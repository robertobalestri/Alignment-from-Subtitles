00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,464
[Max] <i>Previously </i>on New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,759
-Why'd you tell everyone we were a couple?
-Yeah, okay--

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,178
We agreed you were going
to treat me like everyone else.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,640
As your newly-minted
psych residency director,

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,018
you will be on this ward
with real patients

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,353
and you will have me
in supervision as your teacher.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,938
You and your girl work things out?

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,650
We did,
but still figuring out some details.

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,944
[Ben]
You want someone to replace Dr. Sharpe.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,989
Something tells me
Dr. Sharpe is not replaceable.

11
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,449
Don't let her go.

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,243
-Did you find my replacement?

{\an8}Oh, God, I forgot
to ask what Brantley said

32
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,734
{\an8}when you told her that you were leaving.

33
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,861
{\an8}Brantley? I'm sorry. Who's Brantley?
I'm not familiar.

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
{\an8}-[chuckles] Max.
-I'm going to tell her.

35
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,241
{\an8}I just... try to have my replacement
all lined up,

36
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,701
{\an8}because I don't want to give her
a full-blown heart attack.

37
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,619
{\an8}Oh, wow.

38
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,248
{\an8}Sparing Brantley's heart palpitations have
never been a top priority for you before.

39
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,541
{\an8}Better late than never?

40
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,543
{\an8}Okay.

41
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,629
{\an8}What about Luna's grandparents?
Do they know?

42
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,590
{\an8}I'm working on it.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,426
{\an8}We leave in six weeks.

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,345
{\an8}Okay, Helen, come here. Come here.

45
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,806
{\an8}I am going to tell them, okay?

46
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,642
{\an8}I'm going to tell everyone.
I'm going to tell strangers.

47
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,895
{\an8}Maybe even tomorrow, but not tonight.

48
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,107
{\an8}Because tonight, all I want...

49
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,110
{\an8}is dim sum...

50
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,320
{\an8}in bed...

51
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,656
{\an8}with you.

52
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,373
{\an8}[Helen] You are going to get dim sum.

53
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,292
{\an8}-[Max] Really?
-And then some...

54
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,251
{\an8}Ooh.

55
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,004
{\an8}-Once you tell everyone.
-Oh, I see.

56
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,799
{\an8}-Bye.
-Have a good day.

57
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,844
{\an8}[Iggy] Hear ye!
It is that time of year again, folks.

58
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,138
{\an8}It's the Harvest Festival
tonight at the rooftop garden.

59
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,599
{\an8}Please join me for free drinks.

60
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,269
{\an8}The broccoli is coming in hot.
Oh, yeah, she just turned it down flat.

61
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,314
{\an8}Casey, have you ever seen
such ripe, tender heads pressed up

62
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,274
{\an8}-against one another like that?
-What?

63
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,109
{\an8}The thing, man, tonight. You coming?

64
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,404
{\an8}Yo, if I give you some
of the best gossip ever, can I skip it?

65
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,947
{\an8}-No.
-Come on! Damn it!

66
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,158
{\an8}I got to tell somebody.
It's just too good.

67
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,827
I just saw Max and Helen

68
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,997
totally making out
over by the ambulance bay.

69
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,751
But... yeah, they're friends.

70
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,295
-They're good friends.
-Yeah, that were sucking face.

71
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,756
They're physical communicators.
They talk with their hands.

72
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,135
Are you telling me that you had never
any idea what was going on between them?

73
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,971
Casey, although it is a blessing
and a curse,

74
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,474
behavioral analysis
is my superpower, okay?

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,810
If there was ever any romantic inclination
between Max and Helen,

76
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,604
I'd have been the first to suss is out.

77
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,105
-Uh...
-Okay? Now just shush.

78
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,565
Come tonight. Eat broccoli.

79
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,359
I...

80
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:55,902
[sighs]

81
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,161
Thanks for the lift.

82
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,996
Best boss ever.

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,082
Yeah, well, don't thank me just yet.

84
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,210
Uh, Iggy is having
his weird harvest thing tonight.

85
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,755
As your awful girlfriend,
I am forcing you to be my plus-one.

86
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,674
-Sounds great!
-Does it, though?

87
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,515
[Floyd] Good morning, Dr. Malvo.

88
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,892
Morning, Dr. Reynolds.

89
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,229
What's with the smile?

90
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:35,149
Oh, I guess
my 6:00 a.m. spinal fusion surgery

91
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,152
has got me really, really happy.

92
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,280
Ah, well, that would sound strange,

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:45,994
but suddenly I find myself very excited
about my... pelvic laparoscopy.

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,203
Mm.

95
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,414
Assuming you'll walk with me.

96
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,874
I passed my elevator about 30 seconds ago.

97
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,626
I'll try to keep you entertained.

98
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,087
Well, you set the bar
really high last night.

99
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,464
You more than cleared it.

100
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,637
I have a few hours after work
and, um, maybe if you're free, we can...

101
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,722
[chuckles]

102
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,559
You just can't get enough, can you?
[chuckles]

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,479
What's up?

104
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,816
I'm late for my surgery.

105
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,529
Yo, what'd I say?

106
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,705
It's unclear if you know this,
but I am actually a very busy surgeon.

107
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,583
Well, I have a job offer for you.

108
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,961
-But I already said no.
-Not to the job I'm about to offer.

109
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,714
Spoiler alert,
it is the best job that we've got.

110
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,509
[Ben] What's better than
the chair of oncology?

111
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,261
Medical director of New Amsterdam.

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,637
[grunts softly]

113
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,181
No.

114
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,265
-[Ben] No.
-No?

115
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,561
Had I known this is why
you wanted to meet again,

116
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,438
I would have saved you the trouble.

117
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,106
Um, maybe you're, uh...

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,777
Maybe you're in shock at being offered
the very prestigious position

119
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,571
of medical director
at America's first public hospital.

120
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,241
[announcement]<i> Dr. Lu to neonatal.</i>
<i>Dr. Lu to neonatal.</i>

121
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,660
Nah, I feel pretty levelheaded about it.

122
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,206
Would you, uh... would you tell me why?

123
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,042
Because I killed for this job.
I mean, I love this job.

124
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,336
This is the greatest job
in the entire world.

125
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,546
Catastrophic emergency, Max!

126
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,050
That's your answer, in a nutshell.

127
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,011
Makes sense. Okay, would you do me
a professional courtesy

128
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,556
and just think about it and take the day
and get back to me maybe...?

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,599
-[Karen] Max!
-Maybe.

130
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,142
[Ben] Okay! Go.

131
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,936
-Yes? Thank you.
-Go. I'll think about it.

132
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,104
[sighs]

133
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,898
-What was that about?
-Uh, I'm not sure.

134
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,359
Oh, Max, why didn't you just tell me?

135
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,823
Oh. Um, I don't know. I was just looking
for the right time and, uh--

136
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,241
It's our ICU, Max.

137
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,494
If it's understaffed, I need to know
before something like this happens.

138
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,413
Right. You're talking about our ICU.
Makes sense. I completely agree.

139
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,083
We are understaffed.
We should have five attendings per shift.

140
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,584
We're barely getting by with two.

141
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,130
And now those two, Dr. Perez and Dr.
Agata, are down with food poisoning.

142
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:06,467
-And there's no backup, no one to cover.
-You're saying no one's running our ICU?

143
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,847
This is why I keep telling you
we need more doctors.

144
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,223
COVID burnout is real.

145
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,560
You'd think they have more sense of duty
to this hospital than to just leave.

146
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,854
Well, it's not just about
sense of duty to the hospital.

147
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,189
These people face all kinds
of stress for this hospital.

148
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,859
They've had to question
every priority and value they've ever had.

149
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,153
Not to mention,
some of 'em fell in love, you know.

150
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,073
Finally put love first for once
instead of denying it for so...

151
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,452
Well, maybe, I don't know.

152
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,536
Uh, we need doctors.

153
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,955
-That's what I'm saying.
-[woman] <i>Triage nurse to the ER...</i>

154
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,875
We have 22 patients,
two transfers on the way,

155
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,879
at least nine procedures
piling up on the to-do list... Oh, right.

156
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,921
And no doctors.

157
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,257
Then shut it down.
Send these patients to other hospitals.

158
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,634
No. They're too sick.
Some of them won't survive transport.

159
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,845
Can't we farm them out
to other areas of the hospital?

160
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,222
No, they need the specialized care
they can only get here.

161
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,433
If this ICU fails,
the whole hospital goes down.

162
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,144
-We got to make this work.
-How? Who's going to take over?

163
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,812
I will.

164
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,195
Somebody help us over here.

165
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,489
-What happened?
-Went fishing to celebrate his retirement.

166
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,699
-Bluefish, stripers, some tuna.
-They don't give a damn.

167
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,784
-You never know what's important.
-We go every year.

168
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,704
-We get all set up. Nice new hooks--
-Terry, for the love of God.

169
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,790
And when we got to the dock,
all of a sudden Joe just stops talking.

170
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,293
-Okay.
-It's alarming because Joe never shuts up.

171
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,046
Like, never.
It's like the man gets paid by the word.

172
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,715
-No offense, buddy.
-He's going to be okay, right?

173
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,634
Joe, do me a favor.
Can you lift your right arm?

174
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,803
-Is it numb? Is it tingly?
-It looks like he's having a stroke.

175
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,472
Let's get him a CT scan.

176
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,937
Do you sell what you steal?

177
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,106
-No.
-So why steal at all?

178
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,526
I don't know.

179
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,946
The things I take, I don't even want 'em.

180
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,368
It's crazy, but in my head,
it's not stealing.

181
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,621
But, Kevin, where's the empathy?

182
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,290
You are stealing.

183
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,961
Imagine if it were someone you loved.

184
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,922
What if you stole from your dad?

185
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,300
All right, I'm going to pause you
right there. Uh, Miguel, amazing.

186
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,262
Great job bringing Klepto Kevin to life,
man, killin' it.

187
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:19,141
<i>-Oh, gosh, it's such a great role.</i>
-[Iggy] You were born to play it, clearly.

188
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,477
Chitto,
I'm sorry I cut you off back there,

189
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,188
but there was a big-time tactical error
that we need to talk about.

190
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,856
<i>But he was opening up.</i>

191
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,402
No, yeah, I realize that. But try not to
focus on what he was saying,

192
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,614
more on how he was saying it,
his voice, his demeanor, his tears.

193
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,825
<i>Does all that suggest a lack of empathy?</i>

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,994
Crap. No.

195
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,537
Yeah. Also, in last week's reading,

196
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,250
we hit on the common parental archetypes
of kleptomaniacs and the big one was...

197
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>-Withholding parents.</i>
-[Iggy] Exactly, withholding parents.

198
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,047
So when you're withholding empathy

199
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,301
and shaming him for his dad,
in Kevin's mind, guess who you are.

200
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,513
His dad. Okay?
Good luck building that trust back.

201
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,349
This is... this is transference 101, yeah?

202
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,101
Okay.

203
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,938
Oh. All right, guys, come on.
Let's lose the long faces.

204
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,733
Getting adjustments is good,
as long as take what you learn here

205
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,693
and you apply it
to your real-life patients.

206
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,361
All right? That goes for everybody.

207
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,822
So why don't we move past these, um...

208
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,118
these rookie mistakes and, uh, crush one?

209
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,039
Miguel, ready to drop in,
find your center? Chitto?

210
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,207
Take two. Go.

211
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>Kevin, I think--</i>

212
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,213
Okay, I'm going to jump in right here.

213
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,176
-Have you considered--
-[Iggy] <i>No, not... not quite.</i>

214
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>No! Oh, no! Mamma mia, no.</i>

215
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,433
That was definitely... a choice.

216
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,560
Guys, guys, come on. Listen.

217
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,811
Listen to one another.

218
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,523
No, no, no, no, no. Definitely not that.

219
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>Cut! Nope.</i>

220
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>Change tact.</i>

221
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,781
No, okay, that's it. That's it.
That's enough. Stop.

222
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,117
<i>-Any notes for me?</i>
-[Iggy] <i>No, Miguel.</i>

223
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,327
You're perfection.

224
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,829
[sighs]

225
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,499
Heart attack
during a symphony concert last night.

226
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,959
-And this bruise?
-Oh, I fell out of my chair

227
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,253
when the chest pain hit. [sighs]

228
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,508
-Oboist screamed.
-Oh. People say symphonies are dull.

229
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,010
She's had several waves
of chest pain overnight.

230
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,725
Should I increase her IV nitro drip?

231
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,812
Uh, yes, let's do that.

232
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,814
Okay. Will do, Dr. Goodwin.

233
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,734
-I may be out of practice.
-Oh, you? No.

234
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,029
-I bring platelets.
-[Max] Great, thank you.

235
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,198
Today is going to be kind of a day.

236
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,951
I heard. And Wilder, did she say yes?

237
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,955
Uh, she said no,
quite a few times, actually, but I did...

238
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,124
-Dr. Goodwin.
-...convince her to think about it.

239
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,584
We still have 19 patients left on rounds.

240
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,086
Platelets are for bay five.

241
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,712
Co... Copy.

242
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,431
So I hear you got into
a nasty fight with a mountain.

243
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,058
Must have fallen, I don't know, 60 feet.

244
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,352
My God, how terrifying.

245
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,064
My partner and I, we've been climbing
together such a long time.

246
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,192
Do you know, is he here?

247
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,861
I haven't seen him.

248
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,071
He may have been taken
to another hospital.

249
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,575
Could you find out?
His name's Garrett Turner.

250
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,660
-He got it way worse than me.
-Of course.

251
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,328
Uh, Helen, two more just rolled in

252
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,789
and I got an acute leukemic in bay six.
Can you take a look?

253
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,250
Max, why didn't you pull in some help
from another department?

254
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,877
Uh, which one? They're all understaffed.

255
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,421
If I keep us afloat long enough
for Perez and Agata to recover--

256
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,089
Max, that was me saying I'm in.

257
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,549
I'm staying.

258
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,635
-I would kiss you, but...
-[chuckles]

259
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,679
[laughs]

260
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,514
[Floyd] I need to talk to someone.

261
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,601
Oh, I know.
Me too. It's amazing, isn't it?

262
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,270
-What is?
-Max and Helen.

263
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,480
I mean, finally.

264
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,191
All that sexual tension
just brewing for years.

265
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276
Wait, weren't they already a thing?

266
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,489
Are you kidding? No,
but Casey said they definitely are now,

267
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,157
-So...
-Great. Well, they're two adults.

268
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,577
Nothing's standing in their way.
It's no big deal.

269
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,747
How do you enjoy any movie ever?

270
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,169
Okay, look, the, uh, woman I'm seeing,

271
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:20,090
I said I was excited to see her
and all of a sudden she just froze me out.

272
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,760
-I don't even know what I said.
-I'm going to stop you right there.

273
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,428
I'm going to save you some time.

274
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,348
The thing about women is
they just want to hear two words.

275
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,225
"I'm sorry." That's it.

276
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,936
It's a silver bullet to any argument.

277
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,397
I actually could have saved myself
three hours of processing last night

278
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,316
if I'd followed my own advice.

279
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,902
Dr. Bloom, Casey needs you.

280
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,196
-[beeping]
-O2 sat's dropping.

281
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,114
-[Lauren] CT scan?
-Negative.

282
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,659
Isn't a stroke and he's crashing fast.

283
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,702
We're back to square one.
I need more information.

284
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,539
Give me some history.
Nothing happened out there on the boat?

285
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,415
-No, nothing.
-[patient groans]

286
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,126
Well, how's he been feeling?
Has he been sick recently?

287
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,963
He's had some back pain, but that's
all of us. We work in construction.

288
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,839
If you collect a paycheck, you're in pain.

289
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,801
-What else? Think!
-He had the flu or something last month.

290
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,928
-Is that what you mean?
-He even called out sick.

291
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,097
-Stayed home a couple days.
-Yeah, that's not like Joe.

292
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,517
-Post-viral myocarditis?
-Worse, given the arm numbness.

293
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,270
Post-viral Guillain-Barré syndrome.

294
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,730
His whole nervous system is shutting down.

295
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,358
-[Max] Carla has V-fib. Epi.
-[woman] Pulseless VT.

296
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,487
Let's start chest compressions.

297
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,781
[devices beeping]

298
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,786
Come on, Carla.

299
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,415
[Lauren] I need help over here!

300
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,088
Hello?

301
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,507
I'm losing him!

302
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,092
Anyone?

303
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,521
Clear.

304
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,106
-[paddles zap]
-Clear.

305
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,320
I got a pulse.

306
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,322
No pulse. Going again.

307
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,531
-Clear.
-[paddle zaps]

308
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,326
He's back.

309
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,787
-She's back.
-[Max] Carla, are you with me?

310
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,208
-I think so.
-[Max] Good.

311
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,920
What the hell, Max?

312
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,007
-[sighs] We're getting through it.
-This isn't short-staffed.

313
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,967
-This is not staffed.
-What do you want me to do?

314
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,261
-I'm not going to close our doors.
-Ask for more help.

315
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,722
-Who? Whose help am I supposed to ask--
-My help.

316
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,641
You should have asked for my help.

317
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,021
Well, I wanted to,
but what about your residents?

318
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,774
They're fine.
They've got Walsh and an iPad.

319
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,859
I'm staying here with you.

320
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,199
[woman] Sleep with the boss,
ride to work in a limo.

321
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,159
Girl, give me that gig.

322
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,871
-How late you think she got to sleep in?
-Must be nice is all I'm saying.

323
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,626
It's more of a town car than a limo.

324
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,003
Hey, it isn't personal.

325
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,755
Then what is it?

326
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
Just be aware of your privilege, okay?

327
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,804
Privilege? I'm not privileged.

328
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,223
Six months ago I was living in my car.

329
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,642
[chuckling]
Well, you've come a long way, baby.

330
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,145
That iPad with all the emergency
medicine textbooks downloaded on it,

331
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,356
we share one of those
between the three of us,

332
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,691
so we have to study in shifts.

333
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,653
Yeah and we share a cruddy studio
in Morris Heights, three buses away.

334
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,572
We have to wake up at 4:00 a.m.
just to get here on time.

335
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,241
That the Littmann 3M?

336
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,662
I can barely hear a jackhammer
with this thing, let alone a heart murmur.

337
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,747
But it's all I got.

338
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,959
So just know, from where we're standing...

339
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,295
[whispering]
...you're looking pretty privileged to us.

340
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,391
I want to get it even more.

341
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,227
Tell me what it's about.

342
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,148
-Own your feelings.
-[chuckles]

343
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,612
It's a pressure inside of me and, uh...

344
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,617
when I see something that I can take,

345
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,870
it just builds and builds.

346
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,455
Man, that sounds really hard.

347
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,623
Pause. Why did you interrupt me?

348
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,544
Uh, I was being empathetic.
That's what you told me to do.

349
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,755
Your impulse is correct.
The timing is bad.

350
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,133
I'm in the room with you.
I can read these decisions. Okay?

351
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,012
All right, so why don't we explore
that pressure that Kevin mentioned?

352
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,180
How does that make him feel?

353
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:37,973
Uh...

354
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,685
You don't know, because you cut him off
before he could finish telling you.

355
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,646
If you'd let him finish,
he would have told you

356
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,774
that it makes him feel like
he wants to hurt himself.

357
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,278
If you cut him off, if you...
if you slam that window of honesty,

358
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,864
that could be it. That could be his life.

359
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,075
Got it?

360
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,494
Okay. Good.

361
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,830
If a patient is trying
to share with you...

362
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,666
listen.

363
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,585
-Okay?
-Yeah.

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,587
Good. Drop back in.

365
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,089
-Here we go.
-[exhales]

366
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,217
[breathes deeply]

367
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,762
So there's a pressure,
builds and builds inside of me and if...

368
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,014
I feel like if I don't take it,

369
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,601
something awful is going to happen.

370
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,897
You know, it sounds like this is rooted
in conflict with your father.

371
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,193
No, way, way, way too soon
to drop the dad bomb.

372
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,821
That came out of left field.
That's... [sighs]

373
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,366
You can't... You can't have
a patient's epiphany for them.

374
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,993
-Your job is to gently guide them to it.
-[sighs]

375
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,371
You got it?

376
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,165
No, I don't got it.

377
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,792
Okay.

378
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,962
I have been working with patients
for months.

379
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,505
I've helped people.

380
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,509
And real patients let me talk
for more than five seconds.

381
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,928
Okay. I can see that I've upset you.

382
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,473
I know this is hard. Right?
But believe me when I tell you

383
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,686
it is so much better to be stopped
before you make the huge mistake.

384
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,231
All right? That goes for everyone.
That's all of you. Not just you.

385
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,067
And based on what I've seen
in here today, from now on,

386
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,444
I'm going to be sitting in on
all of your actual sessions.

387
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,990
And if you're going down a dangerous path,
I will jump in. I'll be there. All right?

388
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,034
I know that seems like a lot,
because, quite frankly, it is.

389
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,746
And I promise you guys, one of these days,
you will thank me for it.

390
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>Okay? Why don't you take a break?</i>

391
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,292
<i>Next resident, please.</i>

392
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,546
Come on, next resident. Don't be scared.

393
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,548
Come on in.

394
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,308
Uh, where are all my residents?

395
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,226
They walked out.

396
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,525
Hey.

397
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,906
Look, I know you're mad,

398
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,450
but I just want to say I'm sorry.

399
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,286
I really... I really am.

400
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,121
You're sorry?

401
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,664
Yeah.

402
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,918
For what, exactly?

403
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,632
I am sorry... for earlier.

404
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,135
Earlier?

405
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,597
[sighs]

406
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,850
Like, when I said that
you couldn't get enough.

407
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,312
I wasn't implying that
you were, like, a nymphomaniac,

408
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,565
or that your husband
couldn't get the job done.

409
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,236
This has nothing to do
with my husband or sex.

410
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,031
You treated this
like I'm committing adultery.

411
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,952
Right and I did not want
to make you feel that way.

412
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,995
Good.

413
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,122
[stiffly] Good.

414
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,337
Although...

415
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,633
it is adultery, isn't it?

416
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,677
That's what you think this is?

417
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,887
I mean, well, you are married

418
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,348
and also sleeping with me.

419
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,516
Openly.

420
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,435
It doesn't change the fact
that I'm the other guy.

421
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,312
Of course it does.

422
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,528
[exhales] I'm not screwing you behind
my husband's back, Floyd.

423
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,407
I'm in a relationship with you.

424
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,080
At least I thought I was.

425
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,053
Hypertensive patient going down fast.

426
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,221
Uh, yeah.

427
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,892
-Hm. Hey Carla, how you feeling?
-[Carla humming]

428
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,646
-"Flight of the Bumblebee"?
-That's right.

429
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,983
Reminds me of you,
running around here nonstop.

430
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,694
Yeah, I hear that one's
a nightmare for orchestras.

431
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,904
Oh, yeah. It's a beast.

432
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,532
But I can play it in my sleep.

433
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,616
Bet you can.

434
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,038
I'm going to start you on diltiazem drip
to level out your AFib, okay?

435
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:15,542
Yeah, it goes all over the scale
and never lands anywhere.

436
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,379
All that Sturm und Drang for nothing.

437
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,965
Hypotensive patient, bay four.
AAA about to blow.

438
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,343
Carla, I promise you,
this is not for nothing.

439
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,015
[man groaning in pain]

440
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,394
-Already on it.
-Ah, my leg.

441
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,106
Okay, swelling and bleeding are up.

442
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,191
Oh, it hurts, Doc.

443
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,693
The platelets we gave you to clot
your blood made things worse.

444
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,362
We need to reverse course
and give you blood thinners instead.

445
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,032
I'm bleeding and you'd give me something
that makes me bleed more?

446
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,618
-It sounds backwards, but it works.
-And if it doesn't?

447
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,204
Dr. Sharpe,
your leukemic patient's febrile.

448
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,331
Be right there. I'll be right back.

449
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,332
Victoria?

450
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,169
Have you seen any nurses?

451
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,379
-I'm looking for my AAA--
-Yep, Bay Four.

452
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,882
-GI bleed. Tachy and hypotensive.
-Uh, I'll take it.

453
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,258
Hey, how's life? AAA in Bay Four.

454
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,468
-Let's go to Six.
-On my way.

455
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,846
Transfer from the ED. Pneumonia on BiPAP.
Heading for a tube fast.

456
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,473
-I've got this one.
-What are you doing?

457
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,684
AAA in bay four! Going to need
an intubation kit and a vent, stat!

458
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,353
[patient groaning in pain]

459
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,939
-You going to take the new admit?
-I'm surgery.

460
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:23,151
-[sighs] Who's got the new admit?
-[whimpering, groaning]

461
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,945
He's got V-tach. All right.

462
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,280
-Young man, can you speak to me?
-Yes! Yes!

463
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,740
Is ICU down?

464
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:34,454
Okay, I've got this. Just take the AAA
in bay four and tell Flores she's up.

465
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,207
Since when do you work the ICU?

466
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,834
Since there's no one else.

467
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,088
I don't get it, Gladys.

468
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,091
I just don't get it.

469
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,303
That's not true. I do. I get it. I get...

470
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,598
Nobody likes having
their mistakes pointed out,

471
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,350
but to just get up and leave?

472
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,353
They just left! They fell short!
I mean, I'm doing my job.

473
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,064
It is literally my job to correct them.

474
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,525
Oh, bullpucky!

475
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,863
That's a little... harsh
and old-fashioned.

476
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,739
Your job isn't correcting them.

477
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,909
It's to help them become better doctors.

478
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,330
And since every last one
of your residents left today

479
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,959
wanting to throw out their career,
or throw you out a window,

480
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,002
what's more likely?

481
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:28,717
That you got a room full of dunces
or that the person falling short today...

482
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,094
is you?

483
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,852
Mm. [chuckles]

484
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,062
All right. I hear you.

485
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,193
I guess that maybe I am falling a little
bit short of everyone's expectations,

486
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,195
including my own.

487
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,824
But that doesn't change the fact
that these are doctors.

488
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,036
They're treating real people
with real issues

489
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,829
and I can't just risk them failing.

490
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,291
But, Iggy, they will fail.

491
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,667
[chuckles]

492
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,338
I mean, when you were starting out,
didn't you?

493
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,302
[indistinct chattering and beeping]

494
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,386
Dr. Sharpe.

495
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,015
What are you doing out of bed?
Your spleen could blow any minute!

496
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,476
Did you hear anything about Garrett,
my climbing partner?

497
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,228
He's at Baptist.
I don't know anything else.

498
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,272
I'm waiting for a call back
from his doctors. Now, come on.

499
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,232
Come on.

500
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,110
-We were rappelling.
-Mm-hm.

501
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,947
We were tied onto opposite ends
of the same rope.

502
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,326
Going too fast, overconfident.

503
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,411
[grunts in pain]

504
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,540
I got snagged.

505
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,961
I came off the line.

506
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,005
Garrett fell. I...

507
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,300
I hit a ledge, but...

508
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,637
he just kept going.

509
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,434
He just fell such a long way.

510
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,145
I just need to know.

511
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,939
I'll call them again.

512
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,733
[softly] Okay.

513
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,658
I won't be using these anymore

514
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,827
and I'll be taking the bus
to work from this point on.

515
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,164
Okay, so I guess you'll be finishing
your residency, uh, never.

516
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,084
You have given me access
to wonderful things,

517
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,087
things I've never had before, but I...

518
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,381
and I like them. I do.
I really, really do.

519
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,133
I feel like there's a but coming.

520
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,511
But I'm becoming like a different person,
a person with privilege.

521
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,598
Bay eight. Bay eight.

522
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,311
How do you think half the people here
got ahead, myself included?

523
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,273
Yes, I am a super sweet...
Hey, wait, wait. Take this. Take this.

524
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,527
Yes, I am a super sweet doctor
with a super sweet bedside manner,

525
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,239
but easy access to textbooks,
top-notch equipment,

526
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,992
a good night's sleep,
those things make you better.

527
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,493
Not a single one of those residents

528
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,705
would give up those things
if they had them, so why should you?

529
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,624
I've always scraped by,

530
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,085
done the best I could
with what little I had.

531
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,338
Now all these fancy things...

532
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,548

533
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,595

I'm successful, like I didn't earn it.

-Back pain, ocular ptosis,

543
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,664

out on the water. Hurry.

-Why are you still here?

545
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,796
-Because where the hell is everyone else?
-Also a good question. What you got?

546
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,632
-Persistent V-tach.
-Carotid pulse is good.

547
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,133
But I don't have a radial pulse.

548
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,676
Let's check for bleeds.

549
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,595
-[groaning]
-Clavicle's out of alignment.

550
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,223
The seatbelt dislocated his clavicle,
pushed it into his shoulder

551
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,268
and now it's blocking the brachial artery,
which is irritating the left atrium.

to sit you up here, Ferris, okay?

00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,441

Oh, yes. Yes! This is amazing,
because you wouldn't be here in person

00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,005
if the answer was--

566
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,590
-No.
-No.

567
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,550
Really?

568
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,221
I wanted to tell you in person.
The answer is still no.

569
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
No. Uh... [clears throat] Listen.

570
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,643

573
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,155
He's been in and out of facilities
most of his life.

574
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,992
But since the pandemic,
he's been living with me.

575
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,706
It's changed us for the better.

576
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,501
He is my priority now.

577
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,879
Not my work.

578
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:22,343
New Amsterdam deserves a medical director
who's going to put the hospital first.

581
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,106
Speaking of.

582
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,152
It's Carla, BP bottomed out.

583
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,695
-Up the Levophed.
-Maxed out.

584

-Dobutamine?
-All the pressers are maxed out.

585
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,241
-We have no room to move.
-Okay, then, um...

586
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,203
Then we do an intra-aortic balloon pump.

587
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,789
That takes the entire ICU staff
in the best of times.

588
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,373
Does this look like the best of times?

589
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,220
We're doing an intra-aortic balloon pump.

590
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,848
Max, you should have closed the ICU
and transferred Carla hours ago.

591
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,933

Carla can't live
with a blood pressure of 60/40.

She needs help. I'm helping.
I don't know how to do anything else.

597
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,828
Well, if we're going to do this,
she needs to be maximally oxygenated.

00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,704
-Thank you.
-I need you.

599
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,626
-Intra-aortic balloon.
-Here?

600
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,170
-Yes.
-You'll need ultrasound guidance.

-Yep.

-Where's the rest of the team?
-What you see is what you get.

604
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,098
That isn't enough access.

605
