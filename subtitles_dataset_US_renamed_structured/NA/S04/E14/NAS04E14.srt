181

Did you--did you bring them?

185
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,319

them to grab a coffee.

since I was two, so I'm ready.

197

- Wouldn't living on your own
require an income?

198
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:31,222
- No, because if you get
emancipated before you're 18,

199
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,268
your parents
have to pay child support.

200

your own clothes,

203

do your own laundry.

204
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,584

to my folks so they could help.

205

My mom would still do
my laundry,

206
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,544

could still cook me dinner.

Veronica cut the number of beds

staffing levels.
