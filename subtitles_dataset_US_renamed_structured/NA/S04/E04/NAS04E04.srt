on "New Amsterdam"...

- All my patients,

4
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:09,487
all their despair,
it just becomes a part of me,

5
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,489
and I'm not going
to see patients anymore.

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,969
- Dr. Sharpe and I are leaving.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,666
We're leaving New Amsterdam.
We're moving to London.

8

you all

9
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:19,584
to the new medical director
of New Amsterdam.

10
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,110

Yeah, uh, Karen,

14
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,160
would you just stop walking
for one second?

15
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:31,466
- Why? So you can ask me

16
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,207
to reconsider hiring
Veronica Fuentes?

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,165
- No, so I can beg you.
Plead, grovel.

18
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,341
She is the exact wrong person
for the job.

19
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,995
- She's far more qualified
to be medical director

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,127
than you are.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,302
- Maybe on paper,
but I trained under her.

22
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,520
- And look how wonderful
you turned out.

23
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,261
- Despite her.
I have seen her in action.

24
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,742
She is ruthless, corporate,
financially motivated.

25
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,310
- Like, like, love.
- She's not one of us.

26
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,268
She completely lacks
the New Amsterdam spirit.

27
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,617
- Unlike you, Max, the board

28
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,402
had to consider
the future of this hospital,

29
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:57,100
and we were thrilled when
Dr. Fuentes accepted our offer.

30
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,493
She's here to stay.

the natural light

33
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,107
was better on this side
of the room.

34
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,065
- Oh, you thought
the light was better there?

35

That's--that's lovely.

36
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,589

five weeks passing the torch.

except back then,

47

you were a bit more
in the background.

48
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,913
- Yeah, this isn't gonna work.

49
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,263

spirit, Max, is you.

to collaborate

Have you lashed out at Leyla?

00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,839
Okay, so that is
a slippery slope, my friend,

140
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,971
one that you've
skied down before.

I mean, I wouldn't

145
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,806
I mean, you're willingly
acknowledging your behavior.

146
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,417
That's huge.
That's a big step, right?

147
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,593
You've worked really hard
to be here.

148
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:35,552
So I would say, uh, hash it out
with your sponsor,

149
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,381
and focus on your triggers.

150
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,991
- Yeah, thank you.
You're right.

151
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,689

152
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,387

wanna get back in the saddle,

153

you still got it.

155
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,827
- Ah.

156
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,959
Cool.

157
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,917
- Hi, Doc.
You wanted to see me?

158
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,179
- Ah, Adena. Yes.

159
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,616
Please, do come in.

160
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,401

unresolved department issues?

162
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:02,884
- Sure, sounds like you.
-  Yes.

163
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:08,716

166
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,378
I found your name on that list.

167
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,118
- You mean that letter where

168
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,816
they say you have dense
breast tissue,

169
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,644
but we couldn't see everything?

170
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,515
Yeah, I get it every year.

171
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:28,083
- So why didn't you follow up?

172
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,476
- Was I supposed to?

173
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,479
- Okay, to rely solely
on mammograms

174
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,176
when you have
dense breast tissue

175
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,831
could place you at higher risk
for undetected breast cancer.

176
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,181
Now, an ultrasound or an MRI

177
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:42,271
is the best way to establish
a definitive baseline scan.

178
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:43,925
- Well, when you put it
that way,

179
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,536
it sounds
a bit more motivating.

180
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,147
- And you've worked in oncology
for 15 years.

181
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,149
I have a feeling
that every patient on that list

182
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,543
needs to be having
this conversation.

183
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:56,546
Now, where do we keep the files
with the letters like yours in?

184
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,069
- Technically,
they're not patients,

185
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:02,160
so we just kind of keep
their files in limbo land.

187
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,214

188
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,476
Name's Carrie Logandorffer.

189
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,347
- Has she vomited
any more bowel or blood?

190
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,827
- Not since the ultrasound.

191
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,350
I still have no idea
what's causing

192
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,787

- This is Dr. Reynolds.

195
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,094
He'll handle it from here.

196
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,270
- Hey, Carrie,
and you must be her coach.

197
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,489

198
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,099
We're in town
for dance regionals.

199
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,579
We were practicing,

200
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,363
and then all of a sudden,
Carrie collapsed.

201
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,626
Then she started vomiting.

202
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:33,714
Scared us half to death.

203
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,063
Her parents are on the way.

204
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,412
- Okay, Carrie,
I'm gonna touch your stomach,

205
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,196
if that's okay.

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,199
Have you experienced any
other symptoms besides pain?

207
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,506
- Oh--just kind of dizzy.

208
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,116
- Okay, yeah.
We're concerned

209
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,901
you might have some blockage
in your belly area.

210
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:47,989
We're gonna
take a look at that.

211
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,381
Okay? All right?

212
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,861
I'll keep you posted
until her parents get here.

213
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,472
- Okay, thank you very much.

214
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,516

218
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,132
sickle cell disease
or the trait?

219
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,831
- Trait?

220
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,746
I'm--I'm sorry. Sickle what?

221
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,313
- Sickle cell, it's common
among African-Americans.

222
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,620
- What? No, I'm not Black.

Hey, I owe you an apology.

226
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,066
I had no idea who you were

227
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,938
when I had you bounced
out of the ED.

228
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,505

at CBGB's.

little donation that we got--

what to do with it yet--

- Actually,
we're figuring that out.

235

elevated urgent care facility?

Better equipped
with an ED resident rotation?

- Ooh, I like
the sound of that.

- Yeah, we will take it
under consideration.

- Sorry, you heard
about that too?

245

- Seniors are just
so often neglected.

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,365
It causes higher rates
of depression, homelessness,

247
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,542
and I thought
this might help stem the tide

248
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,978

- Chair of obstetrics
and gynecology.

254
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,685
Chair of neurology.
- Impressive.

255
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:16,686
- The new boss
did her homework.

256
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,079
- Old boss still here, gang.

257
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,820
- I heard we picked up
a new satellite property--

258
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,865
- Uh, yeah, the land
is actually already spoken for.

259
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,606
- But I have a great idea.
- As do I, Dr. Fuentes.

260
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,216
- Uh, still here, gang.

261
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,871
- Good, because a new birthing
facility would be optimal.

262
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,525
The lack of quality
prenatal care has severely

263
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,788
affected birthing outcomes
in this area of the city.

264
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,703
- And there's a lack
of neurologic care.

265
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,400
The area is rife
with chronic illnesses

266
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,619
that often expresses conditions

267
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,055
like seizure and stroke,
and if I had

268
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,883
neurological screening
and rehabilitation there,

269
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,406
and we reduce
our hospital census.

270
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,582
- Killer idea, Kao,

271
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,583
right next to my
drop-in center, right?

272
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,149
Plenty of room.

273
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:48,022
- These are all wonderful,
wonderful ideas, I have to say.

274
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,893
- Dr. Fuentes--
- Not you too.

275
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,895
- Totally controversial,
but I think laser-tag

276
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,854
would go gangbusters there.

277
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,899
That and Dr. Reynolds
wanted me to suggest

278
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,292
a elective surgery center

279
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,641
in case, you know,
you didn't go for laser--

280
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,904
- Guys!
Love all your ideas, really.

281
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:03,167
I don't know when this became
Land-grab Tuesday,

282
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:06,040
but the decision
for how this land will be used

283
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,737
will be made
the New Amsterdam way,

284
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,086
meaning it won't come from us.

285
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,045
- No, it'll come
from the community.

286
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,568
We'll reach out directly
to the people

287
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,267
and we'll find out
what their greatest needs are.

288
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,140
- Yeah.
That's what I was gonna say.

289
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:22,360
.

290
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,276
- While this land may be our
project, it is not our focus.

291
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,757
We're here to talk
to the community

292
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,064
about their needs
and their concerns,

293
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,631
and we're here to listen.

294
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,024
Think of it like an
intelligence-gathering mission.

295
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,591
- Okay, well,
that being said,

296
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,549
they definitely do not need
another Chicken O'Cluck.

297
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:40,248
- Well, whatever decision
we do make, these people

298
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,728
and whoever is still working
for New Amsterdam

299
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,555
will have to live with it
for a very long time.

300
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,122
So I think it's very important
that we--

301
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,255
- Welcome to Desmond Park!

302
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,605
- Hi.
- How can I help?

303
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,781
- Oh, well, that's
sort of my line.

304
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,087
- Friends call me Domino.

305
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,610
Whether it's direction,
confection,

306
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,656
connection,
I'm all about satisfaction.

307
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,093
Yeah, consider me your plug,
amigo.

308
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,398
- Oh, my gosh, that's so cold.

309
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,791
- Domino, I'm Max,

310
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,445
medical director
of New Amsterdam--not her.

311
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,273
So you know this area
pretty well?

312
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,491
- Yeah. Know it?

313
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,884
I grew up here
my whole life, man.

314
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:10,104
Anything you want I can get,
and if I can get it,

315
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:11,758
you probably don't need it,
yeah?

316
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,021
Anyway, seven bucks
for waters, each.

317
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,764
- I mean, look at this place.

318
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,331
The kids make do,
but they shouldn't have to.

319
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,942
Build a playground
into whatever it is

320
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,334
that you're building.

321
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:25,597
- So safer spaces for kids
to be kids

322
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:27,208
and for people
to actually gather.

323
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:30,820
- Yeah, and maybe
a closer OBGYN clinic.

324
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,561
It's hard to get the time off
to get to the good one.

325
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,389
It's, like, 11 stops away.

326
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,784
- What we need
is a homeless shelter.

327
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,221
My wife and I
founded this church.

328
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,657
Fed and clothed
at least a fifth

329
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,572
of the folk
in this neighborhood.

330
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:44,747
- A fifth?

331
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,444
That's a--that's
a lot of pressure.

332
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,142
How are you and your wife
holding up?

333
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,579
My wife's passed.

334
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,495
- I'm so sorry. That's hard.

335
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,323
I--I can't even imagine
how it would feel

336
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:56,846
to lose the most important
person in your life.

337
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,806
The most valuable conduit
to your flock.

338
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,721
That's--that's a lot.

339
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,725
- What kind of a doctor
did you say you were?

340
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,292
♪

341
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:38,366

That's the third
Chicken O'Cluck in five blocks.

344
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,284

345
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,198

coverage.
