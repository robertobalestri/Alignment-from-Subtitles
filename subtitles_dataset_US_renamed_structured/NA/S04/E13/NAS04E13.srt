62

64
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:34,241
What?
Flirting?

65
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,633
- I only meant it in a fun way

66

because, like, obviously
nothing could ever happen.

67
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,985
- Yeah, no, no, of course,
yeah, and, you know,

that you're upset.

177
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,108
- You need to listen to me.
- Ma'am, calm down.

178
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,634
- Tiya is not our first child.
We had a child ten years ago.

179
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:45,116
He died at four months,
exactly Tiya's age now.

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,423
He cried the exact same way
right before he died.

181
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,817
- What was wrong?

182
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,819
- The doctors never knew.

183
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,517
I will never forget
the sounds of those cries.

184
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,040
It's happening again.

185
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,738
Something is wrong
with my baby.

186
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,870
You have to believe me.

187
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:07,487
.

188
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,489
- So just keep doing those
finger exercises

189
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,794
whenever you're at a stoplight,

190
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,448
and that should help
with the carpal tunnel.

191
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,145
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.
- Sure.

192
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,278
- When do you meet
the mother-in-law, then?

193
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,193
- I'm on my way
there now, actually.

194
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:19,107
- Oh, give her a bit
of the old flannel.

195
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,804
You'll be all right.

196
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:23,024
- I would ask what that means,
but I don't think I'll need it.

197
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,722
Moms love me.
- Yeah, seems about right.

198
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,072
- Oi, Doc!

199
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,424
- Uh, uh, just set him
down here.

200
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,471
- Easy, mate.
- Easy, easy.

201
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,473
- Had a few too many pints
there, Colin?

202
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,128
- I don't drink.
I never have.

203
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,695
- Your pulse is sky high.

204
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,958
- Hands been shaking, too.
Can you help him?

205
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,699
- Look out.

206
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:49,572
- Oh, he's gonna puke.

207
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,444
- Why's that happening to me?
- Okay, okay.

208
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,143
Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.

209
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:57,972
- Come on.

210
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,452
- Mmm, these have a nice spice.

211
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,717
And Mina, how is she?

212
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,328
- Oh, she's grown glamorous.

213
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,199
She's studying improv
this term.

214
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,202
- Oh, she's not here?

215
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,291
I assumed that's why
you were visiting.

216
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:19,428
- Actually,
I am living here now.

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,563
- Sorry?

218
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:28,785
We've spoken several times,

219
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,006
and you neglected to mention
that you moved back home.

220
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,834
- I-I guess I just knew

221
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:37,881
that it would bring up, um,
a lot for us.

222
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,796
- When did you get here?

223
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,277
- Seven, eight weeks ago.

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,584
- You've been here two months,

225
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,542
and you couldn't be bothered
to let me know?

226
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,893
- It's not that simple.
We wanted to get settled first.

227
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,460
- Who's we?

228
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,247
- I've moved here
with Max and Luna.

229
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,077
- Your cats?

230
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,949
No, Mum.

231
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,778
They're the man I'm seeing
and his lovely daughter.

232
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,041
- His lovely daughter.

233
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,304
- Yep, what about it?

234
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,046
- You keep insisting on raising
other people's children,

235
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,439
Mina, this Luna.

236
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:17,181
If you want to be a mother
so badly, have a baby.

237
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:20,881
What happened to
the egg freezing and all that?

238
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:25,363
- My fertility treatments
were not an easy experience.

239
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,714
- They were not
a cheap experience either.

240
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:32,109
So much money, so many years,
you just gave up.

241
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,635
- You wonder why
I never tell you stuff.

242
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:39,334
'Cause when I do, your response
is purely designed to hurt me.

243
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,379
- I'll tell you something.

244
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,251
You get hurt that easily,

245
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,732
maybe you're not cut out
for motherhood?

246
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,603
It's best you never know
what it's like to have

247
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,911
your child treat you like some
errand they put off for months.

248
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:55,089
I'm not a chore.
I'm your mother.

249
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,918
I gave up everything for you.

250
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,267
- Yeah.

251
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,313
Real Mother of the Year
material, you are.

252
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,837
- What's that supposed to mean?

253
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,319
- Ready for your wine, ladies?
both: Yes.

254
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,286
- Hi.

255
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,591
- This has been
a day from hell.

256
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,681
- Yeah, I-I can only imagine.

257
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:25,989
Um, anything you need from me,
just you name it.

258
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,774
- You committed Adam, right?

259
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,689
- Yes, 72-hour hold.

260
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,692
- Good, then you can
let him out.

261
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,911
- I can...

262
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,652
Out?

263
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,220
- I'm his guardian,
and I want to take him home.

264
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,962
- Um...

265
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,616
Adam is potentially dangerous.

266
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,923
Not to me.

267
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,490
- Not to me.

268
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,798
- He had
a full psychotic break.

269
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,800
What he needs right now
are trained professionals.

270
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,192
That's--that's it.

271
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,107
- He's been living with me
for years.

272
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:01,764
I take care of him, and
I am a trained professional.

273
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,594
- No, not right now you're not.
You're his sister.

274
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:09,772
And I will not compromise
his health and safety or yours.

275
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:15,691
- Either you release him,

276
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,825
or I will go petition
the court.

277
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,786
- I think a 72-hour hold
is more than--

278
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,745
Dr. Wilder!

279
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:37,495
- BP's crashing.

280
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,846
- Cytokine storm
from the crush injuries.

281
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,282
Start a dobutamine drip.

282
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,284
- Losing blood everywhere.
He's in DIC.

283
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,547
Hang a six pack of FFP.
- On it.

284
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,724
- Can we get more gauze?
- Coming.

285
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:53,033
- Whoa, hey.
-  Any word on Tiya?

286
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,339
- She's still being evaluated.

287
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:01,389
- Something's wrong with Tiya.
I know it.

288
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:05,219
I was driving so fast.
I had to get her here.

289
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,048
I had to save my daughter.

290
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,702
- If there's anything wrong,
we'll find it, okay?

291
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,053
We got you.
Just relax.

292
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,239
- Got labs back on the baby--
all normal.

293
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:28,068
- What?
There has to be something.

294
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:32,376
LFTs, thyroid, electrolytes...

295
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,638
everything's fine.

296
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,249
- That's a good thing, right?

297
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,772
- Help!

298
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,778
Oh, my God, is she dying?

299
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,519
- No, she's not dying.
She's having a seizure.

300
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:47,348
Walsh, get me
.7 milligrams of Lorazepam.

301
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,831
♪

302
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:57,880
.

303
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,969
- I told you I don't drink.

304
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,492
And now you're trying
to make me do vodka shots?

305
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,929
- For your health.

306
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,235
You have something called
gut fermentation syndrome.

307
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,584
- That sounds bad.
- Oh, bloody hell.

308
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,586
- It just means that, uh,
due to excessive yeast

309
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,588
in your digestive tract,
every carb that you eat

310
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,068
gets fermented into
alcohol inside your body.

311
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,591
- That sounds quite nice.

312
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,332
- Well, if there's already
lots of alcohol in my body,

313
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,899
why you trying
to force-feed me more?

314
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,249
- Well, because when I
prescribed the antifungal

315
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,425
for your...
- Meat and two veg.

316
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,123
- Right, it wiped out
all the yeast in your body,

317
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,559
which means that alcohol
is no longer

318
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,909
entering your bloodstream,
which means...

319
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,432
- Colin's got the beer shakes.
- Yeah.

320
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,347
But a bit of day drinking
should clear that right up.

321
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,262
And in 24 hours,
you'll be fine.

322
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,091
All right.

323
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:38,181
That is awful.

324
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,575
- Come on, lads, we can't
let him go through this alone.

325
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,272
Oi, another round over here.

326
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,883
- Uh, No, no,
none for me, thanks.

327
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,537
I've got a mother-in-law
to meet...

328
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,712
a half hour ago.

329
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,889
Uh, I got to go.
Good luck.

330
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,153
- Hey, you got a sec?

331
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,720
- I'm prepping Dion
for a double amputation.

332
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,331
- Oh, God, that poor family.

333
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,941
- Tell me about.
How's their baby?

334
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,638
- Well, we managed
to stop the seizures,

335
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,466
but still no diagnosis.

336
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,772
Given family history,

337
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,730
it's got to be a genetic
disorder of some type.

338
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,123
- That's a crowded room.

339
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,952
- Tay Sachs, Gaucher,
Fabry, Pompe,

340
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,562
mucopolysaccharidosis.

341
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,521
- You need a separate
draw of blood for each test.

342
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,044
The baby doesn't
have that much blood.

343
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,960
- Exactly, so I'm sequencing
her entire DNA.

344
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,310
Find the defective gene
directly.

345
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,138
The family already
lost one kid.

346
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,749
I'm not gonna let them
lose another.

347
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:28,231
- Leyla came to me this morning
