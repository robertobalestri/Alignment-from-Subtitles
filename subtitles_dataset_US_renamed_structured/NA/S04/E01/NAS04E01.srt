00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
Maybe we start that joy thing tomorrow.

170
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,835
-[panicked chattering]
-What the hell happened?

171
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,632
We don't know. Everything's on fire.
It came out of nowhere.

172
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,342
[panicked chattering]

173
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,976
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get out of here! Go!

174
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,778
[Max] Is this even real?

175
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,408
I have thought of nothing...

176
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,246
but you... and this

177
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,457
for so long.

178
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,961
Thought it, but didn't know how to say it.

179
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,380
Or maybe I was afraid to.

180
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,469
And now it just feels
like I have a future again.

181
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,765
With you...

182
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,851
just like this.

183
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,773
I should never have let you in.

184
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
[indistinct chatter]

185
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,246
Could've been worse, Dr. Goodwin.
Luckily the sprinklers got it

186
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,914
before the fire got to the gas lines.

187
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,457
You're sure this is arson?

188
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,502
100%. We found multiple points of origin.

189
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,881
Got these patterns here on the wall,
traces of accelerant.

190
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,634
Did security cameras catch anything?

191
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,303
The cameras would have caught something
if they'd come this way.

192
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,181
But they didn't.
Whoever did this knew the layout.

193
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,225
It could be a supplier or--

194
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,352
Or someone who works here.

195
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,356
-[Sandra] Dr. Goodwin?
-Um, excuse me, thank you.

196
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,235
This may seem low priority...

197
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,070
That criteria has changed.

198
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,407
But you still have your ten o'clock
with Dr. Wilder and it is now 11:15.

199
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,996
Can you tell her that the hospital's
on fire and maybe we could reschedule?

200
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,456
Clearly that information
did not compel her to leave.

201
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,088
-Thanks for your patience. The ED's clear.
-Thank you, gentlemen.

202
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,633
-[woman] <i>Pain management to radiology.</i>
-Okay.

203
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,553
Brandon, hi.

204
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,641
Well, yeah, it looks like you've got gout.

205
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,144
That's like some old-timey disease, right?

206
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,271
Fancy people,
sitting around eating all day?

207
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,731
Yeah, not so much anymore.

208
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,984
Uh, just like halter tops and headscarves,
young people are bringing it back.

209
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,612
Nah, I shouldn't be up in here
with no gout.

210
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,114
I'm an athlete. I'm in shape.

211
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,992
You know, my team was in the Final Four
just ten years ago.

212
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,745
-Wait, Brandon Dover?
-Yeah.

213
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,872
I bet against you
in our March Madness pool.

214
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,874
You cost me 15 bucks.

215
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,210
24 points, seven assists, five rebounds.

216
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,630
You know I was supposed
to be the next Derrick Rose?

217
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,298
-So why'd you quit?
-I didn't.

218
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,425
Basketball quit me.

219
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,552
-[door bangs]
-Candy Storell, vaccinated.

220
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,804
Multiple fractures, lacerations,

221
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,557
concussion, fell backwards off
the fire escape while taking a selfie.

222
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,810
-At least she was doing what she loves.
-Walsh, let's get her to trauma one.

223
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,022
Um, Turan, can, um...
can you take over with Brandon?

224
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,566
He needs
two doses of ibuprofen every five hours

225
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,027
and three doses
of colchicine every eight hours.

226
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,154
Write it down so he gets the timing right.

227
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,407
[sighs] We're less than a year away
from needing our own selfie wing.

228
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,159
[Walsh] What've you got?

229
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,953
-Let's hear it, people!
-It looks like a tib-fib fracture.

230
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,872
Some intense reactive inflammation.

231
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,874
Placing a chest tube
to evacuate a pneumothorax.

232
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,127
-Shinwari?
-Arm is irrigated and sutured.

233
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,253
Nice job, everyone.

234
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,131
-Patient is stable and ready for X-ray.
-[Lauren] Too slow!

235
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,886
You guys are going
to need to be much faster

236
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,431
because the next patient that comes in
is not going to be so straightforward.

237
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,225
Nice job on that arm lac.

238
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,854
[Walsh] Let's mobilize for radiology.

239
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,815
Trauma one's a busy place.
Got to clear the room!

240
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,989
[sighs]

241
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,413
Department policy is to, uh,

242
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,582
have a general surgery presence
for all restricted bowel procedures.

243
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,167
I know the policy.

244
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,630
Your husband sent me to assist, so...

245
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,714
Then assist.

246
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,135
You wanted to keep it professional,
we can keep it professional.

247
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,262
Lyn.

248
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,140
-What was I supposed to do?
-Let go.

249
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,307
I couldn't...

250
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,977
I can't, not when I have to look
your husband in the eye every day.

251
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,813
I mean, let go of my hand.
Now I have to scrub it again.

252
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,482
[water running]

253
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,651
[softly] That's my bad.

254
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,364
[sighs]

255
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,158
While the fire department
does their thing,

256
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,536
I want your department to create
a psychological profile of the arsonist.

257
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,748
Uh, okay, yeah, but, um,
that's a really specialized field, right?

258
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,335
What do you mean? Is there no one on staff
who specializes in arson or pyromania?

259
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,549
No, no, there is. Just they're not, uh...
They're not exactly on staff.

260
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,342
Well, then, where are they?

261
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,136
[sighs]

262
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,142
-[buzzer]
-[indistinct PA announcements]

263
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,562
Common Room two.

264
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,240
[door locking, buzzer]

265
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,960
It's so good to see you again, Dr. Frome.

266
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,802
[distant sirens, horns blaring]

267
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,389
Helen.

268
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,683
Hey.

269
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,187
Just talk to me.

270
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,484
-When you, uh, spoke about the future--
-What, was it too soon?

271
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,986
-No, it... it made me sad.
-Helen... Sad?

272
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,198
Why?

273
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,539
When I was in London,
I had this profound feeling.

274
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,875
I was getting Mina settled,

275
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,545
being there for my mom,
it all just felt so...

276
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,589
I felt so exposed.

277
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,343
But in the best way.

278
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,437
It made me realize just how much
of myself that I'd put away.

279
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,943
Packed it up,

280
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,155
crossed an ocean to become someone else
in a place where I have no history.

281
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,996
It was self-preservation,
but what's left now...

282
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,333
of me?

283
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,009
Being home...

284
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,388
broke me wide open and I came spilling out

285
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,391
in a way that I don't have any interest
in boxing back up again,

286
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,976
because it felt right.

287
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,688
I felt right.

288
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,406
You can take some time off.

289
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,911
You take a leave of absence.
You can take whatever you need.

290
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,919
Max, I need to go home...

291
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,007
for good.

292
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,679
We need to push all elective surgeries.

293
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
Any patient that can be transferred,
transfer them

294
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,099
and let's double up on security.

295
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,769
-They've already doubled it.
-Then double it again.

296
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,689
Dr. Wilder, I see you're getting more use
out of this office than I do.

297
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,693
You really have a thing
against filing cabinets.

298
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,946
Just prefer a non-traditional approach
to organization.

299
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,240
Max Goodwin, medical director,
very sorry to keep you both waiting.

300
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,744
When I heard the building was on fire,
I did consider fleeing for my life.

301
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,996
Yeah, well, turns out
the fire department counts on that.

302
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,999
Except I was too curious as to why
you wanted to meet with me.

303
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,793
Um, what, uh, well--

304
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
[grunts]

305
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,046
Oh.

306
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,005
Just... okay.

307
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,342
Um, here's the thing.
I'm in a bit of a pickle,

308
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,219
a delicate situation.

309
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,306
I'm trying to replace,
uh, someone in oncology.

310
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,016
[Ben] Who's leaving?

311
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,186
Uh, uh, Dr. Helen Sharpe.

312
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,232
Holy s... no! [chuckles]

313
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,025
I'm not interpreting that.

314
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,321
Uh, I have a mouth like a sailor,
but Ben is a prude.

315
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,739
It was very explicit.

316
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,410
She's in London
and no one at the hospital knows,

317
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,704
so there's, uh, a bit of secrecy.

318
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,749
[Ben] Dr. Sharpe is the best there is.

319
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,962
I have always been humbled
by her passion, her intelligence,

320
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,632
and also, let's face it, she's super foxy.

321
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,012
Well, I don't know about...
I mean, I don't... We're not, um...

322
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,807
Yeah, they're big shoes to fill.
There's no doubt.

323
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,101
[Ben] And I'm only a size seven.

324
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,438
But I do make up for it in other ways.

325
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,857
I emailed you Dr. Wilder's CV.

326
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,819
Yeah, I see that, thank you. Um...
Listen, you come very highly recommended

327
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,739
by a lot of good people, but what
I'm looking for is impossible to find.

328
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:16,035
Dr. Sharpe not only has our oncology
and hematology departments,

329
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,538
but she also chairs
a cancer research clinic that...

330
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,041
Wow, I see you do as well.

331
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,713
The Murtha Cancer Center
at Walter Reed Hospital where

332
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,340
I currently practice surgical oncology.

333
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,842
That's very impressive.

334
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,429
Fellowship at NIH, studied at MD Anderson

335
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,931
and recipient
of The Order of the Star of Ghana.

336
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
Oh, I was doing Medecin sans Frontieres

337
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,939
outside of Accra and I saw a few ways

338
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,692
to tidy up the irrigation system
while I was there.

339
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,612
The badge itself,
it's really quite lovely.

340
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,156
Sometimes I'll just wear it out.

341
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,783
Um...

342
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,286
Wow. Uh, you are literally...

343
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,082
Uh, what am I trying to say?

344
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,335
Again, that's why I waited out the fire.

345
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,838
I'm very glad you did,
because you are hired.

346
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,258
Let's introduce you to Chairwoman Brantley
and we'll get the paperwork started.

347
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,676
The parking is really a nightmare,

348
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,221
but I think
we can find you a spot at the top.

349
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,099
[distant buzzer, doors slamming]

350
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,702
I can have other photos brought in for you
if that's what you need.

351
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,996
You know what I need.

352
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm not taking you to a burn site.

353
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,335
That is off the table.

354
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,215
Would you profile a patient
from a pile of photographs?

355
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,009
That's entirely different.
Fire is not alive.

356
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,220
Fire consumes oxygen.

357
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,849
Reproduces and moves quickly.

358
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,102
That's more alive
than a lot of my cellmates.

359
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
It's too dangerous.

360
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,484
[chuckles]

361
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,528
What am I going to do?

362
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,823
Escape from the fleet of armed guards?

363
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,992
Burn the place down?

364
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,452
I'm not a supervillain.

365
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,038
No, no, no,
I mean, it's too dangerous for you.

366
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,750
For a pyromaniac, fire is a drug,

367
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,171
and for the six years since
you were arrested, you have been sober.

368
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,884
Taking you to a burn site would be like
sending you off on a bender.

369
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,594
All your progress will be--

370
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,346
You will not shrink me.

371
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,475
You are not my analyst.
I am not your patient.

372
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,229
And my progress is none of your business.
Is that clear?

373
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,274
Yes, Mary.

374
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,650
That is clear.

375
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,072
How calm you sound.

376
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,283
How reassuring.

377
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,287
But that little Iggy mind
is in there scheming away,

378
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,581
trying to figure out
how you can reach me...

379
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,708
help me heal.

380
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,211
That...

381
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,341
That was true when we first met.
My job was to analyze inmates.

382
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,511
But right now, I assure you,
I am just here for your help.

383
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,222
You're not trying to shrink me?

384
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,556
Uh-uh.

385
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,393
Protect me from the only thing I love?

386
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,530
Your love killed 13 people, Mary.

387
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,491
Fire is not love.

388
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,867
Fire is rage.

389
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,579
-We're done here.
-The accelerant is homemade.

390
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,414
That means he's educated.

391
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,460
It's a medium petroleum distillate,

392
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,546
which is uncommon here,
but typical in Northern Europe

393
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
where he's likely from.

394
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,634
And I say <i>he</i> not only because
of the distance the gas was tossed,

395
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,887
but because
of the jagged pattern of how it fell.

396
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,390
You need strength
to toss the canister like that.

397
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,766
And anger.

398
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,188
Now imagine what I could tell
you if you got me out of here.

399
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,737
Brandon Dover, 28-year-old male
with extreme abdominal pain,

400
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,364
low BP and heart arrhythmia.

401
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,574
I just released him.
Brandon, Brandon, can you hear me?

402
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,995
-Did you take the meds we gave you?
-[groans] Yeah. It hurts.

403
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
I need a surgical consult.

404
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,623
-Trauma one.
-[groans in pain]

405
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,709
We got a bleeder!

406
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,670
Got it, suture.

407
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,340
Scissors.

408
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,678
Appendix, liver, spleen, arteries,
they all look fine.

409
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,641
Hm. They're rock hard.

410
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,560
Ischemic loop of bowel?

411
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,938
-No sign of thrombus or infection.
-Well, he came in for gout.

412
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,149
-We gave him medication.
-It didn't help.

413
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,154
-What if the pharmacy screwed up his meds?
-Maybe he didn't have gout.

414
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,989
I saw the crystals myself.

415
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,743
Okay, well, what if he did take his meds
but maybe he took too many?

416
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,870
Why would he OD on colchicine?

417
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,957
-[indistinct chatter]
-[beeping]

418
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,590
Lyn, can we talk?

419
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,383
Professionally?

420
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,218
-Personally.
-[whooshing]

421
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,679
[Lyn screams]

422
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,812
So what are you going to do?

423
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:41,151
Give up on your practice and your patients
and everything that you've built here

424
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,236
-and go back and what?
-Maybe you should leave.

425
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,529
No, I won't.

426
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,616
-You... you won't?
-You won't know how long I've waited?

427
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,160
Now that I'm here, I'm not just
going to leave, just talk to me!

428
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,454
Let me try. Please let me fight for this.

429
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,580
Okay, all right.

430
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,960
The clinic that I took my mom,
they need a new medical director and...

431
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,713
and they want me.

432
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,303
That's great. I'll go back and forth
every other weekend.

433
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,805
It's a six hour flight. Why not?

434
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,182
You can do the same.
We'll be frequent flyers.

435
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:16,019
We can't have a long-distance relationship
without having had a short-distance one.

436
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,437
Listen... listen to me.

437
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,147
Why not? [softly] Why not?

438
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,858
I'm here.

439
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,737
Now that I've held you and I've kissed you

440
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,031
and I've humiliated myself

441
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,242
in front of the entire neighborhood.

442
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,993
How have you humiliated yourself?

443
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,787
Hey, New York!

444
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,497
I love this woman!

445
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,958
-And now she's trying to dump--
-Shh!

446
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,334
-No, I'm not going to--
-Shh! No.

447
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,462
-I'll keep going, I swear to God.
-No, shh. Please, Max, stop.

448
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
I'm not going to stop until you tell me

449
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,258
-that we're going to try.
-How?

450
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,553
I... London, New York, back and forth.
Tunisia, I don't care.

451
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,471
Anywhere, as long as we're together.

452
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,890
Please.

453
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,309
W... What about Luna?

454
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,813
She can come with me.

455
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,191
She's young enough. It's fine.
It'll be an adventure for her.

456
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,901
It'll be an adventure for all of us.

457
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,405
I just want you to say that
you're willing to fight for this.

458
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,740
Because if you don't,

459
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,953
I am going to run through
these streets butt naked.

460
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,121
[giggles]

461
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll do it.

462
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,374
Literally,
I'm taking my pants off right now.

463
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,625
-Here they go.
-No, okay!

464
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,960
-Completely--
-I love you.

465
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,049
I love you.

466
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,520
Do everything you can to secure the
hospital, police, FBI, call it all in.

467
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,065
-[Ben] Max. Max!
-Yeah, I'm sorry. I--

468
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,066
We're here to help.

469
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,738
All O2 tanks and all other flammable gases
need to get disconnected

470
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,241
and someone's got to go around and ensure
that all your fire doors are latching.

471
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,285
Uh, I hate to ask, but...

472
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,413
-[Ben] You don't have to.
-Thank you.

473
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,290
-Hey. Um, well...
Tell me you got something.

474
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,043
-Miss Wheeler's not exactly compliant.
-If we don't find this person,

475
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,128
someone's going to die.
Do whatever you can.

476
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,213
-Okay.
-Thank you.

477
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,589
How you guys holding up?

478
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,717
No signs of concussion.
Just a few scrapes and bruises.

479
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,177
Lauren, Uh, I hate to do this,

480
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,596
-but you need to put the ED on diversion.
-On it.

481
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,015
Let's go over your schedule,
see what surgeries we can push.

482
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,683
Sure, I'll be right back, okay?

483
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,613
If you hadn't been there...

484
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,201
I just wanted to apologize.

485
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,540
It's passed, Floyd.

486
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,877
No, no, it hasn't.

487
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,422
I thought
we could go back to being friends,

488
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,343
but whenever I'm with your husband,
all I do is think about you.

489
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,097
And when we're together,
I just keep thinking about him.

490
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,144
You don't think this has been hard on me?

491
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,982
He may like you more than I do.

492
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,864
[sighs] Something's got to give, Lyn.

493
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,076
Look, either I step down or...

494
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,334
Or what?

495
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,180
[Lauren] Okay, I need every patient
transferred or discharged.

496
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,184
And why isn't Brandon Dover
on anti-colchicine fab fragments yet?

497
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,645
He is. I just haven't
had time to update his file.

498
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,064
How'd he mess up his meds so bad?

499
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:53,403
I have no idea, considering
we gave him such explicit instructions.

500
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,739
[Leyla] Dr. Bloom?

501
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,117
Hey.

502
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,374
I... I'll just go, um, update that file.

503
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
Just go.

504
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,628
[exhales]

505
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,339
You're a sight for sore eyes.

506
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,091
How's your first day going?

507
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,970
Are you serious? It's bad enough you gave
me a medal for cleaning out a wound,

508
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,264
but why'd you tell everyone
we were a couple?

509
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,474
Yeah, okay--

510
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,477
We agreed to wait
until they got to know me as a resident.

511
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,228
You agreed to treat me like everyone else.

512
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,022
But you're not like everybody else.

513
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,982
You're a fully-trained doctor.

514
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,902
They're just a bunch of kids
pretending to be doctors.

515
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,364
I would have complimented them too,
had the situation been reversed.

516
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,240
But the situation can never be reversed

517
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,910
because the other residents
aren't sleeping with their boss.

518
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,623
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

519
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,333
Okay, I'm sorry.

520
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,834
I just...

521
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,880
I was just trying to work my program,
you know? Put it all out there.

522
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,302
There's this saying. It's you're only
as sick as your secrets and...

523
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,851
Lauren?

524
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,145
You know what? You were right.

525
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,606
You were totally in the right
and I am wrong.

526
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,109
But I think I know
what's going on with my patient.

527
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,413
It must have been zero visibility.

528
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,210
Everywhere you look, just flames, smoke.

529
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,253
[inhales]

530
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:37,006
Black and orange, orange and black.

531
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,432
Ah, the doctor disapproves.

532
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,727
No, I'm concerned.

533
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,811
No.

534
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,731
You're scared of me.

535
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,900
You have been
since you walked into my ward.

536
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,197
The only thing I'm scared of, Mary,
is the damage being done to your psyche.

537
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,788
You treat murderers... rapists.

538
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,373
You're alone in rooms with people

539
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,501
who could snap you like a twig
and I don't think you break a sweat.

540
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,171
And here you are acting like
the nice woman of a certain age

541
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,839
is going to take a bite out of you.

542
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,678
Which one of us do you think is having
a damaging psychological experience?

543
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,473
Ahem. You know, Mary,

544
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,726
patients try to drag their doctors
into their pathologies all the time.

545
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,020
When I practiced,
there was a weekly occurrence.

546
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,063
I hate to break it to you.
It's not going to work.

547
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,565
You said when you practiced.

548
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,525
Why'd you stop?

549
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,242
I have an eye for sore spots.
Think I'd make a good shrink?

550
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,912
We're done here.

551
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,122
Tell me why you quit
and I'll tell you who set the fire.

552
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,506
I needed a change.

553
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,259
The hours were terrible.
They were killing me.

554
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,264
I'm giving you a choice
between being honest with yourself...

555
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,184
and watching this place burn.

556
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,853
-Why are you making this about me?
-"She's not too far gone!

557
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,064
We can help this woman! We can save her!"

558
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:17,941
You said that...

559
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,485
at my trial.

560
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,237
-Mm-hm.
-You yelled at the judge.

561
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,531
You demanded he put me in your ward,

562
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,116
not prison, because you could save me.

563
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,870
Iggy, the white knight,
knew everyone can be saved.

564
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,540
Now you've quit.

565
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,835
Now you've left everyone to rot.

566
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,420
Why?

567
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,676
When does the white knight
stop trying to save everybody?

568
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,973
When he stops believing
that people can be saved.

569
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,144
Out of here.

570
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,604
Now.

571
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,316
Fire isn't rage, Dr. Frome.
Want to know what it is?

572
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,195
God writes in pencil. Fire's his eraser.

573
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,448
It's not for anger. It's for pain.

574
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,242
That's your profile?

575
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,244
The arsonist is in pain?

576
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,203
Just like you.

577
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,497
Just like me.

578
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,583
[Mary whimpers]

579
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,669
Okay. Thank you, Teresa.

580
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,754
-I'll catch up with you in a minute.
-Okay.

581
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,173
Hey, so, it was a mistake
to bring Mary back into this.

582
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,466
It definitely set her back.

583
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,553
The best I got out of her is that
the arsonist is trying to erase something.

584
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,264
-Erase what?
-I don't know. I have no idea.

585
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,517
Is there anything that connects
the location of the two fires? Anything?

586
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,769
Not really.
I mean, one was a COVID overflow unit

587
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,522
and the other
was an auxiliary space for neurology.

588
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,983
-What was it used for last?
-[sighs]

589
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,777
It was our second COVID overflow unit.

590
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
Where else
did we annex for COVID patients?

591
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,159
Max! Max!

592
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,496
-Everybody out now!
-[kids screaming]

593
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,584
[Max] When do you fly out?

594
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,337
I have my final interview
with the board of directors next week.

595
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,672
-They said it's just a formality, but...
-I'll go with you.

596
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,550
-Really?
-Yeah.

597
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,138
No, no, wait, sorry, can't that week.
That's Luna's first week of pre-school.

598
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:16,351
Oh, right.
Yeah, no, definitely cannot miss that.

599
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,729
Um, why don't you come
the following weekend

600
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,606
and then I can fly back with you?

601
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,649
Perfect.

602
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,068
Oh, no, sorry.

603
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,820
That weekend is my visit
to Cambridge to visit Mina.

604
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,489
-Mm.
-I'm trying to broker a truce

605
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,615
between her and my mother.

606
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,450
-Yeah, you got to do that.
-Mm-hm.

607
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,035
Uh, okay, no problem.

608
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,705
Then you fly back and we will spend
the following weekend together.

609
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,250
Isn't that the weekend that you usually
have your conferences in Colorado?

610
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,962
The ones that you're always
trying to get me to go to?

611
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,380
[chuckles]

612
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,216
-You are correct.
-Mm-hm.

613
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,133
And this is--

614
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,510
-Crazy.
-Crazy.

615
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,554
There's got to be one weekend
that we can spend together?

616
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,847
Of course there is.

617
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,313
[chuckles]

618
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,233
-Yeah.
-Let's not do this now.

619
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,484
I don't want to ruin this.

620
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,655
It's not ruined.

621
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,574
It's just a scheduling thing.

622
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,705
-Yes.

623
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
It's going to work.

624
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,467
I want it to, Max.

625
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,888
I really want it to.

626
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,181
And it will.

627
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,229
-[Helen sighs]
-[Max chuckles]

628
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Lyle.

629
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,663
That's your name, right?

630
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,046
You lost someone?

631
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,715
Your wife?

632
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,677
I can imagine what that's like.

633
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,845
Can you?

634
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,349
Working in this hospital
and not being allowed in that room...

635
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,770
just to say goodbye.

636
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,649
Because of protocol, rules.

637
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,528
She was in our COVID unit.

638
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,114
Right, the one that burned down today?

639
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:43,206
You mean the room you asked me
to make sunny by covering it up?

640
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,001
That room, where my wife died?

641
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,963
That graveyard you asked me to erase?

642
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,761
I understand.

643
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,306
And I'm sorry.

644
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,312
But above this room
was our third COVID unit.

645
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,232
But you knew that already,
but did you know

646
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,985
that it's back to being
our daycare center?

647
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,783
Where my daughter was playing.

648
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,203
-If anything happened to her...
-[cop] That's him.

649
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,665
Don't move.

650
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,959
...I might want to burn it all down, too.

651
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,377
[handcuffs click]

652
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,797
[indistinct police radio chatter]

653
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,881
Let's go.

654
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,975
Um, I need to correct something

655
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,477
that I said to you earlier
about protecting you.

656
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,356
[sighs] I... I can't.

657
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,650
I can't protect you.

658
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,821
And the truth is,
no matter how much you prepare,

659
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,575
how solid your boundaries are,

660
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:06,164
there will always be patients
that just consume you.

661
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,207
Always.

662
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,668
They will ruin family dinners.

663
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,921
They will doom first dates
and you'll dread seeing them

664
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,841
because they scare
the ever-loving hell out of you.

665
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,470
Uh, the thing that I failed to mention
about the whole healing souls thing

666
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:26,517
is that, uh,
it comes with a hefty price tag.

667
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,522
It's a... It's a piece of your own soul.

668
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,322
So the patient is Mary W.

669
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,325
She is a 60-year-old
psychopathic pyromaniac,

670
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,995
who exhibits highly manipulative
and sadistic tendencies.

671
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,664
She's being transferred here today
from the corrections ward

672
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,125
because she wants our help.

673
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,462
But I don't see patients anymore.

674
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,299
You do.

675
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,801
So...

676
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,930
do I have any takers?

677
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,621
[Lauren] Brandon, I think I know why
you messed up the dosage.

678
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,129
When I was younger,

679
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,341
nobody cared about my education.

680
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,343
As long as I could ball.

681
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,304
Not the school, not the coaches.

682
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,516
I was their meal ticket.

683
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,187
It's always been that way,
even throughout college.

684
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,777
Nobody wanted
to hear about my... dyslexia.

685
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,071
Couldn't even get it diagnosed.

686
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,865
When I blew out my knee, that was it.

687
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,328
I couldn't play,
couldn't keep my scholarship.

688
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,083
I couldn't read.

689
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,721
Okay, uh, here's my card.

690
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,808
So you can recognize
my number when I call you.

691
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
This ain't your problem, Dr. Bloom.

692
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,314
Once your issues out there
become a problem in here,

693
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,899
it's my job to fix it.

694
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,210
Shinwari.

695
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,172
You left the O2 sat meter on the counter.

696
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:05,509
It always has to go back on the wall
in the receptor where it belongs.

697
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,346
The next time an asthmatic comes in,
sucking for air,

698
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,098
I can't be hunting around
trying to find it. You got that?

699
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,226
Am I making myself clear?

700
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,813
Yes. Yes, Dr. Bloom.
I'll put it back from now on.

701
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,740
Look who's back in action.

702
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,201
Nurse Kamoe,
I believe this calls for music.

703
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>-♪ Hey ma ♪</i>
<i>-♪ What's up? ♪</i>

704
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,580
<i>-♪ Let's slide ♪</i>
<i>-♪ All right ♪</i>

705
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,791
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

706
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,960
Let me guess.
You and your girl work things out.

707
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,590
We did,
but still figuring out some details.

708
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,342
<i>♪ All right</i>
<i>And we gon' get it on tonight ♪</i>

709
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,887

<i>Ladies night ♪</i>

710
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,347
I'm going to go out on a limb here

711
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,517
and guess this interview didn't go
quite as smoothly as your others.

712
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,936
Well, there's definitely
more smoke damage.

713
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,688
Yeah, look, we're criminally underfunded.
We are always in the red.

714
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,358
We've got unfilled repair orders
from 1973.

715
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,403
And I'm losing more doctors
and nurses from burnout

716
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,113
than I can even keep up with.

717
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,949
So, uh, I get it, if you want to say no.

718
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,492
-Max.
-Max.

719
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,328
You don't build
a good hospital with money.

720
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,706
You build it with good people.
And you have that in spades.

721
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,293
I would love to work here.

722
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,840
-You would? That's amazing!
-But I can't accept.

723
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,801
You want someone to replace Dr. Sharpe.

724
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,388
Something tells me
Dr. Sharpe is not replaceable.

725
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,725
Whoever follows in her footsteps
will be a disappointment.

726
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,436
My advice.

727
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,897
Don't let her go.

728
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,823
But it was certainly
a memorable interview.

729
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,514
Oh, hi.

730
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,266
Hi.

731
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,562
How was your flight?

732
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,150
Sad, upsetting.

733
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,860
Lonely.

734
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,535
More joy.

735
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,081
That's what I told myself.
That's what I learned.

736
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,461
If anything, over these last 18 months,
that's what I need.

737
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,427
And that's you.

738
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,553
You're my joy.

739
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,815
Did you find my replacement?

740
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,943
No one can replace you.

741
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,701
But I think I found someone to replace me.

742
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,168
What?

743
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,630
I'm going with you.

744
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,263
More joy.

745
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,018
[exhales sharply]

746
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,187
[laughs softly]
