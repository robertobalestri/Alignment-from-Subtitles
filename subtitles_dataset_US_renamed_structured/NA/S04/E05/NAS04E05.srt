00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,970
She needs a shovel
so she can finish off the job.

176
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,973
Lauren.

177
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,672
Can the witness please state
her name and connection

178
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:19,934
to the plaintiff?

179
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,152
Dr. Helen Sharpe.

180
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,111
I've been her oncologist
for five years.

181
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,156
Dr. Sharpe, do you recall
your appointment

182
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,985
with the plaintiff
on June 15th of last year?

183
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,118
Yes, she was having
her radiation mold

184
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,772
cost that required her

185
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,426
to lie with her arms
pinned over her head.

186
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,125
Like this?
Yes.

187
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,388
It's not a painful procedure.

188
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:43,305
It's tedious,
which is why I was surprised

189
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:48,310
when she began--crying doesn't
seem like a strong enough word.

190
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:52,880
She was shaking and sobbing.

191
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:55,056
I helped her up.
I asked her what was wrong.

192
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:59,669
And she explained that
she'd been struck by a memory

193
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,846
of being sexually assaulted
when she was 12.

194
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,022
She said that I was the first
person she'd ever told.

195
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:08,156
But why did she
remember at that moment?

196
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,114
I mean, what triggers
the recovery of a memory

197
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,376
that's been repressed?

198
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,161
It's typically
a sensory detail.

199
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:16,773
It can be a smell or a sound
or the feeling

200
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,297
of having your arms
pinned over your head.

201
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,909
Mm.

202
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:24,389
Like this.

203
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,740
Did any part of you suspect

204
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,526
the plaintiff
was confused or lying?

205
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,181
Her recall of the incident
was crystal clear.

206
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,924
Her trauma was palpable.

207
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,969
I believe every word.

208
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,320
Thank you. Prosecution rests.

209
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,366
Does the defense
have counterclaims?

210
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,846
We do,

211
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,891
an expert witness
who will refute the legitimacy

212
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,851
of this conveniently
recovered memory.

213
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,548
We call Dr. Ignatius Frome.

214
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,265
Hey, I got your page.
What's going on?

215
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,790
Some nut attacked the art,
Dr. G.

216
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,052
What?

217
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,576
She rammed her chair
into that old harp.

218
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

219
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,014
This does not belong to you.

220
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,016
My grandmother fled Burma
as a young woman,

221
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,235
and she said
that the saung-gauk

222
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,193
belongs to her
and that it was stolen.

223
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,804
Stolen, stolen!

224
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:36,113
Okay.
Calm--calm down, please.

225
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:39,116
Clear this up. Now.

226
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,424
All right. Come on, people.
Let's go.

227
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:46,820
How's this for our brand?

228
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,912
That was...

229
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,262
1974.

230
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,395
Soldiers retaliated.
She lost her family.

231
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,570
She lost everything.

232
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,053
Lost that too.

233
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,450
Till today I had never heard
her speak about that time.

234
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:12,715
Ms. Takhon,
I...can only imagine

235
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,630
how traumatizing
that must have been.

236
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,764
I mean, I'd never heard
her talk about the happy times.

237
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,941
In order to start a life here,
she had to forget.

238
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:24,509
But that song today
she told me her mom played it

239
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:25,815
and her family sang to it.

240
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,992
It's hers, and she deserves
to have it back.

241
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:35,042
Look--I--you seem very,
very sincere,

242
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:38,088
but the odds
that this is actually her harp,

243
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,003
I mean, it's been 50 years.

244
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,657
I'm so sorry.

245
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,705
This just doesn't
prove anything.

246
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:49,970
Well, there's an inscription
inside this harp.

247
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:53,103
Can you ask your grandmother
if she knows it?

248
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:18,650
Sandar 81830.

249
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,741
My mother's name
and her birthday.

250
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:27,485
It is hers.

251
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,889
Got your 911.

252
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,065
Why aren't you prepping
for the artificial heart?

253
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,721
Because your husband
pulled me off of it.

254
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,550
He knows, Lyn.
He knows about us.

255
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:49,769
That's impossible.

256
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,509
He took me off the surgery
of my life,

257
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,685
and he did it with no reason.
What's your explanation?

258
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:57,733
There's no way.

259
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:04,044
At breakfast he--
he was a little distant.

260
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,089
That's not how
I wanted this to go down.

261
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,874
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

262
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,353
I mean, all this talk about

263
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,486
how evolved to have such a
mature relationship, it's...

264
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,707
It's wishful thinking.

265
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,144
Of course he feels attacked.

266
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:20,800
Of course he's lashing out.
What were we thinking?

267
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,714
We didn't do anything wrong.

268
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,413
Claude and I, we have rules.
We didn't break them.

269
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,198
Those rules are
who we wish we were.

270
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,679
Here in real life your husband
undermined my career,

271
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,115
and he did it
with the snap of his fingers.

272
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,162
What's he going to do next?

273
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,079
Book a CT.
I didn't like the bloodwork.

274
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,950
Poor guy's had a lot
of tests.

275
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,213
Or you could skip
the commentary and just do it.

276
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,825
Uh, rude.
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,130
I'm having a morning.
It's like--

278
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,784
Thank you so much.

279
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,612
I can't thank you enough.
I--I don't usually...

280
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:54,007
You're kidding.
Traffic in public hospitals.

281
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,620
Jeanie Bloom.

282
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,623
Oh, the world's
sexiest nurse.

283
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,103
Come here, baby.
Give some love.

284
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:07,629
No, I told you to go.
Yes, and I found a doctor

285
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:11,633
who doesn't kick women
in pain to the curb.

286
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:17,508
A word?

287
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,512
You realize she's
just using you for pills?

288
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,080
Maybe.
Maybe. She is high right now.

289
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,908
Which is why I admitted her.

290
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,128
As long as she's intoxicated,
a clean diagnosis

291
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,870
is impossible.
I'm ordering a rapid detox

292
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,654
so I can make
an informed decision.

293
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:33,742
Oh, God. Oh.

294
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,921
Okay, fine. Treat her.

295
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,749
She's just going to
use you for pills.

296
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,883
She's going to say whatever
she has to say to get her fix.

297
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,580
Or maybe we'll discover
the source

298
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:49,714
of the underlying pain.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

299
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,066
We're giving it back.

300
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,764
Max, it is not ours
to give back.

301
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,244
It belongs to the Manhattan.

302
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,681
Yeah, just like the lobby
belongs to this hospital?

303
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,639
Oh, you are really hung up
on the lobby.

304
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,119
This isn't about me.
This is about him,

305
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,904
and it's going to be about you.
If this gets out,

306
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,731
how do you think the board
is gonna feel when they hear

307
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,603
that your first act
as medical director

308
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:11,649
was to make New Amsterdam the
face of someone else's scandal?

309
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,129
I will tell the board

310
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,914
that there are worse things
than taking a PR bullet

311
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,698
for a very rich museum.

312
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,657
And when we get a Manhattan
Museum of art fundraiser

313
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,965
do you honestly think that
they will care about a harp?

314
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,662
This isn't just about a harp.

315
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:27,665
It's about a patient who
endured a lifetime of suffering

316
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,972
and had to live it
all over again because of us.

317
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,888
So screw the board;
screw the games.

318
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,632
She's in pain,
and we can fix it.

319
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,764
That's not my job.

320
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:47,120
I'm sorry, Max. The harp stays.

321
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,818
What is
the Shopping Mall Experiment?

322
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,733
That is a very famous
experiment

323
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,082
regarding the nature of memory.

324
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,041
A group of doctors
tried to convince a group

325
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,912
of healthy minded adults

326
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,609
that they had suffered
an incident as children

327
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,002
where they were lost in a mall.

328
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,613
And did they succeed?
They did.

329
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:05,051
Almost half of the participants
were so sure

330
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,705
that it actually happened
that when the doctors revealed

331
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,969
they made it up
they refused to believe them.

332
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,972
So people can have memories
that feel true

333
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,060
but are pure fiction?

334
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:17,019
So imagine I showed you
a chair

335
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,238
and then I took the chair away
and asked you

336
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,936
to draw a picture of it.
That is memory.

337
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,678
That is our brains attempt
in the moment

338
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,811
to recreate the past.
If I asked you

339
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,726
to draw that chair tomorrow it
would probably be pretty good,

340
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,819
but if I asked you to draw it
again in a year, not so much.

341
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,997
And recovered memories
like the plaintiffs?

342
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,962
Recovered memories would be
like asking your brain

343
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,268
to draw a picture of a chair

344
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,879
it hadn't thought
about in 20 years.

345
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:53,012
Is it fair to say
that recovered memories

346
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,796
are inherently unreliable?

347
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,971
Yes.

348
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,277
Would you send someone
to jail

349
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,888
based solely
on a recovered memory?

350
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,200
No, absolutely not.

351
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,430
Oh, hey, Dr. Reynolds.
Hi.

352
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,780
I need you to instruct
Dr. Baptiste to reinstate me

353
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,565
on the artificial
heart implant.

354
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,176
Now, I'd go to him directly,
but given the effort

355
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,613
you exerted in bringing such
a momentous surgery here,

356
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,442
I figured you'd really
understand the stakes.

357
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,097
Oh, Dr. Baptiste didn't
take you off that surgery.

358
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,577
I did.

359
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,362
I--you?
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,799
Wait, what? Why?

361
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,280
Well, you have a patient
that takes precedent.

362
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,804
Erma Mirojnik?
Erma--Erma--no, no, no, no.

363
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,937
I treated her already
this morning.

364
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,157
Oh, we have a new policy.

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,811
The discharging physician
handles follow-ups if a patient

366
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,249
returns to the hospital
within 30 days of treatment.

367
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,817
And unfortunately, Ms. Mirojnik
returned within 13 minutes.

368
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,384
She what?

369
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,951
Mm, she's here now.
She's awaiting treatment.

370
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:08,652
And you'd know that
if you answered your pages.

371
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:13,353
Dr. Reynolds, do you have
a problem with this policy?

372
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,745
I have a problem
with you risking

373
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,399
a history-making surgery
so I can treat

374
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,922
Erma Mirojnik's paper cuts.

375
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,751
Come on. The surgery is just
a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

376
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,536
And I think history
will manage just fine

377
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:25,495
if someone other than you
is holding the scissors.

378
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,931
I earned this opportunity.

379
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:36,376
Um, no, Dr. Reynolds,
you earned Erma Mirojnik.

380
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,422
Now, if you can treat
Ms. Mirojnik's issues,

381
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:44,819
in time you can certainly still
scrub in on the surgery, okay?

382
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,000
Hayma Takhon's prosthesis
doesn't fit her properly.

383
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,523
It's tearing into her skin.

384
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,439
She's battling constant pain,
infection--

385
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,746
Dr. Goodwin--
That's not the half of it.

386
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,835
This is her first
revision surgery with us,

387
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,707
but it's her fourth
in the last decade.

388
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,406
Insurance won't pay for a
better limb, so every time

389
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,972
she gets a new surgery

390
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,933
she knows that it's not
if she'll be back it's when.

391
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,544
It's torture.

392
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,893
She has my sympathies

393
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:18,592
and those of
the entire Manhattan Museum,

394
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,898
but we have
the saung-gauk's provenance.

395
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,858
We have strict protocols
to avoid cultural looting.

396
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,381
Our hands are clean.

397
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,906
Fair enough.
I'll tell Hayma what you said.

398
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,734
Thank you.
Yeah.

399
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,910
And then I'll tell her to call
the arts task at "The Times"

400
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,651
just to see if they think
your protocols

401
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,436
are as strict
as they need to be.

402
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:45,401
If we let this woman do this
dozens of others with similar

403
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,838
pending claims
are going to demand the same.

404
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,536
You're right.

405
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:52,974
If only there was some way to
magically make it all go away,

406
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,584
skip the legal PR fiasco,

407
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:58,458
then you'd probably
give it back in a heartbeat.

408
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,418
Of course.
Maybe this will help.

409
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,769
It's an NDA signed by Hayma
guaranteeing her silence

410
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,772
in exchange for the saung-gauk.

411
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:11,079
No legal battle, no PR.

412
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:14,952
And you, you get to do
the right thing.

413
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,525
Very well.

414
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,379
Helen, before I walked
into that courtroom,

415
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,948
I had no idea you were
on the other side of that case.

416
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,689
Did you not hear?

417
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:59,606
There is no case.
The state dropped the charges.

418
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,043
Thanks to your testimony,
a monster's gonna walk.

419
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,611
I'm sorry to hear that.

420
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,831
You're sorry.

421
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,572
Great.
Well, I'll just be off then.

422
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,531
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me

423
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:12,880
why you would stand up in court

424
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,795
and attack
a victim of sexual violence?

425
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,537
I didn't.
I did not attack a victim.

426
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,453
I've never even met the victim.
You can't possibly think

427
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,499
that I have some sort
of anti-victim agenda here.

428
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,979
I don't.
How distressing it must be

429
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,546
for you not to be believed.

430
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,380
I gave scientific testimony
that recovered memories

431
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,903
are unreliable, which they are.

432
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,035
I've been practicing
for many years, Helen.

433
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,689
And I've yet
to encounter anyone

434
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,865
who had a recovered memory
that was the unqualified truth.

435
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,564
How about me?

436
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,523
Back in university, I got
caught in a summer rainstorm,

437
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,177
and this memory out of nowhere
came up

438
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,918
and hit me like a hammer.

439
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,615
It's the strongest memory
I have.

440
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:58,142
A summer rainstorm.
August Bank Holiday.

441
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:02,799
I'm five, and I'm playing
this beaded string

442
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,584
that I'd just gotten
for my birthday.

443
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,152
But really, I'm listening.

444
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:11,112
Let go of me.
Wait, we can work--

445
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,897
Stop crying.
Don't touch me.

446
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:17,074
'Cause that's the day
my dad left.

447
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:20,164
Hold on, don't leave. Please.
Please, please, stop.

448
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,905
Don't touch me.

449
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,386
I'm so sorry.

450
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,563
I love you.
I love you. I'm so sorry.

451
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:31,915
And right when he reached
the door I begged him to stay,

452
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:35,789
but he just pushed me off,
and my beads ripped.

453
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,497
Now look me in the eye
and tell me

454
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,543
that my memory is not critical

455
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,810
In a court of law, it's not.

456
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,774
It's a good thing that you're
not seeing patients anymore

457
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,733
'cause I would tell any woman
who came through your door

458
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,778
to run as fast as she could.

459
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,611
I mean that is bad.

460
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,745
How come
no one could see that before?

461
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,443
I said you could treat her,
not prescribe her pills.

462
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,837
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my doctor here.

463
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,143
No, you're not.
You're discharged.

464
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,623
Don't let the door hit you.
Ow. Ow.

465
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,972
You can't just do that.

466
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,974
She's treating me.
I'm her patient.

467
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,281
No, you're a pill head
gaming us for a fix,

468
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,632
and I toss those out of here
all the time.

469
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,155
I also toss out doctors who

470
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,593
hand out schedule two narcotics
to known drug addicts.

471
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,072
I didn't give her pills.

472
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,074
I ordered them
to help her calm down

473
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,076
so I could perform
the ultrasound,

474
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,078
which revealed Lyme disease.

475
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,080
Look at the ultrasound.
You'll clearly see--

476
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,821
An enlarged spleen, right?

477
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,085
And I bet Jeanie was just so
grateful when you spotted it.

478
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:56,826
But Jeannie knows she has
an enlarged spleen,

479
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,829
because genie
is a hard-core alcoholic.

480
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,657
She played you.

481
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,051
Oh, by the way, I canceled
Leyla's prescription.

482
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:05,531
Go score somewhere else.

483
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:07,881
What kind of daughter
treats her mother like this?

484
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,190
I tell you what.

485
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:16,585
You start acting like a mom,
then we can talk.

486
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,066
Really? And how many times
were you here

487
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:23,331
at work stoned off your ass
on Adderall?

488
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,811
Oh, does she know
about that?

489
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,726
She does, because I am
working my program.

490
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,031
I tell her the truth.

491
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,644
Oh, so you and she are...

492
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,559
it's not gonna
make a difference.

493
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,825
Honey, thank you so much.

494
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,523
It was very nice to meet you.
You have been so sweet.

495
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,178
You--you're gonna be over her
by Christmastime.

496
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:47,224
I--I don't know. She's just
nasty inside. She's cold.

497
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,270
I guess you're just next
in line to figure that out.

498
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:53,230
Get out of my ED now!

499
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:59,236
Oh, okay. Ohh.

500
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:04,111
You know what, Mom?
You know what?

501
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:07,767
Here are your pills.

502
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,986
Take 'em with vodka;
have a party.

503
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,945
Why should I care?

504
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:19,692
.

505
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,346
Max, what the hell
did you do?

506
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,262
Oh, I brokered a deal between
the Manhattan and Hayma.

507
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:28,178
Well, that deal is currently
blowing up in our lobby.

508
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,708
It never even belonged
to you.

509
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,579
Hey, hey, hey, put that down.
We had a deal.

510
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:38,580
This man--

511
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:39,712
I'm from the
Myanmar Consulate.

512
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:40,800
Oh he's a thief.
Okay.

513
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,544
Sir, we had an agreement.
The Manhattan Museum of Art

514
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:48,721
has agreed to return
the saung-gauk to Miss Takhon.

515
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,287
We are aware.

516
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,246
When a museum repatriates
an item from our country,

517
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,595
they are obliged
to let us know.

518
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,249
Okay, great. You know.
So what's the issue?

519
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,772
He's about to take back
the saung-gauk.

520
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,165
Okay. Okay.

521
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,601
Let's all just take
a deep breath.

522
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,124
I'm sure that we can
all work this out.

523
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,648
There's nothing to work out.

524
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,432
The country that stole Hayma's
instrument 50 years ago

525
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,477
is back to do it again.
We can prove

526
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:10,133
that this saung-gauk
belongs to Ms. Takhon.

527
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,570
There are many objects
in museums

528
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,310
that may belong to Myanmar.

529
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,617
Mr. Gong has proven
that this one did.

530
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,445
And when she left our country,
it became property

531
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,752
of the state.
She abandoned it.

532
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,450
Abandoned?
She was driven out at gunpoint.

533
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,147
Max.

534
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,715
Look, the state department
has already signed off.

535
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,413
I have sent you the paperwork.

536
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,638
No--no, wait, wait, sir.

537
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,816
Please don't do this
to her again.

538
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:46,517
Just because you can't see
the gun pointed at me

539
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,389
doesn't mean it isn't there.

540
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,179
Triage nurse to the ER.

541
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,485
Triage nurse to the ER.

542
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,316
You have large
inflamed adenoids

543
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,666
in the back of your sinuses.

544
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,320
Good heavens.

545
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:09,192
It's actually good news.
Simple surgery is all you need.

546
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,846
So you can fix it?

547
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,805
Yes but, Erma, your adenoids
didn't get this big overnight.

548
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:15,677
I mean, you must've had a clue
that things weren't right,

549
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:19,899
I mean, from snoring, aching
sinuses, cough, something.

550
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,249
Yes, all of that.

551
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,642
Well,
why didn't you mention it?

552
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:26,819
I mean, we certainly see
each other often enough.

553
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,691
Well, I--I didn't
want to be an old pest.

554
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,650
I mean, I know you have
more important things

555
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,390
to do than to take care of me.

556
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,566
You've already looked
at the clock five times

557
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,355
since you came in here.

558
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,357
You're right. I'm sorry.

559
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,838
I--

560
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,666
I never meant
to make you feel...

561
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,539
Hey.
One moment.

562
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:57,806
Surgery's about to start.
I got this. Go make history.

563
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:10,558
Erma, Dr. Flores
has got it from here.

564
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,649
You're in good hands.
Thank you.

565
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,523
Hi. How are you?

566
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,308
Hi.

567
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,571
Let's see what we got here.

568
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,317
Don't worry about it.

569
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,320
You're in good company.
She's fooled a lot of

570
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,714
A-list doctors.
I shouldn't have left you to--

571
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:39,979
You never looked
at the ultrasound.

572
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,459
Okay.
You know, I find your refusal

573
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,593
to admit your wrong attractive,
but come on.

574
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,900
You're giving substandard
level of care.

575
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,292
I get
that you're embarrassed,

576
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,773
but you are
way out of line.

577
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,296
That was awful in there,

578
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,255
and you haven't
even asked me if I'm okay.

579
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:59,302
Because when I'm on duty
my concern is for the patient.

580
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,304
And if you were being
her doctor instead of her kid,

581
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:03,611
you wouldn't be asking me
to tend to your feelings.

582
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,874
You'd be looking
at the ultrasound.

583
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:12,663
The spleen is
enlarged from alcohol,

584
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:13,795
but I see a level of growth

585
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,014
that
may indicate other factors.

586
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,363
Except it doesn't.

587
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,494
You barely looked.

588
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,931
Because I have seen my mom's

589
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,933
spleen as much as
I've seen her face, okay?

590
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:24,458
It's exactly the same. It's...

591
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,814
What?

592
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,817
Above the spleen.

593
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:39,952
Cysts.

594
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,476
Endometriosis.

595
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:51,659
She was telling the truth.

596
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,839
Come in.

597
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,842
Hi. Can we talk?

598
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,807
Okay, well, I think that we
need to have a talk.

599
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,331
Well, I don't have
anything to say.

600
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:20,949
It wasn't raining that day
when your dad left.

601
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,909
You told me you were five.
I looked it up,

602
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,562
August Bank Holiday
of that year.

603
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,738
There was a heat wave.

604
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:30,045
Meteorologically historic there
wasn't a drop of rain in London

605
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:31,568
that entire summer.

606
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:34,049
Is that supposed to shake me
to my core?

607
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:36,530
'Cause I'm pretty sure
you could find another website

608
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:40,012
that says it hailed frogs.
It rained. I was there.

609
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,579
Unless it wasn't London.
It was London.

610
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:45,713
Really? Most people travel
on August Bank Holiday.

611
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,890
You told me yourself that you
took many trips to the seaside.

612
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,892
I've heard you talk about it.

613
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:58,508
Fine. Maybe it was Cornwell.
Well spotted.

614
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,859
Except for the heat wave
wasn't just in London

615
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,382
that summer.

616
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,950
The entire country
didn't get a drop of rain.

617
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,560
Do you know
where it was raining?

618
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,909
It was raining.
Yes.

619
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,477
You were in a summer storm
when you had the memory.

620
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,653
Maybe the two
have been conflated.

621
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,924
And if you're wrong
about the rain

622
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,013
and you're wrong
about the location...

623
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:27,929
How dare you?
How dare you come in here

624
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,975
and try and disrupt
what I know to be true?

625
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,541
But you don't.
Pardon?

626
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,152
But you don't know,
and I don't know.

627
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:39,549
You know that I hated
what I did today, don't you?

628
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:41,943
I--I hate that part of my job.

629
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,815
Sexual assault victims
are almost always

630
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,948
telling the truth,
and they deserve respect

631
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,690
and sympathy
and above all else belief.

632
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,607
But recovered memories
are not valid. That is a fact.

633
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,043
Not yours, not hers,
not anyone's,

634
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,610
and I'm not going
to lie under oath

635
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,786
because I think somebody
is probably guilty.

636
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,440
I am not playing God.

637
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:04,052
No, just executioner.

638
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,575
How did
the beads rip, Helen?

639
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:07,142
Can you get out, please?
This is so sick.

640
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,058
I will. I will. Just tell me
how the beads got ripped.

641
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:12,104
I already told you
my father pushed me.

642
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:15,455
He pushed you?
That doesn't make sense.

643
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,937
How does the string of beads
get ripped for a push?

644
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,068
Well, that's what
happened so--

645
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,635
No, it doesn't.

646
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,115
A string of beads does not
get ripped from a push.

647
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,594
You don't know that!
You don't know that!

648
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,509
For that you need a pull.

649
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,904
Stop.
She's my daughter.

650
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,775
I can't leave.

651
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,822
We're done.
No, I...

652
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:36,215
I don't want to go.

653
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,524
Don't, no, don't--
Let go.

654
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,140
Get out! Go!

655
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,628
Helen.

656
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:02,154
My--my mother
broke the beads.

657
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:19,258
The retractor
has been removed.

658
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,303
Vitals are steady.

659
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,392
.

660
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,308
Hmm. That looks much better.

661
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:29,050
We thought we weren't going
to get to see you for this one.

662
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:33,402
Nope. This was too important.

663
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:55,163
I'm sorry.

664
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,035
I'm sorry
about your saung-gauk.

665
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:02,214
If you want our legal services,
we'll fight it.

666
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,694
Won't cost you a cent.

667
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:19,492
The past is gone.
Nothing can bring it back.

668
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:22,147
Not even the saung-gauk.

669
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,716
Only thing is to live for now.

670
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:35,073
Maybe we can help with that.

671
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,813
Are you enjoying
the prosthesis?

672
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:40,556
It's the best one we've got.

673
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,168
I don't know why you would
get her hopes up like that

674
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,344
when you know her insurance
would never pay for it.

675
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:47,128
No, no, you're right.
They wouldn't.

676
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:50,218
But, Ms. Takhon,
to make up for their part

677
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,220
in the acquisition
of stolen property,

678
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:55,528
the Manhattan Museum of Art
has offered to buy you

679
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:57,269
the prosthetic leg
of your choosing.

680
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,141
And may I suggest the one you
have on, which should guarantee

681
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,579
that you'd never have
to have revision surgery again.

682
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,801
She understood all of that?

683
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:12,458
She got enough.
Good.

684
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:17,376
So Flores got to do
the artificial heart surgery?

685
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:22,381
Mm-hmm. She did.

686
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:25,688
You were looking forward
to that one.

687
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:29,127
I was.

688
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,564
Oh,
probably for the wrong reasons.

689
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:36,395
Yeah, but the first
Black surgeon

690
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:42,357
to perform
an artificial heart transplant.

691
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:47,275
That would've been cool.

692
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,800
Instead,
you put your patient first.

693
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,806
That's kind of cool too.

694
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,600
Makes me think I should do
that more often

695
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,776
with the people
I care about the most.

696
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,827
It's time to tell your husband.

697
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,444
Endometriosis is difficult
to diagnose.

698
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,273
I mean,
there's no one clear test.

699
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:33,800
And there's no easy fix.

700
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:36,542
Hey. Hey, come on. It's okay.
We're going to get there.

701
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:43,288
30 years no one's
ever believed me.

702
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:45,899
They said,
"Oh, it's your period."

703
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,640
They said, "You're crazy."

704
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:48,771
They said you wanted pills.

705
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:56,475
I've judged you my whole life.

706
00:36:56,518 --> 00:37:00,392
I mean,
I've thought awful things.

707
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:03,917
But you were in pain,
and you needed my help.

708
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,658
And I am a doctor.

709
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,876
I'm your daughter.

710
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,274
I--I should have--

711
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:16,712
I am just really sorry, Mom.

712
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,508
Yeah, come in.

713
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:38,299
I--I was just
leaving you a voice mail.

714
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,910
You know how you can delete
and, like, start over again?

715
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,738
And I just kept deleting,

716
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:48,570
and I got caught
in a loop of stupidity.

717
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:54,010
I--I hate that I did that
to you.

718
00:37:56,752 --> 00:38:01,017
And I hated you for doing it.

719
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,411
It was violating.

720
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,415
But you were right.

721
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,553
I'm about to cross an ocean
to be closer to my mum,

722
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:17,904
and I have no idea
who she is anymore.

723
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:27,914
I've always thought
of my dad as...

724
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:31,439
as a--a coward.

725
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:40,970
But he was holding me.

726
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,669
He was holding me
like he wanted me.

727
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:53,592
And he tried to reach out
so many times.

728
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:57,335
I never answered,
and I was okay with it.

729
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:04,777
But what if I was wrong?

730
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:15,657
The fact that he died knowing
that I-I hated him...

731
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,748
There's just--there's no
making that right, is there?

732
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,453
Well, the good news is,
I would never accept

733
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,019
that memory in court either.

734
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,067
It's just inadmissible.

735
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,640
You wanna know something
really messed up about memory?

736
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:45,034
Literally the least important
thing about them

737
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:47,689
are if they actually happened.

738
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,735
But who cares?
I mean, we do.

739
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,041
We care deeply.

740
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,130
I mean, we build
this story about ourselves.

741
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,523
We tell ourselves--
we make it big.

742
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,916
It's our truth, you know?

743
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,006
But we--we can't base
that story in fact.

744
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,443
We just can't.

745
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,446
We base it in memories,

746
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,103
and memories are--well,

747
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:13,585
I don't--I don't even know.
They're nothing.

748
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:16,065
They're in the ether.

749
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:21,114
So maybe try not
to define yourself by them.

750
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,556
But if memory's bollocks,
then what do I rely on?

751
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:35,041
What about right now,
the present?

752
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:39,001
What makes you feel safe?

753
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:43,528
You know, what makes you feel
pleasure here?

754
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:50,535
Right now,
what makes you feel love?

755
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,762
Well, I hope you're happy.

756
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:04,940
The Manhattan will never
display art in our halls again.

757
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:06,551
Oh, no.

758
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:09,902
What a crushing loss for our
hospital that is not a museum.

759
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,556
A partnership
with the Manhattan

760
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,861
could have
opened up partnerships

761
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,603
with the Philharmonic,
with the City Ballet,

762
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,953
with the Yankees,
and bam, New Amsterdam

763
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:20,521
is a brand that's ready
to change medicine.

764
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,567
You know what I hate
about the word "brand"?

765
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,916
Hmm?

766
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:25,744
It implies that whatever
you're doing

767
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:28,964
you wouldn't be doing it unless
the cameras were rolling.

768
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:32,533
That's not us. New Amsterdam
doesn't have a brand.

769
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,666
It has a creed. We help people.

770
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,668
And your little makeover
of our lobby--

771
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,931
Okay, enough,
enough with the lobby.

772
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,499
What is it with you
and this glorified hallway?

773
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:45,024
It tells our patients that
this hospital isn't yours,

774
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:48,941
and it isn't mine.
It's theirs, the Lenape plaque,

775
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:51,596
the COVID Memorial,
the Black Lives Matter mural.

776
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:54,903
All these things tell
our patients that this hospital

777
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,426
is for everyone.

778
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,125
And you are erasing that,
and you are erasing patients.

779
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,692
Well, if that's how
you really feel

780
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,607
maybe you shouldn't leave.
You know what?

781
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,957
If it means leaving
this hospital in your hands,

782
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,741
then maybe I won't.

783
