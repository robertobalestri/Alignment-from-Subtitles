00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,939
I'm his son, Your Honour.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,971
I can take care of him.

4
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:06,689
He can come home with me.

5
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,284
Why don't you answer
your phone?

6
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,448
I've called you, like,
a million times.

7
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:15,339
- I have not had a second...
- Mom kicked it.

8
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,960
Yeah. Like a date.

00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,965

18
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,231
Ah, check you out!

19
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:56,593
What did you do to my sink?

20
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:58,074
Upgrading it.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,222
Pop! Pop!

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,554
This is not an upgrade!

23
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:04,020
Your water pressure's
terrible.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,241
No, it wasn't!

25
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,763
Now I got to fix this.

26
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,421
What? Man, just look,
I'm soaking wet.

27
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:09,622
And don't touch anything else.

28
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:10,863
You want me to fix it or not?

29
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,769
I want you to not trash
my apartment.

30
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,507
I'm not the one
who overpaid for this place.

31
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,692
That's your problem.

32
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,094
I'm over here
doing you a favour.

33
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,894
A favor?

34
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,954
You know what?

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,194
I saw the building you manage.

36
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:23,001
No of fence, but don't do me
no favours, all right?

37
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:25,252
Just don't upgrade
anything else

38
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,720
until I get off work, please.

39
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,546
You might wanna change first.

40
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:52,037
Can't sleep.

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,972
Still in shock.

42
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,332
Instead of filling
that glass,

43
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,093
can you help me clean a few?

44
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:02,688
Was that really necessary,
Lauren?

45
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,642
Like, right now?

46
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:07,976
No.

47
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,545
Sorry.

48
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,171
I mean, are you even
mourning Mom, or...?

49
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,256
What?

50
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:16,675
Of course I'm mourning her.

51
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,558
Okay, well, you might be able
to completely shut down,

52
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,797
compartmentalise, and run off
to your little job...

53
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,001
Oh, because I have a job,

54
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,539
you think I don't care
that our mother is dead?

55
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:25,859
Whatever, Lauren,
I'm just saying,

56
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,686
I need time to process this,
all right?

57
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,089
This is, like...
This is, like, a loss.

58
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,865
I mean, Jesus,
I don't even know how this...

59
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,692
I don't even know
how this happened.

60
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,055
Right, yeah,
how could a 63-year-old

61
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,297
pill-popping, raging alcoholic
just fall down and die?

62
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,700
Quite easily, as it turns out.

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,541
And the way you adjust, Ness,

64
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,543
is by letting this
be a wake-up call.

65
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,281
Start taking responsibility
for your life.

66
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,028
Oh, my God, you can't
help yourself, can you?

67
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,566
You know, I thought
you weren't supposed to take

68
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,631
people's inventory
in whatever "A" you're in.

69
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,209
Can you just sober up
before we have the meeting

70
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,355
with the lawyer tonight?

71
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:56,796
And there it is... that is what

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,703
this is really about, Lauren,
isn't it?

73
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,879
Put on a united front
so they can crown you

74
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,523
the executor
of Mom's entire estate.

75
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,172
Right, well,
one of us has to be

76
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,156
the responsible one, right?

77
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,885
And I tell you this much,

78
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,101
I'm not going to enable you
the way Mom did.

79
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,536
No more allowance
so you can spend it on drugs.

80
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,138
No more free rent

81
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,836
so you can turn your place
into a crack den.

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,501
Nope, that all ends today.

83
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,503
So you can figure
something else out.

84
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:31,195
Hmm.

85
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,500
Mm.

86
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,523
Please?

87
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,676
Oh, Max, looking for you.

88
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:55,013
Always nice to see you,
Elizabeth.

89
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:56,239
You too.

90
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,760
So here.

91
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,283
The patient satisfaction
survey results.

92
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,604
Great.

93
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,781
Clearly you haven't
read them.

94
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,143
I have not,
but these are gonna be

95
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:05,368
a great distraction.

96
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:06,489
From what?

97
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,591
From myself.

98
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,695
Patient satisfaction surveys.

99
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,737
Wanna know your PSS scores?

100
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:16,179
- No.
- 44%.

101
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,262
Okay, you wanna know why
I get bad scores?

102
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,785
I've been compiling a list
over the years.

103
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,867
Last week, a woman complained

104
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,710
because the person next to her
was dying too loudly.

105
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,992
- Hmm.
- Dying too loudly!

106
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:31,315
- It's a hospital.
- Yeah, it is.

107
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,436
Keep up the great work.

108
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,763
- Floyd, just in time.
- For what?

109
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,926
The, uh, patient
satisfaction scores are in.

110
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,448
Your department received a...
Dr um roll, please...

111
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:45,689
51%.

112
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,772
Ugh. Sorry, man.

113
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,274
Oh, don't be. It's great.
Nailed it!

114
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:53,644
39%.

115
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,887
Your department officially has
the lowest score.

116
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,983
All of my patients
have cancer, Max.

117
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,598
Of course my department has
the lowest score.

118
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:02,684
Yeah, of course, great work.

119
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:07,687
Thank you.
I'll see you later, okay?

120
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,436
- Hmm. Oh, hey.
- Oh!

121
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,118
Iggy, just the man
I wanted to see.

122
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,570
Do you mind if I talk to you
about your PSS scores?

123
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,378
Oh, oh, all right.
Uh, what are we looking at?

124
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,925
Some high-60s, mid-70s? What?

125
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,027
Actually, it's, um...

126
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:25,023
It's 91%.

127
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,887
- It's 91%?
- Mm.

128
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,774
- That-that's huge.
- Mm.

129
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,111
That's a new record. Yes!
Up top!

130
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,617
No, no, not up top.
That number is terrible.

131
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:35,581
Uh, 91% satisfaction
is terrible?

132
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:36,664
Correct.

133
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,589
Satisfaction is not really
our goal, health is.

134
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:41,527
I think if we were
selling smoothies or Slinkys,

135
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:43,484
then these patient
satisfaction surveys

136
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,286
would be a great barometer
of how we were doing that,

137
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,713
but our patients come
to New Amsterdam

138
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,475
on arguably the worst day
of their life,

139
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,958
where we tell them things
they really don't wanna hear.

140
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,080
So I think if they are
"satisfied,"

141
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,122
then that means
we're doing something wrong,

142
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,204
or we're asking
the wrong questions.

143
00:06:58,304 --> 00:06:59,644
- Does it really now?
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:01,327
"Were you greeted
with a smile?"

145
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,484
Really?

146
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,752
"Did you enjoy the décor?"
Honestly, who cares?

147
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,396
Since my entire department's
grant funding

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,221
is directly tied
to these scores...

149
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:09,896
Which are stellar...

150
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,537
- I care.
- Good!

151
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:13,019
I'm glad you do. I care too.

152
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,996
That's why I'm changing
the survey.

153
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,622
What? No, no. What? No!

154
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,303
Just to be more accurate.

155
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,986
More honest questions
means more honest answers.

156
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,388
- Max... Max!
- Iggy.

157
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,925
If we're not improving,
we're failing.

158
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,992
You'll thank me later.

159
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:27,234
Hiya Diallo,
12-year-old female.

160
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,675
Bike accident, head trauma.
LOC on the scene.

161
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,879
Avi Diallo, 17-year-old male.

162
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,761
Elbow contusions,
multiple skin abrasions.

163
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,002
Please help my sister!

164
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:36,403
A car swerved
into our bike lane.

165
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:37,404
I tried to help her...

166
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,485
It's okay. It's okay.
We got it.

167
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:39,663
Both pupils are sluggish.

168
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,749
She needs a head CT stat.
Let's move.

169
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,377
Avi. How you feeling?

170
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:51,138
How's my sister?

171
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,380
Did she wake up?

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,821
She sustained
a significant amount of trauma

173
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,223
to the right side of her brain.

174
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:59,346
She has what's called
a subdural hematoma,

175
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,110
which means there's bleeding
in her brain from the fall.

176
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,193
She also has paralysis
of the left arm.

177
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:07,075
Look, she needs surgery
right away

178
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,497
to avoid a brain herniation
that could be fatal.

179
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,274
No, eh, I...

180
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,536
Now, are your parents
at home?

181
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,445
Are they at work?

182
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,603
We need to notify them
right away.

183
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:19,460
You can't... they're in,
um, Cancun.

184
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,670
Vacationing.

185
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,351
Okay, can we get
their number?

186
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:27,045
No, no.

187
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,313
- Ah, name of the hotel?
- No.

188
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:31,940
They-they check in
when they can.

189
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,662
But if they call
when you do the surgery,

190
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,544
I'll update them.

191
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,388
Okay. Uh, thanks, Avi.

192
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,892
I'm gonna go check on Hiya.
And be right back, okay?

193
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,507
Dr. Turan, can you call

194
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,419
Child Protective Services
for me?

195
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,361
Why? What's going on?

196
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,599
Nothing that kid
is telling me is true.

197
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,845
Oh, you trying
to win a sister over

198
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,575
- with sugar now, huh?
- Hey, trying?

199
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,297
I thought I already had.

200
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,779
Uh, although I am sorry for all
the back-and-forth lately.

201
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,502
Ever since my pops moved in,
things have been out of whack.

202
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:16,346
But maybe, just maybe,
we can make up for lost time.

203
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:18,909
Or maybe the time we had
was enough.

204
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,206
I'm supposed to be
leaving soon, anyway.

205
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,471
Yeah, you keep saying that.

206
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,552
Excuse me.

207
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:26,116
Uh, you looking
for the OB department?

208
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,038
Yes, I need to give up
my baby.

209
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:30,240
Oh, are you, uh, in labor?

210
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,562
Mm-mm.

211
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,964
Do you need to talk
to a hospital social worker

212
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,205
about the adoption process?

213
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,167
No.

214
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,210
I need my baby
to be delivered today.

215
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,333
Otherwise, I'm gonna kill it.

216
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,105
And for you.

217
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,703
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,789
- Are these the new surveys?
- Sure are. There you go.

219
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:02,015
And remember,
complete candour is welcome.

220
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,188
And for you.

221
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,353
Hey, hey.
Are you seeing this?

222
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,359
Are you doing the surveys
over the phone?

223
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,859
Max told me to call.

224
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,925
Call who?

225
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,987
Every patient we have.

226
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,009
And there you go.

227
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,812
Hi, Maureen.
I'm ready for you.

228
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,253
Sorry, Iggy,
don't want to bias the results.

229
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:24,649
- Uh...
- Here we go.

230
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,080
Gladys, you're better
than that.

231
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,282
Fill that out.
One through five.

232
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,204
Just fill whatever feels right.

233
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,326
Go ahead and mark that down.

234
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,688
Uh-huh.

235
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,570
Almost there, Dr. Frome.

236
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,292
Just need to finish
this survey.

237
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,919
Turns out I got a lot to say.

238
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,783
Bob, Louise,
thank you for coming.

239
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,002
Skip the preamble.
Just tell me how long.

240
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,481
Whatever time I have left,
I wanna spend

241
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,347
as little time as possible
in this office.

242
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,265
She'd tell you
if you stop talking.

243
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:57,232
Okay, so-so I actually,
I have some good news.

244
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,372
I just got your numbers.

245
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:02,878
And they're what?

246
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:04,680
They are phenomenal.

247
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,602
Your cancer
has shrunk dramatically.

248
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,364
Uh, now I get
to tell you something

249
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,487
that I don't get to say
often enough.

250
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,790
You're looking
at a full remission.

251
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:22,057
I told you, Louise.
I told you!

252
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,540
A miracle occurs,
and the first thing you do

253
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,541
is yell at your wife.

254
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,223
Real nice, Bob. Real nice.

255
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:28,744
Sour grapes?

256
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:30,830
- Mm...
- I'm relieved, okay?

257
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,628
What the hell's wrong with you?

258
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:36,352
Uh, a cancer diagnosis
is stressful on everyone.

259
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:38,114
Even good news
can be hard to accept

260
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,515
after months of chemotherapy.

261
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,010
But that's where
you're wrong.

262
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,932
I haven't had months of chemo

263
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,255
because I've been throwing

264
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,882
your stupid pills
in the garbage.

265
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,268
Straight into the trash.

266
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,015
Against his wife's wishes.

267
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,848
Okay, hold on, you have been
throwing away your chemo pills?

268
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:53,589
They made me feel sick,
so I stopped taking 'em.

269
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:56,172
And now? I'm not sick.

270
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,306
You doctors, acting so fancy.

271
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,656
You have no clue.

272
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,728
Just a bunch of puppets
for Big Pharma.

273
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:03,620
Mr. Levin, Mr. Levin...

274
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,218
Yeah, save it
for the next sucker.

275
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,524
Come on, Louise.

276
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,947
Mm-mm. Rise up!

277
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,029
- Take off the blinders!
- Apologies. Again.

278
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:14,849
- Get out of the chair!
- He gets crazy.

279
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,135
Bob!

280
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:29,286
Olivette, I know you
don't want to harm your baby.

281
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:32,490
Um, you wouldn't be here
if you did.

282
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,592
So you wanna tell us
what's going on?

283
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,915
Olivette, when was
your last prenatal visit?

284
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,401
Uh...

285
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:46,404
I haven't gone to any.

286
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,847
You're afraid
you'd be judged?

287
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,252
Are you still using?

288
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:02,142
I stopped once I found out
I was pregnant.

289
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,503
Okay, so you intended
to keep the baby.

290
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:06,605
Yes.

291
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,470
The baby was gonna be
my new chapter.

292
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:16,615
I'd be clean.

293
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:19,378
Like the best mom, you know?

294
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:21,480
But...

295
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,143
Then you went back out.

296
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,704
About a week ago.

297
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,467
First time in months.

298
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,811
Okay, so what changed?

299
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:38,057
Didn't need anything
to change.

300
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:41,441
It's what I do.

301
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,523
Knew it was gonna happen
eventually.

302
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,165
No family, friends?

303
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,595
Any support?

304
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:51,351
None out here.

305
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,661
Olivette, you slipped.

306
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:02,903
It happens. That's all.

307
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,664
Nah, that ain't
the end of it.

308
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,907
I'm gonna keep using,
I know it.

309
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,309
And when was the last time
that you felt the baby kick?

310
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,591
Any movement?

311
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,152
I don't know, a few days ago.

312
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,696
Maybe.

313
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,874
I heard 26 weeks is safe
for a baby to be born.

314
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,961
Is that true or not?

315
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:23,964
Technically, yes, uh,

316
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,563
the baby can survive
at six months.

317
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:30,251
- But you're not in labor, and...
- I don't care.

318
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,073
It's not safe with me.

319
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,204
I need it out.

320
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,881
Avi.

321
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:52,714
Hiya's stable.

322
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,636
They're gonna be taking her
for surgery soon.

323
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:57,078
She is? Thank you.

324
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,563
While they're prepping her,
I need you to come with me.

325
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,770
There's someone who I want you
to talk to, okay?

326
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,475
You called them.

327
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,438
CPS.

328
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:20,150
Okay, as a doctor,
I am mandated by the state

329
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,664
to report
any suspicious behaviour.

330
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:24,627
What suspicious behaviour?

331
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,729
Are your parents really
in Cancun?

332
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,873
Is Hiya even your sister?

333
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,233
Yes.

334
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,635
Okay.

335
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,737
That's a start.

336
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,774
Look, I wanna help you, okay?

337
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,938
But you need to come with me.

338
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:42,095
Sure.

339
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:43,685
All right.

340
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,762
Just let me get my bag?

341
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,595
Don't...

342
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,697
Avi. Avi, Avi, don't do this.

343
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,781
You said you'd help us!
You lied!

344
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,829
Avi. Avi, come on.

345
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,905
- Open the door.
- I can't.

346
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:05,068
Look, this isn't helping...
Hiya or you!

347
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,229
We can't be in the system.
They'll separate us!

348
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,032
Master key.
You want me to call security?

349
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,073
No, no.

350
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,675
Look, Avi.

351
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,758
Avi, we're coming in.

352
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,440
Damn it, Avi!

353
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,144
- What's-what's happening?
- Avi. Avi, she's crashing.

354
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,625
We have to get her up
to the OR right now.

355
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,371
No. Turn off the alarm!

356
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,772
I can't do it from out here!

357
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:30,298
I know you're doing this!
I know it's a trick!

358
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:31,724
No! This is real!

359
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:34,010
Look, if you don't
let us in there right now,

360
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,891
then your sister
is going to die!

361
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,267
Get her up to the OR stat!

362
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:49,947
Hot off the presses
and straight

363
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:51,429
into a hermetically
sealed envelope.

364
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:54,538
Are you ready
for your new PSS scores?

365
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,307
It's no the Oscars, Max.
Just open the damn thing.

366
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,795
And the Oscar goes to...

367
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,709
36%.

368
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,705
Th... oh, my God.

369
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,307
No. This can't be happening.

370
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,760
Now you have honest feedback
to make real improvement.

371
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:11,322
Max, my funding will be cut.

372
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,822
Okay, listen to this.

373
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,312
"My new meds made me feel sick,

374
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,539
and I couldn't get a follow-up
for a month."

375
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,496
"When I'm in crisis,
I don't want to wait a week

376
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,744
for my next appointment."

377
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,034
"I had to wait three months
to get my first appointment."

378
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,463
Now, if you're asking me,

379
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,084
seems like the unifying factor
here is wait time.

380
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,511
Great... so are you
gonna spring

381
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,752
for ten new therapists?

382
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,066
I don't know
if it's a staffing issue.

383
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,293
Seems more like
a scheduling issue.

384
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:34,011
Okay, sure,
but you know that scheduling

385
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,278
will never be perfect because
it's not like a patient

386
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:38,120
can predict
a mental health crisis.

387
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,440
You know that, right?

388
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,324
I do,
and I couldn't agree more.

389
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:43,326
- Good. Really?
- Yeah.

390
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,463
You're saying
that mental health

391
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,129
is inherently unschedule-able,

392
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,211
so why not toss the whole
schedule out the window?

393
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:49,668
Right, no more appointments,
first come, first serve.

394
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,214
I think that's really smart,
buddy.

395
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:53,616
Uh, hi, can I have the room
for a second, please?

396
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,422
Max.

397
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,304
No appointments will be
wildly disruptive

398
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,681
- to my department, okay?
- Yeah.

399
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,387
My patients rely heavily
on structure.

400
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:05,428
Uh-huh.

401
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:06,565
The predictability
and reliability

402
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:07,887
of scheduled appointments
is everything...

403
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,353
Routine is the cornerstone
of their mental health.

404
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,315
Iggy, I hear you,
but this isn't me, okay?

405
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,637
This is the survey.

406
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,479
This is what
your patients want.

407
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,533
You know what?

408
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,659
I actually can't even discuss
this with you right now.

409
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:18,885
Why? Why not?

410
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:20,607
Because you didn't make
an appointment.

411
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,022
See what I did there? Wouldn't
it be nice if you could just

412
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,047
show up with your problems

413
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,345
and get help when you need it?

414
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,491
That's the beauty
of open access,

415
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,620
and some of these patients
need help today,

416
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:31,924
Iggy, not in three weeks
on a Tuesday at 4:00 p.m.

417
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,247
So what do you say
we give it a shot?

418
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,751
- What's the worst that could...
- No, don't... don't.

419
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,016
Don't say it.

420
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,449
Okay. That's fair. Yeah.

421
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,069
If I may be candid,

422
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:46,791
there are parts of Bob

423
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,353
that have definitely
gotten smaller with age.

424
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,517
But I didn't know cancer
worked that way.

425
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:55,480
Spontaneous remission
is extremely rare,

426
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,137
but yeah, his cancer's
definitely shrunk.

427
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,405
I just gotta figure out how
because either it's a fluke,

428
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,168
or Bob has inadvertently
found a cure for his cancer.

429
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,689
Oh, please don't
tell him that.

430
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,531
That will definitely go
to his head.

431
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:09,414
Nothing is easy with that man.
Ever.

432
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:12,437
But I love him,
even in spite of his behaviour.

433
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,821
Finding out you have cancer
is never easy.

434
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,183
Oh, please, I know
several people with cancer

435
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,560
who aren't going
through the same

436
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:23,468
mortality-induced mania
that Bob's going through.

437
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:24,990
Can you be more specific?

438
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,554
Trading in our Volvo
for a cherry red Miata, fine.

439
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:30,796
I expect him to do that
around this age.

440
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:33,279
And while the spray tans
are unsettling,

441
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,880
I can literally
look the other way.

442
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,243
But spending hundreds
of dollars a month

443
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,765
on vitamins and elixirs

444
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:42,528
instead of taking the meds
prescribed to him by a doctor

445
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,850
is ridiculous, even for him.

446
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,733
Hang-hang on, what kind
of vitamins and elixirs?

447
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,535
Oh, they all
have crazy names.

448
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,738
Are you ready for this, Ben?

449
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:54,020
"Horny goat weed."

450
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,743
Tell me that's not a scam.

451
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,761
Can you bring me everything
that Bob has been taking?

452
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,266
Everything?

453
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,790
Yes. Everything.

454
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:13,079
I waited too long.

455
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,182
Opening the door.

456
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,285
Well,
she's in good hands now.

457
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,170
It was working.

458
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,775
We were doing really good,
you know?

459
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,877
Until today.

460
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,722
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

461
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,790
Both our parents died
of COVID.

462
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,892
Two years ago.

463
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,016
I'm really sorry.

464
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,579
We couldn't visit.

465
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,483
We couldn't say goodbye.

466
00:20:55,583 --> 00:21:00,628
They just went to the hospital
and never came home.

467
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,173
What about other family?

468
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,275
Grandparents?

469
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,939
Hiya and I decided
to stay together.

470
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,021
Figured if we go to school,

471
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:17,546
stay under the radar,
no one would split us up.

472
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:20,949
I turn 18 in a few months.

473
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,352
Old enough to be her guardian.

474
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,454
What about you?

475
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,017
What about me?

476
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:32,321
Who's taking care of you,
Avi?

477
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,489
So since this is
your first prenatal exam,

478
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,267
we're just gonna check
the health of the baby

479
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,393
and make sure
we can induce labor.

480
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,860
Is that the heart?

481
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,381
That is the heart.

482
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,484
- Nice and strong.
- Mm.

483
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,568
Can I hear it?

484
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,731
Sure.

485
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,181
Would you like to know
the sex?

486
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:15,245
Yes. And no.

487
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,407
So hey, how about this?

488
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,509
Write it down for you.

489
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,935
Whenever you're ready.
Or not.

490
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:29,900
Is there any intrauterine
growth restriction?

491
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,583
- None that I can tell, why?
- What's going on?

492
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:35,105
The baby seems small.

493
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,190
How far along are you again?

494
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,911
26 weeks.

495
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,834
- Since your last cycle?
- I guess.

496
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:46,056
Take a femur length
measurement.

497
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,846
That's 23 weeks.
It's off by 3.

498
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,362
So...

499
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:55,240
so what does that mean?

500
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,944
That would mean
that your-your baby's

501
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:58,609
too premature for us
to induce labor.

502
00:22:58,709 --> 00:22:59,691
If we were to do it now,

503
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,093
it probably wouldn't even
survive.

504
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:03,991
You're gonna have to carry
another three to four weeks.

505
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:05,376
No.

506
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,698
No, that's impossible.

507
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,800
I can't. I know what I am.

508
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,503
- I'm an addict.
- Yeah, I know.

509
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,944
Well, we can get you
into rehab.

510
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:15,987
I've done more using in rehab
than I do on the streets.

511
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:18,390
No, you're not listening to me.
I can't do this!

512
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,007
- No, I can't do this!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

513
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,474
- No, I can't do this!
- Call security!

514
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,356
- Seriously?
- Security? What for?

515
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:25,557
Floyd, don't do this.

516
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:26,638
Well, she's not giving us
a choice.

517
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,016
Look, I'm gonna put you
on a psych hold.

518
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,217
You're not gonna be able
to leave the hospital.

519
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:30,522
No! Why?

520
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:33,325
Reckless endangerment
of an unborn child.

521
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:35,547
Call security!

522
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,516
Hey, I have a
scheduled appointment.

523
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:42,318
- But I was here first.
- I know, I know.

524
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:43,935
Uh, everybody, that's...
Hey, that's enough!

525
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,019
That is enough!

526
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,059
Please form a line to the right
of the hallway.

527
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:49,045
Yeah, but what am I supposed
to do with this?

528
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,026
Are you the person
to give the survey to?

529
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,081
Just asking.
Thank you very much.

530
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,198
Have a good day.

531
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,735
Hey, hi, hi.

532
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,032
Do you have a scheduling nurse

533
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,473
that I can borrow
just for a little bit?

534
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:02,819
I'm drowning up there.

535
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,100
How'd you get so buried?

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,062
Uh, Max. How else, you know?

537
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:07,784
He forced me
to institute open access,

538
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:10,306
and now my department
is just flipped upside-down,

539
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,148
all because of a stupid survey,
you know?

540
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,990
Love the guy,
but I just wanna...

541
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,207
Wanna strangle him sometimes.

542
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,993
He's just over-asking
and over-promising

543
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:19,956
and over-everything.

544
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:21,918
Tell me about it.

545
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:24,060
Oh, yeah?
Why, what'd he do to you?

546
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,005
You can ask Nurse Colleen.
She's available.

547
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,607
Yes, yes, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

548
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,345
Somebody having
a mid-life crisis down here?

549
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,531
All you're missing
is the toupee.

550
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,053
Thank you. Thanks again.

551
00:24:57,335 --> 00:24:59,213
So you're actually
committing a pregnant woman

552
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,278
like she's a criminal.

553
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:02,040
I never said
she's a criminal.

554
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,401
Though, by her own admission,

555
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,843
she's a threat to herself
and her unborn child.

556
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:08,166
Is this Gilead?
Give me a break.

557
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,128
Look, I'm giving the patient
what she wants,

558
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:13,812
which is... stapler...
A chance for her child.

559
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,013
Then tell me this:

560
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,135
Could a woman in New York,
if need be,

561
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,738
terminate her pregnancy
at 23 weeks?

562
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:20,979
Yes.

563
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,236
And would she be detained
for it?

564
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,262
Oh, come on,
this isn't a life sentence.

565
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:26,745
Olivette will only be held
until she reaches 26 weeks.

566
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,828
And what about the baby?
Become a ward of the state?

567
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,045
Because good luck
finding someone

568
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,791
to adopt a 26-week-old preemie.

569
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:34,553
Okay, I am not
the bad guy here.

570
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:36,931
But you are stacking the odds
against this baby from day one.

571
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,134
Okay, don't you think I know
all the societal challenges

572
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:40,439
for babies like hers?

573
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,161
Detaining Olivette
is not ideal,

574
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,778
- but I'm listening to the...
- Are you?

575
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:44,844
- Are you fully listening?
- Yes.

576
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,325
I'm trying to save a child.

577
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,808
But you're gonna fail if you
can't save the mother first.

578
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:09,689
Avi.

579
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,396
So we're gonna keep Hiya
for a few more days,

580
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:19,339
but we are expecting her
to make a full recovery.

581
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,985
Thank you.

582
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,368
Avi...

583
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:31,652
look, this isn't gonna be easy
for you to hear,

584
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:33,453
but once she's discharged,

585
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,616
Hiya is gonna become
a ward of the state.

586
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:37,458
No! She can't.

587
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:39,660
I-I can do better.
I can take care of her.

588
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,142
I know you can. I know.

589
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:44,525
That's not what
this is about, okay?

590
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,649
Look, Hiya's injuries
were physical.

591
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,993
We could fix those.

592
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,215
But you have injuries too.

593
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:59,500
You do, and people might not
be able to see them.

594
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:03,604
But that doesn't mean
they're not there.

595
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,707
What are you saying?

596
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,611
New Amsterdam Hospital
has a mental health department

597
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,053
which specialises
in child traumatic grief...

598
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:14,215
No. No. Mm-mm. No.

599
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,458
Wait, just listen to me.
Just listen to me.

600
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:17,899
Okay?

601
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,622
They can give you the support
that you need.

602
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,626
And eventually,
you can move forward.

603
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,510
And in a couple of months,
when you turn 18,

604
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,552
I really think
you're gonna be better.

605
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:32,354
I do.

606
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:35,037
And ready...
Ready to take in Hiya.

607
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:38,320
And be her guardian.

608
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,682
In the truest sense
of the word.

609
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:40,883
Come here.

610
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,815
Hey, Max.

611
00:27:52,915 --> 00:27:57,099
I have the, uh, new test score
right here.

612
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,541
5%.

613
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:01,104
- 5% increase?
- No, no. No. Take a look.

614
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:04,187
That's a 5% total score.

615
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:05,588
- Ah.
- Yeah.

616
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:08,271
That is the single lowest score
in the history

617
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:11,234
of any department
at this hospital... ever.

618
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:14,277
The last record-holder
was Rikers.

619
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:17,921
I am losing out to jail.

620
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:19,779
But isn't open access better
for the patients?

621
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:21,124
Better for the patients?

622
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:23,927
You saw the "last helicopter
out of Saigon" scenario

623
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:25,248
in my waiting room, right?

624
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:27,090
You were there?

625
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,294
My staff spent the entire day
just, uh,

626
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:33,176
careening from one
upset patient to the next.

627
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,259
That's all they had time to do
all day.

628
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,116
Well, isn't it better
to inconvenience a few

629
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,103
- for the greater...
- No. No! It's not, Max.

630
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:40,280
It's not better for anybody.

631
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,948
I have followed you around
for years,

632
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:45,309
a cheerleader just watching you

633
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,127
casually knock everything down,
but not anymore.

634
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:49,033
My department was working.

635
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,474
And it was working well!

636
00:28:50,574 --> 00:28:52,676
And now your insistence
on treating everybody

637
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:55,079
all at the same time
is working for nobody.

638
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,961
My staff included.

639
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,603
So no, I am not gonna go along

640
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,486
with your little
Quixotic experiment anymore.

641
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,768
All right, why can't you just
leave well enough alone?

642
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,970
We have a good thing going,
Max.

643
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,052
You ruined it.

644
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:10,154
Why?

645
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,919
You're right.

646
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,922
Do what you have to do.

647
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,643
Thank you.

648
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,830
All right, are you
sure that this is everything

649
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,799
that you've been taking
for your...

650
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:38,501
- Breakdown?
- Holistic healing journey?

651
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,779
Yes.

652
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:41,965
What is this,
some kind of shakedown?

653
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,433
Were you taking a drug
known as antoderide?

654
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:49,998
What's it for?

655
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:51,624
- For hair loss.
- Why would I take that?

656
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,555
Bob, we can all see
the giant bald spot

657
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,782
on the back of your head.

658
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,869
Ben has a perfect view.

659
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,183
Then fine, I'm taking it.
So what?

660
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:03,055
I wanted to feel young
for however long I had left.

661
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,149
Sue me.

662
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:06,176
Dr. Wilder,
is that drug the reason

663
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:07,883
that his tumour shrank?

664
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,524
Not a lot of people
know this,

665
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,352
but Viagra was first invented
to treat hypertension.

666
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,219
For the record,
I'm not on Viagra.

667
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:15,044
Yet.

668
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:16,471
- Louise.
- What?

669
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:19,687
But when the company realised
that they had a gold mine

670
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:21,133
for treating
erectile dysfunction,

671
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,239
they rebranded it.

672
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:24,306
My point here
is that sometimes,

673
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:26,093
discoveries are made
on accident,

674
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,640
and you... you, Bob,
you're living proof

675
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,285
that antoderide
has this amazing side effect

676
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:34,102
of treating Gonsalves' tumours.

677
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:36,690
So my hair medication
will get rebranded?

678
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:37,883
Will that make it
more expensive?

679
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,068
- Bob!
- What?

680
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,790
It's not all about you.

681
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,191
No. No, no, no, no, no.

682
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,273
Your cancer is so rare,

683
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:45,571
it just doesn't make a lot
of financial sense,

684
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:48,878
but there is an organisation
that logs drugs

685
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:52,442
with unexpected and potentially
lifesaving side effects.

686
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,564
So with your permission,

687
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:57,167
I would like to share
your numbers with them.

688
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,975
Well, if it'll help humanity
and whatnot, sure.

689
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,077
Glad to help.

690
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,232
- Hey.
- Hey.

691
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,335
Uh...

692
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:26,997
Just wanted
to officially apologise

693
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:29,840
for forcing open access on you.

694
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,443
It was, uh, clearly a bust,

695
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:35,126
and I-I don't blame you
for switching back.

696
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,888
Well, I didn't switch back.

697
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,169
- No?
- No. Kept it.

698
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,451
- You kept it?
- Yeah, we kept it.

699
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,094
Exhibit A,
you just waltzed right in

700
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,231
and started talking,
didn't you?

701
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:46,177
Uh, yeah, I did, but you...

702
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:48,139
I thought it was a disaster.

703
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,436
Yeah, it was more like
a train wreck,

704
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,783
but, uh, you know,
once we sorted through

705
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:55,186
the rather size able backlog
of patients in our system,

706
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:57,349
um, open access
actually integrated

707
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,551
pretty seamlessly into our
existing scheduling model.

708
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,594
Appointments in the morning,
walk-ins in the afternoon.

709
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:05,036
Wow, so it's-it's working.

710
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:08,080
Well, I had a patient today

711
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,521
that had all but given up

712
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,283
on scheduling appointments
altogether.

713
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:12,900
You know, she works at a few
different restaurants,

714
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:15,047
picks up shifts,
doesn't know her schedule

715
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,129
till the night before,
and when she found out

716
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,532
that she could just walk in
when she was free,

717
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:22,493
we had a great session...

718
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:24,072
One that wouldn't have
been possible yesterday,

719
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:27,099
so yeah, it's working.

720
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:29,201
- Thank you.
- Knock knock.

721
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,546
Hot off the presses.
New survey scores.

722
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:34,803
Oh, my God,
you're killing me.

723
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,468
- Ready for this?
- No.

724
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,752
Here we go.

725
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:42,275
Okay, buddy.
Survey says...

726
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,778
Oof.

727
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:47,800
It's 53%.

728
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,604
Congratulations.

729
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,706
Thank you.

730
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,049
53%.

731
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:00,012
Well, Max, you were right.

732
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,454
Less satisfaction,
but better health.

733
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:14,268
You know,
I usually pride myself

734
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,871
in listening to my patients,

735
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:22,156
and what I, uh, heard from you

736
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:25,439
is that because
of your addiction,

737
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,962
you believe that
you lack the capacity

738
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,763
to safely bring your baby
to term.

739
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,766
And I get it.

740
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,769
You know? That takes courage.

741
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,892
But for nearly six months,

742
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:40,534
you had it... courage.

743
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:43,458
Hey, it took courage
just showing up here

744
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,461
and asking for help
in the first place.

745
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:49,344
But you know what else I heard?

746
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,065
I heard from you
that it's hard,

747
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,988
maintaining this on your own.

748
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,750
So my question for you,
Olivette,

749
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,392
is if you were capable,

750
00:33:57,492 --> 00:34:01,156
if you had the support
that you needed,

751
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,258
would you continue
with your pregnancy?

752
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,761
Oh, no, hey. No, I'm serious.

753
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:09,664
In your heart, would you want
to carry your baby to term?

754
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:16,031
Yes.

755
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:17,933
Okay.

756
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,936
Okay, so instead
of committing you

757
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:23,338
until you can safely deliver,

758
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:26,021
I'm gonna make a commitment
to you

759
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:28,183
so that you can.

760
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,426
Now, you're gonna need
prenatal care,

761
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,149
proper nutrition,
birthing classes,

762
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:34,670
birthing coach,

763
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,752
and you're also gonna need
to stay clean.

764
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,834
That's most important.

765
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,438
Now, I know none of this
will be easy, Olivette,

766
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,081
so this time,
you're gonna have something

767
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:46,162
you didn't have before.

768
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:47,844
A sisterhood.

769
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:50,687
Because if you need to go
to a meeting or an appointment,

770
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:52,088
I'm gonna go with you.

771
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:56,412
And if Gabrielle can't,
I'm there for you.

772
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:00,216
And if neither of these
wonderful women are available,

773
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:02,899
we've got nine others
in this hospital

774
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,222
who are pledging to step in.

775
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:07,103
And not just for you...

776
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,385
For any other pregnant woman

777
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,487
who might be struggling
on their own.

778
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,888
And you still got that little
piece of paper he gave you?

779
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:30,608
- A girl.
- Ooh.

780
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,249
Looks like
she's gonna be a part

781
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,651
of this sisterhood too.

782
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:44,222
Hi, I'm home. Hey.

783
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,783
Oh, hey, just in time.

784
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:48,346
I... oh, I was fading.

785
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,468
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

786
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:54,232
Oh, there was a tiff
this evening.

787
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:57,755
Um, Saleem accused Raffi of,

788
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,279
and I quote,
"Being really extra."

789
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:03,682
Yeah, that is a lot
coming from Saleem.

790
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:04,883
Right? Uh, yeah.

791
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:08,286
But on the plus side,
it exhausted everyone,

792
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:09,944
and now they're peaceful,
sleeping angels.

793
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,209
Okay.

794
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:12,851
Chicken quesadillas
in the fridge.

795
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:29,188
Okay, I think
we've covered all aspects

796
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,629
of the amended trust,

797
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:33,152
and you are clear on your role
as executor, Lauren?

798
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,434
- I am.
- Good.

799
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,696
Then that just leaves
the distribution of assets.

800
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,640
"As my eldest daughter, Lauren,

801
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,922
"worked tirelessly
to help me in life,

802
00:36:43,022 --> 00:36:44,644
"in death, I, Jean Marie Bloom,

803
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,648
"bequeath my entire estate,
valued at over $7 million,

804
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,731
to my youngest daughter,
Vanessa Pageant Bloom."

805
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:01,261
Uh...

806
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:03,363
well.

807
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:07,295
Don't know about you,
Counsellor, but, um,

808
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:10,250
I could use a drink.

809
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,119
Dad?

810
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

811
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,084
Fixed everything up?

812
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,286
Yeah.

813
00:37:26,386 --> 00:37:28,569
Was nothing I couldn't handle.

814
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,973
Guess I shouldn't have
doubted you.

815
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:35,376
So what's in the bag?

816
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:37,298
- What, this bag?
- Yeah.

817
00:37:37,398 --> 00:37:39,380
Oh, just a little

818
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,382
New York Noodletown
sumthin'-sumthin'.

819
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:44,225
Ooh.
You got the kung pao shrimp?

820
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:46,067
Is water wet?

821
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,708
That reminds me.

822
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,046
I got a couple things
I wanna do

823
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,391
in that bathroom of yours.

824
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:51,793
- Oh, don't tell me that.
- Hush.

825
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:53,290
I just wanna re-caulk
around the sink.

826
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:54,996
Put in a a new shower head.

827
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:57,098
Earn my keep around here.

828
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,082
Sounds good, Pop.

829
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:02,804
All right then.

830
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,906
All right.

831
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:09,010
All right, just gonna...

832
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,112
Can't we say grace?

833
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,176
Yeah.
