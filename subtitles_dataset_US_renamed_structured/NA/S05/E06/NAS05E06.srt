I'ma need you to come in
to New Amsterdam tomorrow

3
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:13,125
so we can come up
with a plan for treatment.

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:14,604
I don't wanna do any of that.

5
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:18,140
I got a condition.
I gotta make some calls!

6
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,308
Three years sober.
Wow, that's impressive.

7
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:24,658
And the real villain
of your life is Mom.

8
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:25,876
It's not me.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,052
Where are you going?

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,705
To get high.

11
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,490
Well, if that's really true,

12
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,906
then...

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,658
what are we doing?

14
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,096
I don't know.

15
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,226
I can't be
who I want to be...

16
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:42,296
with you.

17
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,293
The key to our appreciation
is looking deeply

18
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:53,466
and asking yourself...

19
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:56,921
How does it make you feel?

20
00:00:57,694 --> 00:00:58,873
Hmm?

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,305
Uh, yeah...

22
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,952
No, nothing.

23
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,266
Tell me about it.

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,615
I've been on three of these,

25
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:09,790
and I haven't
hooked up anyone.

26
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:12,836
No, I'm not here
looking for a date.

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,537
I'm... no, I'm here... I wanna
broaden my horizons, you know?

28
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,408
Find out what I like,
what I don't like,

29
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:20,888
what I connect with,
where I belong.

30
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:22,278

Ho-ho-ho!

59
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,224
- You're glowing.
- 8,000 feet up,

60
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,486
- closer to the sun.
- I'm dying to see

61

even the finger flint.

did you have?

64
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,145

70
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,200
He's not a member
of the Royal family,

71
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:56,636
and this isn't a red carpet.

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,575
- You miss me?
- Bay four.

73
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,206
Oh, so you gonna play it
like this?

74
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,294
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,687

00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,906
You missed me.

77
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,603
I didn't even realize
you were gone.

78
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,649
And yet you happened
to pick up bagels

79
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,607
from my favorite bagel place.

80
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,219

bagels that I happened

to pick up for no particular
reason whatsoever.

84

There's no soliciting

all right?

119
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,383

They're in pain.

The last thing they need
is some two-bit sleazy lawyer

123
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,521
- preying on them.
- Yeah, sleazy two-bit lawyer

124
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,957
who specializes

125
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,307

- Don't say that.

128

Hey, you paged?

133
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:53,813
Uh, Rafael here thought

134
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,336
he could take down
a speeding car.

135
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,729
Tough odds, kid.

136
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,034
No bleeding,
so bone didn't break the skin.

137
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,601
But I am still worried
about a fracture.

138
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,429
Okay, no problem.
We'll X-ray to confirm.

139
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,953
But, uh, looks like you
definitely will need

140
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:04,998
a cast for that arm.

141
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,826
No, I can't do that.

pool party's this weekend.

143

doesn't go in the water.

144
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,397
- Oh...
- Doctor, is there anyone

145
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,835
in the hospital suffering
as much as poor Rafael?

146
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,561
- Grandma...
- "Oh, no, this is the worst

147
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,187
- I've ever seen."
- Hey.

148
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,407
Well, you'll still get to
stick your legs in the pool.

149
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,844
- It's not the same.
- Ah....

150
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,672
All right, well,
let's get you up.

151
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,148
We can wait
for Rafael upstairs.

152
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,980
Ah... aah!

153
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:33,418
- Let's get her down.
- Grandma? What's going on?

154
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,854
- Is she okay?
- Let's get her right here.

155
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:35,768
Ah...

156
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,476
Let's get her to Trauma One.

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,100
Come on, sweetie.

158
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:49,683
No!

159
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:51,120
Hey, bud...

160
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,654
- Do the big breaths.
- Let's do the thing.

161
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,439
Baby, look at me.
Listen to me.

162
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:55,701
Baby, look at my mouth.
Look at my mouth.

163
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,568
Remember?

164
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,929
Remember? Do that.

165
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,532
- Hi, sorry, Doc.
- Hi.

166
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,534
- Uh, Josh and Chary, Jael.
- Hi.

167
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:04,100
This is why we're here.

168
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,102
That's okay.
This is why I'm here.

169
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:06,920
No!

170
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,538
Uh, Jael was
a perfectly happy baby

171
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:10,977
until about two years ago,
and then...

172
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,371
it just keeps getting worse
every year.

173
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:16,265
We know... baby, shh.
Hey, it's okay.

174
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,462
Ever since starting school,

175
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:18,985
he's been spiraling
out of control.

176
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,900
- Well, have you tried...
- Yeah, no, no.

177
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,108
Look, Doc,
we've tried everything...

178
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,999
More sleep, less sleep,
no sugar,

179
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,772
uh, no... food coloring.

180
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:30,170
- The-the... what...
- Uh, uh, the calming jars.

181
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,867
Yeah, the calming jars.

182
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,913
We didn't wanna medicate him
till absolutely necessary.

183
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,436
Right.

184
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,483
It's clear to us
that he needs it.

185
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,746
Okay, okay.
Hi, hi.

186
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,922
Hi.
Would you like a chair?

187
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,489
Hold on a second.
Honey, honey, look.

188
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:45,968
You gotta look at his mouth,
okay?

189
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,927
No, baby, no.
You gotta...

190
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,843
Can you do that again?
He needs to see your lips.

191
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,585
Jael's deaf?
I'm so sorry, my apologies.

192
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,630
I don't know how I missed that
on his chart.

193
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,589
Uh, you didn't.

194
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:58,938
We don't usually mention it

195
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,592
so he's not treated
any differently.

196
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,942
I see, okay.

197
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,813
But wouldn't you like
an ASL interpreter here,

198
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:06,859
at least, so that Jael
feels more comfortable

199
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,470
- communicating with me?
- No, it won't be necessary.

200
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:12,299
Jael doesn't know ASL.

201
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:19,042
♪

202
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,310
Hey, Doc!

203
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:24,526
Doc!

204
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:26,792
Come here!

205
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,620
Step into my office.

206
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,448
Hey.
I would tell you to sit,

207
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,014
but I've only
got this one chair,

208
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:36,715
and I've got this whole
lumbar situation, and...

209
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,717
anyway, what can I do for you?

210
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,241
Well, uh,
this is a very nice office.

211
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,636
You don't need walls
or electricity or law stuff.

212
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,289
So you're here
to bring justice

213
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,944
to the kid and the old broad
who got mushed this morning?

214
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,207
Yeah,
I wouldn't call her that.

215
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,122
But, um, yeah.

216
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,429
And more people are going to
get hurt unless we fix it.

217
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,562
Put your mind at ease.

218
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,085
Be calm.

219
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,565
Come with me.

220
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,348
Now, you see
that crosswalk over there?

221
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,398
- No.
- Because there isn't one.

222
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:13,142
My point is that intersection
is not up to code,

223
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,841
and the city has never
done squat to fix it.

224
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,757
But at the end of the day,
that is not an intersection.

225
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,150
That is a slot machine.

226
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:25,024
And if your old broad
needs surgery, well then,

227
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,549
that slot machine
is set at all sevens.

228
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,726
I'm talking big payouts!
A lot of cash!

229
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,251
Get your crash cash, baby!
Get your crash cash!

230
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:38,907
I-I'm actually
not looking for money.

231
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,084
An obvious lie, but okay.

232
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:43,695
No, no, no.
All I am here for...

233
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,957
- Mm-hmm.
- Is to get this intersection

234
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,741
fixed, all right?
That's it.

235
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,874
Well, you cannot
sue a driver to get that.

236
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,267
Well, we're not
gonna sue a driver.

237
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:52,834
We're gonna sue
the city of New York.

238
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,230
10 grand up front,
and that's a discount.

239
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:59,882
5, and only if we win.

240
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,062
Let's go crush
these bastards.

241
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,336
Obviously, the city
of New York takes no joy

242
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,774
in what happened
to Ana and Rafael Linares.

243
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,016
But I must point out
that in this courtroom,

244
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,933
we have neither the perpetrator
of a crime nor a victim.

245
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,065
Where is the driver
of this car?

246
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,359
Where are the people
who were struck?

247
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,276
This is an irrelevant bystander
smelling deep pockets,

248
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,723
and the City moves for this
complaint to be dismissed.

249
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,320
Response, Counselor?

250
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,773
Time to make 'em hurt
where the sun don't shine.

251
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,265
Yeah, um, Your Honor,

252
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,820
this crosswalk is in a very
busy residential neighborhood.

253
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:36,606
Kids play there.
Families work there.

254
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,347
In fact, their hopes and dreams

255
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,698
are played out on this
neglected patch of asphalt.

256
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:44,005
And I'm not asking for money,
okay?

257
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,964
All I'm asking is
for the city of New York

258
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,702
to protect the lives of its
citizens...

259
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:50,316
Which I believe
they are obligated to do...

260
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,362
And offer the cost
of a new coat of paint.

261
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:56,061
Now, I believe
that is a small price to pay

262
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:58,859
to protect the lives of
the citizens of this shining...

263
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:00,122
Citation?

264
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,370
Objection.

265
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,268
Sorry.
Uh, what?

266
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,854
What city charter regulation

267
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,982
are you citing
for your complaint?

268
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,205
Well...

269
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,524
Yarborough v.
City of New York.

270
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,992
That's the one.

271
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,995
With exception
of unsightly construction,

272
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,097
the City is required
to paint the intersection.

273
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:22,167
So ordered.
Department of Transportation

274
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:23,732
will restore the intersection.

275
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:25,960
The... what the... um...

276
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,875
- We just... did we win?
- We won.

277
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,276
And that, my friend,
is how you Cruz for justice!

278
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:34,413
God, I'm good.

279
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:37,548
Wow, I can't believe we won.

280
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,913
I mean, I can't believe that
you actually, you know, did it.

281
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,324
I had some doubts about you...
Maybe you noticed.

282
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,327
But that was incredible.
I mean, you knew exactly

283
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,548
what to say,
and this feels so good!

284
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:49,723
I think
I should've been a lawyer.

285
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,203
Yeah, I know, right?

286
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,205
Now imagine
how even better you'd feel

287
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,667
if they were actually
gonna paint that thing.

288
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:58,193
Yeah, but the judge
just said they have to.

289
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,152
So they're going to...

290
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:01,981
This is actually
the third time

291
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,115
I've won a city case
about that intersection,

292
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,175
and they ain't
never painted it yet.

293
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,002
That'll be 5 grand.

294
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,806
You doing okay?

295
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,591
- Yeah, fine.
- Yeah?

296
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,767
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

297
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,770
That's the fourth time you came
in here to check on your phone.

298
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,294
Are you spying on me?

299
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:41,644
Well, I've known you
long enough to know

300
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,863
when you're upset.

301
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,082
I'm fine, Casey.

302
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,953
Ah, she says as she evades.

303
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,346
She says while working,

304
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,565
which is what you
should be doing too.

305
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,308
Oh, and, um, I'm sorry
to bruise your sensitive ego,

306
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:56,355
but I had things totally under
control while you were gone.

307
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,312
Oh.

308
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,487
Kai.

309
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,707
Kai, you okay?

310
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,100
I don't feel so...

311
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,928
Okay, okay.
Let's get you sat down.

312
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,495
Here you go.

313
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,410
Oh, my God.

314
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,673
Can you take Bay two?

315
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,154
Uh, Casey,
can you go see if the...

316
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:16,549
- I gotta go.
- No...

317
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,680
There you go.

318
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,899
Now, let me know
if your fingers go numb.

319
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,161
All right.

320
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,643
Is that about my grandma?

321
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:24,902
No.

322
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,166
Is Nana okay?

323
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,042
"Your grandmother's injuries

324
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,131
"were more severe
than we expected.

325
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:36,351
"She cracked
one of the vertebrae

326
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,657
in her spinal column."

327
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,351
Oh.

328
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,780
She's gonna be fine though,
right?

329
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,857
I mean, you guys saw her.
She was walking.

330
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,552
She's gonna be fine.

331
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:50,046
"Well, at her age,
it's dangerous.

332
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:53,428
"But the good news
is that we can treat it.

333
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,242
"First option is minimally
invasive, but it means

334
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,027
"your grandmother
wears a back brace

335
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,116
"for the rest of her life.

336
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,568
"Second option
is open spinal surgery.

337
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,557
It does offer greater upside,
but it's risky."

338
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,618
Okay, um, which one
is she gonna choose?

339
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:17,479
"Your grandmother
is unconscious.

340
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,827
"So it's up to her
healthcare proxy to choose.

341
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,576
That's you, Rafael."

342
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,960
Me?

343
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:28,360
"It's in her medical records.

344
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:31,232
She chose you to make
these decisions for her."

345
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:32,581
What?

346
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,673
What if I make
the wrong decision?

347
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,415
I... no, no.
You choose.

348
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,330
We can't.

349
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:46,160
Your grandmother trusted you
enough to make you her proxy.

350
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,944
And now you just gotta
trust yourself enough

351
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:49,545
to make a decision.

352
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,331
Um...

353
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:03,087
I say...

354
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,307
I say do the surgery.

355
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:36,471
At 12 months,
Jael was just starting to talk

356
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,865
when he got sick,

357
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,912
and then he lost his hearing.

358
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,132
And...

359
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:48,091
we assumed that he needed
to learn ASL, but...

360
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,964
His pediatrician told us
it wasn't necessary...

361
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:54,228
That if we taught him to sign,
he would never learn to speak.

362
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:57,362
He would rely on sign language
instead of reading lips.

363
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,280
The audiologist
and the speech therapist,

364
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:04,325
they told us the same thing.

365
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:06,197
If we wanted
to give him his best shot

366
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,895
at navigating the world,

367
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,375
we had to motivate him.

368
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,073
His doctors said

369
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,728
that sign language
would limit him.

370
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,470
It would shrink his world
to a small bubble of peers

371
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,036
who could sign.

372
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,690
It would isolate him.

373
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,345
We didn't wanna relegate
our son to some dark corner

374
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,040
to be treated
like a second class citizen.

375
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,029
Well, is it working?

376
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:34,226
The therapy, the exercises,
are they working?

377
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:41,446
Can you hold
a conversation with him?

378
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,322
How many words
is he able to speak?

379
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,237
78.

380
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:55,330
Okay.
That's, um...

381
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,727
The average
that a two-year-old knows

382
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:02,296
is around 150,
just to put it in perspective.

383
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,344
The behavior that Jael
is showing is consistent

384
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,607
with language
deprivation syndrome.

385
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:12,393
The brain has a critical window
in which it forms language,

386
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,396
and if that window is missed,
it can cause a whole range

387
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,572
of issues.
Some are behavioral,

388
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:20,532
some mental.
If that window is closed,

389
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,662
it makes acquiring language
much more difficult.

390
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,280
If this is true, how come no
one's ever told us this before?

391
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:33,980
Because unfortunately,
medicine... our world...

392
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,416
Is still very much filtered

393
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,657
through an able-bodied
perspective.

394
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:40,009
That's why.

395
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,633
You two need
to make a decision... now.

396
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,036
To give Jael
a language of his own,

397
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,125
even if it's one
that you don't understand,

398
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:54,805
because his window is closing.

399
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,797
If you're willing
to get your hands dirty

400
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,189
to get that intersection fixed,

401
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,212
this is where
the magic happens.

402
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,537
Great, and by magic, do you
mean making bodies disappear?

403
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:16,809
Oh, give me your phone.
I gotta send a text.

404
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,560
- My phone?
- Yeah, things are just louder

405
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:22,262
when they come
from an unknown number.

406
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:24,044
You know what?
I'm not gonna ask questions.

407
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,350
- Good.
- Great.

408
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:26,565
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

409
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,705
Curt!

410
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,141
Callie!
You crazy bitch.

411
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,187
You scared the crap out of me.

412
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,449
Mwah!
Come here.

413
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,060
C-c-c-c-come.
Hey, Dr. Max Goodwin.

414
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,107
This is Curt Waldichuck,
Deputy Commissioner

415
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,065
for Roadway Repair
and Maintenance

416
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,371
for the city of New York.

417
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:48,373
Great.
Well, I'll just assume

418
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,766
this is a totally normal
and professional way to meet

419
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,377
- and dive right in.
- Sure.

420
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:57,034
So we received a judicial
order to have your department

421
00:18:57,118 --> 00:19:00,127
repaint an intersection...
Very dangerous.

422
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,343
So I guess we're here,
because we wanna know

423
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:05,781
what we have to do
to actually make that happen.

424
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:06,947
Nothin'.

425
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:09,559
Judge's order puts it
right onto our action list.

426
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:11,080
We'll get to it ASAP.

427
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,675
ASAP.
Curt.

428
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,009
Oh, you beautiful weasel, you.

429
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,924
We both know
that's gonna take decades

430
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,892
to get
to my client's intersection.

431
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,986
Unless, of course,
some friendly encouragement

432
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:26,338
might bump my client sort of
to the top of the list.

433
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,346
- I'm listenin'.
- Yeah, I'm also listening.

434
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:29,717
Sounds like... hey, hi.

435
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,894
Sounds like you were asking us
to bribe a city official?

436
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,290
Whoa.

437
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,032
Bribery, Doc?

438
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,393
No way.

439
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:37,726
For... God, no.

440
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,252
I'm just reminding my ferrety
friend of a little dalliance

441
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,167
he enjoyed
with a lady of the night.

442
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,647
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- That's not bribery.

443
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:46,997
- That's extortion.
- Oh, but you'd be surprised

444
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,172
- how well it works.
- You think

445
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,130
I don't got the goods on you,
Callie?

446
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:51,566
- All right, hey...
- What do ya got?

447
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,090
Why don't we just all
just take it down a notch,

448
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,352
all right?
Your consensual sex life

449
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,397
is, uh, you know,
your business,

450
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,704
and I'm sure it's going great.
I think we should go.

451
00:19:58,788 --> 00:19:59,966
Whoa, whoa, one second.

452
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,759
W-w-wait, Doctor, wait.

453
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:04,197
You are walking away
from a win.

454
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:06,364
Do you want
the intersection fixed or not?

455
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,235
Not like this.
I'm not gonna bribe

456
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,411
a city official just
to get them to do their job,

457
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,544
all right?
I'd rather do things my way.

458
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:15,851
Next time, money up front.
Let's go.

459
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,372
Yeah.

460
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:30,007
Guys, uh, tests came back...

461
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:31,562
Bacillus Cereus.

462
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,132
Which means it's my fault.

463
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:36,785
I guess
it must've been the schmear.

464
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,137
Are you trying to off us?
Is that what happened to Leyla?

465
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:43,053
Leyla got a better job
at Baptist.

466
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,142
But thank you
for bringing that up.

467
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:46,404
I guess the cream cheese

468
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:47,883
must've been left out
for too long.

469
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:49,407
Then why aren't you sick?

470
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,093
Oh, I had
the vegan cream cheese.

471
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:54,063
- What about Walsh?
- I also ate the vegan one...

472
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,283
By accident...
Nearly made me throw up

473
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,763
for an entirely
different reason.

474
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,287
35-year-old ice cream vendor.

475
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,463
- His stand got rear ended.
- Aaah!

476
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:05,292
- And this is?
- How they serve the ice cream.

477
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:08,121
- It's my tricking stick.
- He's hypotensive and tachy.

478
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,122
All right,
let's get him to Trauma One.

479
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:10,602
Let's go.

480
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,082
BP's dropping.
Heart rate's slow.

481
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,431
FAST is negative.

482
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:15,172
This thing is tickling
his vagus nerve.

483
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,390
Okay,
we gotta get it out of him.

484
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,957
He's lost a ton of blood.

485
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,698
Okay,
let's clear the puncture.

486
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,964
Easy...

487
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,095
Oh...

488
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:26,966
- Easy, come on.
- I can see why they call it

489
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,531
a tricking stick.

490
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,358
Okay.
Lap pad.

491
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,570
- Suction.
- Got it.

492
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,492
- He's crashing.
- Okay, let's push fluids.

493
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,197
I'm gonna try
and suture him up right here.

494
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,635
Inject epi!

495
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,719
You want some help?

496
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,591
Just get back to your bay!

497
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:47,987
What?
I've got this.

498
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,460
Can someone
please silence that?

499
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,071
It's your sister.

500
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:00,208
Why is your drugged-out
sister calling you?

501
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:02,044
Can you just
get back to your bay?

502
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,698
Let's hang a bag of O-Neg!

503
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:32,023
Hey, buddy.

504
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:54,059
Can you read my lips?

505
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,142
Are you hungry?

506
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,721
You hungry?

507
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,930
Yeah?

508
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:09,338
I'll get you a burger.

509
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,251
Hang on.

510
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:19,461
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

511
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,820
Okay, the kid likes burgers.

512
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,558
Get right on that.

513
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:28,365
Hey, Jael, do you
wanna learn a funny sign?

514
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,596
Yeah?
Kay, ready?

515
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,958
Burger King.

516
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:36,245
Booger.

517
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,486
Booger.

518
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,080
King.

519
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:45,275
Yup.

520
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,104
Yeah.

521
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:49,163
You're the booger king?

522
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,415
You're the...
I'm the booger king?

523
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:52,546
Mm-hmm, all right.

524
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,635
Good to be the king
of something.

525
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,638
Oh, boy, I can't imagine
how hard the last few years

526
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:00,934
have been with everybody
wearing a mask

527
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,366
all the time.

528
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,273
And you're not understanding
the language the entire world

529
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,535
was speaking.

530
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:10,535
Would you like
to learn sign language?

531
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:13,361
Sign language?

532
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,881
Can I show you something?

533
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,204
Wanna come with me?

534
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:32,151
Yeah?
Kay, come on.

535
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,500
Let's go.

536
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,753
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come with me.

537
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,349
You too, Mom and Dad.
Come on, let's go.

538
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,738
Field trip.

539
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:46,233
- How's she doing?
- Vitals are stable.

540
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,757
That's Dr. Wilder.

541
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:50,891
She is the chair
of this entire department.

542
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,527
She's our top oncologist.

543
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:55,314
She runs this whole thing.
And guess what.

544
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:56,893
She's deaf...

545
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:58,841
Like you.

546
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,387
It's cool, right?

547
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:06,895
Yeah, sign language is a key
that unlocked the world.

548
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,622
Suction.

549
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:16,040
- Alice.
- Vitals are stable.

550
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,745
- What, Dad.
- You're busy.

551
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:45,773
I get it.

552
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:48,124
Dr. Reynolds!
You're a man on the go.

553
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:53,034
- Where are you calling from?
- I'm a man on the go too.

554
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,017
I'm making moves myself.
But I need 100 bucks.

555
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:57,323
For what?

556
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,586
Before you say no,
hear a brother out.

557
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,719
I'm making... I've got...

558
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,982
Pops, where are you?

559
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:05,287
Get out of my way!

560
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:06,898
You get out of my way,
old man!

561
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,335
- Why are you in the street?
- You get outta my way!

562
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,337
- Go! Go!
- Are you in the street?

563
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,469
I got... I got plans.

564
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,558
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:17,430
I'm working it.
I got everything under control.

566
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:19,820
What's going on?

567
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:21,601
Pops?
Pops!

568
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:24,413
Hi, excuse me.
How's it going?

569
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,376
Just a second of your time.

570
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,727
How would you feel about
saving some children's lives?

571
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:31,673
Sorry, bud.
Don't got any cash.

572
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,432
Oh, no, no.
It's not that kind of donation.

573
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,923
See, there is a dangerous
intersection nearby.

574
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,766
I see a lot of people
get hurt there,

575
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,391
and how would you feel about

576
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,720
stopping by after your shift
and touching it up?

577
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,374
I mean,
you'd be improving the city,

578
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,680
and you'd be
keeping people safe,

579
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:50,335
and all it's gonna cost you
is some paint.

580
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:51,466
- So...
- So...

581
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,859
- Right?
- What do you say?

582
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,644
- We'd love to.
- Great!

583
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,341
I knew it! Finally.

584
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:57,908
- Thank you.
- We can't, though.

585
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,344
Can't... can't?

586
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:01,085
- Why?
- We don't just paint

587
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,174
wherever the hell.
We got a schedule.

588
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:04,567
Yeah, see?
There's a schedule.

589
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,220
The city inventories
every gallon of paint.

590
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:07,562
Yeah, 'cause it's the city.

591
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:10,397
Plus, our boss flips out
if we aren't on his schedule

592
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:13,094
- to a T, so sorry, guy.
- Um, yeah.

593
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,445
But I'm actually a boss myself.
So maybe, you know...

594
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:17,405
- Yeah, but Max, we gotta...
- Right, but maybe

595
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:19,610
- just one bucket...
- We gotta move on.

596
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,665
- Couple blocks.
- Gotta move on, okay?

597
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,281
You tried, all right?

598
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:25,500
You took a few swings,
and you missed a few balls.

599
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:29,156
But you played the game.
Now, now it's time to move on.

600
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,767
It's unbelievable.
You know, my friend

601
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,187
could've died this morning...

602
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:36,204
Or Rafael or his grandmother
or my daughter could be playing

603
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,761
by a street, and all it would
take is one speeding car

604
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:40,141
to see her one second too late.

605
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,883
You're gonna
have an aneurism.

606
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:43,538
People are getting hurt!

607
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,555
And it would be so easy
to just fix it.

608
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,906
And all anyone keeps telling me
is why they can't.

609
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,645
Can we just get something done?

610
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,408
How can running the largest
public hospital in America

611
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:59,713
be easier than just
fixing an intersection?

612
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,502
I'm gonna Venmo your 5 grand,
all right?

613
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:05,766
And thanks for your help.

614
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:14,164
"Stabilization complete.

615
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:17,798
"Let's lighten the anesthesia
and see if there's any damage

616
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:19,997
- to the spinal cord."
- Lightening.

617
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,289
"Ana, if you can hear me,

618
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:25,521
raise your index finger
on your right hand."

619
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,836
"Great, you're doing great."

620
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,719
"Now wiggle your toes."

621
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,419
"Ana, can you wiggle
your toes for me?"

622
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,672
"You're doing great."

623
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,523
So guys,
there is some good news.

624
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:11,519
There is an emerging program

625
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:14,044
that will help make up
for all the lost time.

626
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:15,902
Jael will learn
ASL much quicker

627
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,339
in an environment like this

628
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,995
as opposed
to a mainstream school.

629
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:21,406
Yeah, check it out.

630
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,844
It's a high-quality
deaf education.

631
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,031
They use a bilingual approach,
which means that Jael

632
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,078
will continue
to receive speech therapy

633
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:30,444
as well lip-reading instruction

634
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:32,750
and all the while,
he'll be learning to sign

635
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:36,141
while building up a very strong
foundation of language.

636
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:39,023
This is amazing.
Where is it?

637
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:42,949
The school itself is
in Framingham, Massachusetts.

638
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:45,039
That's a four-hour drive.

639
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:47,693
How many times a week
do we have to sign him up for?

640
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:50,218
Because of how late it is
in his development,

641
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:52,133
they recommend
that we enroll Jael

642
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:53,699
in their residential program,

643
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,179
which means
that he will be living there,

644
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:58,726
fully immersed in the language.

645
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,747
Oh, you just said
that he is acting out

646
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,360
because he can't
communicate his needs,

647
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,014
and now you want us
to send our five-year-old

648
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:06,538
to live in another state
with strangers?

649
00:30:06,623 --> 00:30:08,497
- He'll be lost.
- Well, he's lost now.

650
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:11,671
He's on his own now.

651
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,789
Do you wanna go?

652
00:30:21,874 --> 00:30:24,140
Yeah.

653
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,606
Go ahead.
Take a look around.

654
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,336
Yeah.

655
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,060
Walsh,
let's get him up to Post-Op.

656
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:53,498
They can continue
to take care of him up there.

657
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:57,067
Chart room, now.

658
00:30:57,151 --> 00:31:00,938
Hospital maintenance
needed on 4-3.

659
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:11,473
Sent you a message.
Let's hear it.

660
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,692
Would you just stop?
It's private.

661
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:15,216
From a sister
you've been actively avoiding

662
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,000
- since I've known you?
- Yeah, what do you want me

663
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,219
to say?

664
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:19,742
What happened
when I was gone?

665
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:21,309
I was lying earlier, okay?

666
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:22,745
Yeah, no kidding.

667
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:25,008
I missed the hell
out of you when you were gone.

668
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,532
I mean, I turned to talk to
you, like, a million times.

669
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:28,707
But you were
on top of a mountain

670
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,492
where I couldn't even call you.

671
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,276
You're my touchstone.

672
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,366
You're my best friend,
and if you would've been here,

673
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,239
I would never have been so
stupid as to try to save her.

674
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:40,803
Does your sponsor know
that she's in your life again?

675
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:43,937
She's my sister.

676
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:46,812
Just tell me something.

677
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:50,120
What part about putting the
oxygen mask on yourself first

678
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,858
did you forget?

679
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:57,221
She's like this
because of me.

680
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,919
I can't just abandon her...

681
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,614
Again.

682
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:04,134
I can't.

683
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:18,757
You got the hundred?

684
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:21,282
I walked the whole way,
so I hope you got it.

685
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:23,588
Okay, um, you've been
drinking?

686
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:25,764
Hell no.

687
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,549
I just got a plan.
That's all.

688
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,029
I'm gon' make
everything good again.

689
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,769
You watch and see.

690
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:33,947
I'm getting the garage back.

691
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,119
Bam!

692
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:37,472
Floyd's?

693
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,778
- With $100?
- Yes, sir.

694
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:41,606
I should never have sold it.

695
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,043
Everything was beautiful then.

696
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,741
I had it all...
Your mom, all you kids,

697
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,264
- my own shop.
- Yeah.

698
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:48,744
- It was beautiful.
- Okay, yeah, I know.

699
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,137
Let's go inside.
We can figure it out.

700
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:53,053
Oh, no time.
Just give me the money, son!

701
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,186
Pops,
you gotta let me help you.

702
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,796
Help me?

703
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,363
Help me?

704
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:04,629
You can help me.
Just give me the hundred, son.

705
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:08,982
I'ma get you help.

706
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,636
It's a 51/50.
Just a temporary psych old.

707
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,203
What's going on?

708
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,162
This the 9.58?

709
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:17,077
- What'd you do, son?
- Just take it easy, sir.

710
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,383
- I... I'm your father.
- This is just temporary.

711
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,819
You're my son!

712
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:22,517
- Listen to 'em, Pops.
- Please, Floyd, please.

713
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,536
- Please, Floyd!
- Take it easy.

714
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,278
Please, Floyd, please.

715
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:27,552
<i>Please, Floyd! Floyd!</i>

716
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:28,896
Please, Floyd!

717
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,935
Now that you ask me...

718
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:55,141
<i>I'm so high.
Pass it here.</i>

719
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:56,305
<i>I want another bump.</i>

720
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,384
<i>Stop hogging!
So greedy and selfish!</i>

721
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:01,736
<i>I actually am not.
You're so wasted.</i>

722
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,739
<i>You're just
literally babbling.</i>

723
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:06,089
<i>I'm gonna get more vodka
from Leo's downstairs.</i>

724
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:40,682
How you doin'?

725
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,824
Don't beat yourself up.

726
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:49,346
There's no way you could've
known it'd end up this way.

727
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,357
She took care of me
when no one else did.

728
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,137
And now...

729
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,967
I don't know
how to take care of her.

730
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,889
And it's all because
of that stupid decision.

731
00:35:10,772 --> 00:35:13,122
How did you
come to that decision?

732
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,173
I didn't.
You forced me.

733
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,929
Look, I forced you
to say something.

734
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:22,882
But you could've chosen
the less risky procedure.

735
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:26,452
My grandma goes for it.

736
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,749
I mean,

737
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,999
that's just who she is.

738
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:34,710
So I chose what I thought
she would want me to do.

739
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,858
There you go.

740
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,249
Then you made
the right decision.

741
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,796
What if she doesn't
see it that way?

742
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,530
Well, you go in there,

743
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,248
and if she needs
to be mad at you,

744
00:35:49,332 --> 00:35:51,085
let her be mad.

745
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,249
You're not just in charge
of her medical decisions,

746
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:58,671
'cause accepting
the consequences...

747
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,739
that's a decision too.

748
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,628
Grandma.

749
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:32,463
Come here, baby.

750
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:35,378
Come here.

751
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,936
- Hi, hi, sorry.
- Hey.

752
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,231
Is everything okay?

753
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:00,773
Yeah, man, welcome.

754
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,931
How in the world
did I miss this?

755
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:07,282
You wanna give it a go?

756
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,351
Uh, oh, that?
No.

757
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,280
No, thank you.

758
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:12,547
Not in my wheelhouse.

759
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:14,284
Not mine either...

760
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,068
till I got hit by a truck
and had to rebuild

761
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,504
my entire body from scratch.

762
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,272
- Wow.
- Yeah.

763
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:21,624
- You did that.
- Yeah, yeah.

764
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:23,075
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

765
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,165
I have a bad back and bad arms,

766
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:28,690
bad legs, bad everything, so...

767
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,139
Well, this will help.
It did for me.

768
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,052
What do you got to lose?

769
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:37,586
Well, I would say my dignity,

770
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,766
but, uh, that sucker left
the building ages ago.

771
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:43,574
- So what the heck?
- All right, my man.

772
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:46,273
- Give it a go.
- Okay, so over here,

773
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:47,358
we got a dead lift.

774
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,536
That's not helping.

775
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,234
Okay, so hip's-width stance.

776
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:53,105
Hands just outside the hips.

777
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,585
- Right.
- Kay.

778
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:56,024
Your shoulders slightly
in front of the bar, right?

779
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,501
- Yeah.
- And then your hips

780
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,945
and shoulders are gonna rise

781
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,504
- at the same time.
- Right, okay.

782
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:02,724
Just grab the bar and lift.

783
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,414
Grab the bar and lift,
he says.

784
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,858
- Yeah, man.
- Here we go.

785
00:38:06,942 --> 00:38:08,730
Just lift the thing.

786
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:10,209
Just...

787
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:11,558
Just pick it up.
Here we go.

788
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:18,914
Aah!

789
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:20,219
All right!

790
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,657
All right!

791
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:26,246
All right.
You feel that?

792
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:28,858
You feel that?

793
00:38:28,965 --> 00:38:31,145
Oh, I felt it.

794
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,402
I felt something.

795
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,212
Yeah?

796
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:00,301
N.A.?

797
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:01,996
The meeting's upstairs.

798
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,449
Hey, Doc!
Thanks for comin'.

799
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,669
Will you hustle up?
Come on!

800
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,628
Get out of the street...
For obvious reasons.

801
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,544
Did the, um, Venmo
not go through?

802
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,024
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

803
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:27,939
While you were
nobly flailing today,

804
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:31,560
I was thinking to myself,
if you actually fixed this

805
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,772
intersection, then you would
ruin my entire business plan.

806
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:37,107
Well, it's New York,
so I'm sure you can find

807
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:39,646
another dangerous
intersection somewhere.

808
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,953
Well, my thoughts exactly!

809
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:43,389
So I took your money.

810
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:49,324
And I bought this.

811
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:53,704
- You got paint.
- I got paint.

812
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:56,838
- Are we-are we doing this?
- You are so doing it.

813
00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:58,709
- Oh, I'm doing this?
- And I'm so overseeing it.

814
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,493
Great, where's the brush?

815
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:03,061
Mary, you're here!
Take this.

816
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:05,890
I'll just share with him,
okay?

817
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:08,110
Oh, my God,
you guys are so great!

818
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:09,807
Take this.
Take this.

819
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:11,200
- You're gonna want that.
- Yeah.

820
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,743
What about the guys?
Who else is here?

821
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,386
You can help...

822
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,601
there.

823
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,692
