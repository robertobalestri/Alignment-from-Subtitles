00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,969
To the Bloom sisters.

3
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:05,840
Barely functional,
but a ton of fun.

4
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,233
You haven't told her
you're sober?

5
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:08,295
- Not yet.
- When?

6
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:09,850
- Soon.
- Dr. Reynolds,

7
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,237
I can say without a doubt

8
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,066
that you are the worst patient
I've ever encountered.

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,328
Hey, what'd you say
your name was?

10
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:17,888
- I didn't.
- Hi, my name is Iggy,

11
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:18,990
and I'm on this app,

12
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:21,160
because who wants
to go through this awful,

13
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,516
confusing, joyous world alone?

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,227
Choo, choo.

15
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,359
- I...
- Hey.

16
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,665
- I wanna help you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,406
Hey, Luna... Luna.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,626
You gotta watch with your eyes,
remember?

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,062
Not your hands.

20
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:55,716
Yeah, be careful.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,196
Here, give me that,

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,983
you little strawberry thief.

23
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:12,994
Okay.

24
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:14,909
Whoa, hey, whoa, now, buster.

25
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,563
Blenders are for big people.

26
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,173
But...

27
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:20,175
if you watch
those grabby hands...

28
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,524
Come here, you.

29
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,917
Rawr.

30
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,137
You can watch from right here.

31
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,620
All right, here we go.

32
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,188
Baby,
that was not a good choice.

33
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,407
Here, give me that.
Let's put that back.

34
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,104
Come here.
You're just making a mess.

35
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,585
Oh, boy, okay.
Ooh.

36
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:41,718
All right, don't,
uh, touch anything, okay?

37
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,334
Owie.
Grabby hand.

38
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:50,771
Oh, no, no, baby, baby,
baby, come here.

39
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,164
You okay?

40
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:53,426
You all right?

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,255
That's grabby hands.

42
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,734
You know what?

43
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,258
You're coming
with Daddy to work, okay?

44
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,263
Come here.
Ooh.

Hey, Nurse.

48
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,963
Trudy, wait up.

49
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,269
Trudy?

50
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:11,618
Hildegard?

51
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,837
Do I look like
a Hildegard to you?

52
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,145
You're right.
You look more like a... Olga.

53
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,494
Not even close. Mm.

54
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:20,192
I mean, you could
just tell me your name.

55
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,194
And miss out
on all these crack guesses?

56
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,544
- Nah.
- Paloma?

57
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:25,719
Margarita?

58
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:28,113
- Julep?
- You're just naming cocktails.

59
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:29,897
I am not.
Harvey Wallbanger?

60
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,420
Yeah,
I think you're just picking up

61
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:32,987
that I want a cocktail.

62
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,468
Yeah, well, let's make it
happen after work.

63
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,166
Hey, girl,
you are not gonna believe this.

64
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,037
- What?
- They just offered me

65
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,301
a $20,000 bonus if I pack up

66
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:43,867
and go to
Oklahoma City tonight.

67
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,347
Good for you.

68
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,176
I will meet you there
if the food is halfway decent.

69
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,482
- Deal.
- Okay.

70
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,269
- See you when I see you.
- I'll see you.

71
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,097
So you're a travel nurse?

72
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,234
Yeah, I'm here for eight
weeks and then on to the next.

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,627
But you were talking
about after work?

74
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,632
You know what?
I can't.

75
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,592
But I'll see you on the rounds.

76
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:13,593
Uh...

77
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,814
Okay.

78
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,389
You must be as hung over
as I am.

79
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,132
Here.

80
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,442
- Hair of the Dog.
- Oh, read my mind.

81
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,579
Make yourself at home.

82
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,027
Uh, I will, 'cause it is.

83
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,634
Oh, yeah?
Mom still paying the rent?

84
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,371
Yeah, when she remembers.

85
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,678
Oh, God.

86
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,854
Man, it is so weird,
Mom forgetting things

87
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,074
'cause she's old,
not because she's hammered.

88
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,119
I know.

89
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:06,039
Sucks... makes it so much
harder to be mad at her.

90
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,218
You ever think about it?

91
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,954
About what?

92
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,785
Getting clean.

93
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:22,462
Uh, yeah.

94
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,626
Yeah, sometimes.

95
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,108
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,110
Hey, do you remember...

97
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,286
You remember when Mom
used to get, like, wasted

98
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,896
and order, like,
8 million dumplings

99
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,571
from that one place?

100
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,141
Yeah?

101
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,798
I want those dumplings.

102
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,821
I say we get trashed,

103
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,388
eat them tonight.

104
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,042
What do you say?

105
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,868
Reclaim our heritage, Lauren.

106
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,354
Yeah, yeah.
I will pick some up

107
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,228
on my way home from work.

108
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,735
I'm, um...

109
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,626
I'm glad you're here.

110
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,680
Us talking, it feels, like, um,

111
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:20,467
I don't know,
healthy or whatever.

112
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:23,508
So let's keep talking.

113
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,514
Just two little stitches.

114
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,430
- Cool.
- What do we say?

115
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,345
Thank you, Auntie Lauren.

116
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,521
Oh, you are so welcome.

117
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,567
I don't get to see you enough,
do I, big girl?

118
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,178
- Whoa! Whoa.
- Do not grab the scissors.

119
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,963
Good news is we'll be seeing
Auntie Lauren again very soon.

120
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,009
32-year-old woman
with respiratory arrest

121
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,053
on the A train.

122
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:51,925
Please keep an eye on her.

123
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,667
Now with pulse ox
in low 90s on 100%.

124
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,712
Uh, is that
what I think it is?

125
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:58,540
Skin that blue, it's gotta be
sodium nitrate poisoning.

126
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,672
I don't think
I've ever seen it before,

127
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:00,890
it's so rare.

128
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,762
51-year-old
with respiratory collapse.

129
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:05,199
- On the A train?
- No, 34 West 57th,

130
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,506
- fifth floor office.
- Two unrelated cases

131
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,855
of sodium nitrate poisoning?

132
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,509
Yeah, well,
it used to be rare.

133
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:12,032
65-year-old man

134
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:13,860
- in respiratory arrest.
- I think we get the picture.

135
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,732
Okay, let's get all
three patients to curtains,

136
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:19,129
and let's start
methylene blue times three.

137
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,221
Guys, if you look out
your window to the left,

138
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,701
you will note some very...

139
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:31,007
Strange green objects
whizzing by.

140
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,531
Those are what we commonly

141
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:35,534
refer to as trees!

142
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:37,057
Those are trees, everybody.

143
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:39,581
You are officially out
of the city and into the woods!

144
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,366
Whoo!

145
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,632
Yeah!

146
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,067
Now, you know,
I know our little therapy group

147
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,157
is usually hospital bound,
but, um, you know, a good hike,

148
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,855
amigos, that is a therapy
all to itself.

149
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,379
It's unbelievable.
Our connection

150
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,818
to the natural world is just...

151
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,172
So, um...

152
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,350
Anybody reading anything good?

153
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,960
Ah, I see.
Interesting.

154
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,571
Yeah, I thought you guys

155
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,181
might like to know
that we are about to drive

156
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,096
right into a fire.

157
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,880
Also, the bridge up ahead
looks like it's out,

158
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,669
and I am definitely
going to crash the car.

159
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,538
Bigfoot!

160
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:26,106
Bigfoot straight ahead!

161
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,546
All right, okay.

162
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:35,507
Give me your phones.

163
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,987
Phones, please.

164
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,206
I'm almost done
with this level.

165
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,381
- It'll just be a second.
- My friends,

166
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:42,252
we are going phone-free today.

167
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,690
Oh, my God, you are so mad
with power right now.

168
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:45,821
Can I have my phone back
if I do my breathing?

169
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,086
Thank you.
Give it.

170
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,133
Thank you.
This is not for me.

171
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:55,617
It is for you.

172
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,534
There, doesn't that
feel better already?

173
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,326
Have you seen
their ID bracelets?

174
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,501
Yeah.

175
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,460
They all have the same address.

176
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,635
I've been trying
to call the landlord

177
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,245
to let him know
about the exposure,

178
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,725
but I keep getting voicemail.

179
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,857
"Hi there,
you're poisoning your tenants.

180
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:23,685
- Please call me back whenever."
- You try City Health?

181
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,034
Yeah, that would be perfect,

182
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,254
if we needed it dealt with
in ten years' time.

183
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,039
Look, pick a nurse
with a tox background,

184
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,737
and get her over there.
Someone needs to deal with this

185
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,260
- before anyone else gets hurt.
- I'll go.

186
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,828
Uh, thanks,
but I think we can find someone

187
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,177
a few ranks down
from Chair of Surgery for this.

188
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:39,617
Text me the address.
This is some ripe...

189
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,662
Okay.

190
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:46,795
"Hi, Justine, it's very nice
to see you again.

191
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,188
"Uh, it's totally normal
to be nervous,

192
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:50,843
"and any questions you have,
just fire away.

193
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:52,366
I promise I heard 'em all."

194
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,504
I-ay ust-jay ad-hay
un-way estion-quay.

195
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,332
It's Pig Latin.

196
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:06,815
"Oh, why are you
speaking in Pig Latin?"

197
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,341
Ell-way, ay-may
ids-kay aid-say.

198
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:13,692
I can help.

199
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,041
My kids did this
for a year once.

200
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:19,698
Go ahead, hon.

201
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:22,178
"I'm sorry
about the Pig Latin,"

202
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,616
and, "My kids said

203
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,490
it was good luck."

204
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,667
"And just so you know,
I've resected lung cancers

205
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,148
like yours hundreds of times."

206
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,759
Excuse me, I need
Nurse Andrea Cantwell.

207
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,239
- Okay.
- Sir, you need to step aside.

208
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:40,893
"No, surgery
is about to begin.

209
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:43,460
Whatever this is, it can wait."

210
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,071
I'm afraid it can't.

211
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:48,422
But New Amsterdam already
took responsibility for this!

212
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,816
Okay.

213
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,173
I know you're just
doing your job,

214
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,949
but you're not hearing me,
okay?

215
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,083
- But... but the hospital...
- "Keep prepping, Ms. Cerrado."

216
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,408
Already took responsibility
for this, okay?

217
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,580
- This is not her fault.
- Sir, you need to step aside.

218
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,043
You're not hearing me.
This is not her fault.

219
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,523
Ma'am, you're under arrest.

220
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,090
It's okay.
It's all right.

221
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,252
My husband... someone
needs to call my husband.

222
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,659
I will call him.
The lawyers are on this, okay?

223
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,138
Andrea Cantwell, you have
the right to remain silent.

224
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,575
Our whole legal team
is on this.

225
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,011
Don't worry, okay?
We got you.

226
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,099
You have the right
to an attorney...

227
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,230
Don't worry.
We've got you... I...

228
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,667
If you can't afford
an attorney...

229
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,551
"What the hell is going on?"

230
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,302
Two months ago,
Andrea's patient died.

231
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,994
"Yeah, this is a hospital.
People die."

232
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,096
Well, tell that to the D.A.,
because they're prosecuting her

233
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,380
for murder.

234
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:33,408
Uh, Ms. Sawhook,
you're running point

235
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:34,970
on Nurse Andrea Cantwell's

236
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:36,964
- case, right?
- Yup, I drew the short straw.

237
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,100
Great, so you know that
this death was not her fault?

238
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,972
Andrea grabbed
the wrong medication

239
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:43,887
and injected it
into a patient's IV,

240
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:44,888
and it killed him.

241
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,281
Sounds like her fault.

242
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,021
Okay, uh,
meds in this hospital

243
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,936
are dispensed
by MedRack machines...

244
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,198
I'm sure you know that...
But sometimes,

245
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,287
they make mistakes, all right?

246
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:53,549
They don't dispense
enough meds,

247
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,333
or they dispense too many,
and occasionally,

248
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,380
the nurses have to override
these machines

249
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:00,686
- or patients would die.
- Careful, it sounds like

250
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,818
you're admitting liability.

251
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,036
Well, we already did that

252
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,211
the first time
this went to court.

253
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,692
Okay, HCC admitted
that this machine

254
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,453
that every hospital
in America uses,

255
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,782
made a mistake, all right?

256
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,175
That's not on the nurses.

257
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,133
That's on the entire
American healthcare system.

258
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,788
That was in civil court.
This is a criminal charge.

259
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,486
Andrea's not a criminal.

260
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,183
She was doing her job.

261
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,490
And the only reason that
this D.A. is pursuing this case

262
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:23,405
is because it makes
for a great headline,

263
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,189
and now it's open season
on nurses.

264
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,147
But it's your responsibility
to protect...

265
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,456
What's your job again?

266
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,414
- Medical director.
- Well, this is no longer

267
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:33,896
a medical problem.

268
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,598
Sorry,
these stairs are off-limits.

269
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:45,340
My hip hasn't let me
take those stairs in a decade.

270
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:48,952
- What's all this?
- This is, uh, rat poison

271
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:50,475
laced with sodium nitrate.

272
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,477
Yeah, no store brand
would have that...

273
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,343
Only cheap, basement-made crap
someone got off the internet

274
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:56,984
to save a buck.

275
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,266
Yeah, your landlord
was reckless, stingy,

276
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,007
and damn lucky no one died.

277
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,835
That's this building for you.

278
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,360
Every day, something like this.

279
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:07,884
Every day,
something like mass poisoning?

280
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,584
Wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

281
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,934
- Try me.
- There was black mold

282
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:18,764
in the bathroom.
Now I have severe asthma.

283
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,028
There was asbestos
in my floors, in the walls.

284
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,510
Now my G.I. tract is shot.

285
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:29,296
Roaches in the food,
in the sheets.

286
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,342
My ma got gastroenteritis.

287
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,997
- Spiders.
- Water damage.

288
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,565
- Sewage.
- Oh, New Amsterdam's great.

289
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:37,783
You did such a good job

290
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,263
when all those people here
got poisoned.

291
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,613
He means the last time
people got poisoned.

292
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:44,398
The furnace was out,
so everyone used gas ovens.

293
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:47,227
No vents, carbon monoxide...
It was awful.

294
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,055
Lucky for us,
our window was broken,

295
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,709
so we just got hypothermia.

296
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,540
And pigeons.

297
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,717
All right,
does everybody have water?

298
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,284
Sunscreen?
How 'bout hats

299
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:01,459
to keep your heads
from exploding when you see

300
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,462
the sheer beauty
of Bear Mountain?

301
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:06,595
I, for one,
am not doing courtesy laughs

302
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,423
until I get my phone back.

303
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,120
Okay, fair enough...
Gives me an opportunity

304
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,730
to improve my material.
No big deal.

305
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,340
It's not funny.

306
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,255
You're punishing us, and we
didn't even do anything wrong.

307
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,997
Come on.
Are you serious?

308
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,564
This is not a punishment,
you guys.

309
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,523
I'm not punishing you.
This is a gift.

310
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,699
I am giving you
the gift of nature.

311
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,179
Cell phone over us age,
social media, all that stuff,

312
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,442
those are harmful things.

313
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,269
It's like the early days
of cigarettes.

314
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,793
People would run around
like a bunch of dum-dums,

315
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,099
addicted to the things,
had no idea the damage

316
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:34,753
they were doing
to their own bodies, right?

317
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,581
And what about the Snapchat
thing this morning?

318
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,453
Some kid died
doing a Snapchat challenge.

319
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,063
- That's awful.
- Okay, the kid jumps

320
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:43,414
out of a car... a speeding car...
Because someone on Snapchat

321
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:44,328
told him to?

322
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,547
Yeah, he's got bigger problems

323
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,549
than things on the internet.
We're not morons.

324
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,333
Our phones aren't,
like, damaging us.

325
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,553
Mm-hmm, says the kid
who falls asleep in class,

326
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:54,425
'cause he's up all night
texting with his buddies.

327
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,559
And Skyla, when we first met,
you painted our entire art wall

328
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,430
with a beautiful,
gorgeous mural.

329
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,606
And now your folks tell me you
won't pick up a brush anymore,

330
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,956
because you're too busy
watching other people paint

331
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,219
on YouTube.

332
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,004
- It's fun to watch.
- I know it's fun to watch,

333
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,136
but watching is not doing.

334
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,703
It's not the same thing,
you know?

335
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,966
And I'm not picking on you.
I'm talking about everyone.

336
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,490
This is everywhere.
Like, Austin,

337
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:18,754
why did you have to
have thumb surgery again?

338
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,582
I played too much "Fortnite."

339
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,367
Yeah, you played
too much "Fortnite."

340
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,630
Yeah, and Bizzie, you spent
half the damn ride up here

341
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:26,979
trading seats with everyone,
trying to find

342
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,807
the perfect lighting
for a selfie.

343
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,243
There's only one person here

344
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,725
who has their phone
on them 24/7.

345
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,510
That's... okay,
that's totally different.

346
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:37,599
I am a doctor, and I'm on call.

347
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:40,210
I didn't hear any calls.
But back in the van,

348
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,781
I did see a lot
of push notifications.

349
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,391
Me too.

350
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:49,262
My mom has that same app.

351
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,964
Uh, she says
it's for professional singles.

352
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:57,836
Okay, yeah, all right.

353
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,359
Uh,

354
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:01,579
you know what, guys?
You know what? You're right.

355
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:03,059
You're right.
I'm not being fair.

356
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:06,627
Mm-kay?
I got a solution though.

357
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,719
There, now nobody gets a phone.
Okay?

358
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:13,025
No phones for anybody... none.

359
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,158
What do you think?

360
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:18,030
Guys, calm down.
It's a 90-minute hike.

361
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:20,206
I think you'll survive.

362
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,686
All right.

363
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,035
Let's go.

364
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,560
Let's get that heart rate up
and blood pumpin'.

365
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:27,303
Yeah.

366
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:37,223
Nurse Banner just quit
in the middle of a shift?

367
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:39,098
She's the fourth one today.

368
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,316
"So I've got room in my O.R.

369
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,666
"for the pulmonary
sleeve lobectomy.

370
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,145
"It's a really
challenging procedure,

371
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,060
but one you'll need to master
to make your careers."

372
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,107
- No, thank you.
- I'll pass.

373
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:52,673
Mm!

374
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,633
"Okay,
it's a major opportunity.

375
00:15:55,717 --> 00:16:00,203
You're both just...
You're not interested?"

376
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,252
Or we don't want
to end up in handcuffs.

377
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,998
Um, can I see that?

378
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:17,742
Hey, um, why was a CT ordered
for kidney stones?

379
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,178
I mean, here's the X-ray.

380
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,832
If Andrea wasn't protected
by MedRack,

381
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,011
you think anyone's gonna be
protected by X-rays?

382
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,578
Excuse us. Thank you.

383
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,755
- Max!
- Max!

384
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,670
Excuse me.

385
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:35,717
"I just had to cancel
multiple procedures.

386
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,110
Because of Andrea,
everyone is in a panic."

387
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,504
I spent years trying to take
the fear out of medicine.

388
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:42,506
Now we're back to square one.

389
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,595
"This is not square one.
This is worse.

390
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,641
"We are not treating anyone.

391
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,741
"This place has ground
to a halt.

392
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,978
What are we gonna do?"

393
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:55,715
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

394
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,738
- You're in a hurry.
- Yeah,

395
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:57,882
I'm headed to legal.

396
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,870
I need to learn
about housing law.

397
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,089
Okay, spill it.

398
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,744
You and that building,
what's this about?

399
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,531
It's about your sodium
nitrate victims who were just

400
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,837
discharged
to an apartment building

401
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,839
that's gonna make them sick
all over again.

402
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,842
- Hey, where are you going?
- I am having a bonding night

403
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,541
with my sister,
which involves picking up

404
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,717
our favorite
childhood dumplings.

405
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,240
Oh, okay,
so you're still pretending

406
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:19,372
to be a party-goer
to impress her?

407
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,547
No, I think
what you're asking is

408
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,244
if I'm still using
unconventional methods

409
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,899
to form a therapeutic alliance
with my addict sister.

410
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,248
No, I definitely meant
the first thing.

411
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:27,641
Have you asked out
that nurse yet?

412
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,164
Uh, no,
it's not gonna work out.

413
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,992
That didn't stop
you and Malvo.

414
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,015
- Tell your sister the truth.
- Ask out the nurse.

415
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,257
- Agree to drop both things?
- Yes.

416
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:35,563
All right.

417
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,480
District Attorney Belber,
Max Goodwin.

418
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:42,003
Thanks so much for coming in.

419
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,309
Ah, well, almost in.

420
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,919
Is this usually
where you greet your guests?

421
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,574
Just the ones who
persecute hardworking nurses.

422
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:48,966
If it's all the same,
I'd rather not let a fox

423
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,533
- into a henhouse.
- I figured that's what this

424
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,056
is about.
Now, look.

425
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,884
I'm glad that you reached out.

426
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,322
Bringing criminal charges
against medical personnel

427
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:57,758
is new ground,
and I want you to know

428
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,629
- where I'm coming from.
- Great, I appreciate that.

429
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:00,761
I'd love to know
where you're coming from,

430
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,415
'cause right now,
I don't see it.

431
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,417
Do you know what an M&M is?
It's a conference

432
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,766
that we have
after a patient dies.

433
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,333
And doctors and nurses
get together

434
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,899
to have a candid discussion

435
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,424
about everything
that we could've done better.

436
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,034
We look mistakes
right in the eye,

437
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,079
because that's how you learn.

438
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,908
And if admitting a mistake
means life in prison,

439
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:19,997
just how candid do you think
people are gonna be?

440
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,435
So it's your position that
medical deaths should be immune

441
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,914
- to criminal charges?
- No.

442
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,612
If a surgeon operates drunk,
throw 'em in jail.

443
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:27,701
But when a nurse does
everything possible

444
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,268
to save a life
in the face of dire illness

445
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:31,444
and a malfunctioning machine,

446
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,010
then maybe cut her some slack.

447
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,882
You know, I heard the same
line from the police union.

448
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:36,753
Do you think I should stop
prosecuting wrongful deaths

449
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,451
- with the NYPD too?
- Look, our nurse didn't

450
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,931
pull a trigger.

451
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,456
She made the best decision
she could at the time

452
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,414
under the circumstances.
And the truth is

453
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:47,634
it could've happened
to either one of us.

454
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:49,549
It was great
talking with you.

455
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,249
Do you hear how quiet it is?

456
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,165
We had to stop
taking ambulances,

457
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,994
because it's gridlock in there.
Do you know why?

458
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:03,127
Because our nurses
are quitting.

459
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,607
Everyone is afraid.

460
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,480
Please.

461
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,134
Let Andrea go home to her kids.

462
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,355
She will.

463
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,531
Ten years.

464
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,928
She already took a plea.

465
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,890
Why is nature therapeutic?

466
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,849
What is the point
of this activity?

467
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:33,375
All right, guys, I know
we got off to a rough start

468
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,377
with the phones and all that,
but hey,

469
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,031
look around you.
Take a look around.

470
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:40,687
Look at the wind blowing
through the trees, you know?

471
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:41,992
Look at the leaves
dancing in the wind.

472
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,430
Feel that air.
Feel the crispness.

473
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:45,866
Right?

474
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,563
These are all tactile
sensations that you can use

475
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:48,695
to bring yourself
back to the moment.

476
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,393
Where's the trail?

477
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:51,718
Where's the...

478
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:52,981
Oh.

479
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,484
- Uh...
- Well, we were so busy

480
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:56,746
looking at leaves.

481
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,259
I think it's that way.

482
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:06,047
No, no, it's, uh...

483
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,803
- No, I think it's over there.
- Was it that steep?

484
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,633
Dr. Frome, are we lost?

485
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,286
What?
No.

486
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,073
No.
Um, no, we just, uh...

487
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,816
We just need...

488
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,297
A sign.

489
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,822
There we go... a sign, guys.
Come on, follow me.

490
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,956
They must've put these here
for this exact reason.

491
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,130
Huh?

492
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:37,224
All right,
let's see what we got here.

493
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:41,533
What's it say?

494
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,123
"BP's low.

495
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,638
- She needs Levophed."
- I know.

496
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,613
"She needs Levophed now!

497
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:04,798
What the hell
are you waiting for?"

498
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:07,635
The MedRack's refusing
to dispense the med.

499
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,245
"How long have you been

500
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,986
- waiting?"
- Six minutes.

501
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,336
"Override the machine now.

502
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,818
If we don't act,
she's gonna die."

503
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,428
I have kids.

504
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,259
If I go to jail,
they'll have nobody.

505
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:22,867
- Get out of the way!
- Get out.

506
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,478
Elizabeth...

507
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:27,179
Elizabeth, if you do this,
it's on you.

508
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:39,754
Come on, come on.

509
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:47,675
Mm!

510
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,024
"Let's get her to the O.R.

511
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,115
for a Left Ventricular
Assist Device, please."

512
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,899
Was it the wrong med?

513
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,714
"It was the right med.

514
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,114
We just waited too long
to use it."

515
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,775
I spoke to your landlord,

516
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,931
and... hang on to your hat...

517
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:13,670
Mr. Palumbo's prepared to fix
every problem in this building.

518
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:15,392
- He will?
- Yup, he's gonna clean up

519
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:18,556
all the black mold.
The asbestos in the walls?

520
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,254
- Gone.
- And in the ceiling?

521
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,454
And in the ceiling.

522
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,635
Hey, while we're at it,
how does an exterminator

523
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,551
- for the cockroaches sound?
- It's about time.

524
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,165
Like you forgot the spiders.

525
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:29,425
Oh, no, no, no.
He'll deal with the spiders.

526
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,949
He'll deal with the rats.
He'll upgrade the furnaces.

527
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,690
He'll fix your windows.

528
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:35,692
He'll deal with the pigeons.

529
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,171
Right?
He's gonna repair

530
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,130
what's broken,
replace what's busted,

531
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:41,911
and get this place
back up to code.

532
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,511
How?

533
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,910
Yeah, um,
so just hear me out.

534
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:49,481
He will need
to increase your rent by 50%.

535
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:53,187
- Raise it?
- This is illegal.

536
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,711
- We have a lease.
- Are you kidding me?

537
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:56,756
- Oh, I signed a contract.
- Hey, easy now.

538
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,844
Do you think
we're made of money?

539
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:58,759
- Ridiculous.
- Come on.

540
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,107
Easy now.
Hey, I said hear me out,

541
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,935
remember?

542
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,286
Yes, it sucks that
you'll be paying more money.

543
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,375
But hey, that's already money
you're spending every month

544
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,986
on medical bills, right?
And on lost wages

545
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,553
from missing work
when you're sick.

546
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,076
I mean,
once this place is safer,

547
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,252
those expenses vanish.

548
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,123
Big picture,
you're breaking even.

549
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:20,302
Only now, you have
a safe and livable building.

550
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:21,868
Right?
What do you think about that?

551
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:23,043
- No way.
- No, thank you.

552
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,219
- Hell no.
- I think it sounds awful.

553
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,613
- No, no.
- I don't... I don't get it.

554
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,701
Mm-mm.

555
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:30,050
I missed "Blue Bloods"
for this?

556
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,443
I mean,
I really don't get it.

557
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,750
You won't lose a dollar,
and you'd fix the building.

558
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,405
That's right.
We'd fix it.

559
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:39,973
Maybe higher rents would cost
the same as our medical bills,

560
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,802
but we shouldn't have either.

561
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,674
This is
the owner's responsibility.

562
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,808
Not ours.

563
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,687
Footprints!

564
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,905
What?
Yes.

565
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,298
Oh, yes!
Yes, Bizzie,

566
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,735
you wonderful woods woman, you!

567
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,911
Very nicely done.
Okay.

568
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:06,260
Okay!
Guys, what have I been saying?

569
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,306
I said if we keep calm,
keep our eyes peeled,

570
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,916
and we stick together,
we will get out of here

571
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,830
- in one piece, right?
- I think these

572
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,441
are our footprints.

573
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:13,833
Hmm?

574
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,879
No, no,
I don't think that's true.

575
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,924
No, see the weird
worm thing in the middle?

576
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,970
Those are Austin's shoes.

577
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,844
I don't think
they look like worms.

578
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:26,280
Uh...

579
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,762
okay, okay, okay.
Yeah, um, okay, so

580
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:32,374
we know that we've been walking
around in circles, right?

581
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,027
That's good in a way.
That's a clue, right?

582
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:36,769
We know now more than we did
five seconds ago.

583
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:38,902
We do not wanna
keep going that way.

584
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:43,167
We wanna go one of,
um, uh, the other...

585
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,650
- Ways.
- Wait,

586
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:50,566
my dad said moss only grows
on the north side of trees.

587
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,264
Oh, Lev, yes.
Amazing!

588
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:54,526
Yeah, okay,
everybody come on over here.

589
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,180
Guys, come on.
Come check out the moss

590
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:57,576
over here.
We, uh...

591
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,014
Moss sucks.

592
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,407
North is not every direction,
moss.

593
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:09,933
Uh, Dr. Frome, I'm cold.

594
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:11,064
Yeah, I know you are, bud.

595
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:12,457
I know.
Me too.

596
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,633
Um, sorry about that.

597
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:15,982
You know,
if these clouds

598
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,984
weren't so dang thick,
we could use the shadows

599
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,291
from the trees
as, like, a sundial, you know?

600
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,166
- Get our direction that way.
- Those clouds look scary.

601
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,737
Oh, don't... don't worry
about the clouds, okay?

602
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,525
Dr. Frome, it's raining.

603
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,178
Yeah, I'm aware, Skyla.

604
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:40,354
Thank you.

605
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,096
Okay, uh, guys, find cover.
Find cover.

606
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,097
Come on.
Go, go, go.

607
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:45,969
Find cover.
Go.

608
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,013
Okay,

609
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:48,014
backs up against the tree.

610
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,625
Dr. Frome, my dad told me

611
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,151
never go under trees
when there's lightning.

612
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:00,810
Hey, Doc.

613
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,855
"How are you feeling?"

614
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,466
Glad to be alive

615
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,033
and able to speak
in normal English

616
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:10,213
instead of Pig Latin.

617
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:18,526
What is it?

618
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,051
"There's been
a complication."

619
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:26,879
The delay
in Justine Cerrado's care

620
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:30,274
caused permanent kidney damage.
She'll need a transplant,

621
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:35,627
and, um, her life will have
limits it did not have before.

622
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,500
But hey, legally speaking,
we're in the clear.

623
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:41,503
We were just
double-checking medications.

624
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:45,071
We were just, uh,
being prudent.

625
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:49,641
We were just covering our ass.

626
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:53,340
Guys, I can't invent
a better MedRack.

627
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:55,429
I can't fend off the D.A.
They could come after you

628
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,827
for an honest mistake,
and I can't protect you.

629
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:03,133
But if we're putting our
welfare ahead of the welfare

630
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:06,615
of our patients...

631
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,442
then we failed.

632
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:11,881
We might as well
shut the doors,

633
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,623
because patients first

634
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:18,627
is the only way
I know how to do this.

635
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,241
And if you can't do that,
then, uh...

636
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:25,593
Then you should quit.

637
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,771
And with everything
that's happening,

638
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,167
I wouldn't blame you.

639
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,563
Soup dumplings and memories

640
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,695
of our mother's
inebriated past.

641
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,349
Get 'em while they're hot.

642
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:48,221
Ah, these are, like, 95% MSG,

643
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:51,575
but they smell incredible.

644
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:02,366
Vanessa...

645
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,500
Three years sober...

646
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,938
Wow, that's, um,

647
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,417
that's impressive.

648
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,769
- Get out.
- Stop it.

649
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,772
What... okay, look,
can we just talk about this?

650
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,164
So I'm sober, who cares?

651
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:20,689
Who cares?
You've been lying to me

652
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:22,038
this whole time, Lauren!

653
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:23,430
I mean, what are you
even doing here?

654
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:25,781
Coming here to, like,
deprogram me or something?

655
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,696
Acting like we're best friends
all of a sudden

656
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,176
when you've been lying
to my face the whole time!

657
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,830
I'm sorry.
Why is my sobriety

658
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,832
any of your business?

659
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,051
I mean, you only know about it

660
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:36,661
because you went
through my stuff.

661
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:39,925
Yeah, in my house!
I was looking for Adderall!

662
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,187
I mean...

663
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,841
Classic druggie sister, right?

664
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,756
What will she do next?

665
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,237
Vanessa!

666
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,239
Okay, can you just...
Please, can you just stop?

667
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:51,241
- Get out of my way!
- I'm sorry!

668
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:52,372
I don't ever
wanna speak to you again.

669
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,852
I lied, I lied!
Okay?

670
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:55,898
I'm a liar!
But this... us?

671
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,161
This is not fake!
You know that!

672
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,250
Just... can you just
tell me what I can do

673
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:01,294
- to fix this?
- I'm sorry, Lauren.

674
00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:02,556
I haven't read your A.A. book.

675
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,297
I don't know
which step this is, exactly.

676
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:05,734
- You're not a step.
- You're just using me

677
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:08,258
to make yourself feel better
about your sad life,

678
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:10,129
about the crap
you pulled when I was a kid.

679
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:13,567
- No, I love you.
- You left me, Lauren...

680
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,746
With our psychotic mother
when I was nine!

681
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,749
Do you have any idea
how much worse things got

682
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,576
after you were gone?

683
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,928
I mean, literally.
Do you have any idea?

684
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,322
Right.

685
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:32,238
Get out.

686
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:35,415
Pick those up.
You...

687
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,288
Pick those up!

688
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,951
I was an 18-year-old
runaway drug addict.

689
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,954
And yeah, it sucks
that you couldn't come with me,

690
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:54,783
but I couldn't
take care of you.

691
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,046
And the real villain
of your life is Mom.

692
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,265
It's not me.

693
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:00,614
And now it's you.

694
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,268
It's you
and your terrible choices,

695
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:04,096
like the one
you're making right now,

696
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,881
acting like
I somehow betrayed you,

697
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:08,622
when what I am doing is
easily one of the nicest things

698
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,276
- anyone's ever done for you.
- Oh!

699
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,757
Right, okay.

700
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:14,019
Where are you going?

701
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,455
- To get high.
- Oh, yeah, great.

702
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,109
Hurt yourself
to get revenge on me.

703
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,458
- Go right ahead.
- Yup.

704
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:19,459
Wait, Nessa, wait.
I didn't mean it.

705
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,244
- Just...
- Know what, Lauren?

706
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:23,333
You wanna live here so bad?
Fine.

707
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,515
Go right ahead.

708
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,128
Nessa!

709
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,377
Hey.

710
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,859
Hey.

711
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:34,621
- Hey, Dr. G.
- Um, uh,

712
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:36,275
sorry.

713
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,493
Just expected it to be

714
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:40,409
a lot less
full of people who work here.

715
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:43,238
- Did you consolidate?
- I didn't have to.

716
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:45,192
Nobody left.

717
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,464
None of us got into this
business to cover our asses.

718
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,132
You guys said this place
needs a better owner...

719
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,656
Someone who cares about it
as much as you do

720
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,184
and who's willing to do
what it takes to keep it up.

721
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:14,886
Well, I found them.

722
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,839
- Who?
- You.

723
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,380
Actually, all of you.

724
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,497
- Some sort of joke?
- I can't afford a studio,

725
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,760
- never mind a whole building.
- This is ridiculous.

726
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,109
- Come on, Gabe.
- Hey, hang on.

727
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:29,763
Let me explain.
New Amsterdam's gonna loan you

728
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,287
the money... below market rate...

729
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:34,899
To convert this place
into a co-op.

730
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:38,067
That way,
you can all be owners.

731
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,486
And why would
a hospital do that?

732
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,429
Well, the short term is
it's a huge tax write-off.

733
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,345
Long term, you guys
are all such frequent flyers

734
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,713
that if we get you healthy,
we'll actually come out ahead.

735
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:54,440
But the monthly cost of each
unit will increase by 50%.

736
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,752
- It has to.
- Yeah, we know.

737
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:57,660
We already told you
we didn't want that.

738
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,749
Why on God's green Earth
do you think any of us

739
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,283
would pay
that much more in rent?

740
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,188
'Cause it's not rent.

741
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,965
It's a mortgage.

742
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,793
So instead of giving
your money away,

743
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:10,195
you'll be investing
in your future.

744
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,067
If you own,
the only thing limiting you

745
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:15,330
is how hard
you're willing to work.

746
00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,165
You wanna fix something?

747
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:19,300
Do it.

748
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:22,381
You can actually make this
place what you want it to be.

749
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:25,036
You know why?
Because you own it.

750
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:29,605
It's yours.

751
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:34,697
I've been dreaming
of fixing up this place

752
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:36,746
for 41 years.

753
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:43,666
Lobby party.

754
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,538
Yes, lobby!

755
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:58,852
This wasn't just for us,
was it now?

756
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,941
Well,

757
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:03,077
we all deserve a good home.

758
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:15,390
Wow, where did you learn
to build a fire like this?

759
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:17,091
YouTube.

760
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,221
That's impressive.

761
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,657
Tell my parents.

762
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,704
They're still mad
about what I did

763
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:26,619
to the side of the garage.

764
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:27,968
Right.

765
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,540
Well, guys, I am...

766
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,368
I am so sorry.

767
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:39,849
I am so, so sorry.

768
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:42,069
You know,
phones are a nightmare.

769
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:46,378
They are a brain-damage-causing
actual nightmare.

770
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:48,771
But, uh,

771
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,425
taking them away like that...

772
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:54,560
Yeah, that's not cool.
It's a therapist's job

773
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,997
to help people cope,

774
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,433
and I basically asked you guys

775
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:01,001
to stick your fingers
in your ears

776
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:03,006
and pretend
that phones don't exist.

777
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,139
That's not therapy.
That's, um...

778
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:11,142
that's, like,
scared-old-guy territory.

779
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,015
Yeah.

780
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,497
You know, and obviously,
phones aren't all bad.

781
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:21,674
For example,
you can use them to call 911

782
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:22,848
when you're lost.

783
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,375
Bingo, Bizzie.

784
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,421
Yeah.

785
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,684
You know, what I'm really
apologizing for, though,

786
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:36,371
is not for taking your phones
away or for getting us

787
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,480
hopelessly lost in the woods.

788
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:42,521
It's for not respecting
that you guys have

789
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:46,635
more than enough character
and fortitude to handle

790
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,699
anything that cell phones and
social media can throw at you.

791
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:53,934
I mean, look at you guys.
Look at this.

792
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,317
We're soaking wet.
We're lost in the woods,

793
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,051
and you're not panicking...

794
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,714
Not even a little bit.
You're lighting fires,

795
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:05,254
and you're being cool as
a bunch of cucumbers, you know?

796
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:06,983
I'm proud of you.

797
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,725
What was that?

798
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,416
A bird, maybe,
or something like that...

799
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,156
Austin, what was that?

800
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,473
My iPad.

801
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,040
Austin,
what is wrong with you?

802
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:24,737
- Why would you hide that?
- You had it this whole time?

803
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:26,086
He said phones.

804
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,827
Give it to me.
Give me the iPad.

805
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:30,656
- Okay.
- Hand it over.

806
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,790
Thank you.

807
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:47,107
Okay, all right,
we're good to go.

808
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,935
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

809
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:51,114
Oh, my gosh, Austin.

810
00:36:58,681 --> 00:36:59,728
Gabrielle

811
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:01,991
is my name.

812
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:03,254
Gabrielle.

813
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,258
All right.

814
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,782
I'm gonna get
one of those fancy drinks

815
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:12,045
you were talking about earlier.

816
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,829
You still out?

817
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:25,102
Yeah.

818
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:27,278
Yeah, I'm still out.

819
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:28,714
Are you one of those doctors

820
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:30,324
that think you're too good
for nurses, or...

821
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:32,021
No, no, no.

822
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,720
No, uh, I'm just one of those

823
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,289
doctors who's pushing 40,

824
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:39,725
and I'm nowhere near
where I thought I'd be

825
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,204
outside this hospital.

826
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:44,991
I'm looking for something
more permanent.

827
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,862
Mm.

828
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,865
You know, and
I have been for a long time.

829
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:54,261
How is that going for you?

830
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:57,833
So bad.

831
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,528
So bad,
you wouldn't believe it.

832
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:05,142
See?
Maybe you have just been

833
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:06,708
going about it all wrong.

834
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,232
How is that?

835
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:10,930
All I'm gonna say is

836
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:15,111
it's surprising how much fun
you can have in eight weeks.

837
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:25,552
Yeah?

838
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:28,080
Yeah.

839
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:36,521
You know what?

840
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:40,351
I think I owe you and
your grabby hand an apology,

841
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:43,354
because this morning,
when I was trying to make

842
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:46,400
your smoothie,
you kept trying to help me,

843
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,968
and I didn't let you.

844
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,404
But I should've,

845
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:53,712
because helping is everything.

846
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:54,800
Right?

847
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:55,801
- That's what...
- Yeah.

848
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:58,456
Yeah,
that's what family does.

849
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:02,242
And you...

850
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:07,247
You're all the family I got.

851
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:14,083
Maybe that's why
I get so... scared.

852
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:19,433
But the world has been
reminding me that...

853
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:22,697
That fear isn't something

854
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:25,265
that goes away.

855
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:27,224
It's just something you face,
right?

856
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:28,312
Yeah.

857
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,401
Yeah, so remember when I said

858
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,533
that blenders
were for big people?

859
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:33,665
Yeah?

860
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:36,320
That was silly,
'cause you are big.

861
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:38,321
You're the biggest.

862
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:43,152
That's why you are gonna
make a smoothie right now...

863
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:45,111
- All by yourself.
- Yeah.

864
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:47,766
- You ready?
- Yeah.

865
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,378
<i>♪ We were walking so long,

866
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:54,468

All right,
you wanna do the milk?

872
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:15,576
