00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,672
<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#fff840">"New Amsterdam"...</font>

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:05,892
I can... I can't be
who I want to be

3
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,392
with you.

4
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,936
I think
I might have to crash here.

5
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:12,214
Yeah, sure thing, sis.

6
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:13,478
You're sober, Lauren.

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:14,531
You can't handle
that kind of

8
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,466
- temptation.
- What I can't handle is guilt, okay?

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,494
She's a mess because I left
her there with my mother.

10
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:21,469
You went from
Norman Rockwell to screaming.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,345
Could've gone to jail.

12
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:24,055
No, we're not goin' fishing.
We're going home.

13
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,556
You've been pestering me
for months!

14
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:27,816
It sounds like
a textbook example

15
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,210
of someone
with bipolar disorder.

16
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:36,414
Friends.

17
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:37,691
Friends.

18
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:44,023
Move, move, move,
move, move, move.

19
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:45,296
Clear a path!

20
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:46,460
Clear a path!

21
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,406
Hey, you get Max's page?

22
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,726
You only got one?

23
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,282
- What do three 911s mean?
- Can't be anything good.

24
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,543
Oh, excuse me,
excuse me, coming through!

25
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,545
- Did he page everyone?
- Yes, this must be bad.

26
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,920
- Make a damn hole!
- Move aside, please.

27
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,273
Move. Move. Move.

28
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:05,465
Max, what's wrong?

29
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,001
- What's the emergency?
- What is it?

30
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,422
Is everything okay
with the hospital?

31
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:09,640
Is it a mass casualty?

32
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,211
- Tell me Veronica's not back.
- Hold on.

34
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:13,628
Just take a seat.
All right?

35
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:15,336
Come on in.
Why don't you take a breath?

36
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:19,000
In fact, why don't we all take
a nice, deep breath with me?

37
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,236
Ready? In...

38
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,859
And out.

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,696
There we go.
Doesn't that feel better?

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,765
Yeah?
Okay, now that we are

41
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,101
nice and relaxed,
I have some bad news.

42
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,960
You are all
in critical condition.

43
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,062
What... what does that mean,
exactly?

44
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,707
Well, it means that morale
for doctors

45
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:37,828
is at an all-time low.

46
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,898
You gotta be kiddin' me, Max.

47
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:39,984
Uh, not kidding.

48
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,664
Burnout and turnover
are at an all-time high,

49
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:43,970
and if it continues
at this pace,

50
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,016
we're not gonna have enough
staff to keep the doors open.

51
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,226
Yeah, you made this sound
like it was a real emergency.

52
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,879
This is a real emergency.

53
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,140
Your hours are too long.
Your downtime is too short,

54
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,586
and you don't have
the mental space

55
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,054
to take care of yourselves.

56
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,398
And if you can't do that,

57
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,500
how are you gonna
take care of your patients?

58
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,390
I got some surgeries
to attend to.

59
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:05,774
Well, actually, you don't,
because I took the liberty

60
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,312
of clearing
your entire schedule.

61
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,101
In fact, nobody in this room

62
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:16,048
has anything urgent
to do today,

63
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:20,867
because today, your one
and only patient is you.

64
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,929
I hope everyone gets as excited
as Dr. Lauren Bloom here.

65
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,165
Yes, question.
Elizabeth?

66
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,500
- "No."
- Okay, not really a question,

67
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,061
but, uh, the answer is yes.

68
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:34,375
We are all going to prioritize
the health issues

69
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,734
that we have been putting off,

70
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,220
because we're either
too busy or too tired.

71
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,664
- Now say it with me.
- Please don't.

72
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:41,718
We can do it.
Ready?

73
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,079
Doctors, heal thyself!

74
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,265
Oh, God.

75
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:48,726
Ooh.

76
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,882
Ooh, I think
the New Amsterdam newsletter

77
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,742
has found its centerfold.

78
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,594
Pretty sure you're not
allowed to say stuff

79
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,046
- like that anymore.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:02,244
Let me.

81
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,953
This latest Max plan is such
a ridiculous waste of time.

82
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,664
Suck it up.
I just got my first

83
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:11,983
mammogram in three years.

84
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:13,586
It had been weighing
on my mind,

85
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,823
but I had no time
to do anything about it.

86
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:18,143
- And?
- I'm in perfect health,

87
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:20,230
and you'll be too.

88
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:26,945
What?

89
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,148
If this is a bit,
it's not funny.

90
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:33,796
You... you have a short
PR interval and a delta wave

91
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,679
at onset of the QRS complex.

92
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:37,709
Are you suggesting
pre-excitation syndrome?

93
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:40,453
No, I am saying it flat-out.

94
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,265
You have
Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome.

95
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,984
I'm fitting you in for
a catheter ablation at 4:00.

96
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:49,513
Nah.

97
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,726
Floyd, you know the risks
of a re-entrant tachycardia.

98
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,758
What I do know is that
they're not as immediate

99
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,919
as the risk posed to my five
patients I had scheduled today.

100
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,559
Now, I did my part
for Max's stupid plan.

101
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:03,833
I'm gonna go tend to them.

102
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,263
I'll deal with this
on my next day off.

103
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,181
Oh, when is that?

104
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:12,281
Yeah, I'll see you at 4:00,
hot stuff.

105
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:16,129
So it's so nice to
finally meet you

106
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,776
in the flesh, Ronel, you know?

107
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,012
Not that our emoji-ladened
chats on the app

108
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:20,707
haven't been fun.

109
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,029
Cowboy hat, cowboy hat,
fireworks.

110
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,356
Uh, spaceship,
pretzel, sunglasses.

111
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:33,125
You've always been so busy,
and now you're suddenly free?

112
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,478
- Yeah.
- Did you get fired?

113
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:38,734
No, no...
Not that I know of, anyway.

114
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,500
No, no, I'm as shocked
as you are.

115
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:41,985
You know, my boss he, uh...

116
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:44,039
He insisted that all of us
take a health day...

117
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,055
You know, out of the blue.

118
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,302
Initially,
I was really resentful,

119
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,220
but then I realized that,
like, it had been so long

120
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,731
since I had actual
human-to-human contact

121
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,885
outside of work that I thought

122
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,080
this was the most healthy thing
I could do.

123
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,065
So you wanna hit it?

124
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,739
What... do I wanna hit it?

125
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,013
Uh...

126
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,749
Yeah, I mean, I'd love...
I'd love to hit it.

127
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,364
But you know,
I heard that this place

128
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,701
has a wonderful tarte Tatin

129
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,584
that's apparently
somethin' else.

130
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,942
It's nothing compared
to what I'd like to give you.

131
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:17,375
Doctor's orders, right?

132
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,563
'Scuse me.

133
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,191
Check, please.

134
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,345
I... so, sorry...

135
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,094
So, so sorry.

136
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,017
Okay, spoiler alert.

137
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,696
This one is going to be
clean as a whistle.

138
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,030
I mean pristine.

139
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,953
You seem real proud
of this sample.

140
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,703
Oh, I am, yeah.

141
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,905
You have any idea
how hard it is staying sober,

142
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:44,648
- living with my sister?
- Can't say I do.

143
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,692
Well, she wakes up
to tequila shots.

144
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,820
Yeah, her apartment
is like one big pharmacy.

145
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,655
Essentially,
the whole thing is, like,

146
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,656
one big trigger for me.

147
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,090
BP's good.
Now let's check your weight.

148
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,853
I guess I'd be lying
if I said it hadn't

149
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:04,611
tested my sobriety,
but she needs me, you know?

150
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,766
- Mm-hmm.
- What does it cost me, right...

151
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:08,836
To finally be there for her?

152
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:11,115
It looks like
you lost five pounds.

153
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Oh.

154
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:13,774
Why, thank you, doctor.

155
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,172
You need to stop
taking your Adderall.

156
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:17,665
I'm sorry, what?

157
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,681
You're underweight,
and the protocol is clear.

158
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,665
So I can't refill
your prescription,

159
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,641
and you'll have to hand over
any pills you have.

160
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,540
So you just want me
to quit cold turkey?

161
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,811
I'm just following
the protocols.

162
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,438
Yeah, but you're not
gonna hold me to that.

163
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:35,095
You know that this
is a class of medication

164
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,740
that makes it harder
to maintain weight,

165
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,985
and yours is dangerously low.

166
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,758
You know,
if I don't get my meds...

167
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,131
you know what happens.

168
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,594
My hands are tied here.

169
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,666
I get irritable,
anxious, distracted.

170
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:57,196
- I can't focus.
- Lauren...

171
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:58,715
the bottle.

172
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,465
I run
an emergency department.

173
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:04,618
I mean, I can't do that

174
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,218
if I, myself, am in a state
of emergency.

175
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,349
Look, come back at the end
of the week

176
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:15,767
for another weigh-in.

177
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:16,946
If you put on the weight,

178
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,071
I'm happy to give you
your pills back.

179
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:21,875
Okay.

180
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:27,995
Just take
the rest of the week off.

181
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,904
I'm perfectly capable
of running the E.D.

182
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,845
- if you recall.
- Actually, as I recall,

183
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,868
- you needed me to do it.
- Wow, already,

184
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,423
the moodiness is upon us.
That was fast.

185
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:36,549
No, it's just
a couple of pounds.

186
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:37,728
I mean, I'm gonna have it
handled by lunchtime,

187
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:38,774
'cause I got a plan...
Right there.

188
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,994
See?

189
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:43,446
- All right, let's do this!
- I've never been so inspired.

190
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,908
- What do we got?
- Displaced patient,

191
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,244
32 weeks gestation
and contracting.

192
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,953
Uh, why didn't we send her
up to the OB?

193
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:49,606
I did.
They sent her back... no room.

194
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,125
Oh, the cafeteria served
the eggplant parm again?

195
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,272
Like clockwork.
Every time, we get flooded

196
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:58,914
- with patients in labor.
- The ergots are gonna get ya.

197
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,532
Hi, Aria.
I'm Dr. Bloom.

198
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:05,797
So your contractions are
what we call Braxton-Hicks.

199
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:07,117
It's actually fake labor,

200
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,315
but it's nothing
to stress over.

201
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,999
My husband's in Cleveland.
Should he fly back?

202
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,610
No, no.
There is no need

203
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:12,904
to disrupt his day, okay?

204
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:14,348
What you need
is rest and peace.

205
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,878
So I'm just gonna move you
to a quieter part of the E.D.

206
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,777
where you can relax, okay?

207
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:22,537
I'll be right back to check
on you in just a moment.

208
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,045
All right, who's got grub?

209
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,033
I was gonna eat that one.

210
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:29,684
With that,
ladies and gentlemen,

211
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,513
we coast right into aggression.

212
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,365
Closed for the day, good.

213
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,279
Closed.

214
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,252
Closed, excellent.

215
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:40,100
Closed. Great.

216
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:41,553
Oh, hey.

217
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,959
Sorry to micromanage.
I'm just, uh, goin' around,

218
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:44,946
checkin' in to see how people

219
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,468
are doing
with today's mandate, so...

220
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:48,912
"Me?
Oh, well, uh, you know,

221
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,865
"I just took a power nap.

222
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,447
That was... wow.
Best five minutes of my day."

223
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,896
Huh, yeah, naps are good,
but I was kind of looking

224
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:00,818
for more of a designated,
real self-care day...

225
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,639
You know,
appointments and procedures,

226
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:05,577
that kind of thing.
Is there anything you've been

227
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,062
letting fall by the wayside?

228
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,264
- Mm-mm.
- "Nope."

229
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,998
Come on.
Surely there's something.

230
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,850
- What?
- Uh...

231
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,451
"Uh," what?
What?

232
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:21,088
What was that?
That was something.

233
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,866
That's "Him... him.
Tell... tell him."

234
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,303
That means, "Tell him."
I know what that means.

235
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:27,646
Tell me.

236
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,231
What?

237
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,648
He's right.

238
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,559
- Okay.
- "I need surgery.

239
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,584
But it's really
not a big deal."

240
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:38,975
Mm.

241
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:47,310
Uh, but see the thing is,
surgery is kind of a big deal,

242
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:50,186
because it's surgery.
So what is it?

243
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,006
I have...

244
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:51,973
"I have
carpal tunnel syndrome."

245
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,169
Well... well,
that's fixable, right?

246
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,861
"Yes, sure.
Uh, physical therapy,

247
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:01,446
"acupuncture,
icing your wrists twice a day,

248
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:05,116
"steroid shots and all that.
It did not work.

249
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:08,930
Now surgery
is the only option."

250
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:11,625
Well, uh, so you...
You get it.

251
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,744
"It is my hands, Max.

252
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,737
"Even if everything
goes perfectly,

253
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,849
I wouldn't be able
to use my hands for weeks."

254
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,405
- Well, but you...
- Stay!

255
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,932
Just...

256
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,282
Ignatius,

257
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,913
you look positively trounced,

258
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,719
though, not necessarily
in a bad way.

259
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,664
Hello, Dorian.
It's nice to see you.

260
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:43,640
You know, you would think
that being a psychiatrist,

261
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,223
you would know
a little more about tact...

262
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:46,683
You know,
especially after practicing

263
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:47,959
for what, 900 years now?

264
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,604
Ouch.

265
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:51,589
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,909
Dorian.
Dorian, I'm sorry.

267
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,556
Hey, I just... it's just...

268
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,429
It's us.

269
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:01,533
- Psychiatrists?
- No, gay people.

270
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,299
- Why is our culture like this?
- I completely agree.

271
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:07,265
I say this Gaga person
is no Streisand,

272
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,565
and I don't care who knows.

273
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,010
I am talking about
our obsession with sex, Dorian.

274
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,511
You know on some
of these dating apps,

275
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,378
they don't even want
a picture of your face?

276
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:15,781
- That's awful.
- Yeah!

277
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,305
What did you say
the name of that one was?

278
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,876
Of course, gosh.
It's dehumanizing, you know?

279
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,846
The last time I was
in the dating pool,

280
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,448
which was pre-internet,
you had to talk to someone

281
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:26,360
before you just took 'em home.

282
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:29,091
Yes, that's what gay clubs
have all been famous for...

283
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,191
- Talking.
- Look, I'm just saying

284
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:33,053
that I was shocked
at how bad it is out there.

285
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,289
That's all.

286
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:37,264
In my day,
the best I could hope for

287
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,244
was a furtive meeting
in a park,

288
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:42,147
while keeping my fingers
crossed that no vice cops

289
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,396
- were watching.
- Right.

290
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:47,314
Talking wasn't exactly
at a premium then either.

291
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,860
But what this sounds like,
to my experienced ears,

292
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,405
is a guy complaining
after a bad date.

293
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,591
No, no, wrong, completely.

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,018
Yeah, okay,
I mean, yes, I had a date.

295
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,755
I did have a date,
but it wasn't bad.

296
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:09,083
It wasn't bad at all.
It was just, you know, off.

297
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:10,350
He didn't want
to have sex with you.

298
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,838
Um, in fact, he did,
Rylance, thank you very much.

299
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,922
But it wasn't that.
It was his approach, you know?

300
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:18,843
It was his, um...
It was his directness.

301
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,677
He didn't really
wanna get to know me,

302
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,554
and it, uh,
it just threw off my game.

303
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,807
- That's all.
- You couldn't get an erection.

304
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,141
Oh...

305
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,316
Man, come on. Hey.

306
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,278
Yes, yes,
I couldn't get an erection.

307
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:34,027
The last thing you need is to
treat this issue with silence.

308
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,271
Oh, just because I don't want
my entire department

309
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,541
to know that I couldn't
get it up,

310
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
doesn't mean
I don't wanna deal with it.

311
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,709
Iggy, you just asked me
to agree with your rant

312
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,657
about gay culture, thus,
validating the notion

313
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,824
that your erectile dysfunction
is everyone else's fault.

314
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,852
But I won't, and it isn't.

315
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:54,680
If you're experiencing E.D.,
Iggy, that's about you.

316
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,217
What's going on?

317
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:11,610
I couldn't help but notice
you reassigned your surgeries

318
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,402
back to yourself,
so I took the liberty

319
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:17,223
of re-reassigning them
back to other surgeons.

320
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:18,726
I'm the chair.

321
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:19,767
You need approval to do that.

322
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,327
- Yeah, she got approval.
- What the hell?

323
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:22,500
Do you remember
that little speech I gave

324
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,622
about three hours ago
about doctors

325
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,814
taking care of themselves?
That wasn't just advice.

326
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,235
That was actually an order that
you're apparently ignoring.

327
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,444
So we have decided to take
matters into our own hands,

328
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,258
and we're gonna take care

329
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,070
of that
Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome.

330
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:34,655
Max...

331
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:35,757
Oh, I have an opening right
now.

332
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:36,925
You're in good hands,
my friend.

333
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,409
I never liked you...
Either of you.

334
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,189
- I am fine with that.
- I think he's excited.

335
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:42,341
Yeah, I think he is.

336
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:46,519
I'm just saying five pounds
is a lot to put on in one day.

337
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,485
I've got science on my side.

338
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,321
I've got an extra-large
vegan, veggie,

339
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,141
double meatless chicken pie.

340
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,571
Need our ooey-gooey
garlic cheese dipping sauce?

341
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,477
Ha, more than you even know.

342
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:00,003
Uh, okay...

343
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,413
- What, did you skip breakfast?
- Watch it, pal.

344
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,532
I've got a bunch
of scalpels back there.

345
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:07,524
All right, keep the change.

346
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,609
Thank you.

347
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:12,672
Okay,
time to pack on the pounds.

348
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:14,283
I've got a male, 30s,

349
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,446
complaining of stomach pains
and vomiting blood.

350
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,074
Or not.

351
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,941
Right, yeah,

352
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:21,680
okay, that sounds
like a stomach ulcer.

353
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:23,796
Stomach ulcer?
No, that can't happen.

354
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:24,782
I'm supposed to work
a double tonight.

355
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,150
I'm afraid Red Papayas
is gonna have

356
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:26,926
to make do without you.

357
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:28,754
We need to perform an emergency
endoscopy.

358
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,285
Let's get him
in the procedure room.

359
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,261
Okay, I need two
large-bore IVs,

360
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:33,698
normal saline, wide open.

361
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,221
Start a propofol drip, and let's...
oh, shoot,

362
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,993
uh, just a sec.

363
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,465
Hi, Aria, how are you feeling?

364
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,434
- Much better, thank you.
- Oh, great, 'cause we need

365
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:44,753
to move you to a quieter part
of the hospital, okay?

366
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,096
- Oh.
- You're gonna love it.

367
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,181
Oh, okay.

368
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,156
All right, let's do this.

369
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,206
I can't see a thing.

370
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,815
Okay.
Irrigating...

371
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,875
That ulcer's
gotta be in here, somewhere.

372
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,198
Come out.
Come out wherever you are.

373
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,789
Try deeper in the antrum.

374
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,841
Okay,

375
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,909
getting closer.

376
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:12,371
There, three o'clock.

377
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,655
Whoa, ulcer eroded
into the artery.

378
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,359
It's a real pumper.

379
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,214
I... I can't see anything.

380
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,876
BP's dropping.
You gotta zap it.

381
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,384
- No, Walsh, just...
- You gotta zap it now!

382
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:22,359
Those are
the exact coordinates.

383
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,297
- Now!
- Just zoom in.

384
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,660
D... on the monitor!
G... just...

385
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,391
Use fully
thought-out sentences!

386
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,629
Fully thought-out.

387
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,911
Switching to cautery mode.

388
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,106
You got it.

389
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,881
That was a close one.

390
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:43,888
Try salty food.

391
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,070
You really need
to get back on your meds.

392
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,945
Oh, um, hello.

393
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,781
Dr. Yamadi.

394
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:04,197
"Dr. Yamadi, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

395
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,250
Give me just a moment, please."

396
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:17,671
"So tell me about your cancer.

397
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,370
When were you diagnosed?"

398
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,244
I'm fine.
I'm here to see you.

399
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,930
Carpal tunnel, right?

400
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,775
"A hand surgeon?"

401
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,088
Well, not just
any hand surgeon...

402
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:32,648
The best hand surgeon
in Manhattan just for you.

403
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:35,016
"Oh, just for me?
Oh, well, thank you,

404
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,532
- wonderful."
- I know that you're worried

405
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,625
about taking care
of your patients, all right?

406
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,032
But by getting this surgery,

407
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,734
you are taking care
of your patients.

408
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,251
And Yamadi is so good

409
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,081
that you'll be performing
surgery again in no time.

410
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,792
"You have overstepped, Max."

411
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:49,227
All right, how much pain
are you in right now?

412
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,986
Scale of one to ten...

413
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:52,509
How much discomfort

414
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:54,304
in your wrists?

415
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:59,336
- "Six."
- What does that really mean?

416
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:03,609
- Eight.
- "Eight."

417
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,266
And today was
your clinic day,

418
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:06,672
which means no surgeries.

419
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,242
So how bad is it
when you operate?

420
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:14,688
Elizabeth.

421
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,689
Elizabeth.

422
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,992
You can tell me
it's none of my business.

423
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,829
And as a friend,
you'd be right,

424
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,392
but I am also
the medical director.

425
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:29,844
And as a surgeon,
your hands are your gift.

426
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,682
What would you say

427
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,844
to a patient who was ignoring
this kind of pain?

428
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,402
"Yes, Max, my hands

429
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:40,113
are my career.
But..."

430
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,575
"They're also my way
of connecting with the world."

431
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:53,820
"Surgery means I won't be able
to communicate for weeks."

432
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:56,668
"No ASL,

433
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:59,239
"no writing, no texting..."

434
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,337
"Not being able
to take care of myself,

435
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:06,234
and not being able to say
what I need."

436
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,239
"It's not recovery.

437
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,770
Max, you would be
putting me in a prison."

438
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:31,889
Oh, wonderful news.

439
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,273
I have high blood pressure,
and now I'm very anxious.

440
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,037
Oh, uh, take an ACE inhibitor
and call Dr. Frome.

441
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,593
My CAT scan was inconclusive,

442
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,706
so I'm gonna need another day
off for a follow-up.

443
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:42,815
You got it.

444
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,848
What?

445
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,292
There's a reason
I don't pick up

446
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,682
my meds from the pharmacy.

447
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,425
They remind me I'm sick.

448
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,792
Why can't I live
in denial like my patients?

449
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,535
Guess who did what you said

450
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,065
and got their ADHD meds
confiscated.

451
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,800
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.

452
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:02,699
What does matter
is you were right.

453
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:06,221
Taking care of yourself
feels great!

454
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,896
Ah.

455
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:14,714
Have you been
pleasuring yourself?

456
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:20,097
Uh, the correct medical
terminology nowadays

457
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,878
- is... is non-partnered sex.
- Of course.

458
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,065
Thank you.

459
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,345
So have you been whacking it?

460
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,207
Ugh, Dorian, come on.

461
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,484
Yeah, yes, yeah.

462
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,089
And you
and your husband's sex life?

463
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:37,045
My soon-to-be ex-husband
and I had a very good sex life.

464
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,011
Happy to hear it,
because it allows me

465
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,759
to state with confidence that
your problem isn't physical.

466
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,175
Well, good.
That's a relief.

467
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,706
You already knew it wasn't,
or you would've prescribed

468
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,026
yourself Viagra.

469
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:54,190
Your block
is psychological, emotional.

470
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,418
So get emoting.

471
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,378
What's this about?

472
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:05,348
Okay, um,

473
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,344
okay.

474
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,941
Yeah, um, um, today was, um,
I tell you, would've been

475
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:16,409
the first time I had sex
with somebody since Martin,

476
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,197
which is a big deal, you know?

477
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,585
In the heat of the moment,
with this beautiful guy,

478
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:26,596
I, uh, I didn't feel turned on.

479
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:28,624
I didn't feel...

480
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,284
You know,
I didn't feel charged.

481
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,104
I felt...

482
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,923
I felt guilty.

483
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,761
You know, 'cause there we are
about to do it.

484
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,379
We're gonna have sex,
and we're gonna share this,

485
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:41,366
like, sacred space, and uh,

486
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:44,645
that was me destroying
the final thread of connection

487
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,596
- between Martin and I...
- No.

488
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,442
I'm sorry, what?

489
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:52,345
Not buying it.

490
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,029
You don't get
to say that to me, all right?

491
00:20:56,503 --> 00:21:00,143
Your sex life wasn't a sacred
space when you were signing up

492
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,586
for no-face dating apps.

493
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,908
Whatever caused your E.D.,

494
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,937
it's not your ex-husband.

495
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:07,423
Try again...

496
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,934
This time with honesty, please.

497
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,737
Please set the gain at
200 microvolts per centimeter.

498
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:20,890
You know...

499
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:24,229
I might set the gain
to 100 microvolts.

500
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,050
It's more sensitive.
I don't wanna miss anything.

501
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,432
Set the gain at 100, please.

502
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:32,745
Set.

503
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,482
Let's start with
the radio frequency ablation

504
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,716
of the macro-reentrant
right atrial pathway.

505
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:38,104
Yo, hold on, hold on.

506
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:40,607
You're gonna approach the main
bypass track from the right?

507
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,409
The left's atrial pathway
might be easier.

508
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,620
You think we should approach
from the left?

509
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:47,169
Yes.
You know what?

510
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:49,031
As a matter of fact, just, uh...

511
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,575
Can someone grab me a laptop

512
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,644
and just put it here,
bedside?

513
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,644
- A laptop?
- Yeah, put it right here.

514
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:57,628
I could probably
just do it myself.

515
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,144
You can do it yourself?

516
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:01,480
I just...
All I need is my right hand.

517
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:04,276
Oh, okay, great.

518
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,314
Hey.
Diana, where you goin'?

519
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,589
Okay, I'll shut up.

520
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:20,559
Can I, uh, talk to you...
Talk to you for a minute?

521
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,457
"Sorry, I'm busy.
I can't talk right now."

522
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:26,021
Yeah,
I found a lump in my neck,

523
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:27,668
making breakfast
for Luna this morning,

524
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,067
and, uh, it wasn't there,
and then suddenly...

525
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,068
It was,

526
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,153
and, uh,
I'm walking Luna to school,

527
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,808
and I'm thinking,
you know, Georgia is gone,

528
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:39,956
and now, Helen is gone,
and then what if in a year...

529
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,933
What if I'm gone,

530
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:45,964
and I just leave Luna...

531
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,779
alone?

532
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,427
Max...

533
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,603
It almost, uh, killed me

534
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:56,199
the first time...
The chemo and the radiation.

535
00:22:56,284 --> 00:23:00,503
I got through it,
but what if I don't next time?

536
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,260
I guess that's why
I'm pushing everyone...

537
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,871
Pushing you so hard,

538
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,726
'cause you can't push off
what your body needs,

539
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:11,245
not till tomorrow
or next week.

540
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:12,861
It's just today.

541
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:23,714
So anyway, I got an MRI
when I first got here.

542
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:27,326
"When do you
get your results?"

543
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,565
Oh, later this afternoon.
Would you take a look?

544
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,609
"I don't think I can."

545
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,201
Why not?

546
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:41,066
"I'll be in surgery."

547
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,943
"For my wrists."

548
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,332
Mm.

549
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:59,635
<i>Nurse Parker, ER.
Nurse Parker, ER.</i>

550
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,840
Wow, trying to get into

551
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:13,441
the "Guinness Book
of World Records"?

552
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,135
You know, the key is dipping
that into water first.

553
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,329
Did I call for a consult?

554
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:21,488
School bus jumped a curb.
We're about to get flooded

555
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:23,208
with a whole lot of bumps
and bruises, which means

556
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:27,667
your disgusting gorge-fest
is gonna have to wait.

557
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,034
Fine.

558
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,143
Do I have something
in my teeth?

559
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,877
Funny.

560
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,849
I need a portable chest,
bay 30!

561
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,671
I got
multiple head lacerations

562
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,366
and possible concussion in 27.

563
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,227
Okay, let's order a CT scan.

564
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,042
- Which?
- Both.

565
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:46,419
Bus driver hit
the windshield.

566
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:47,824
- Is he critical?
- Vitals stable.

567
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,574
Okay, let's get him
to Trauma One.

568
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:53,440
Okay, um, I need an air splint
for the soccer coach, bay 25!

569
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,622
- My son, Jabari...
- Yes, yeah, I've seen him.

570
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:56,707
He's fine.
He's in Bay 5

571
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,710
with a broken wrist
and really dark sense of humor.

572
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,370
- Huxley.
- I'll take you.

573
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:06,199
Uh, all right,
let's fix this broken pinky.

574
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,573
All right, okay, on three.

575
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:08,683
- One, two...
- Wait.

576
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,885
- Is it gonna hurt?
- Not at all, okay?

577
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,970
On three.

578
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,762
But wait...

579
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,847
I'm scared.

580
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,932
Arlette,
I need help over here!

581
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,335
Bay 24!

582
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,918
We all get scared, but we can't
go through life with a pinky

583
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:23,372
shaped like a bendy straw,
can we?

584
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:24,464
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:26,644
On three. One, two...

586
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:28,523
Brunstetter, splint!

587
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,201
See?
Easy-peasy.

588
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:31,395
Kid with LLC?

589
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,863
All right, I need two IVs

590
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,411
- and a portable chest.
- I paged surgery.

591
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:35,908
Okay, now page
every other department.

592
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,309
Right.
Hey, how you feelin'?

593
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,520
Yeah, I'm a little hungry.
Go.

594
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,985
What's happening to me?

595
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,944
You're about to have a baby.

596
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,988
Hey, can we get
some help over there?

597
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:55,200
Busy!

598
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:03,652
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

599
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:05,260
The truth.

600
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,658
How hard is that?

601
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,699
Not the first time you've heard
that today, one suspects.

602
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,465
Oh, man, my marriage
of 15 years is ending,

603
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,118
and I don't think
it's that ridiculous to suggest

604
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:22,690
that maybe that's
the root of my problem.

605
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,518
Tell me about your date.

606
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,053
Um, I did already.

607
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:28,635
Not the boudoir.

608
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,747
The date.

609
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:31,988
All right, all right.

610
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:34,518
So he was hot.

611
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,107
You know, way out of my league.

612
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:37,885
That's not me being
self-deprecating.

613
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,413
That's just the facts,
all right?

614
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,232
Objectively speaking,

615
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:43,312
he was like if Apollo
walked off of Mount Olympus.

616
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:47,346
You know, but our profiles
matched up on the app,

617
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,964
and, uh,
I didn't pursue it at first,

618
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,519
because I thought
it was too far-fetched.

619
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:53,755
But then he beeped me.

620
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,968
Is that a euphemism?

621
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:57,760
Is that a what?

622
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,417
No, he beeped...
If you like someone's profile

623
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:01,694
on the app, you beep them.

624
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:02,430
You p... you ping them.

625
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:05,101
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

626
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:08,870
Anyway, he set it up.
He reached out,

627
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,938
and, uh,
and then he propositioned me

628
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,425
before we even got dessert.

629
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,387
Essentially,
it was the easiest date

630
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:15,998
of all time.
You know, all I had to do

631
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:18,526
- was just say yes.
- Hmm.

632
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,287
Sounds familiar.

633
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:21,943
Oh, is that your usual?

634
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,362
Must be nice to be so popular.

635
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,698
It's familiar,
because it's extremely

636
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:30,284
reminiscent of your first date
with someone else.

637
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:39,076
Martin?

638
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:41,446
Isn't that your origin myth?

639
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:47,033
Staggeringly handsome Martin
swoops down on dear, sweet Iggy

640
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,651
at the bar
and picks him right up.

641
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:52,510
The location's different,
but the dynamics...

642
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:54,288
Exactly the same.

643
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:59,628
Moments ago, you said your
marriage of 15 years is ending.

644
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:03,901
Now, that is a sentence without
a subject, but this divorce

645
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,706
didn't just happen.

646
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,110
Your relationship is ending

647
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:10,065
because someone
decided to end it.

648
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:11,552
Which of you was it?

649
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:14,742
Me.

650
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,186
Damn right.

651
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,911
You felt so strongly
it was over

652
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,899
that you upended
your entire life,

653
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:24,789
and then for your first
post-Martin intimacy,

654
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,493
you chose a man
who replicated every part

655
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,245
of the relationship
you just left.

656
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:33,839
Your impotence
wasn't your body failing.

657
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,698
It was your body
giving you a warning.

658
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:40,401
This is not what you want.

659
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,241
Why did you end you marriage?

660
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,097
Because I couldn't be
who I wanted to be.

661
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:53,737
Well, marvelous news...

662
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:55,142
Now you can.

663
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:58,838
The question is
who do you wanna be?

664
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:07,604
I was out of line,
and I apologize.

665
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:09,158
Keep going.

666
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,987
I have a hard time

667
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:15,201
giving up control, and...

668
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:17,538
I'm sorry.

669
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,077
Uh...

670
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,765
Guess who's behind the wheel
when I'm in a car.

671
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,757
At a barbecue,
guess who's at the grill.

672
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,788
I think it all comes down
to...

673
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,718
my dad leaving
when I was a kid.

674
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:45,615
I mean, you know how it goes.
Everyone said,

675
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:48,640
"You gon' be the man
of the house now."

676
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:51,827
I guess I took that to heart,

677
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:53,514
and, uh,

678
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,713
I never let it go.

679
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:58,234
So you didn't have a mother?

680
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:03,031
Yeah, uh,
yeah, I had a mother.

681
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:06,210
Was this mother not capable
of running the household?

682
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,009
Well?

683
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:11,968
Answer the woman.

684
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,679
Yeah, uh, yeah.

685
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,813
I guess she... she was capable...

686
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,804
Is... is very capable.

687
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,114
She's a force of nature.

688
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,692
So you're telling me that
your mother was a competent,

689
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,403
highly intelligent woman
who knew how to do

690
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,226
what she needed to do.

00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,712
I started here last week.

779
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,561
- How do you like it?
- Dr. Reynolds,

780
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,672
I have worked
on four continents,

781
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,618
in six countries
and 27 different cities,

782
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:59,235
and I can say without a doubt

783
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,353
that you are the worst patient
I've ever encountered.

784
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,601
And Dr. Flores, she's literally
drinking in a bar right now

785
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,345
because of you.

786
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:14,353
Hey,
what'd you say your name was?

787
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:17,315
I didn't.

788
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:20,947
Hm.

789
00:36:24,563 --> 00:36:26,214
Okay,
get your prescription pad.

790
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:27,117

791
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,105

- Get it.

00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,034
Okay.

793
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,735
- Wow.
- Told you.

794
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:42,103
You actually lost a pound.

795
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:44,121
No, that's not possible.
No, I... I gained at least

796
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,999
five pounds... what?
No, that's impossible!

797
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:50,436
I mean, I... I housed, like,
two orders of egg rolls.

798
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:52,666
I mean, I crushed
the stuffed-crust pizza,

799
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,739
a bear claw.
I mean, how have I not gained

800
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:55,733
any weight?

801
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,236
Wha... I raced
around all day today

802
00:36:58,336 --> 00:36:59,576
searching
for high-calorie food.

803
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,615
I mean, I even skipped
a bathroom break,

804
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,982
so I could run
across to third for poutine.

805
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:07,110
There's gotta be some kind
of mistake with this thing.

806
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,111
Well, check your phone

807
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:09,959
and see how many steps
you walked.
