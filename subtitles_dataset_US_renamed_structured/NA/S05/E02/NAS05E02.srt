1
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,218
Okay.

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,289
Hi.
I'm Ignatius.

3
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:08,492
Nope. It's pretentious.

4
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:09,688
I, uh...

5
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,840
Hey, my friends call me Iggs.

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,407
No, they don't.
Dr. Igg... Dr. Iggs.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,756
Okay. Hey, I'm Ignatius.

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,934
Dr. Iggs. I'm Iggy.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,414
And would you please kill me?

10
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:23,897
Uh, hi, my name is Iggy,

11
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,687
and I am in hell.

12
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:29,162
Oh, my God, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

13
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,643
Just... hey, hi.

14
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,407
Hey.
Um.

15
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:34,726
Hey, you know what I am?

16
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:35,985
I'm a psychiatrist.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,695
I'm a psychiatrist.

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,007
I'm a psychiatrist.

19
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,919
Oh. Hey, there.

20
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:52,272
Some might call me
a textbook Scorpio.

21
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:53,405
Watch out.

22
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,104
I would say a sense of humor
is the most important thing.

23
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:59,999
Communication
is the most important thing.

24
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:03,554
Patience is the most
important thing?

25
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,601
No.

26
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,481
Hi, my name is Iggy,

27
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:14,568
I am going through a divorce,
I have four amazing children,

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,093
and I'm on this app because...

29
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:20,882
Well, because who wants
to go through this awful,

30
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:22,983
confusing, joyous world alone?

31
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:33,046
Yeah.

32
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,776
All right.

33
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,577
<font color=#FF00FF>*NEW AMSTERDAM *</font>

35
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,421
Good morning.

36
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,477
Morning.

37
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,960
Yeah, oh, yeah, I'll... bye.

38
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,248
I mean, I just...
Tell me honestly.

39
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:38,400
Am I too old to date on an app?

40
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:39,968
I'm not worried about
you meeting somebody.

41
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,361
I am worried about you

42
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,445
marrying the first guy
you date, all right?

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,797
So let's cross that bridge
when we get there.

44
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,360
All right, don't... don't
let me do that, by the way.

45
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:47,148
Well, listen.

46
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,199
It's just like my mom always
said when I was with Edie.

47
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:52,694
There are plenty
of fish in the... sea.

48
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,938
That was weird.

49
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,234
Iggy, this is my father,
Horace.

50
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,977
- Oh.
- Dad, this is Iggy.

51
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,632
Yeah, hi.
Nice to meet you, finally.

52
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,242
I'm Iggy. Pleasure.

53
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,450
All right, then.
Come on, we're going fishing.

54
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,413
Today? Wait. Now?

55
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:10,889
The bass will be
sleeping by noon.

56
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,508
I... I can't.
I'm at work.

57
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,569
I'm working.

58
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,659
I'm supervising a resident's
fem-pop bypass this morning.

59
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,109
There's got to be other
doctors in this hospital.

60
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,890
That is true.

61
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,739
I'm sorry, Dad, this is
not how I run my department.

62
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,654
This is not about how
you run your department.

63
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,702
It's about how
you run your life.

64
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,507
I can't. I'm sorry.

65
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:39,687
Well, suit yourself.

66
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,288
But don't tell me I didn't try.

67
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,012
What are you doing?
You wanted this, right?

68
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,624
No, not like that.
Not out of the blue.

69
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,288
You can't control
how love comes into your life.

70
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,411
All right?
That's good advice for me, too.

71
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,218
Okay.

72
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:02,374
Hey, Pop, wait up. Hey.

73
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,988
Whoo-hoo.
That's what I'm talking about.

74
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:14,968
Hey, good morning.
New haircut?

75
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,449
Look, I know Casey
is out of town,

76
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,306
so you need someone
to gossip with,

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,835
but may I suggest,
quite literally,

78
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,744
anyone else
in our entire department?

79
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,878
Ooh, speaking
of our department,

80
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:27,749
Layla's visa finally
got approved,

81
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,446
which means, drum roll please.

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,351
No.

83
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,906
She's finally moving
out of my apartment

84
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,300
and into her own place.

85
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,844
You know, maybe you can
call Casey, Face Time him?

86
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:36,715
I don't know.

87
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,898
All that's left to do now

88
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,856
is to pick up my clothes
from storage,

89
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,851
which I am dreading,
but I need them, you know?

90
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,757
I've been living in the same
eight outfits for months

91
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,741
and my undies are
practically translucent.

92
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,903
Why did you wait till
things were see-through?

93
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,165
I mean,
most storage places let you

94
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,367
get things whenever you want.

95
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,648
Yeah, well, it's not
that kind of storage.

96
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:03,155
Brunstetter, a word?

97
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:06,963
What are you doing?

98
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,184
She can't afford her
blood pressure meds,

99
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:09,881
and it's only 40 bucks, so...

100
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,792
Okay, we don't pay
patients out of pocket.

101
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:12,694
I know.

102
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,109
Even in situations like this.

103
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,624
For every Esther, there are
a dozen more just like her.

104
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,413
I know, it's just...

105
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,429
It's hard not to do
something when I can.

106
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,834
You can pick up your
prescription at a pharmacy.

107
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,287
Thank you.

108
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,929
You really didn't need
to do this.

109
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,750
It's okay.
It's not a problem at all.

110
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,359
Oh, hang on.
Just a little problem here.

111
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:52,138
Sorry, guys, I'm just
a little short on cash.

112
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:55,446
Oh, Max, Max.
Do you mind spotting me?

113
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,187
Oh, sure.

114
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,038
Happy to help.

115
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,351
Sorry. Thank you.

116
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:02,656
Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,602
Let me guess. Budget meeting?

118
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:07,767
Oh, this is my new and
improved cost savings plan.

119
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,344
Worked all week on this bad boy.

120
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:10,790
All right, how much
are you going to save?

121
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:13,585
$432.

122
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,273
Ooh, that's going
to be good meeting.

123
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,048
Well hey, you just had
to borrow 5 bucks from me.

124
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:18,293
You're not one to talk.

125
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,273
All right, do you know what?

126
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,343
You had to spot me because

127
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:22,032
my patient couldn't afford
her blood pressure meds,

128
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,500
and since it took
just 40 bucks to save her life,

129
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,952
- that is what I did.
- Hmm.

130
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,503
And we see patients like
her every single day, Max,

131
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,248
stuck in the
Medicare donut hole,

132
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:31,785
unable to afford their meds.

133
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,273
I mean, some of them can't
even afford a daily meal.

134
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,175
I mean, if they had just
a little extra cash,

135
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,671
they wouldn't keep
ending up in the ED.

136
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,797
All right, well, that was not
the reaction I was expecting.

137
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,931
But that is a great
savings plan, Lauren.

138
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:52,239
Oh, no.

139
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,655
This is Canaan Ochoa,
thrown from vehicle.

140
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,125
Abrasions, hemothorax,
and crush injury

141
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,599
to the right shoulder
and rib cage.

142
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,562
Give me a rapid infuser
and notify the blood bank.

143
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,784
Prepare for rapid
sequence intubation.

144
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:07,978
Make sure we have a humeral
head retractor in the kit.

145
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,469
It's extensive crush injury.

146
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,823
All spreaders and gougers
on the tray.

147
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,155
On my count, one, two, three.

148
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:19,944
Work up that MAYSI score.

149
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:22,181
Blood bank's been notified.

150
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:26,106
It's probably
gonna require a drain.

151
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:29,160
Problem looks too extensive
for a transhumeral procedure.

152
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,555
Can you feel that?

153
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,001
No.

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,633
Anticipate a shoulder
disarticulation.

155
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,504
All right, what about now?

156
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,715
Anything?

157
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,197
What's wrong with me?

158
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:45,826
The accident
crushed your shoulder.

159
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,271
Your bones, muscles,
nerves, blood vessels,

160
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,777
they're all badly damaged.

161
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,129
Oh, my God.

162
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,302
Determine if the patient
is a candidate for...

163
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,606
All right,
we can save your life, Canaan,

164
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,871
but the operation
is going to require

165
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,067
the amputation
of your right arm.

166
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:01,732
W-What?

167
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,769
No, you can't take my arm.
Please, please.

168
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:07,829
The artery in your shoulder,
it's been weakened.

169
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,297
It could rupture at any second.

170
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,921
If that happens,
you will die within minutes.

171
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:13,192
We need to operate now.

172
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:16,288
No, no, there has
to be some other way.

173
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:17,730
I wish that there were.

174
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,168
Well, don't I have
kind of say in this?

175
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,388
Of course.

176
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:23,090
We need your permission
to operate.

177
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,882
Okay, well, you don't have it.

178
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:32,640
You can't take my arm.
I'd rather die.

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,637
Wow, we made good time.

180
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,121
This is really something.

181
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,598
Never been out here before.

182
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,427
- Here, hold this.
- All right.

183
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,864
- Want me to grab it?
- Nope.

184
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:05,137
Wow.

185
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:11,004
This is beautiful, Pops.

186
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:15,552
It's just the two of us,
father and son,

187
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,658
spending some good quality...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:18,922
Where are you going?

189
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,460
The best spot
is just down here.

190
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,244
Yeah, but the sign.

191
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,550
Oh, they got to put that up.

192
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,763
Just making sure
we not terrorists out here

193
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,442
trying to mess with the
New York City drinking water.

194
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,791
It's nothing.

195
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,450
Yeah, but it clearly
says no trespassing.

196
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:35,831
You always mind the rules,
Floyd.

197
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,551
Good kid.

198
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,087
Never too late to fix that.

199
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,806
Oh, come on, now.

200
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:49,193
It ain't fishing if you ain't
trespassing just a little.

201
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,062
Yo, Pops, wait up.

202
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,723
Hey, I got your page.
How can I help?

203
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:09,115
My patient needs his right
arm amputated at the shoulder

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,510
or he's going to be dead
within a matter of hours.

205
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:14,470
However, he is refusing
the life-saving surgery,

206
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:18,474
so I need you to
declare him incompetent

207
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:20,519
so that I can move
forward with the operation

208
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,223
and save his life.

209
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,004
Okay, do you know who that is?

210
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,293
- Who?
- That's Canaan Ochoa.

211
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,926
He's the starting pitcher
for the Brooklyn Cyclones.

212
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:42,873
Morning.

213
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,489
Now, who's ready
to have their world

214
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,536
completely rocked
by my new plan?

215
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,460
Let's see,
your last cost-saving plan

216
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,974
was equal to the price of
a one-way flight to Rochester.

217
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,552
Well, then, buckle your
seat belt, Madam Chairwoman.

218
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,249
$5,000.

219
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,295
That is the average cost

220
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,080
when a patient
comes through our doors

221
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,778
at this hospital,
but I have found a way

222
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,200
to reduce this number to...

223
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,467
50.

224
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:11,403
- Any questions?
- Yes, is this a joke?

225
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,404
Nope, there's nothing funny
about savings like these.

226
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,964
There's no way this is legal.

227
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,326
Well, that's a great question,

228
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,450
and I'm glad you asked.

229
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,453
We're going to accomplish this
with targeted

230
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:22,108
monetary prescriptions
specifically designed

231
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,758
to nip expensive
and avoidable hospital stays

232
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:25,840
right in the bud.

233
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,975
This expression you see?
Disbelief.

234
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,202
Oh, okay.
Well, let me prove it to you.

235
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:33,423
Fund a one-day pilot program,
and if it succeeds,

236
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:34,817
we make it permanent

237
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,879
and we sit back
and we let the savings roll in.

238
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:44,124
It's hard to argue
with those numbers.

239
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,954
Yeah, she's right,
so let's not argue.

240
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,571
All right, fine. All in favor?

241
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:58,559
Your pilot program
is hereby approved.

242
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:00,742
Thank you, Karen.

243
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,625
You mind showing me
how you plan on implementing

244
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,365
this revolutionary,
never-been-thought-of program

245
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,512
in just one day?

246
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,887
I thought you'd never ask.

247
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,804
This is going to change lives.

248
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,184
Oh, dear God.

249
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:36,934
Hi. Mr. Ochoa?

250
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,484
Hi, I'm Dr. Frome.

251
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,052
Can I ask you a few questions?

252
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,186
Do what you got to do.

253
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,447
Okay, thank you.

254
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,004
Can you tell me what year it is?

255
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,723
2022.

256
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,786
And where are we right now?

257
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:53,801
A hospital.

258
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:57,526
And if you found
a stamped letter on the ground,

259
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,582
what would you do with it?

260
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,832
You think I'm crazy.

261
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,409
You have rejected
life-saving medical care,

262
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,200
and it is my job to determine
whether you're of sound mind

263
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,051
to sign your death warrant
today.

264
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:14,040
That's not the kind of thing
that we want to get wrong,

265
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,676
understand?

266
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,223
All right.

267
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,831
Do you have any family
that would be impacted

268
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:23,629
by your choice to die?

269
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,926
No, my team was my family.

270
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,145
I already lost them.

271
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,655
You know,
many successful people

272
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,622
have a brutally hard time
separating the sense of self

273
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,412
from their career.

274
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,413
T-this isn't my career.

275
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:42,504
Okay, all right,
it's not your career.

276
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,810
Got it.

277
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:46,981
So tell me, what is it?

278
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,231
This is my life.

279
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:53,559
This is... I don't
even know the word.

280
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,465
You're calling?

281
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,051
You know the first game
I ever pitched?

282
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,004
I left my body. For real.

283
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,466
I mean, I was up there just
thinking about all the things

284
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,749
I had to do, you know,
move my ankle here,

285
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,442
adjust my hips there.

286
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,614
And then suddenly, I was just...

287
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:20,926
watching it all happen,
10,000 tiny movements,

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,301
and then bam.

289
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:28,546
That ball soared right to
where it was supposed to go,

290
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:31,118
and it may have been
me doing the wind-up,

291
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,145
but God was throwing that ball.

292
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,289
And if I can't have that...

293
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:45,281
I don't want to live, man.

294
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,469
I know what I'm choosing,
doctor.

295
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,961
So if I found a stamped
envelope on the ground,

296
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,781
I'd mail it.

297
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,656
Cancel the surgery.

298
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:26,618
23-year-old jumper off
the Hell's Gate Bridge,

299
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,392
now with multiple
lower extremity fractures.

300
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,751
Heart rate,
respirations normal.

301
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:31,212
We got to him
in the nick of time.

302
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,310
Stay with us, kid. We got you.

303
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,538
I messed up. I'm sorry.

304
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:38,976
Okay, let's get him to Bay 29.

305
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:40,065
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

306
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,321
Just promise us once
they fix you up,

307
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,714
you'll come by the station
and say hi.

308
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:44,541
Patient ortho and psych, stat.

309
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,062
Mike?

310
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,672
Mike? Man down!

311
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,719
Any medical history
I should know about?

312
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,374
No, nothing.
Mike's in perfect health.

313
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,854
He's the one
who saved the jumper.

314
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,031
- We need a stretcher!
- I'm on it.

315

00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,875
Wow, it really works.

00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,056
What are you going to
spend your prescription on?

318
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,109
Oh, my knees are terrible.

319
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:15,606
I'm a waiter, but I
haven't been able to work,

320
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,750
so I'm getting orthotics.

321
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,448
Great.

322
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:21,820
There you go. Help yourself.

323
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,109
Who's next?

324
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:24,094
Hi, there.

325
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,133

Mm.

341
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:05,408
Uh, I was prescribed cash
for a bus pass.

342
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,410
Walking to work in this heat

343
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,762
was triggering
my extreme asthma.

344
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:15,289
Yeah, that's... may I try? Hmm.

345
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,657
I think this well has run dry.

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,232

is no longer any good?

This time, jig it a little
when you reel it back.

349
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:49,567
I never knew you
liked fishing this much.

350
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,670
Ever since I was a kid.

00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,397

watch the rod tip.

Rod tip. Right.

353
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:05,052
Oh, not like that.

354
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,646
You try to hook them,
not tickle them.

355
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,821
Hey, man, you never
taught me how to fish.

356
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,826
How am I supposed to know
what I'm doing out here?

357
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,782
Yeah, I never taught you
how to be a surgeon neither,

358
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,912
and that turned out just fine.

359
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,664
Oh, Pops, I got something.

360
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,637
Wait, what... what do I do?

361
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,368
Run!

362
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,145
What?

363
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,455
Oh, crap!

364
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,937
Son of a...

365
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,615
Lungs are clear.

366
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,861
- Regular heart rhythm.
- EKG looks fine.

367
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,602
Pupils reactive,
no signs of head trauma.

368
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:52,904
So it's not cardiac.

369
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,606
It's probably not subdural.

370
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:57,818
- No signs of concussion.
- No signs of bleeding.

371
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,965
It doesn't make any sense.

372
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,046
Mike was fine before
he went in the water.

373
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,309
He didn't even hesitate.

374
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,465
He dove right in
and pulled the guy to shore.

375
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,480
He's dry drowning.

376
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,043
But there's no water
in his lungs.

377
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:09,254
He must have inhaled

378
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:10,735
some small particles
when he dove into the river.

379
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,239
His airway is blocked
due to severe laryngeal spasm.

380
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,633
We can't oxygenate him.

381
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,756
There's no air
that's getting in.

382
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,063
No, we need to intubate now.
Come on.

383
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,114
If one of your
patients told you

384
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,834
that they were going
to go home and hang themselves,

385
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:27,882
wouldn't you stop them?

386
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,144
That's not the same thing.

387
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,396
Mental health care professionals

388
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,637
intervene if someone
demonstrates a plan.

389
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,167
If a patient is actively
going to pursue self-harm,

390
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:36,429
yes, of course, I step in.

391
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,214
But Canaan isn't doing anything.

392
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:41,692
He's just refusing to let us do
something, which is his right.

393
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,311
- Don't hide behind semantics.
- Let's call this what it is.

394
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:45,916
We are letting him die.

395
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:46,918
No, we are not.

396
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:48,312
We are letting a patient
tell the doctors

397
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,359
what they can
and can't do to his body.

398
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:51,387
That's it.

399
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:52,522
That's what New Amsterdam
stands for.

400
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:53,957
That's why we're here.

401
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,361
Really?

402
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,520
I thought that we were
here to save lives.

403
00:19:57,605 --> 00:20:00,293
No, no, not against a
patient's wishes, we're not.

404
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:02,568
Even if that was ethically
okay, which it is not,

405
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,325
he would sue you for
wrongful life and he would win.

406
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,840
Believe me.

407
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,770
If you force a surgery
on that man,

408
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,932
you will lose your license.

409
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,418
You will never
practice medicine again.

410
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:15,842
Is that what you want?

411
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:30,223
Prep Canaan Ochoa for surgery.

412
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,364
Why are you doing this?

413
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:50,646
The subclavian artery
could rupture at any moment.

414
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:52,825
We don't have much time
to save this man's life.

415
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:58,285
You can start.

416
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,535
Ah...

417
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:08,003
I don't want to live like this.

418
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,825
Out!

419
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:22,010
Everybody out. Clear the OR.

420
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,207
You offend me.

421
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:53,302
Would you tell a group
of wounded vets

422
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,520
that their lives
aren't worth living?

423
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,310
Or someone who is missing
an eye or a leg?

424
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,590
I-i-it's not that.

425
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,399
Then what?

426
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:08,154
You're not special anymore,
so you're just going to die?

427
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,676
I'm nothing else.

428
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,379
Before baseball, I was nothing.

429
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:24,551
And now, without it...

430
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:27,825
what's left?

431
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:38,216
If I had quit when
I couldn't see a way forward,

432
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:40,426
I would not be here
with you now.

433
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,536
You have spent your whole
life defining yourself

434
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,247
in this one narrow way,

435
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,010
and you have convinced yourself
that is poetry.

436
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:56,192
I got news for you, Canaan.

437
00:22:56,817 --> 00:23:01,762
You would not be any less human
if you woke up in post-op.

438
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,418
In fact, maybe,

439
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:10,325
I don't know, just maybe,

440
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,864
you would be more.

441
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,569
Boy, you should have
seen the look on your face.

442
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:29,658
You got wheels, son,
I'll give you that.

443
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,929
You think this is funny?

444
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:33,108
Come on, we made a
rent-a-cop run a little.

445
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:35,210
Man needed exercise.

446
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:38,633
That was a Homeland Security
officer, Dad.

447
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,540
Homeland Security,
for God's sake.

448
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:41,828
Oh, you need to relax.

449
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:43,281
I'm a doctor
at a public hospital.

450
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:45,196
If I get detained
by Homeland Security,

451
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:46,367
I could lose my license.

452
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:48,727
Yeah, here we go with
the doctor business again.

453
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,328
Every chance you get,
you slip that in.

454
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,074
Spoons. They like spoons.

455
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:55,564
We're going to put spoons
on the end of this.

456
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,818
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,863
What I came to do.
Fish are still biting.

458
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:03,431
Come on, let's go.

459
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:05,303
Are you serious right now?

460
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:06,609
We could have gone to jail.

461
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,089
No, we're not going fishing.
We're going home.

462
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:10,396
You're the one pestering me
for months!

463
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:12,311
You're the one
who wanted all this!

464
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:13,703
And now, you're blaming me

465
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,666
because it don't live up
to your high expectations.

466
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,100
That's... that's
not what this is.

467
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:20,754
Nobody force you
to be here, Floyd.

468
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:24,109
And last I checked,
nobody's keeping you here now.

469
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:30,156
I came to go fishing, and
fishing is what I mean to do.

470
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:47,538
How many nibbles
have we gotten?

471
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:48,886
What?

472
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:52,195
Likes, bites, hearts, swipes.

473
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,460
And how many hot dudes are
buying what we are selling?

474
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,658
Oh, my gosh,
Oh, the hot dudes.

475
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,953
I don't know, let's see.

476
00:24:58,136 --> 00:24:59,835
All right.

477
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,117
Uh, zero.

478
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:05,234
Is that right?

479
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:07,547
You know,
maybe it didn't post.

480
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,019
No, no. No, it posted.

481
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:10,716
- It's right there.
- Oh, yeah.

482
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,671
Clear as day.

483
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:17,550
I guess everyone who saw it
just swiped the other way.

484
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,523
Turns out nobody's buying
what I'm selling today.

485
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,251
Okay. Hmm.

486
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,320
Oh.

487
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,061
Okay.

488
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,651
For what it's worth,

489
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:36,275
I would have swiped
the right direction.

490
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:46,422
Big news, everybody.

491
00:25:46,507 --> 00:25:47,836
Our humble, little pilot program

492
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,408
was an unmitigated success.

493
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:52,148
Today, we saved this hospital,
conservatively speaking,

494
00:25:52,232 --> 00:25:55,283
$100,000.

495
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,619
I know what you're thinking.

496
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:57,680
That's maybe the first time

497
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,571
I've actually
saved this hospital money.

498
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:00,947
That's why I wanted
to get it in writing.

499
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,551
Now, here's what I'm thinking.

500
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:05,485
We redirect those savings right
back into the ATM in the lobby

501
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,125
where there are still
patients lined up

502
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,516
to fulfill their prescriptions

503
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,641
and we just
keep that magic flowing.

504
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,640
Some people thought
it couldn't be done.

505
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:15,265
This is where
our money has been going?

506
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,381
Pedicures?

507
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:18,212
Prescribed by a podiatrist
for an ingrown toenail.

508
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:19,306
The Laugh Shack?

509
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,383
For depression.
Laughter is the best medicine.

510
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:22,440
Seeds?

511
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,250
Behavioral health
uses gardening

512
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:25,430
to help ease anxiety.

513
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,665
Lingerie?

514
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,915
Support bras, actually.
It's a great story...

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,296
We're a hospital, Max,
not a Target.

516
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:32,415
Right.

517
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,852
How do we know
these patients are

518
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,334
even using the money for
what it was prescribed for?

519
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,585
We don't.

520
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,370
So any of these people
would just take our money

521
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:41,570
and go out and buy
a PlayStation game?

522
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,462
Yeah, actually,
that was prescribed

523
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,579
for a patient with autism.

524
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,141
Helps with social skills.

525
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:50,446
Our detractors already
accuse socialized medicine

526
00:26:50,531 --> 00:26:51,852
of being just handouts.

527
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:53,375
Now you're standing here

528
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,796
saying your big innovation
is literally handouts?

529
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,649
No, no, no, no.

530
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,821
Our medical staff are
assessing patients' needs

531
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:03,109
and then writing them
specific prescriptions...

532
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:04,218
- For cash?
- Yeah.

533
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,040
There's zero
accountability here, Max.

534
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,830
Well, that line of thinking
suggests that you only

535
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:10,211
see our patients as crooks
and liars when actually,

536
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,360
they're just real people
in need of real health care.

537
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:15,001
But none of these
things are health care.

538
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,281
All of these things
are health care.

539
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,430
A bus pass for a woman whose
severe asthma is triggered

540
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,500
every time she's forced to walk
to work, that is health care.

541
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,134
And when we spend money now,
we save money later,

542
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:28,125
because all of this
is preventative care.

543
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,318
If you don't believe me,

544
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:37,329
just follow these patients
for six weeks

545
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:38,203
and you'll see that's true.

546
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:40,671
Here's what will be true
today or in six weeks.

547
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:42,633
You want New Amsterdam
to give away free money

548
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:43,892
and no matter how you spin it,

549
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:44,870
those are handouts
and that's just wrong.

550
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,875
- No, Karen...
- I'm sorry, Max, shut it down.

551
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,237
He's progressed
to hemorrhagic pulmonary edema.

552
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,592
BP is dropping.

553
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:07,457
His heart's not getting
enough damn oxygen.

554
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,313
- Hang another bag of saline.
- And start a do but a mine drip.

555
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,102
- It looks like V-fib.
- Damn it.

556
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:20,312
Confirming V-fib.

557
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:23,789
Clear.

558
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,012
Nothing.

559
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:29,363
Going again.

560
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,462
Clear.

561
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,424
Nothing.

562
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:35,195
Going again.

563
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,710
There's too much blunting.

564
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:40,013
I can't get any oxygen in.

565
00:28:57,462 --> 00:29:00,570
Time of death, 4:22 p.m.

566
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,257
We did everything we could.

567
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,437
But I just...

568
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,668
I'm so sorry.

569
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:06,464
Oh, my God.

570
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:08,671
The fish won.

571
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,985
Can't control

572
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,597
how love comes to you, huh?

573
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:14,265
Aren't you supposed to
be a brilliant therapist,

574
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:15,860
master of human insight?

575
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,071
Oh, come on, it couldn't have
been that bad, right?

576
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:19,954
Plus, you can't put a price
on adventure.

577
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:21,297
Although to be fair,

578
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:22,903
I don't know how much
those pants cost.

579
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:25,296
I should have known playing
hooky with him was a mistake.

580
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,680
To think all this time,
I got him to hang out with me,

581
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:31,165
what, three,
maybe four times, max?

582
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,367
And it's always me
trying to arrange it.

583
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,726
It's always me trying
to pin him down.

584
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:38,476
And there he was this morning
coming to me with a plan.

585
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,110
All right?
And he was so excited.

586
00:30:41,195 --> 00:30:42,629
But you know what?

587
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,071
He wasn't showing up for me.

588
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,195
'Cause when I got in trouble,
he didn't care.

589
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:48,590
Yeah. You know what?

590
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,437
I almost got arrested today.

591
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,721
What?

592
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,617
Yeah, almost lost
my whole career.

593
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:56,687
And all he can think about was
getting back to the damn trout.

594
00:30:57,578 --> 00:31:00,687
And when I called him out
on it, he blew up.

595
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:04,532
Dude went from Norman Rockwell
to screaming

596
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,393
to total indifference
in one afternoon.

597
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,109
Oh, sorry to hear that.

598
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:13,133
Well, Mama was right.
She was right.

599
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,001
She always said that horse
was like a roller coaster.

600
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:17,110
Starts out fun,
but before you know it,

601
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:19,313
your back's out
and you want to throw up.

602
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:21,485
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what
was the car ride home like?

603
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,106
I Ubered.

604
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:26,304
- You know why?
- Uh, why?

605
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:30,668
'Cause he's still out there
fishing.

606
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:35,844
So what can you say
about a man like that?

607
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:37,250
Well.

608
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,599
No, go ahead, say it.

609
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:43,647
Um, okay, well...

610
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:45,432
I've known the man
for exactly two seconds,

611
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:47,303
so this is worth
a grain of salt.

612
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:51,366
But it sounds like
a textbook example

613
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:55,268
of someone
with bipolar disorder.

614
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:09,382
And it was working.

615
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:12,952
I didn't come here today
to get a bus pass,

616
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:14,748
I came for my asthma.

617
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,906
Yeah, but all you needed
was the bus pass.

618
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:21,903
Hang on, I can...

619
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:26,406
I gave all my money away
this morning.

620
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:34,176
Sorry, I couldn't help
but overhear.

621
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:35,906
Here. I got you, ma'am.

622
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,709
- Oh, that's...
- Please.

623
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,747
Thank you, dear.

624
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,490
Happy to help.

625
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:50,312
What is it with this place?

626
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,047
You know, sometimes,
even I don't know.

627
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:54,980
Excuse me.

628
00:32:55,405 --> 00:33:01,373
That was very kind,
but you didn't have to do that.

629
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:02,366
Oh, my pleasure.

630
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,101
I donate to charity
all the time,

631
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:06,164
but nothing feels better

632
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,089
than knowing exactly
who your money is helping.

633
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:17,006
Hmm.

634
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,285
Good work.

635
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:31,612
Everyone, thank you all.
I know today was hard.

636
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:36,334
You did the hard lift,
changing his mind.

637
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,217
All I did was start
from a different perspective.

638
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,280
- Good night.
- Hey, Karen, do me a favor.

639
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:03,272
Define handout. Humor me.

640
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,313
A gift you didn't earn.

641
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:08,436
Something for nothing.

642
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,616
So many people come here
needing our help

643
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,373
and a lot of them can't pay,

644
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,582
but is stopping an unhoused man

645
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,991
from having a heart attack
a handout?

646
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:22,389
Or giving an undocumented kid
a polio vaccine?

647
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,288
It's not the same.
That's medicine.

648
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:27,178
Everything I did today
was medicine.

649
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:28,791
The board just can't see that.

650
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:31,171
But fortunately,
I don't need the board

651
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:33,648
to see that medicine
extends beyond these walls,

652
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:38,737
because the rest of the world
already knows that.

653
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:40,739
Okay, I'll bite.

654
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,511
- "Sponsor a patient."
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,850
Each of these patients only
needs a small amount of cash

656
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:53,475
to make a huge impact
on their overall health.

657
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:55,264
See?

658
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:58,061
<i>♪ Nobody knows
how to go back home ♪</i>

659
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:04,127
See, top right.
"Allison needs $40."

660
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,484
"I have asthma,
and I need a bus pass."

661
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:12,984
"My eyes are failing,
and I need them to read."

662
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,910
"I have back pain, and
I would like to hold my baby."

663
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:22,437
Some of these prescriptions
are as low as $5.

664
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:24,608
We can help tell their story.

665
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:28,656
These are not numbers or
statistics or reckless policy,

666
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,898
they're just people.

667
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:32,140
And when you see a person
in need, you help them.

668
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,945
That's not a handout.
That's just humanity.

Hey.

673
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:02,906
Rough day?

674
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:05,214
Yeah, you know, work...
Work is hard, and I...

675
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,947
I, uh, just, uh...

676
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,644
Nothing, never mind.

677
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,244
No, what?

678
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:14,236
Nothing. It's just...

679
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:15,398
You know, it's us.

680
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:17,617
It's... not us. It's me, it's me.

681
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,424
It's moving on stuff, and I'm...

682
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:21,666
We can't talk about that, right?

683
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,750
That's weird.

684
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,322
No, it's...
It's not weird at all.

685
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:30,895
Come on. Spill it.

686
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,244
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm a big boy.

687
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:36,033
Uh, yeah, I don't...

688
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,596
I don't know how
to be a single man, Martin.

689
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:41,119
I don't know what I'm doing.

690
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:42,635
I'm...

691
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:43,860
It's pathetic.

692
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,559
I was terrible at it in my 20s.
You know.

693
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:49,327
I'm terrible at it as
a single, middle-aged father.

694
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:53,635
I'm... I'm just bad at it.
I'm a failed partner.

695
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,419
- Come on.
- Well, it's true.

696
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,897
Mm.

697
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,049
That is my dating profile.

698
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,400
Hard to tell, because nobody
swiped left, right, or center.

699
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:06,794
Nobody.

700
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,758
Um, uh...

701
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:12,011
Iggy, your profile's set

702
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,197
to only matches
over 90 years old.

703
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,286
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah.

704
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,322
- What?
- Buddy, yeah.

705
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:22,240
I think if you just toggle that
and then switch that one.

706
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:25,123
- Oh, my gosh.
- Boom.

707
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,297
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wowza.

708
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,346
Oh.

709
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,150
Holy moly.

710
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:35,041
I'll see you in three days.

711
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:39,049
Yeah, yeah, three days.
See you then.

712
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:53,636
Jesus, you going to
stand out here all night?

713
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,669
I buzzed you up like
ten minutes ago.

714
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,221
Oh yeah, don't mind them.
They're not here.

715
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:10,120
Yeah, so there are all
your clothes ready to go.

716
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,971
Should I charge
you a storage fee?

717
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:32,511
You okay?

718
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:36,105
Yeah, like you care.

719
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,940
You know,
there's been a change of plans.

720
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:51,291
I think I might have
to crash here.

721
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:56,893
Why?
What happened to your place?

722
00:38:57,165 --> 00:39:01,283
The truth is
you'd be doing me a favor,

723
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:04,900
Really helping me out.

724
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:07,229

725
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,769
Uh, yeah.

00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:15,266
