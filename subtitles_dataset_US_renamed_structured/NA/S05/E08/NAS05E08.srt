00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,062
Fun, right?

3
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:04,839
- Friends.
- Friends.

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:07,427
The only thing holding me back

5
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:08,696
was this voice in my head.

6
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,255
And Martin, the voice is you.

7
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:12,061
I want to broaden my
horizons and find out

8
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,617
what I connect with,
where I belong.

9
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,609
I felt something.

10
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:15,957
So I'm sober, who cares?

11
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,672
You've been lying
to me this whole time.

12
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,149
- Where are you going?
- To get high.

13
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,352
I don't even know
where you're staying.

14
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,091
Can you just let me know
that you're not dead?

15
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:23,293
I think you may be bipolar.

16
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:24,334
Bipolar?

17
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,457
Out of my way!

18
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,585
You got to let me help you.

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,802
What'd you do, son?

20
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:31,404
- Please, Floyd!
- Take it easy.

21
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,019
Please, Floyd!

Come on, Iggy, crush this.

25
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,789
Get it up there! Come on!

26
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:13,256
Let's go.

27
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:15,138
Whoo! Let's go!

28
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:16,380
- Whoo!
- There it is.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,702
Whoo! Yes.

30
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,689
Oh, my God. Am I vibrating?

31
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,236
It's just the endorphins.

32
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:23,023
Now if you puke, it just
means you're doing it right.

33
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,608
Nice.

34
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,436
Oh, man, I've been lifting for what,
two weeks now?

35
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,200
I feel like I've been
power lifting my entire life.

36
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,947
Welcome to the
grind house, baby.

37
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,588
- OK.
- Oh, man.

38
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:33,978
Yeah, I feel like
I'm cracked open.

39
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,164
I feel alive.

40
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,487
Like, everything is
different. I'm different.

41
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:38,824
- Yeah.
- And the craziest thing is,

42
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,186
is that no one
else even sees it.

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,813
Eh, most people just
caught up in their own stuff.

44
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,194
They're just not
looking at it right.

45
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:45,380
Don't sweat it.

46
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,967
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I am.

47
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,233
Good talk,

48
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,677
but these power cleans
ain't gonna do themselves.

49
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,040
- All right, all right.
- Crush it, Iggy.

50
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,127
Here we go. Come on.

51
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:58,240
I have been sober for
three years and seven months.

52
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,332
I, uh...

53
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:05,061
I actually came close
to ruining that.

54
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,993
Did something stupid.

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,584
I moved in with my sister,

56
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,436
who's also an addict.

57
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,331
Yeah, I told myself
that I could help her.

58
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,931
Be this big hero.

59
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,410
But all I did was hurt myself.

60
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,719
I stopped going to meetings.

61
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,255
I stopped calling my sponsor.

62
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,893
She became my addiction.

63
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,541
Thank you.

64
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,167
Uh, I'm Lauren, I'm an addict.

65
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:09,728
All right, got a medium
Italian coffee for you,

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,634
light foam.

67
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,041
Wow. For me?

68
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:22,039
My favourite. Yeah.

69
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:24,127
You know, great minds.

70
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,282
Cheers. Um...

71
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:34,103
Just sorry to
bring you in early.

72
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,359
Mm.

73
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,765
Yeah, true.

74
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,275
All right. Uh... yeah.

75
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,165
All right.

76
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:57,158
I would like to
begin this session

77
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,251
with where we left off last week,
okay?

78
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,519
You spoke about having
intense feelings

79
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:04,067
of brain-numbing
emptiness and depression.

80
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:05,759
They're gone.

81
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,041
They're gone?

82
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,069
- Yeah.
- Wow.

83
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,901
That's a big change from
what you described last week

84
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:15,770
when you said, "I'm
on the edge of a cliff

85
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:18,072
peering into never-ending
nothingness."

86
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,556
No edge, no cliff,

87
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:23,067
just breathing this rare air.

88
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:26,493
What a time it is to be
alive, huh, Dr. Frome?

89
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,108
Yeah, I'll say.

90
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:30,611
Wow.

91
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,800
Um, I'm really glad the
CBT exercises are working.

92
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,746
Oh, no, sorry.

93
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,329
I haven't been doing
your exercises.

94
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,515
Oh.

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,417
OK, wh-what have you been doing?

96
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:42,642
What changed?

97
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:46,477
I finally talked to my mum.

98
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,126
She acknowledged my feelings.

99
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,900
Even owned her mistakes.

100
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:54,275
That's your late mother?

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,095
- Yeah.
- Huh.

102
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,167
- How?
- Solomon helped me.

103
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,689
Hmm.

104
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,579
We don't have a
Dr. Solomon on staff.

105
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,885
Oh, no, he... he works here.

106
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,900
He's... he's just not an MD.

107
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,540
Oh, wait, uh, hang on.

108
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,611
Are you talking about
Solomon the janitor?

109
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,681
Yeah.

110
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,407
He's psychic.

111
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,134
Is he?

112
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:28,935
What the hell happened?

113
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,204
Beauty pageant.

114
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,652
Stage collapsed.

115
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,080
Okay, let's get her to Bay 30.

116
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,813
Uh, let's page orthopaedics.

117
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,041
You've come to the
best possible place.

118
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,375
You're gonna be
brand-new in no time,

119
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,859
and so will your
fellow contestants.

120
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,006
Porsha Grux, 16,
clavicle fracture.

121
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,335
Uh, okay, Walsh,
let's get her to Bay 23.

122
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,430
- On it.
- The Miss Teen Liberty pageant

123
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:48,937
stage may have broken,

124
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,875
but it will not let
it break our spirits.

125
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,258
Nichelle Bartley, 17,

126
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,148
head trauma from
falling scaffolding.

127
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,618
Conscious with severe bleeding.

128
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,111
Uh, Casey, page for backup.

129
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,625
Anna, you're gonna be fine.

130
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,235
Come on,
let's look alive, people!

131
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,469
Let's go! Move!

132
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,776
Hang in there, Candace.

133
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,547
You're gonna be okay.

134
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,111
- Where do you want me?
- Uh, over here.

135
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,937
Head trauma, massive bleed.

136
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,313
Turan, let's take care of the
girl in the sequined dress.

137
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,657
Let's go.

138
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,866
What do we got?

139
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,422
Compound fracture,
right tibia.

140
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:16,930
Oh, yeah, reserve an OR.

141
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,008
She's gonna need an ORIF.
And call anaesthesia.

142
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,961
Okay, yeah, we're gonna
take good care of you.

143
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,707
Alexa.

144
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,524
You're a warrior.

145
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:28,273
These are world-class
physicians.

146
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:29,900
Keep your chin up, okay?

147
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,258
Good girl.

148
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,076
Candace.

149
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,235
Is that your grandmother?

150
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,743
That's Marvel a,
the pageant emcee.

151
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,811
She's everyone's grandmother.

152
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,999
Ah! Mm.

153
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,571
Do you know where you are?

154
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,588
The hospital?

155
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,539
Am I gonna die?

156
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,797
No. Uh, try to relax.

157
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,143
The bleeding isn't stopping.

158
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:52,813
More pressure.

159
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,680
Breathe in. Breathe out.

160
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,027
All is well.

161
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:58,782
You're gonna be fine,
Nichelle, I promise.

162
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:00,145
Thanks, Marvel a.

163
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,782
We need a type and
screen and cross match.

164
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,569
Okay.

165
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,272
And that should heal nicely.

166
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,821
They're gonna get me.

167
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,846
Wait, wh... who is?

168
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,836
Them. The CIA.

169
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:18,844
Yeah, those two aren't CIA.

170
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,282
They've been spying on
me with their machine.

171
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,369
Make them stop.

172
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,524
Okay.

173
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,271
We're gonna get
right on that, okay?

174
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,125
Okay, let's order her a CT scan.

175
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,288
Whatever's going on with her,

176
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,475
it's not caused by
a collapsing stage.

177
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:38,836
Yeah.

178
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:42,306
Ladies. Ladies,
I've spoken to you

179
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,214
on this day and on better days.

180
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,672
And you know what I've seen?

181
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,082
Grit that won't quit.

182
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:53,713
So keep those spirits up
because the show must go...

183
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,078
- Grab the backboard.
- I got her head.

184
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,008
Okay, I need help over here!

185
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,774
- We're on it.
- O2 and Ambu bag.

186
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:07,196
You the medical director here?

187
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,903
Uh, one and only.

188
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:10,187
- How can I...
- You really think you can

189
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:11,734
get away with it?

190
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,711
Stealing my mum's house.

191
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,932
Uh, h-hold on, hold on.

192
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:18,440
Uh, is this... Is this
billing or collections?

193
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,588
No, it was in her will.

194
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:25,499
You're saying that your mum
left this hospital her home?

195
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,063
Our home.

196
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,681
She was manipulated to do it,
by you and your greedy cronies.

197
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,396
Tricked into donating
it for nothing.

198
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,623
Now I'm here to get it back.

199
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:43,051
<i>'Cause I knew you were
dying to see it, that's why.</i>

200
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,888
Oh, I also got us a table

201
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,875
at Le Bernard in before the show.

202
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,246
Anything for you, my dear.

203
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:50,913
Pick you up at 6:00?

204
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,092
Buh-bye.

205
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:54,595
What's up, my friend?

206
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,988
Um, listen, I have a question.

207
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:59,324
Do you remember a patient
named Joanne Danova?

208
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:00,477
Joanne, yeah.

209
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:02,644
Ugh, what a sweetheart.

210
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,519
We just lost her, actually.

211
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,027
But silver lining,
we did get the house,

212
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,414
so score.

213
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,487
What can I say,
we're good at what we do here.

214
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,019
Yeah, um, what... what
exactly did you say to her?

215
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,620
Oh, it's not like
that, Dr. Goodwin.

216
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,855
What we do takes
time and finesse.

217
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,800
Starts with a polite
correspondence...

218
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,913
Maybe a "Happy Birthday"
personalised from one of us,

219
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,420
or a "Happy Holidays."

220
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:30,909
And once contact has been made,

221
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,462
we develop out the relationship.

222
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:33,848
Develop out?

223
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,462
Um, how?

224
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:36,812
Oh.

225
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,918
I've got connections with
every maître d' in the city,

226
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,802
hookups at the Broadway houses,

227
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:43,205
and I get a great deal
from the florist on Second

228
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,566
because New Amsterdam fixed

229
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:45,945
the guy's trick knee
a few years ago.

230
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,250
You're, uh... you're...

231
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,854
You're preying on our patients.

232
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:51,323
Hey now, that's um...

233
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:52,761
That's very insulting,
Dr. Goodwin.

234
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,995
Yeah. You wined and
dined Joanne Danova

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,667
until you convinced
this poor woman

236
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,791
to donate her family home to us

237
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:01,878
instead of her actual family.

238
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,675
And where was
Joanne's actual family

239
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,845
during her final months, huh?

240
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,255
Who was there to
get her a wheelchair

241
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,636
when she couldn't walk?

242
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:12,791
Us.

243
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:15,219
Who was there to make sure her
final birthday was special?

244
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,546
Us.

245
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,891
Who was at her bedside
holding her hand

246
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,885
when she finally passed?

247
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,195
Hint, it wasn't her family.

248
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:26,370
Every hospital has a
department like this.

249
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,918
Ours just happens to
be an industry leader.

250
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,665
I'm currently
developing relationships

251
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,693
with 30 other
patients as we speak.

252
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,331
Me and my team, we fill
holes in people's lives

253
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,745
that their own families
are neglecting.

254
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:41,119
Now I ask you, is
that preying on them,

255
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,901
or is that providing
a necessary service?

256
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,666
Now if you'll excuse me.

257
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,800
Ms. Albans, did
you get my flowers?

258
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,537
Oh, yes.

259
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,539
I'm so glad, my dear.

260
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,025
Hey.

261
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,226
Excuse me, Solomon.

262
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:04,548
Dr. Frome.

263
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,816
Oh, this about the
new disinfectant?

264
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,393
Spring breeze. Too flowery?

265
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,291
This isn't about
the disinfectant.

266
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:11,723
All right, that's
good to know.

267
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,415
Yeah, it's about a
patient that came to me

268
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,544
with something
kind of concerning.

269
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,210
They told me that they believe

270
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,824
you connected them with
a deceased relative.

271
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,769
Oh, yeah, I did.

272
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,946
Um, he was dealing
with a lot of pain,

273
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,535
but I'm glad I brought him
some closure.

274
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,243
Yeah. Well, Solomon,
I... I appreciate

275
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,421
what I can see is a gesture
of goodwill for you,

276
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,183
but... but that
kind of interaction,

277
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,905
that interferes with
patient treatments.

278
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,067
- It's not good.
- Oh, no.

279
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,541
I'm helping.

280
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,313
You see, I'm... I'm
bringing them some clarity.

281
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,245
When these messages come,
I'm compelled to speak them.

282
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,438
Honouring the soul's wishes.

283
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:48,277
Okay, look, you've
been fantastic here.

284
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:49,893
Your first few weeks
have been stellar.

285
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,161
But, uh, whatever it is you're
claiming to do or to be,

286
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,214
you can't do that here.

287
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,268
You can do it at home
on your own time,

288
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,149
but not here, not with
this vulnerable population.

289
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,440
You understand?

290
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,194
You have my word, Dr. Frome.

291
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

292
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,423
- Won't happen again.
- All right, cool.

293
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,448
Thanks, man. See you around.

294
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,952
I'm not seeing a
hematoma in her brain.

295
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,620
Let's go ahead and
move to the chest.

296
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,018
Now we just need to
make sure that nothing's

297
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,441
obstructing the lower region.

298
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:24,660
When I worked my first
Miss Teen Liberty pageant

299
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,773
in 1989, something struck me.

300
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,297
- Do you know what it was?
- No, ma'am.

301
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:33,573
Announcing a pageant is
just like being a doctor.

302
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:36,233
A doctor?

303
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,942
Don't think I can't
hear your skepticism

304
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:42,307
despite being lodged
in this titanium donut.

305
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,988
Yes or no? Your job basically

306
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,979
is to make people feel better.

307
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,441
- Yes.
- Well, it's the same for me.

308
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:55,471
You have CAT scans,
MRIs, scalpels.

309
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,018
Those are your tools.

310
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,416
And I have my tool.

311
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:00,832
Oh, yeah, what's that?

312
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:04,260
The golden voice, baby.

313
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,521
Oh, I've done game
shows, roasts.

314
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:12,143
Oh, but the pageant
is my heart and soul.

315
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,795
Sure, there's the fake tiaras.

316
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,544
That's for the audience.
But for the girls,

317
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,012
there are real
scholarships, good ones.

318
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,002
At rehearsals, I work with them.

319
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:24,430
I get to see what
makes them shine.

320
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,573
Life's just one big runway, no?

321
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:33,526
I get to help them find
the confidence to walk it.

322
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,120
That's a broken rib.

323
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,060
It's penetrated her heart.

324
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:42,607
Book an OR.

325
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,281
Could rupture at any moment.

326
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,573
Ms. Cole.

327
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:53,363
Hi, I'm Dr. Bloom.

328
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,990
Um, may I have a word?

329
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,362
Yeah.

330
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,824
What's going on
with my daughter?

331
00:14:58,909 --> 00:14:59,970
Was she hit by something?

332
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,212
Does she have a concussion?

333
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:03,935
Your daughter's CT
scan came back clear,

334
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,096
which means there's nothing
going on with her head.

335
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:07,723
So what is it?

336
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,423
Her toxicology tests
showed that she'd overdosed

337
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,557
on a substance called THC.

338
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,605
THC? Isn't that...

339
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,893
The psychoactive
ingredient in marijuana.

340
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,166
Look, I'm really sorry that
you had to find out like this,

341
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,673
but kids Kearston's age,

342
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,176
they start getting
curious about drugs.

343
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:25,843
But you can't
overdose on weed.

344
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,965
I-I know it sounds crazy,

345
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,503
but it happens a lot these days.

346
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:30,665
You know, with all
the different ways

347
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,371
that marijuana is consumed,

348
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,870
it's really difficult to know
what it's been laced with.

349
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,268
But I do know.

350
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:38,745
How?

351
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,963
I'm the one who
buys it for her.

352
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,325
All right, some
good news, Nichelle.

353
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,713
We were able to get
your blood to clot,

354
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:53,284
and this transfusion is gonna
make you feel better soon.

355
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,144
You might feel a
little bit of chills,

356
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:57,862
but it's nothing to worry about.

357
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,627
Then I can get
back to the pageant.

358
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,306
Ms. Marvel a always says,
the show must go on.

359
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,768
Mm.

360
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,732
How long have
you been competing?

361
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,495
Since I was nine.

362
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,195
Must have taken up
a lot of your time.

363
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,976
It's a lot of
work, but I love it.

364
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,057
Seems like a lot of pressure
for somebody your age.

365
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:32,029
I guess, but the
pageants are worth it.

366
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,788
Does it ever stress you out,

367
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,415
you know, having to
look a certain way,

368
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,617
having to have a
certain body type?

369
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,448
Why are you asking me that?

370
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:46,360
So I'm gonna be
straight with you.

371
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:48,705
I'm looking at the
pallor of your skin,

372
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,338
your excessive bleeding,
and how thin you are.

373
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,830
Your platelet count
is dangerously low.

374
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:58,372
All of these are signs
of an eating disorder,

375
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,651
most likely anorexia.

376
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,638
I don't have an
eating disorder.

377
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,260
I'm not anorexic.

378
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:10,870
Hey, do you notice
anything different about me?

379
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,222
Your shoes?

380
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,769
Nope.

381
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:17,276
Did you get a haircut?

382
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,596
Uh-uh.

383
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,569
- Is there something different?
- Never mind, never mind.

384
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:22,791
I'll see you later.

385
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,088
Gia.

386
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,698
Hi, what's the matter?

387
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,580
Did something happen in group?

388
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:34,240
I spoke to Bryan, Dr. Frome.

389
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,364
He's not in pain anymore.

390
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,461
He truly is in a better place.

391
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:41,169
Bryan, your deceased husband?

392
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,394
Yes.

393
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,348
All thanks to Solomon.

394
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:46,725
Solomon.

395
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,784
You were right, Warren.

396
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,199
An employee from this hospital
spent a great deal of time

397
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,980
with your mother during
her final months.

398
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:57,968
And, uh, in that time,

399
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,210
she decided to legally
and of sound mind

400
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,917
donate her home
to this hospital.

401
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,987
Wh... how is that
even permissible?

402
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,532
I know that
that's frustrating,

403
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,900
and all I can say is that, uh...

404
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:14,695
For those months, whenever
your mother needed something

405
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,198
or someone, the
bequest office was...

406
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,284
Was there for her.

407
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:24,135
Because I guess...
nobody else was.

408
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,623
You know what these
are, Dr. Goodwin?

409
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:33,652
I do.

410
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,291
For the past two years
I've been deployed.

411
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,899
Been to places you
couldn't even fathom,

412
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,546
places not easy to catch
a hop out of back home.

413
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:45,683
- Sorry, I...
- Believe me,

414
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,045
I wanted to be
here for my mother.

415
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,131
It just wasn't possible.

416
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:51,675
So I did the best I could.

417
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,639
I... I handled her bills.

418
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:59,885
I checked in on her every
spare chance I had be...

419
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,808
Before she passed.

420
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,451
Hell, the only... only reason
I'm even able to be stateside now

421
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,354
is on hardship leave to
get her affairs in order.

422
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,208
Little did I know
that New Amsterdam

423
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:12,593
took care of all that.

424
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,023
No, no, no. Look, Warren...

425
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:15,401
You know what,
save it, Doctor.

426
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,209
Somehow you guys turn
service to your country

427
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,579
into a liability.

428
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,462
And it's gonna cost you.

429
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:22,764
I'll see you in court.

430
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:29,888
Please don't
fire me, Dr. Frome.

431
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,743
Solomon, I asked you explicitly

432
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,931
to not get involved
with my patients' care.

433
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,093
Look, I know, and I tried.

434
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,096
But this gift I have,

435
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,419
the ability to speak to souls,

436
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,947
I can't control it.

437
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,895
I don't know what to
say. I... I trusted you.

438
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:49,690
- You gave me your word.
- It just happens.

439
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,417
I swear it does.

440
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:53,299
It takes over my spirit.

441
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:55,967
It's always a vivid flash

442
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,395
and some jolt of a
random feeling...

443
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,142
Joy, guilt, a taste or a smell.

444
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:06,610
And I feel it all
in my core like...

445
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,517
Like a roller coaster.

446
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:12,947
And it releases me,
and the messages come.

447
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,178
How long has this
been happening?

448
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,604
Pssh.

449
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,111
Um, since I was a kid,

450
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,497
about ten.

451
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,205
It's passed down
through my family,

452
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,913
my father and his.

453
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,541
That's why it's second nature.

454
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:29,059
It's in my DNA.

455
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,451
This gift, i-it's written...

456
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:32,565
- This, um...
- In my family history.

457
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,551
This doesn't sound
like a gift, Solomon.

458
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:37,099
This sounds like
temporal lobe epilepsy.

459
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,630
Core temp 37
Celsius. On target.

460
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,181
DVT prophylaxis on board.

461
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:48,314
There she is.

462
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,399
Forceps.

463
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,067
On our A game, folks.

464
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,869
We only get one shot at this.

465
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,759
Just one big splinter.

466
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,261
Go ahead and
position the shoulders.

467
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,256
All right, let's close her up.

468
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,883
- All right.
- Suture.

469
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,792
Thank you.

470
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,314
Damn it. Come on.

471
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,080
Switch to a Prolene suture?

472
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:23,361
Nah, it won't help.

473
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,072
This heart's been fighting
hypertension for years.

474
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:27,657
The walls are too thin.

475
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,837
It's beyond saving.

476
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,264
She's gonna need a transplant.

477
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,476
All right, uh,
let's close her up,

478
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,504
get her to ICU,
and contact UNOS.

479
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,954
We only got a few hours
to get this woman a heart.

480
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,219
Do you mind if I use the COW?

481
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:50,642
Oh, sure.

482
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,762
I gotta order psych consult.

483
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,670
Yeah, you got it.
I'll just be one sec.

484
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,298
Mm.

485
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:00,654
It's for Miss Teen won't Admit

486
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:02,829
That She Has an Eating Disorder.

487
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,510
What are you supposed
to do about that?

488
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:05,839
I mean, how do... How
do you help a patient

489
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:07,978
who is so completely in denial?

490
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:11,487
Uh, these pageants, they put
so much pressure on girls.

491
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:12,731
You know, as if the whole world

492
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,125
wasn't already a beauty pageant.

493
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,409
Telling women that
they have to smile,

494
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:17,901
and have to be thin, and
have to be beautiful.

495
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,872
Sometimes all you can do
is treat the disorder.

496
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:24,525
And if you get lucky,
the patient will follow.

497
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,450
You gotta be kidding me.

498
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,436
New patient?

499
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,823
Uh, uh, was.

500
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,384
She just donated her
house to New Amsterdam.

501
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:43,463
Wow.
That's very generous of her.

502
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:45,853
No, generosity had
nothing to do with it.

503
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,003
You're supplying your
own daughter with drugs?

504
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,792
Do you have children?

505
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:53,782
No, I am not a
parent, but I do know

506
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,991
that supplying kids with
drugs is usually frowned upon.

507
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,087
Wh-when my daughter was 15,

508
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,052
she came to me, and she said

509
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:04,720
that all her friends
were all vaping weed,

510
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:07,068
trying tinctures, edibles.

511
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,976
She wanted to try it,

512
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:10,568
and I said no.

513
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,891
So she didn't.

514
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:14,248
Then at 16, she asked again,

515
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,997
and she said she wasn't
asking my permission.

516
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:19,377
She was just wanting
to be honest about it.

517
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,275
I was afraid she would
buy it off the street,

518
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,490
and it would be laced
with God knows what.

519
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,303
So I did the responsible thing.

520
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,839
I bought her edibles, tinctures,

521
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,507
weed from a reputable dispensary

522
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:32,774
to protect her.

523
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,298
And she's only allowed
to do it at home,

524
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,998
and I oversee how much she does.

525
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,575
This is what raising
kids in 2022 is like.

526
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:43,060
Oh, my God.

527
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:47,208
Did you know that THC,

528
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,649
the psychoactive
ingredient in marijuana,

529
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,631
it used to make up 5%.

530
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:54,092
Now it makes up 95%,

531
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:56,514
making it more potent,
more addictive,

532
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,901
and more bio active.

533
00:23:57,986 --> 00:24:01,217
Marijuana in 2022
is not the same drug

534
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,484
as when you were a kid.

535
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:03,788
I was trying to
do the right thing.

536
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,094
I was trying to keep her safe.

537
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,290
Yeah, well, you know what,
buying her drugs didn't do that.

538
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,711
Kearston's gone.
Her bed's empty.

539
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:12,858
What?

540
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,370
♪ One life so it's time ♪

541
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,356
♪ To open up your closet ♪

00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:20,654

♪ What

547
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,594
No...

548
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:00,385
- She leapt into traffic?
- Yep.

549
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,065
She was out of her mind,
thanks to Mummy Dearest.

550
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:03,337
Let's connect her to the vent.

551
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:10,823
Okay, heart's steady.

552
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:12,410
96 sat. She's stable.

553
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,537
Well, ortho will
take her up to the OR,

554
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:17,549
where they will stabilise
her shattered pelvis.

555
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,717
I'm calling Child
Protective Services.

556
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,699
Really?

557
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,047
Look at her.

558
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:25,838
I know, but her
mum meant well.

559
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,565
Well, you know what, good
intentions don't really

560
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:29,925
matter when your kid has to
be put back together in the OR

561
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,221
because you wanted them
to experiment with drugs.

562
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:34,351
You know, her future,
her potential,

563
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,940
it's all derailed because
of her drug-pushing mother

564
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:37,981
who meant well.

565
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:39,623
Who are we talking about here?

566
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:42,126
This girl or you?

567
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:50,714
What happened?
Nichelle was doing great

568
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,678
after the transfusion.

569
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:52,924
Severe abdominal pains,

570
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,332
then her blood
pressure plummeted.

571
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,822
Found a bleeder.

572
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:05,213
What is that?

573
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,173
Enlarged lymph nodes.

574
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,054
She wasn't lying.
She's not anorexic.

575
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,871
She has lymphoma.

576
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,522
There he is.

577
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:29,197
My medicine man.

578
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,389
Whatever you're
paying these nurses,

579
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,136
it's not enough.

580
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:36,309
They are fabulous.

581
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,537
Yeah, yeah, they are.

582
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:39,899
Glad to see you're comfortable.

583
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:40,900
How are you feeling?

584
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,768
Like a want to.

585
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:46,838
I know bad news when I see it.

586
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,705
You can give it to me straight.

587
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,346
The organisation that,
um, arranges transplants

588
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:01,080
refused to put you on
their list of recipients

589
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,846
because of your age.

590
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,453
So where does that leave

591
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:08,816
my chances of
getting a new heart?

592
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,627
Extremely low.

593
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:13,007
I'm sorry.

594
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,983
Oh.

595
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:19,589
Are they canceling the pageant?

596
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:22,633
No, Ms. Anders, we really
need to focus on you now...

597
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:25,073
Oh, honey, that
ship has sailed.

598
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,959
No, no, no, no,
you deserve a heart.

599
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,682
And you know what?

600
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,854
I'd like to talk to someone
about making that happen.

601
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,229
I'll see what I can do.

602
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:34,984
Thank you,

603
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,292
but no.

604
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:37,417
Well, at least let me try.

605
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:39,510
No special favours.

606
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,791
I've had my time.

607
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,378
Let a young person
have the heart.

608
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:50,434
I've been lifting up young
people my whole life.

609
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,275
Why stop now?

610
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,533
Okay, so your scans
came back clean,

611
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:01,582
which means we can
rule out epilepsy.

612
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,326
So there's nothing
wrong with me?

613
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:05,855
You're not out of
the woods just yet.

614
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:07,941
You know, something is
causing these visions.

615
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:13,658
It's a gift, not an illness,
Dr. Frome.

616
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:16,181
Just because you can't explain
something scientifically

617
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:17,743
doesn't mean it's not real.

618
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:18,920
Well, it doesn't really matter

619
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,186
what I can explain, Solomon.

620
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:22,182
What matters is your health.

621
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,767
So I would like to
run some more tests

622
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:26,954
and start on a low-dose
seizure medication

623
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,758
so we can pinpoint the
actual cause, all right?

624
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:31,861
Is that something
you would agree to?

625
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:36,221
Hey.

626
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,305
Solomon, I know that this is
something you've dealt with

627
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:39,182
for the better
part of your life,

628
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,388
and I know that this is...
this is a lot.

629
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:43,455
It's a lot to take
in, to accept.

630
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,220
But I... I would
like to help you,

631
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,323
if you'll let me.

632
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,642
- Solomon...
- I have someone here with me

633
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:53,188
who has a message for you.

634
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,541
- Your brother.
- So until you decide

635
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,744
that you want my help, my
hands are completely tied.

636
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,098
Short-Fuze says he's sorry.

637
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,264
What... what did you say?

638
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,811
I'm being asked to tell Grunt

639
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,158
that he's sorry for
the way he treated you.

640
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,632
He's showing me his wrist...

641
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:18,800
Uh, the left one,
does that make sense?

642
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,729
How are you doing this?

643
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:36,166
He says he's proud of you.

644
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:38,645
And he watches over you,

645
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,846
even though you
found your strength.

646
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:44,939
Stay the course.

647
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,486
He sees the change,
and others will too.

648
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:55,670
We are shutting down New
Amsterdam's bequest program

649
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,814
because the way in which
this program operates

650
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,901
borders on criminal.

651
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:04,549
By targeting patients
in the dementia ward,

652
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:06,979
this department has
stained the reputation

653
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:09,207
of America's oldest
public hospital,

654
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:13,256
not to mention violated
any number of HIPAA laws.

655
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,855
Warren Danova's mother
was grossly manipulated.

656
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:18,536
And we have the power
to make this man,

657
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,979
a US veteran,
whole in his grief.

658
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:24,096
All we have to do is give
him back his family home.

659
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:26,128
- Is this true?
- We had no idea

660
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,955
Mr. Danova's mother
had dementia,

661
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,993
because going through her
records would have been

662
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,299
a violation of HIPAA laws.

663
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:33,807
All we have access to is
what she gave us access to.

664
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:35,972
Yeah, sure, but you knew
which doctor she was seeing,

665
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,918
which wards she was
being assigned to.

666
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:38,865
That data was available...

667
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,811
What more do you need to know?

668
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,540
Ms. Danova was
not of sound mind

669
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,007
when she signed over her house.

670
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,433
And if you don't
want to give it back,

671
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,147
then I am sure we can
find an estate lawyer

672
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:47,650
who will take it back.

673
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:57,358
Joanne Danova's last
will and testament,

674
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,639
dated January 7th, 2020.

675
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,275
According to her chart,

676
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,093
when was she admitted
into our dementia ward?

677
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:09,033
July 17, 2021.

678
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,224
So for nearly
a year and a half

679
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:13,924
after the signing of her will,

680
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:16,596
where she left New
Amsterdam her property,

681
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:21,010
Joanne Danova was of
sound mind and body.

682
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:26,434
Max, the donation stands.

683
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,486
Thank you.

684
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,172
Kearston's stable.

685
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:59,955
We expect her to
make a full recovery.

686
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:06,019
I wanted to let you
know that I didn't call

687
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,644
Child Protective Services.

688
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:10,073
But a social worker is going

689
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:12,191
- to be reaching out.
- Are you kidding me?

690
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,674
Look, I understand
that raising kids

691
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:16,997
in today's environment is tough.

692
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,999
And I get that
marijuana is everywhere,

693
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,072
and it is legal now.

694
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:24,526
But here in New York,
if you're under 21,

695
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,822
it is considered a
controlled substance.

696
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:31,464
You said that you only
let your daughter use

697
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,140
in your home with a
supply you provide, right?

698
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,464
And that was a tincture
full of cannabis?

699
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,188
A single drop could
make anyone psychotic,

700
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,400
much less a young girl.

701
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:47,170
Maybe next time,

702
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,393
leave the prescribing
to the doctors.

703
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:51,877
Sure.

704
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:54,361
Yeah, that's really
gonna stop kids

705
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:56,523
from experimenting with drugs.

706
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:00,276
Thanks for your help.

707
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:06,466
Yeah, well, my mother used
to give me drugs and alcohol

708
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,174
when I was a teenager.

709
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:13,596
Try to win my affection.

710
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,564
I spent my whole life trying
to dig myself out of that hole.

711
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:22,058
You want to help her experiment,

712
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,930
help her experiment
with not taking drugs.

713
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,965
'Cause, yeah, it might not work,

714
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:28,564
but this right here,

715
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:30,730
this is the alternative.

716
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:42,385
How you feeling?

717
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:44,283
What happened?

718
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:47,111
We had to take
you in for surgery,

719
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,385
and in doing so, I found
several lymph nodes

720
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:51,691
that were severely inflamed.

721
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,385
It turns out you have
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

722
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,283
Cancer.

723
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:01,769
We caught it very early,

724
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,761
and treating it is
gonna be a tough road,

725
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:05,870
but I know that you're tougher.

726
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,883
I owe you an apology.

727
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,369
As your doctor,
I made a mistake.

728
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,594
I let my prejudices
inform my diagnosis.

729
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,597
I assumed something
that I shouldn't have

730
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:26,322
because you were in a pageant.

731
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,726
I was as judgy as the
people I was ranting about.

732
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:33,666
And for that, I'm sorry.

733
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:39,704
You know, for the final three,

734
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,064
there's an interview portion?

735
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,667
Want to know what my answer to
the "who inspires you" question

736
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,948
was going to be?

737
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,534
Yeah, absolutely, I do.

738
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,153
It was Dorothy Klenke Nash.

739
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,127
Ah.

740
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:57,329
The first female neurosurgeon.

741
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:00,141
She trained right
here in New York,

742
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,846
and started practicing in 1928.

743
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:11,104
You go, girl.

744
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,042
Ah, look at Orderly Brenner go.

745
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,187
The man's a gladiator!

746
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,292
And Nurse Faldo,

747
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:27,558
a vision in sage.

748
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,330
Tell us, Amelia, what is your
favourite part of the job?

749
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:33,806
My paycheck, Marvel a.

750
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:36,737
Lies, you tell.

751
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,658
She's a giver to the core.

752
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:40,174
Isn't that right, everybody?

753
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:44,269
And Nurse Zambrano,
I don't have to tell you.

754
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:48,016
You've already been blown
away by those hot pink Crocs

755
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:50,487
with the fabulous
Jibbitz on them.

756
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:08,129
Oh, and Dr. Monique,

757
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:11,153
looking so chic
in her new frames.

758
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:16,148
Mr. Reynolds, you've made
significant improvement,

759
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,999
but in the opinion of
your psychiatric team,

760
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:19,820
you are not yet
fully stabilised.

761
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:21,945
Therefore, you are
hereby ordered to remain

762
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,287
under psychiatric supervision
a further two weeks.

763
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:25,415
Ha-hang on.

764
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:26,565
That's not right.

765
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:27,922
I've done what
they've told me...

766
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:30,093
Mr. Reynolds,
you've stated your case.

767
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:31,178
No.

768
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,775
I didn't ask to be here.

769
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:36,002
They put me in here.

770
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:37,742
They have treated me.

771
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,315
Now I just want to go home.

772
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,137
I can take care of
myself, Your Honour.

773
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,554
I cannot, at this juncture,

774
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:44,700
release you to your
own recognisance.

775
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,499
If you have family you can
stay with who can care for you

776
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,963
and monitor your condition
as you continue to adjust,

777
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,012
I will consent to release
you into their aegis,

778
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:55,062
but that's the best I can do.

779
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,240
I don't have any family.

780
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:02,022
I'm all I got.

781
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:06,498
Very well. Then
you are ordered...

782
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:07,785
That's not true.

783
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:09,512
I'm his son, Your Honour.

784
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,695
I can take care of him.

785
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,331
He can come home with me.

786
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:16,533
Mr. Reynolds, do you comply?

787
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:22,653
Yes, Your Honour.

788
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:31,213
I'm sorry, Warren.

789
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:33,478
I know this wasn't
what you wanted,

790
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:35,865
but I'm not giving up the fight.

791
00:37:36,072 --> 00:37:37,539
Okay? As long as I'm

792
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:40,104
medical director, I'm gonna...

793
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:41,640
Mr. Danova.

794
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:43,121
You know what, leave me alone.

795
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:44,851
Look, you don't
owe me anything,

796
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,656
but is it possible
to talk for a minute?

797
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:47,996
Ken, I think
you've said enough.

798
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,655
It's all going to veterans.

799
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,332
- Excuse me?
- All the proceeds

800
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,976
from the sale of your
mum's home is going

801
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,181
to New Amsterdam's
Wounded Veterans program.

802
00:37:58,452 --> 00:38:02,499
Your mother was adamant
about that stipulation.

803
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,945
We spent a lot of time together,

804
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,163
and you were always at the
centre of every conversation.

805
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,506
She could not have been
more proud of your service.

806
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,999
Hey.

807
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,046
I may have been here for her,

808
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:23,241
but it's you who gave
her peace in the end.

809
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,428
I'd be happy to share
as much as I can.

810
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:29,998
Whatever you want to know
about our time together.

811
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:35,764
Yeah, I think I'll
take you up on that.

812
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,289
Uh, thanks again for
the early drop-off.

813
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,600
The daily logistics
of cop a renting

814
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,226
are nothing short
of running a circus.

815
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:48,360
Kid coordination is an ever
moving goal post, I get it.

816
00:38:48,444 --> 00:38:50,046
This is for Sameera's
science project.

817
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,859
- Okay.
- So have fun with that,

818
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:53,966
- Bill Nye.
- Thanks.

819
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,662
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

820
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,710
Well, you know, I did, uh...

821
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,023
I did have to transfer
a psychic janitor

822
00:39:00,108 --> 00:39:03,212
to our holistic medicine
department today, where, uh,

823
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:04,921
I think he'll actually
fit in really nicely.

824
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:07,450
- Mm-hmm.
- So, you know, I'm good, yeah.

825
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,138
Just one of those days.

826
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,600
Hm.

827
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,267
- What?
- You...

828
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:15,866
You seem different.

829
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:17,733
Oh, yeah?

830
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:22,138
Yeah. Uh, in a good way.

831
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,244
Well, thank you, Martin.

832
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,655
It means a lot that...
That you noticed.

833
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,704
- Dad!
- Uh, I got to go.

834
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:31,735
- Okay.
- Thank you.

835
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,933
Yeah. Bye, kids.

836
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:34,842
- Love you.
- Thanks.

837

Here we go.

00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,874
- Vanessa.
- Hey.

846
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:11,984
- What are you doing here?
- Why don't you answer

847
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:13,005
your phone?
I've called you, like,

848
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,123
- a million times today.
- I've not had a second...
