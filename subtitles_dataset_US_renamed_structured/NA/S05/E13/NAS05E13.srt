1
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,396
- Keeping watch?

2
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,616
She's your sister?

3
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,758
What's your name, son?

4
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,717
- Maximus Leonard Goodwin.

5
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,415
- That's a nice name.

6
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:11,245
Do people call you Max?

7
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,608
How can I help?

8
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,221
And from that moment...

9
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:34,094
Because of those words,

10
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,878
I knew I was gonna be a doctor.

11
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,924
And, um,

12
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:41,926
well, I share this with
you now not just so you can

13
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,713
imagine me as an adorable
little five-year-old,

14
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,932
but, um, because...

15
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,848
I want you to remember what
that moment was for you,

16
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,024
when you knew this was
gonna be your calling.

17
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,332
Because this job
can wear you down.

18
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:59,509
Even on the best days,
takes a toll on your heart.

19
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,384
If you find yourself
in a tough moment,

20
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,777
thinking that all is lost,

21
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,866
feeling like what you
do doesn't matter,

22
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,827
I want you to remember
why you became a doctor

23
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,134
in the first place.

24
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,049
And let that moment

25
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,703
be your North Star.

26
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,704
Uh, I never imagined
I'd be standing here

27
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,534
saying goodbye to this hospital,

28
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:26,624
to this incredible
group of people.

29
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:30,672
But I think I did what
I came here to do...

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,286
Which is to make New
Amsterdam a place of hope

31
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,809
for those who need it most.

32
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:41,813
And now the time has
come for new challenges.

33
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:44,773
As many of you know, I'll be
running Global Health Policy

34
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,515
at the World Health
Organization in Geneva.

35
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,517
Even bigger systems to break

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,869
and hopefully put back
together stronger.

37
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,350
But, uh,

38
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,569
I'm gonna miss each
and every one of you.

39
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,529
And I wish I could stay
for even one more day.

40
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:04,532
But I made a very
special promise

41
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,274
to a very special person.

42
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,279
And, uh, I have to keep it.

43
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:15,673
Today is the annual
Manhattan Mermaid Parade,

44
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:18,110
and this year, we are
not gonna miss it.

45
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,030
So, um...

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,819
I don't know what to
say other than, uh,

47
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,168
thank you...

48
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,912
For everything.

49
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,611
- Dr. Max Goodwin.

50
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,990
When
you are in the market

51
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,645
for solid information,
I say go to the source.

52
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,603
- Sorry?
- Uh, information.

53
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,649
It's the information booth.

54
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,694
You...

55
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,826
You
got what I need?

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,046
- Are you lost?

57
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,221
No. Uh, no.

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,614
I'm just looking
for my assistant,

59
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:27,571
who I was supposed to meet here,

60
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,920
but I'm seeing no sign of her.

61
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,749
And I am, uh, kind of
sweaty from my commute,

62
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,553
so I'm thinking I need
to go take a cold shower

63
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,946
so that I can make a
good first impression

64
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,973
on everybody that I meet,
with the exception of...

65
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,975
What's your name?

66
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,803
- Bart.
- With the exception of Bart,

67
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,761
who has already seen
me in my natural state:

68
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:47,112
lost, harried, and slightly
dewy with perspiration.

69
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,116
- Who are you again?

70
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,381
- I'm the new medical
director of New Amsterdam.

71
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,386
- Yulia Salenko, female,
32, tachy in the field.

72
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,778
- Casey, check her heart rate.

73
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,606
Hi, Yulia. I'm Dr. Bloom.

74
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,434
Uh, we're just gonna
take some vitals, okay?

75
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,827
- I'm sorry.

76
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,915
- Don't be sorry.

77
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,351
Much rather be
taking care of you

78
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,981
than listening to Dr. Walsh
rant about inflation.

79
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,374
- The Fed's out of
control, and you know it.

80
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,703
- Let's move.

81
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,401
- She's hypotensive
and warm to the touch.

82
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,706
- Yeah, her spleen's enlarged.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,882
Possible endocarditis?
- I was thinking stroke.

84
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,754
- Maybe part of a
broader infection?

85
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,364
- Never seen anything
like this before.

86
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,931
Look at her eyes.

87
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,672
- Uh, I'm sorry, can
you go wait over there

88
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:25,866
for me, please, by
the nurses' station?

89
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,501
- Let him stay with me, please.

90
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,652
- He'll be close by, I promise.

91
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,914
I just need the
space to work, okay?

92
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,002
- Hey. Hey, bud, we're
gonna hang over here.

93
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,897
- It's okay, Dimi.
Mama's right here.

94
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,638
- I think she's got
fluid in her lungs.

95
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,161
- Okay, this didn't
happen overnight.

96
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,163
Um, Yulia,

97
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,341
how long have you been
feeling sick like this for?

98
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,864
- Weeks.

99
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,171
But we don't have any insurance.

100
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:49,174
I kept thinking it
would get better, but...

101
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:53,004
this morning when I
was brushing my teeth,

102
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,616
there was all this blood.

103
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,487
What's happening to me?

104
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,144
- I don't know.

105
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,972
But we're gonna figure it out.

106
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,279
Walsh, let's start fluids.

107
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,717
Casey, page Wilder now.

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,109
- Your labs showed

109
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:14,069
abnormally low cell
counts, Ms. Salenko.

110
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,027
I'm not sure what's
making you so sick,

111
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,943
but I would like to
biopsy your bone marrow.

112
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:21,511
That's gonna give
us a few more clues.

113
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,817
- She's good to go.

114
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,166
- Okay.

115
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,218
Hey.

116
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,525
- We've numbed your mom's back,

117
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,486
but, you know, the
needles are scary.

118
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,226
You want to wait
outside for this part?

119
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:52,977
- After we came to America,
my son stopped speaking.

120
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,502
Before, he was such
a little chatterbox.

121
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,418
But I haven't heard
his voice in a year.

122
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,077
- You can stay if you want.

123
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,959
- Squeeze my hand as hard
as you need to, okay?

124
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,573
If I die,

125
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,270
who will take care of my son?

126
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,838
I'm all he has.

127
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,714
- What do you see?

128
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,456
- Well, her biopsy clearly
shows extreme phagocytosis.

129
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,457
- Can you spell that?

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,850
- Um, P-H-G...

131
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:42,505
P-H-A... no, actually,
I... I can't. I'm sorry.

132
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,854
Her white blood cells are eating

133
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:44,918
all of her other blood cells.
- You're thinking

134
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,379
hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis?

135
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,598
- Come on, guys.

136
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:51,471
- Just say HLH.

137
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,473
- Uh, HLH is extremely rare.

138
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,909
- I know. I mean, we barely

139
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,519
even touched on
it in med school.

140
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,845
- Yeah, but it's the only thing
that explains her symptoms.

141
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,741
I mean, enlarged spleen,
excessive bleeding,

142
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,612
abdominal pain.

143
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,135
- And it is almost always fatal.

144
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,050
- I mean, I've never
even seen a case before,

145
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,009
let alone treated
one successfully.

146
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,447
- I have treated one

147
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,579
but not successfully.

148
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,058
- Same.

149
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,408
I only know of one doctor
who's been successful.

150
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,323
- Well, that's a start.

151
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,167
- Well, yeah, but I don't
want to call him in.

152
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,240
- Why?

153
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,593
- How can I help?

154
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,732
- Conco's at 23! LB!

155
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,866
Buy! Buy!
- Buy!

156
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,607
Buy!

157
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,131
Today
was insane, man.

158
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,959
You know, I... I thought
last year was peak,

159
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,918
but 2008, get ready.

160
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,530
Yo, it's gonna be next level.

161
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,183
Ugh.

162
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,795
Yo, I... I'm gonna buy me a boat.
- Ugh.

163
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,754
Pete, you get motion sickness
going down an escalator.

164
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,626
- So I'll snort Dramamine.

165
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,628
Wh-what are you gonna
do with all your dough?

166
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,937
- I don't know.

167
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,246
- Spare some change?

168
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,901
- Uh, yeah.
- Yo, get a job, man.

169
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,555
- Uh...
- Gross.

170
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,121
- Hey, hey.

171
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,645
Here.

172
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,690
- God bless you.

173
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,692
- You're just enabling
him, you know.

174
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,391
- You're a real
dirtbag, you know, Pete?

175
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,089
- It's all part of my charm.

176
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,788
- You gonna get that?
- No.

177
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,224
It's my druggie sister.

178
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:36,663
Oh, my God.

179
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,099
Call 911.

180
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,405
Uh... um, uh, excuse me!

181
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,494
Excuse me, can you help me?

182
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,193
Someone help, please!
I think he needs CPR!

183
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,934
Somebody help me, please!

184
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,284
Can somebody help?

185
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:52,026
Come on. Somebody, some...

186
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,115
Oh, my God.

187
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,333
Oh, God.

188
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:58,162
I don't know how to help you.

189
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,035
I don't know how to help.

190
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,689
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

192
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,999
- Hey.

193
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,411
Our friends down in
the cafeteria tell me

194
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,133
it's chocolate chip cookie day.

195
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,091
And I can hook you up, brother.

196
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,963
How many you want, hmm?

197
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,834
Two, three?

198
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,756
I'm working my best material,

199
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,889
but the kid's not
giving me anything.

200
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,024
- I got this.

201
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,855
Hi, Dimi,

202
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,248
would you come with me?

203
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:46,210
- His mother's in
critical condition?

204
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,604
- That's not why he won't speak.

205
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,347
She said he hasn't said
a word in over a year,

206
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,915
ever since they fled Ukraine
at the start of the war.

207
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,396
- Okay, well, maybe we need a
translator here just in case.

208
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,356
- No, she assures me
that he speaks English,

209
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,618
when he used to speak.

210
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,378
- Okay, so he's choosing
not to communicate.

211
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,753
That's, um... That's
selective mutism.

212
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,713
- Look, between you and me,

213
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:13,760
there's a real chance that his
mother's not gonna survive.

214
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,370
Look, if he won't
engage with anyone

215
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,477
and he ends up in
the foster system...

216
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,459
- Selective mutism is treatable.

217
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,721
It's okay. It's very serious,

218
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,264
and it requires
immediate intervention,

219
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,569
but I'm glad you
brought him to me.

220
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,073
I know exactly what to do.

221
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,335
Okay?

222
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,035
Hey, buddy.

223
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,514
So sorry, but I have a bunch

224
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,952
of boring old insurance
stuff to wade through here.

225
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:35,216
Shouldn't take me more than
an hour or two... three, tops.

226
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,696
You cool to wait?

227
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,308
#Adulting, am I right?

228
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:08,989
- Oh, come on, baby.

229
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,035
Okay, I am gonna be
so quick, I promise.

230
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,776
- No, Daddy, no.

231
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,474
- Hey, how long can
mermaids last out of water?

232
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,738
- Until they dry?
- That's right.

233
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,652
And that's why I'm
gonna be right back

234
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,699
and get you back in that ocean
before you dry out, okay?

235
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,832
Now, I am gonna give you this.

236
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,530
Why don't you draw
me a mermaid, okay?

237
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,140
I'll be right back.

238
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,801
Hi, Yulia. I'm Dr. Goodwin.

239
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,977
And I come bearing methotrexate.

240
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,302
It's gonna make you
feel a whole lot better.

241
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,806
- What is it?

242
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,436
- You know how we told you
that your white blood cells

243
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,549
are confused and they're
attacking your own body?

244
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,987
This should help,
uh, calm them down.

245
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,336
- I'm sorry.

246
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,338
It's just,

247
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,863
the last few hours have
just been so scary.

248
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,344
And no one seems to know
what's causing this.

249
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,477
- Well, HLH is an
aggressive syndrome.

250
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,567
But it's caused by an
underlying condition

251
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,892
that most people don't
even know they have.

252
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,224
So the real question is,
what's underneath this?

253
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,834
- How do we find out?

254
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,577
- I get to know as much
about you as I possibly can.

255
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,665
Have you had COVID?

256
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,666
That can be a trigger sometimes.

257
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,016
- Mm, no. Not that I know of.

258
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,777
- And where do you live?
What do you do for work?

259
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,107
- Um, my son and
I live in Queens.

260
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:28,111
But we came from
Ukraine last year.

261
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,026
- You got out?

262
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,073
- After the Russians bombed
a school in our village,

263
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,858
I took Dimi, and we fled.

264
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,164
- Must've been horrible.

265
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,602
- We hid in farms, stables,

266
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,517
stowed away in train cars.

267
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,345
But we made it out.

268
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,825
We left our home behind,

269
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,829
and I vowed to give my son
a better life here, but...

270
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,352
a new country,

271
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,006
no family...

272
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,485
It's been lonely.

273
00:13:57,227 --> 00:14:00,143
And now this illness, it's...

274
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,236
- Mm.

275
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,629
- What's wrong?
- Um...

276
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,302
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm very sorry,

277
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,285
but I think I made a mistake.

278
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,852
This is not gonna help you.

279
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,680
Hey, brucellosis! Brucellosis.

280
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,180
That's Yulia Salenko's
underlying condition.

281
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,964
- How'd you land there?
- Because when she fled

282
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,468
the war in Ukraine with her son,

283
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,862
they were hiding out
in farms and stables.

284
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,994
It... it's livestock. That's
gotta be how she got it.

285
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,929
- So in order to treat her
HLH, we have to completely

286
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,824
rid her body of all
traces of brucellosis.

287
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,628
- Yeah, I already started
her on a massive regimen

288
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,108
of antibiotics.
- All right, so if she fled

289
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,482
Ukraine when the war
began, that's a year ago.

290
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,938
I mean, the bacteria
would have spread

291
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,354
to every part of her body.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,678
- That's untreated endocarditis.

293
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:39,661
- I didn't say it
was gonna be easy.

294
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:40,836
- Max...
- Floyd, if we don't

295
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,403
at least try, then
she will have come

296
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,926
all this way just to die here,

297
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,948
and her son is gonna be
orphaned in a foreign country.

298
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,321
- I hear you, I do.

299
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,670
But what you're talking about,

300
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,498
this procedure, it
will literally take

301
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,804
dozens of highly trained
surgeons and specialists

302
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,284
to pull it off.
- 53.

303
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
By my count, it's gonna take 53.

304
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,124
- You know damn well that money
was for Courtney's braces.

305
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,082
- And if my garage
goes under, then what?

306
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,300
- Your garage is struggling

307
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,712
because you ran it
into the damn ground!

308
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,105
- You know I'm doing what's
best for this family!

309
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,653
- No, you're doing what's best
for Horace... like always!

310
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:16,828
- You never respect me!

311
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:17,786
I'm the man of this house!

312
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,961
- Then act like one!

313
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,973
Floyd?

314
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,456
What did you do, baby?

315
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:24,026
- I put it back
together... For you.

316
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,381
- Clamp.

317
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,210
Scalpel.

318
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,474
Forceps.

319
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,479
Popcorn on a stick.

320
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,527
Okay.

321
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,792
Now ready to implant
porcine aortic valve.

322
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,360
Dr. Wilder, uh...

323
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,970
- There's nowhere
else that I can stand.

324
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,667
- Well, can you...
Just a little...

325
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,495
- No. I have to be
right beside Dr. Gaffen,

326
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,019
and I need to be
able to see Ben.

327
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,300
- We got no wiggle
room over here, Floyd.

328
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,065
Try over there.
- Oh, God.

329
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,240
Oh.

330
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,242
- We just lost the
bypass machine.

331
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,114
- Our patient just died.

332
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,249
But hey, this is why
we rehearse, right?

333
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,816
- Max, we're packed
in here so tight

334
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,079
that if I just breathe, I'm
gonna knock something over.

335
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,819
- I know. We can
rework the plan.

336
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,604
We can do some of the
surgeries individually

337
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,929
instead of simultaneously.
- Anything that's gonna

338
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,433
give us more space
to work in here.

339
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,132
- But it's gonna add time
that we can't afford.

340
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,397
- I can help.

341
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,051
- How?

342
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,400
- I can replace the aortic valve

343
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:34,879
while her heart's still beating.

344
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,101
Then we can get rid
of this bypass machine

345
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,209
so it doesn't take
up so much space.

346
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,669
- Will that save time?

347
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,584
- Yes.

348
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,020
- While her heart's
still beating?

349
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,587
Have you ever done that before?

350
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,981
- No.

351
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:53,028
- Okay.

352
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,508
You better start practicing.

353
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,425
- All right, what do you think,

354
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:02,081
stripes, outrageous pattern?

355
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,604
Which one?

356
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,040
- Neither?

357
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,564
- What, no tie? Huh.

358
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:08,913
- What about a bolo?

359
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:11,133
Albert wore a turquoise
one on our first date,

360
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,241
and I found it quite fetching.

361
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:15,137
- Oh, yes, Albert, the new beau.

362
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,680
When do I get to meet
the lucky fella, huh?

363
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,160
What do you think,
dinner Saturday night?

364
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,620
- Uh, okay.

365
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,119
- Good. We can chat
about his affinity

366
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,014
for Southwestern apparel.

367
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,150
- What are you doing?

368
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,021
- Oh, I'm, uh...
I'm ignoring him.

369
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,762
- Yeah. I can see that.

370
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:34,504
- Mm-hmm.
- But why?

371
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,158
- Well, because with
selective mutism,

372
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,594
you do not pursue.

373
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,640
You create a path and
let them come to you.

374
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,816
I have set the
table, so to speak.

375
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:45,472
Now all he has to do
is come and feast.

376
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,822
- He doesn't appear
to be hungry.

377
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,781
- Not even a little bit.

378
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,046
Mm.

379
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,620
- Hey.

380
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,622
Hey, Lu.

381
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,059
- Mermaid Parade?

382
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,776
- I don't think we're gonna
make the Mermaid Parade

383
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,062
this year.
- No.

384
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,108
You said mermaids.

385
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,023
- I know. I know I did.

386
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,199
But then someone
came to our hospital,

387
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,070
and they need our help...
- But you said.

388
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,594
- I know I did, but I...

389
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,731
Look at me.

390
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:31,953
This patient, she
really needs our help.

391
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,912
And not just me.

392
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,567
This whole hospital,

393
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:41,180
everybody here, is gonna help.

394
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,704
So we gotta help her.

395
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,402
And hey, you and me,

396
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,274
we're gonna have so
many fun things to do...

397
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,754
I hate New Amsterdam!

398
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,285
- Drug overdose,
found in the park.

399
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,330
Patient's a 62-year-old
male, unresponsive.

400
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,680
- Got this one, boss.

401
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,247
- Are you okay?

402
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,162
- Yeah.

403
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,598
Yeah, I don't know, I...

404
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,340
I've given up hope on
Vanessa ever getting clean,

405
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:13,124
ever seeing her again.

406
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,624
But I'm in this
constant state of fear

407
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,128
every time someone comes
crashing through that door.

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,307
- Oh, she's bottoming out.
- Uh, we need help over here!

409
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,960
- Yeah, what happened?

410
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,093
- BP's tanking.

411
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,399
- Okay. We gotta do this now.

412
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,965
Let's get her to the OR.

413
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,815
- I thought we had
until tomorrow.

414
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,970
- So did I.

415
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,932
I hope you used
those ten minutes

416
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,760
to work out the kinks,

417
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,283
'cause rehearsal's over.

418
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:49,160
- What a waste of everything.

419
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,032
I sank all our money
into that thrasher.

420
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,513
Brand-new, made to
last, and what happens?

421
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:56,124
Snap beans are the top
cash crop 20 years running

422
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,126
until yours truly
starts planting 'em.

423
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,172
And then it's early frost
and seed-corn maggots.

424
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,436
You know how screwed we are now?

425
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,438
Maybe God has it out for me.

426
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,701
Maybe I even deserve it.

427
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,268
- This'll be three
Sundays in a row

428
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,573
I miss church.

429
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:13,489
People notice, start talking.

430
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,926
Lina Tompkins at Rotary had
to make her little comment,

431
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,755
and now I can't
even look at her.

432
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,366
Worse is the way
they look at me,

433
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,456
at that pathetic woman whose
husband is out catting around.

434
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,024
I just need to
lose a few pounds.

435
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:30,289
And then he'll
see me. I know it.

436
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,639
Why can't I?

437
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:35,859
Why am I just... this?

438
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,948
- So Tiff Stinson put
her hand on my arm,

439
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,299
and she "accidentally"
brushes her boobs against me.

440
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,517
That's a signal, right?

441
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,712
But she and Tiff
are best friends,

442
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:43,954
and I'm with Allie.

443
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,305
No way Tiff keeps
her mouth shut,

444
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,654
but I mean, good God,

445
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,133
she is so much
hotter than Allie.

446
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,134
So maybe I should just go for...

447
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,355
- Why are you telling me this?

448
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,617
- I don't know, freak.

449
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:55,879
I'm just making conversation.

450
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,403
- No, it's not.

451
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:01,015
You, Mom, Dad, everyone
just talks atme.

452
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,017
It's always weird,
private grown-up stuff

453
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,193
that they never share
with anyone else.

454
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:07,369
But why does everyone
feel like they can just

455
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,066
dump all their crap on me?

456
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,242
They act like I'm not even here,

457
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,070
like I'm invisible.

458
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,291
- Listen, you're the
opposite of invisible, Iggy.

459
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,033
You're like a rock or a
mountain or something.

460
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,818
You don't judge.
You just listen.

461
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,734
And I don't know why, but
you being here, listening,

462
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,520
just kind of makes
things better.

463
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,697
- You want something?

464
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,022
You don't have to
talk, just, uh...

465
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,265
Point.

466
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,055
Oh, Mamma mia.

467
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,365
This, uh, little experiment
of mine is not going

468
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,279
how I thought it would.

469
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,630
Can you tell?

470
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,634
Usually people just open
right up to me, you know,

471
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,200
my whole life.

472
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:58,551
It's kind of a big part
of why I became a doctor.

473
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:01,858
But you are a tough nut
to crack, my friend.

474
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,860
My biggest and
baddest doctor moves

475
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,688
are not having
any effect on you.

476
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:09,170
I don't know, maybe I need to...

477
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:12,173
stop talking like a doctor.

478
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,828
You know, we do have something
in common, me and you.

479
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,831
I know your secret.

480
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,310
Yeah.

481
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:23,532
Yeah, I didn't talk
much as a kid either.

482
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:26,492
People would always say I
was such a good listener.

483
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:29,451
But, uh, you and I both know
that they had that backwards.

484
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:34,891
I wasn't quiet because
I loved listening.

485
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,546
I was quiet because I was...

486
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,200
terrified of talking.

487
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,595
I hated it so much,
because talking...

488
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,511
You know, really talking...

489
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:48,601
Means revealing who you are.

490
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,472
Means being seen.

491
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:55,085
I figured if I just didn't talk,

492
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:59,307
nobody would ever see
how broken I felt inside,

493
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,830
how scared.

494
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,400
And that broken,
scared part inside

495
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,577
that all this silence
is protecting...

496
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,715
Talking is the only
way to heal that too.

497
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,512
So listen, I am not going
to ask you what you want.

498
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,905
If you want something,

499
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:34,864
you are gonna have to
reach out for yourself

500
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,039
and take it.

501
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,729
- We're behind, but if
anybody's gotta close,

502
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:08,730
I'm glad it's you.

503
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,297
- This plan won't work.

504
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,961
- Hello.

505
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:23,440
Hello, anyone?

506
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,095
Anybody from oncology around?

507
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,796
If this is a prank, hats off.

508
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,014
- Oh, there you are.

509
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:33,165
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

510
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,364
I'm Kate, your new assistant.

511
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,844
- Oh, so I am in
the right hospital.

512
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,063
- Yeah, of course.

513
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,499
Uh, do you need anything?

514
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:39,805
- Yeah. I need doctors...

515
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,067
Doctors to run the hospital.

516
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,024
Do you know where
all the doctors are?

517
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,460
- Yeah, well, things are always

518
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:44,873
a little crazy around here.
- Well, spread the word.

519
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:47,203
All department heads,
auditorium, 6:00 p.m.

520
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,988
It's about to get even crazier.

521
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,775
- We gotta go back to plan
A, put Yulia on bypass.

522
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,777
- No, it's, uh... We're
two hours behind, Floyd.

523
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,276
That's gonna take time
that we don't have.

524
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,800
What happened to your plan?
- Well, I didn't exactly

525
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,739
get the time I needed to
perfect the technique.

526
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,784
Look, stopping her
heart is tried and true.

527
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,283
- No, her lungs can't
afford the extra time.

528
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,700
She's got one shot left, Floyd,

529
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,504
and it's operating on
her still-beating heart.

530
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,356
- Just because she's got
one shot doesn't mean

531
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,247
that it'll work or that
it's even a good idea, Max.

532
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,683
- I know, but if I
had one shot left,

533
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,796
I would want youto take it.

534
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:21,194
And Yulia should get no less.

535
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,328
- Okay.

536
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,350
Blood pressure dropping.

537
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,289
Heart rate.

538
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,378
- No sign of hemorrhage.

539
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,953
- 80 over 40. 80 over 40.

540
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:26,694
Up on the monitors.

541
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,186
- Who are you supposed to be?

542
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:46,540
- Dr. Ross.

543
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,758
- Ah!
- Hey, give that back.

544
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,325
- Says the brainless monster.

545
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,892
- Give that back to her now!

546
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,589
- Why does she
need a stethoscope?

547
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,721
She can't even hear.

548
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:02,991
- She thinks you should
be something else,

549
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,212
something less hard for you.

550
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,387
Hey, hey.

- Scalpel.

556
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,476
- Blood pressure's
still dropping.

557
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,738

whoa, what are you doing?

558

559

Hey, hey. Elizabeth, stop.

560

Starting fluid resuscitation.

- Hi.

637
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,262
I grew up at New Amsterdam.

638
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,699
My mother died in this hospital.

639
00:39:57,743 --> 00:40:01,790
My father spent every
waking second here,

640
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:05,185
breaking the system so he could
put it back together again,

641
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,927
better and stronger than before.

642
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,843
Doing whatever he could
to help his patients.

643
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:16,022
I remember my father's last
day as medical director.

644
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:19,591
He was supposed to take
me to this Mermaid Parade,

645
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,594
just a special day with my dad.

646
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,030
But then he got
called in to help

647
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:26,685
with an impossible surgery.

648
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,774
And I was so mad.

649
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,864
I thought, this place
has taken my father

650
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,822
away from me yet again.

651
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,520
But then, over the
course of the day,

652
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:39,741
I saw how hard he
worked to save one life

653
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:43,441
and how hard everybody
worked together.

654
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:47,140
And that's when I realized
that New Amsterdam didn't

655
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:50,404
take my father away from me.

656
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,146
This hospital gave me my father.

657
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,279
Showed me who he was,

658
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,804
who I could be.

659
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:03,504
And that's the day I realized
I wanted to be just like him.

660
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:06,246
It was the day I knew I
wanted to be a doctor.

661
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:10,380
So I wanted to start
by asking all of you

662

father asked his staff
