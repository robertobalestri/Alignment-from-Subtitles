1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,365
Damn.

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,640
Damn right.

3
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:16,589
Mm.

4
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,750
The sink's clogged again!

5
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,164
Plumber is coming tomorrow!

6
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:32,110
It's like a crime scene
in here.

7
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,789
Written word not enough, huh?

8
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,470
You want the full
audio experience?

9
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,994
I need an actual human being,

10
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,690
or someone is getting strangled
with a plunger.

11
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,174
We still being sexy?

12
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,567
Look, I've only got
a few weeks left.

13
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:57,135
<i>It's time to make this
an in-person thing.</i>

14
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,745
So let's do it.

15
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,095
<i>Tonight.</i>

16
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:01,966
For real, for real?

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,924
<i>What about your dad?</i>

18
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,100
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,145
He's... he's doing great.

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,973
He's on his meds.
Model roommate.

21
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:11,671
So it's time for him to see
a sock on the door knob

22
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:12,846
and get gone.

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,196
<i>For real.</i>

24
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,159
Oh, I know that smile.

25
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,769
That's the smile of a man
making plans

26
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,507
for the finest
fishing exposition

27
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,015
in the tristate area.

28
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,905
That's a bunch of old timers

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,082
swapping stories
in the back of a bait shop?

30
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,344
Sure.

31
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:34,129
If you wanna say
the Javits Convention Center

32
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:35,956
is a bait shop.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,828
Oh, looks great, Dad.

34
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:39,134
Yeah, tell me about it.

35
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:42,311
I will not,
'cause you're coming.

36
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,182
Sounds great, Dad.

37
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,270
Good.

38
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,490
We'll go after your work.

39
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,448
Wait, the expo's tonight?

40
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:50,797
Is that a problem?

41
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:08,000
Mm.

42
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:11,765
What did you do that for?

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,463
Just making sure you're real.

44
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:19,804
Only way to know for sure
is to give me a scalp massage.

45
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,306
- Dad's back!
- Hi, everybody.

46
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:26,877
Hi, guys.
You're darn right, Dad's back.

47
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,400
- Yeah.
- I'm here.

48
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:33,797
This morning,
my daughter said that

49
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:39,367
when I'm tired,
I look like a sad racoon.

50
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:44,721
So do you think I can trade her

51
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,854
for a new car?

52
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,075
A very nice new car.

53
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,641
Good.

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,171
Thank you.

55
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,937
Where do you get
your motivation?

56
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,834
Good morning.

57
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,657
I have the clinical
trial prospectus.

58
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,267
Thank you.

59
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:14,680
Well, Dana, this is Dr. Wilder.

60
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:20,864
And Dr. Wilder, this is Dana,
my ASL teacher.

61
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,219
Oh, yeah.
No, I got that one.

62
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,569
Crystal clear.

63
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,397
<i>♪ It's a brand new</i>

64
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,920
Please give me
something good.

65
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:56,271
And this one's
the quarterly budget template.

66
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,533
Another? How many are there?

67
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,143
It's quarterly, so four.

68
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:00,492
Sandra Fall, I hate forms.

69
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,015
Forms never helped anyone.

70
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,017
Well, this one literally
funds the hospital.

71
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,584
If I'm not looking
into a patient's eyes,

72
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:08,021
if I'm not looking
into the underlying roots

73
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,719
of their issues, then...

74
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,460
Then you can do your
actual job, sign these forms,

75
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,288
- and end this conversation.
- I had a question.

76
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:14,724
Is there a form that fires you?

77
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,032
You keep shredding it
against my wishes.

78
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,466
Sign.

79
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,939
The ICU needs
a substitute attending?

80
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,036
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Slavin broke her ankle.

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,124
She's out today.

82
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:30,043
All right. So today I am not
your boss's boss's boss.

83
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,002
I am just simply your boss.

84
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,699
So I'm here for you.

85
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,833
Let's do some actual medicine.

86
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:38,871
Who's with me?

87
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:41,191
You look chipper.

88
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:42,404
Do I?

89
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,057
Well, it is never a bad day
to have a good day,

90
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,410
my enchanting chairwoman.

91
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:46,843
Charmed and unnerved.

92
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,453
Look, we have a problem outside.

93
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,638
- Okay.
- An unhoused gentleman

94
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,988
who's facing some challenges

95
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,633
has created
an untenable environment.

96
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,297
I don't... I don't follow.
What are you saying?

97
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,821
There's a crazy
homeless guy out front.

98
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,607
He's scaring our patients.
I need him gone.

99
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:02,579
Well, that was a touching
and heartfelt alternate way

100
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:04,032
of putting that.
Thank you.

101
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,427
I'm suggesting
you provide him

102
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,690
with appropriate care
and services.

103
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,995
That is far away
from our entrance.

104
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,171
- Thank you, Ignatius.
- You got it.

105
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,739
Do not go inside!

106
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,703
Yes. Yes.

107
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,171
Come out.

108
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,355
Get away from them.

109
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,052
Stop. Stop.

110
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,314
They will kill you!

111
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,726
Hey, there. Hey.

112
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,439
Got a little something here
that might brighten your day.

113
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:29,015
Evil. Evil people.

114
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,539
Okay. Sure. Sure.

115
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,882
You're one of them.

116
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:36,233
Actually, I'm just a guy
with some socks.

117
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:40,039
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:42,242
Want a pair?

119
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,812
Yeah. Go ahead. Take a pair.
It's cold out here.

120
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,515
Yeah, you're good. Yeah.

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,602
I got a whole bag
full of socks here.

122
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,343
I got sweaters.

123
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:53,823
What you say
you and I take this

124
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,041
wherever you're camping out

125
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,281
and we stash
the whole bag there?

126
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,044
I got a place
just over there.

127
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,268
Oh, over here under
the scaffolding?

128
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,965
Yeah. I've seen people there.

129
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:09,491
No.

130
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:12,407
Penthouse.

131
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,064
Penthouse?

132
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,416
Right on.

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,587
Oh, that is quite
the decision.

134
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,023
- Tell me about it.
- Right.

135
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,286
So you can either hang out
with a bunch of AARP guys

136
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,376
at a literal fish show,
or you can hook up

137
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,902
with a beautiful, available,
interested woman.

138
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,599
Yeah.
I can see why you're torn.

139
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,818
It's not that easy,
all right?

140
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,559
All I've ever wanted
was my family back.

141
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,908
And now that I have it...

142
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,301
Young woman found
down in Morandi Park.

143
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,564
Unresponsive.

144
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,348
Respirations
and heart rate slow.

145
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,523
Vanessa.

146
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,177
Vanessa?

147
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:57,833
Pupils are pinpoint, nonreactive.

148
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,225
Narcotics overdose.

149
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,139
I need a second IV.

150
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,315
- O-2 sats are low.
- On it.

151
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,230
Saturation 88%.

152
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,406
I need an intubation tray
with a seven.

153
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,236
Pushing Narcan.

154
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,096
Quick pop quiz.

155
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,683
This is from a 65-year-old man

156
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,292
who is hypertensive
and unconscious.

157
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:43,946
Do you shock this rhythm?

158
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,905
No.

159
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:46,993
Yes.

160
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,080
All right.

161
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:49,840
So you just flip through
these four screens,

162
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,714
and then you pull down
this tab right here.

163
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,019
And, oh, the M key
does not work.

164
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,545
So we just use a little "rn"
right next to each other.

165
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,808
Someone's gotta build
a better system.

166
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,027
Oh.
What if that's someone is you?

167
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,942
When you approach a patient
about hospice,

168
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,726
you don't talk
about end-of-life care.

169
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,598
You just talk about life care.

170
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:09,513
This is just
the next stage of it.

171
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,995
- It's Duane Roberts.
- All right.

172
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,180
This is it.

173
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,868
You're up.

174
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:20,176
BP 60 over 49.

175
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,264
Absent breath sounds
on the left.

176
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:22,613
Left heart's straining EKG.

177
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:25,200
Tension pneumo.
Need a left-sided chest tube.

178
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,732
VAN runs under the rib.

179
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:42,665
BP rising.

180
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,870
Sats normalizing.

181
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,481
It worked.

182
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,537
That's good work.

183
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,120
Decision, coordination,
execution, all excellent.

184
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,908
Mika, you okay?

185
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,365
It used to be cleaner.

186
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,541
Oh, no, no.

187
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,866
This is, uh... this is amazing.

188
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,560
Wow.

189
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:30,350
Look at this place.

190
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,352
Look at that view.

191
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,481
Oh, someone's a gamer, huh?

192
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:37,294
Uh, coder.

193
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,609
Bit coin.

194
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:40,482
Cooler.

195
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,967
Do you want one?

196
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,925
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

197
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,361
I'll take one of those.

198
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,642
Cheers.

199
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,845
So, hey, just curious.

200
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,410
Why did you start hanging out
in front of New Amsterdam?

201
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,633
I'm warning people.

202
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:58,896
Warning people about what?

203
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,375
Bad things happen
in that place.

204
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,352
They're evil. They hurt people.

205
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:06,512
They do experiments
on young children.

206
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,254
They use lightning,
and they rip out their brains.

207
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,531
They tie them down with rubber.

208
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,866
And it's tight.

209
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,868
No! It burns.

210
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,261
And they zap.

211
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,915
They zap and zap and zap.

212
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,090
They...

213
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,226
I'm saving those kids.

214
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,011
Tied down with rubber?

215
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,099
Lightning?

216
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,927
Don't... don't try to deny it.

217
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,450
No, no, I'm not.
That... that is how they

218
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:34,580
used to do electroshock therapy
40 years ago.

219
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:36,934
Harlan, when you were a kid,

220
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,110
were you a patient
at New Amsterdam?

221
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,895
Oh...

222
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,950
Hey, how you doing?

223
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,782
How does it freaking look?

224
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,524
It's the Narcan.

225
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,222
You're in withdrawal
from the heroin.

226
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:07,529
Well, it feels like ants
are crawling out of my body.

227
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,314
So... oh, Jesus.

228
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:10,619
All right. Okay.

229
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,012
We're gonna get you
through this.

230
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,840
- Stop. Get off.
- What?

231
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:15,450
- Stop gloating, all right?
- I'm not gloating.

232
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,843
- Please just leave.
- Okay, you really...

233
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:18,950
Ugh. Jesus.

234
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:23,154
All right.
You know what, Vanessa?

235
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,503
You tried to kill yourself.

236
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,765
Whether you realize it or not,

237
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:26,940
that is what you tried to do.

238
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,157
And I'm gonna be here for you, okay?

239
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,599
Yeah. Well, you know what?

240
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,166
Being nice to me now
is not gonna change the fact

241
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,208
that Mom died hating you.

242
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:44,871
That's not true.

243
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,307
Yes, it is.

244
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,874
Yeah, it is, actually.

245
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,486
Thanks to me, she wrote you
a letter a few years ago,

246
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,227
an apology, you know,

247
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,534
for being
such a terrible mother.

248
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,663
I threw it away.

249
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:09,896
Why would you do that?

250
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,984
Answer me.

251
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,551
Why would you do that?

252
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,770
Because you didn't deserve
that, Lauren!

253
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,168
God, she was so vulnerable

254
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,904
when she came to me
with that letter.

255
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:19,926
She was, like, crying
and asking me

256
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,777
if I thought you'd ever
forgive her.

257
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,620
She thought
you threw it in her face.

258
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,927
So yes, Lauren. Yes.

259
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,712
I'm pretty sure
she died hating you.

260
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:28,931
You know what?

261
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:29,932
You really are pathetic,
aren't you?

262
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,325
And there she is. You see,

263
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,587
this is who you really are.

264
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,197
How many times
do I have to tell you?

265
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,417
- I'm done with it!
- Selfish bitch!

266
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,722
- I'm done with being there!
- I can't stand

267
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,246
the condescending bitch
you've become.

268
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,205
Vanessa? Vanessa? Vanessa?

269
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,251
I need help in here!

270
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,600
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:47,251
Okay, okay. Okay.

272
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,552
- Chest, it hurts.
- What do you got?

273
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,779
Hypertensive,
diaphoretic, tachy.

274
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,521
Probably narcotic withdrawal.

275
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,598
- My chest.
- Vanessa, I know it hurts,

276
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,286
but we need you to stay still, okay?

277
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,124
Start an Esmolol drip.

278
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,512
- TOX screen?
- The usual polypharmacy.

279
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:05,067
Oxy, meth, cocaine,
marijuana, you name it.

280
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,652
Was she acting erratically?

281
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:10,787
She was outta control,
screaming the most hateful...

282
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,136
An adrenergic storm.

283
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,007
From acute cocaine toxicity.

284
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,922
Her coronary artery
is spasming.

285
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,489
I didn't see it. I...

286
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,317
We gotta get her
to a cath lab now.

287
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:20,579
The clues
were right in front of me,

288
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:21,841
but why didn't I see it?

289
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:23,930
With family, we never see it.

290
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:26,150
Let's go.

291
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,673
Straight. Straight. This way.

292
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,027
Hey.

293
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,029
- Hey.
- You okay?

294
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:38,162
Uh, yeah,
it was just allergies.

295
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:42,166
It didn't look
like allergies.

296
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,689
Looked like a panic attack.

297
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,778
Oh, no. Not at all.

298
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,824
I mean, I've been here a month,
and Elliot's code

299
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,304
isn't one of the top ten
most intense things

300
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,001
that have happened all week.

301
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,655
Who's Elliot?

302
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:54,654
The... the patient.
The code we just ran.

303
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,620
No, Mika.
That was Duane.

304
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,622
Who's Elliot?

305
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,504
Um...

306
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:10,063
My first patient here.

307
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:11,891
You never forget your first, right?

308
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,284
No.

309
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,414
Especially if they die.

310
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,163
How did you know that?

311
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,253
'Cause I've stood
where you're standing.

312
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,125
Patients die, Mika,
no matter what you do,

313
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,431
no matter how good you are,

314
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,129
and I've been watching you
on the floor.

315
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,914
You're a really good doctor.

316
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:38,788
No.

317
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,398
I'm an excellent doctor.

318
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,705
Elliot had a triple A
that ruptured.

319
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,620
That's one of the hardest
procedures we do,

320
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:47,315
and I ran that code flawlessly.

321
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,761
And then I went home
for the night,

322
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:57,763
and he died

323
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,418
while I was watching
a reality cooking show

324
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,678
and eating a takeaway salad.

325
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,556
I could have saved him.

326
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,295
He was my patient,
and I left him to die.

327
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:20,305
They experimented on me
with lightning.

328
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,136
It hurt.

329
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,748
Yeah, I bet.

330
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,445
Yeah, a lot of hospitals
back then used

331
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,448
a very crude version
of electroshock,

332
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:32,929
and they way overmedicated.

333
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,496
Just so many pills.

334
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,975
You could barely even move.

335
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,762
It's like being in a cage.

336
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,766
A cage you can't see.

337
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:53,863
You know, Harlan,

338
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,995
we don't do that anymore.

339
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,215
No, we don't.

340
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,651
And I have helped schizophrenics

341
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,915
without pills, without shocks.

342
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,569
None of it.

343
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,396
Really?

344
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,833
Yeah, really.

345
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,619
If you come with me
to my office today,

346
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,751
I will get you
back on your feet.

347
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,236
It doesn't believe you.

348
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,498
The voice?

349
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,021
- Mm...
- Yeah. That's okay.

350
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:23,414
That's okay. That's okay.

351
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,722
But all you have to do
is let me try,

352
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,811
and you will see
that I can help you.

353
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,203
I mean, Harlan, look
at what you've accomplished.

354
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,553
Look at this.

355
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,424
You were doing really well
for a very long time.

356
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,860
Stop talking.

357
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:36,862
Look, going to the hospital,
that's new, right?

358
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,734
Shut up!

359
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:41,476
Did something happen
recently?

360
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,477
- Something...
- Get out.

361
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,348
Get outta here now!

362
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,176
- Get outta here right now.
- Okay.

363
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,133
No hospitals!

364
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,352
No doctors!

365
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:49,571
No, no, no!

366
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,866
No!

367
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,873
Morandi Park.

368
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,963
I don't...

369
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,123
Vanessa lives
on the Upper West Side.

370
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:40,209
So do all of her friends.

371
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:44,052
Yet she OD'd in Morandi Park...

372
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,082
directly across the street
from this hospital.

373
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,043
She knew exactly
where they'd bring her.

374
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,855
She knew that I'd be the one
to see her like this.

375
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:08,462
She chose this.

376
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:14,189
That's how much she hates me.

377
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,672
Well, she was coked
out of her mind.

378
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,544
It wasn't the coke.

379
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,546
She meant what she said,
every last word of it.

380
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,013
She meant it.

381
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,933
And why shouldn't she hate me?

382
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:31,279
I left her.

383
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:33,152
Lauren...

384
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:37,834
You wanna know
the worst part?

385
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,451
If she never woke up,

386
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:46,181
I think a part of me
would be relieved.

387
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:55,591
Why didn't I help her?

388
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,513
You know why
better than anyone.

389
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:03,546
An addict has to want help.

390
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,417
I have to try.
I have to try.

391
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,724
I can't... I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

392
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,465
- No, you...
- No, Floyd, I'm not just gonna

393
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,291
walk away
and just watch her die.

394
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,895
This time I'm staying.

395
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,622
Get out.

396
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:28,048
- Don't you spy on me.
- I'm not.

397
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,702
- Don't you spy.
- 48 floors.

398
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:30,964
It just... it takes a minute.

399
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:34,141
Damn thing. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

400
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,037
Hey, the protein shakes,
you like 'em?

401
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,213
They good?

402
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:43,368
Yeah.

403
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:46,284
Did you start drinking them

404
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,851
right before
you started warning people

405
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,113
out in front of the hospital?

406
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,377
What?

407
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:02,269
The M key doesn't work.
Remember?

408
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:04,346
Gotta just use "rn."

409
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,735
Thanks.

410
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,655
Mika, you left your patient
'cause your shift was over.

411
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:13,025
Can we not talk about this?

412
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,876
Well, I can't let you
see patients until we do.

413
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:20,750
Fine.

414
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:26,324
I could have stayed.

415
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,283
I chose to leave.

416
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:31,938
When you're not on call,
do you ever sleep here?

417
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,026
We all grab naps sometimes.

418
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,551
That's not what I meant.

419
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,813
How often do you go home?

420
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,642
It depends.

421
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:42,035
Mika, I'm just asking you,

422
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,863
when was the last time
that you got

423
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:47,734
a full night's sleep
in your own bed?

424
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:58,356
The night Elliot died.

425
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,188
That was over a month ago.

426
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:08,062
Mika, you have to go home.

427
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:10,297
It's not a request.

428
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,979
I don't think you're allowed
to dictate where I sleep,

429
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,890
and my performance
isn't a problem.

430
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:18,141
So... thank you for your concern, truly.

431
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:20,661
But I'm not going anywhere.

432
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,709
You want to take the job.

433
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,009
I have to.

434
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,660
It's too important.

435
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,057
I won't leave you in the lurch.

436
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,450
I'll help with the transition.

437
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,159
I will handle the interviews
for my replacement.

438
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,149
Can we talk alone?

439
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:00,970
I'll be right outside.

440
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:04,984
Hey, hey.
I have good news.

441
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:07,274
You dealt with the homeless...
Unhoused gentleman?

442
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,476
Yes. His name is Harlan,

443
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,217
and I did help him indeed.

444
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,438
It turns out the problem
was protein shakes.

445
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,744
It didn't look like
the problem was protein shakes.

446
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,789
Well, upon further inspection,

447
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:18,138
they were all he was eating,

448
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:20,749
which led to a niacin
deficiency, AKA pellagra,

449
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,621
which I then treated
with a multivitamin.

450
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,101
So he wasn't schizophrenic,

451
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:25,754
he just needed
Flint stone pills?

452
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,322
He is still schizophrenic,

453
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:29,846
just minus the aggressive
behavior, the irritability,

454
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,977
and the angry voices
in his head.

455
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,544
That was all the pellagra.

456
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:35,025
As long as sanity has
prevailed at our front door,

457
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,635
- I'm happy.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,071
Yeah.
Well, you know, about that.

459
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,899
Do you get your vitamins?

460
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:41,509
There's 13 essential ones.

461
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:43,642
They're good for your bones,
your immune system.

462
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:44,861
This will save your life.

463
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:46,819
I told you to clear
the front door.

464
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:48,777
No. No, you told me to help.

465
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,475
- Hey, Iggy!
- And I did.

466
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,911
- Hey!
- Hey, doing great.

467
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,870
Excuse me.
Do you get your vitamins?

468
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:55,610
Vitamins are really good
for you.

469
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,528
You're still here.

470
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,136
Dr. Goodwin.

471
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,614
You gotta go.

472
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,796
Stay, and you're a bad doctor.

473
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,891
Are you asking me
to care less?

474
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:17,847
No. If anything,
I'm asking you to care more.

475
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,985
The hardest part of caring
is the part you're not doing.

476
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:24,941
- Letting go.
- Giving up is not caring.

477
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:28,992
Elliot's gone.

478
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:30,863
If you worked
1,000 hours straight,

479
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:32,212
it wouldn't bring him back.

480
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:33,779
- You can't undo it.
- Stop.

481
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:36,956
Sometimes people go,

482
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,566
and wanting them to stay,

483
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,655
fighting, clinging,

484
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,919
that's for you.

485
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:45,965
And you going home,

486
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,446
that's for the person
who needs you next.

487
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,022
Can I walk you out?

488
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:01,676
Yeah.

489
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:12,861
Is she...

490
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:15,386
Vanessa's awake,

491
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,083
and she's asking for you.

492
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:22,349
You don't have to go.

493
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:25,045
Don't keep doing this
to yourself.

494
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,965
She's family.

495
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,054
You don't turn your back
on that.

496
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:33,168
Well, I thought that too.

497
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:37,712
With my dad when I was trying
to get into his life,

498
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:41,064
I made so many excuses for him.

499
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:45,372
I said I wasn't gonna be
the one who turned away,

500
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:48,068
but my friend told me
that was crap.

501
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:51,291
It's not the same.

502
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:56,946
You said that change won't
happen unless you demand it.

503
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:01,867
But what if it doesn't?

504
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:05,349
What if she needs me,
and I'm not there?

505
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,614
What if she dies?

506
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:14,619
I don't know how to help her.

507
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,972
I don't know how...

508
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,234
I don't know how to help her.

509
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,541
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

510
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:26,718
You've already done it once
when you were 18.

511
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,372
No.

512
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,679
That was selfish.

513
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,290
You know, me leaving her,

514
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,466
that put that needle
in her arm.

515
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,076
Listen.

516
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,471
If you hadn't left,
you'd be in a bed next to her.

517
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,342
All right?
She has someone alive

518
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:47,478
to help her
because you left, right?

519
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:54,006
You spent most of your life
wishing you can change things.

520
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,790
But you know what?

521
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:00,404
It wasn't the worst thing
you ever did.

522
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:02,710
It was the best.

523
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:06,671
And I think Vanessa needs you
to do it again.

524
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:29,520
She's not coming?

525
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:30,735
No.

526
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,696
But she wanted me
to give you this.

527
00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:40,441
That's where she'll be.

528
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,673
Hey, Pops.
Give me a minute to change,

529
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,021
and we can hit that tri...

530
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,071
What's happening?

531
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,244
I'm moving out.

532
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:04,859
Okay. If you're...

533
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,122
feeling anxious
about something,

534
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,382
- we can work through it.
- Son, I'm good.

535
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:11,036
Have a seat.

536
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:21,093
This may be hard
for you to hear,

537
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:22,834
but I read all your texts.

538
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:24,227
- Pops!
- Easy.

539
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,098
It was an accident.

540
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,795
I was checking out vendors
for the expo.

541
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,928
And when I closed the browser,

542
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:32,931
your message app
was all over the screen.

543
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:35,583
The thread
with this Gabrielle girl.

544
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:38,110
I tried not to look,
but those pictures...

545
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:39,198
Oh, my God.

546
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:40,939
Calm down. I didn't linger,

547
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,419
but I got enough to know

548
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:45,030
that you are about to make
the wrong call.

549
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:46,966
Oh, no, no, no, no.

550
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:50,905
Pops, look,
you are not in the way.

551
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,604
This isn't pity.

552
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,606
I want to pick you.

553
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,042
I don't know
if I got the right

554
00:35:57,126 --> 00:36:01,612
to give you fatherly advice,
but if I did,

555
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,657
I'd say the most important
thing I've learned

556
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,527
is you go for the girl.

557
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,495
No, Pops. Pops, wait.

558
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,931
Just...

559
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:26,506
I'm afraid
I won't see you again.

560
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:32,556
Son, the first time I left,
that was selfish.

561
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,821
This time,
I'm doing it for you.

562
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:45,830
Hello.

563
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,919
So is anybody in the mood

564
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:51,488
for a sweeping
romantic gesture?

565
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:56,014
This Cab is both robust
and impertinent,

566
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,668
much like myself.

567
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,493
Iggy in a bottle.

568
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,892
Hey.

569
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:06,372
- Hey.
- Hey.

570
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,287
So I know last night
was a lot,

571
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:11,725
um, but it was wonderful.

572
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,511
Maybe things haven't changed
that much.

573
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:17,554
Yeah, our good parts
are still good.

574
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,909
But what's it say
about the bad parts?

575
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:24,303
I don't know.

576
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:27,045
You know, we'll find out.

577
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,305
Maybe... maybe they're better.

578
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:33,265
Maybe's not an answer.

579
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,708
We can't just blindly hope
that our problems

580
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,318
have magically solved themselves.

581
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:40,624
I don't think that, Martin.

582
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,677
I'm not... I'm not waiting

583
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,146
for them to magically
solve themselves.

584
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm... I'm working at changing.

585
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,328
I have changed.
You've seen it.

586
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:50,982
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm not just talking

587
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,244
about the physical,
the outside.

588
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:53,245
You know,
I'm talking about inside.

589
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,725
I feel different.

590
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,074
I'm different.

591
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:59,204
Iggy, so am I.

592
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:08,695
Martin, I love you.

593
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:12,351
I'm in love with you.

594
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:18,923
I love you so much...

595
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,580
But we're not those people anymore.

596
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:36,854
It's time to finalize
the divorce.
