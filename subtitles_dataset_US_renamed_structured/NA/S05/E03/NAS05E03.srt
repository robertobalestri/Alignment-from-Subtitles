2
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02,928
She was dealing with a lot.

3
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,944
Maybe she needed
to deal with that alone.

4
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:06,646
I know she did,
'cause she told me.

5
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:08,332
I don't know how
to be a single man.

6
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,085
Your profile is set to only
matches over 90 years old.

7
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,757
If you just toggle that...

8
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:13,701
Oh, my gosh.

9
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:15,896
I'm looking
for a Horace Reynolds.

10
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:18,178
Hey, look, I heard
he got really sick.

11
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,852
It sounds like
a textbook example of someone

12
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,342
with bipolar disorder.

13
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,945
There's been a change
of plans.

14
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:27,725
I think I might
have to crash here.

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,489
The truth is
you'd be doing me a favor.

16
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,152
Hmm.

17
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:49,596
Somebody's been practicing.

18
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,668
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:52,700
Found a nice deaf instructor
on YouTube

20
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,121
who convinced me
to go premium.

21
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,464
You roll... y...

22
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,247
I just got the word "you."

23
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:04,949
Rolling... will you help me here?

24
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,293
I think you got this.

25
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:10,885
You do?

26
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:21,754
Was it roll?

27
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:27,598
Who... who door clock?

28
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:29,403
No, sorry.

29
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,895
Who are you door...

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,762
Who are you door punching?
That doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,770
Here.
Would you just...

32
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,309
type it?

33
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,087
- Please.
- Hmm.

34
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:53,743
Hmm.

35
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,457
Great.
Thank you.

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,559
- We're all here.
- What's the big news?

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,332
You dating another
married woman?

40
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,629
Ladies, ladies.

41
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:19,864
Let's give him some grace, huh?

42
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,598
Floyd, what's going on?

43
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,160
Right.

44
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,239
So as you all know,
I've been spending

45
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,994
- a lot of time with Dad.
- Floyd.

46
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,833
And I think that there
may be an explanation

47
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,114
for his behavior
through all these years.

48
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,051
I think he has
bipolar disorder.

49
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,882
Why on Earth
would you think that?

50
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,552
Well, he was acting
very strangely the other day,

51
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,614
and the chair of psychiatry
suggested to me that his...

52
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,216
Have you lost your mind
along with him?

53
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,545
Oh, come on, Mama,
can't you see it?

54
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,974
The erratic behavior,
his... his mania,

55
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,544
all those awful stories
you told us

56
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,941
about how he behaved
before he left...

57
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,737
It all makes sense now.

58
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,857
Floyd, lots of people
have issues,

59
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,295
but they find a way
to stick around.

60
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,472
Your father didn't leave us
because he was mentally ill.

61
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,040
He left us because he didn't
love us enough to try!

62
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:14,346
OK, OK.
All right.

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,036
Well, let's not repeat
his mistake, right?

64
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:20,396
Let's... let's find
enough love to reach out.

65
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,528
The only way
to cut through decades

66
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:25,401
of untreated mental illness
is just to show him

67
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,316
what he could have
if he tries...

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,319
- A family.
- Oh.

69
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:32,234
I don't wanna hear this.

70
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,044
Lost his mind.

71
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,443
I honestly didn't
think you could top

72
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,246
having a baby in a threesome.

73
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:45,986
Hmm.

74
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,730
<i>♪ Bury me alive
or just kill me ♪</i>

75
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,256
<i>♪ 'Cause honestly I'm tired
of just feeling ♪</i>

76
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,129

00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:12,883

00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,016
<i>♪ Because you're the reason

82
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,456
What are you...

83
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,980
Put that plate back.

84
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,286
It's dirty.

85
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,508
Yeah, this is
also my apartment.

86
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:35,949
How about some breakfast?

87
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,610
God, no.

88
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:46,308
Where are the... where are
the pills I had here?

89
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:48,481
Oh, I took those hours ago.

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,922
God, Mom screwed us up.

91
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:07,459
So, listen, there is work
being done on my apartment,

92
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,374
like some really involved
plumbing thing.

93
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,028
It's gonna be
at least a month,

94
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,117
and I was thinking
that maybe I could stay...

95
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,637
Hell no.

96
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,946
I'll pay rent.

97
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,171
All right, fine,

98
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,783
but you're paying up front.

99
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,088
Because who knows
when you're going

100
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,134
to disappear on me again?

101
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,057
Oh, big mistake.

102
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,537
Big, huge.

103
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,016
Are you quoting
"Pretty Woman"?

104
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,453
Yes, because those
dead-eyed bitches

105
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,237
snubbing Vivian
is the same level of dumb

106
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,021
as you moving in
with your sister.

107
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,414
You're sober, Lauren.

108
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:50,546
You can't handle
that kind of temptation.

109
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,982
What I can't handle
is guilt, OK?

110
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,897
She's a mess because
I left her there with my mom.

111
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,073
She's a mess
because she gobbles up drugs

112
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,070
like they're Skittles.

113
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:59,772
A sober person living with her
isn't gonna change that.

114
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,426
You haven't told her
you're sober?

115
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,427
- Not yet.
- When?

116
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,515
- Soon.
- Tonight.

117
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,169
I miss Casey.

118
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,866
I'll take this one.

119
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,303
Fire at a wedding venue
caused a stampede for the exit.

120
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,740
Groom was crushed
against the wall.

121
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,263
- Mostly likely broken ribs.
- OK, O2 stats are low.

122
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,917
Respirations are high.

123
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,266
Let's get him to Trauma 1
and prepare for intubation.

124
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,615
- Got another one.
- On it.

125
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,661
Cordelia Kaplan, 32,
minor abrasions

126
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,271
and severe smoke inhalation.

127
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,533
OK, vitals are stable.

128
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:22,708
Let's park her
at the nurse's station

129
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,123
and get her on 100% O2.

130
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,365
Hey, how many more
can we expect?

131
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,092
The whole damn wedding.

132
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,545
Hey, page everyone.

133
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:46,358
Hey, where do you want me?

134
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,966
Bay 27.
Ring bearer with facial lac.

135
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:51,287
Hey, nice suit.

136
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,785
- Collapsed lung?
- 70% on chest X-ray.

137
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,482
OK.
I will place the chest tube.

138
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,745
You take the esophageal rupture
up to the OR.

139
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,486
- On it.
- How can I help?

140
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,792
Is there a vax set?

141
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,576
Wilder's in Trauma 1.
Massive bleed.

142
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,448
Copy.
Excuse me.

143
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:11,061
Hey, where are we?

144
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,063
We got
a lacerated femoral artery.

145
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,673
Trying to close him up,
but I can't stop the bleed.

146
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,284
- He's the groom.
- How's the pressure?

147
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,881
106/58.

148
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,896
Thank you.

149
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:27,991
Severe cyanosis
on both hands.

150
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,732
Wait, wait, wait on the blood.

151
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,255
It's O negative.

152
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,645
Check his pockets.

153
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:40,974
His blood type
is Lutheran B negative.

154
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,374
His cells have an atypical
protein, making it very rare.

155
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,530
What does that mean?

156
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:47,140
It means that O negative is
not a universal blood for him,

157
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,751
and it could kill him.

158
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,231
Hey, do we have any
Lutheran B negative on hand?

159
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,276
No.

160
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,848
OK, Ellie, well, it's
looking pretty cleaned out,

161
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,371
so we'll get you
a couple stitches,

162
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,938
and we'll get you out of here.

163
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,767
- Your mom's gonna be OK.
- See?

164
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,594
Everything's gonna be OK,
just like I told you.

165
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,922
Lily?

166
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,756
You doing OK, Lily?

167
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,687
That's a beautiful bouquet.

168
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:21,203
Should we get them some water?

169
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:22,680
Honey?

170
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:25,015
Can you tell me
how you're feeling, Lily?

171
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,704
OK, you stay right here.

172
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:29,790
I'm gonna go
and get some water.

173
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,707
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

174
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,925
- Close her up.
- On it.

175
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:34,647
- Iggy?
- Yeah, yeah.

176
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:35,955
Put it up over your nose.
Deep breaths, okay?

177
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah?

178
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:38,705
OK, so the flower girl,
she's got no visible injuries,

179
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,672
but she's unresponsive
to verbal and physical cues.

180
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:42,718
OK, oh, yeah,
I'll check that out.

181
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,547
Deep breaths, OK?
Deep, slow.

182
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,598
You have to clear this area.
I'm so sorry.

183
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:54,599
Whoa!

184
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,038
This is why
I'm never getting married.

185
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:06,381
Ottawa usually has two
frozen units, but they're out.

186
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:07,842
OK, so what's
the next closest?

187
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,186
- Perth.
- Australia?

188
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,271
It's 26 hours away.

189
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:12,257
Our guy has maybe 12 hours
before complete organ failure.

190
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,389
I mean, this is why
rare blood banks exist.

191
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:17,358
- How can none of them have any?
- Seriously?

192
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:20,633
Covid, staffing limitations,
poor donor turnout.

193
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,502
Mexico City has nothing.

194
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,655
You're smiling.
You're smiling.

195
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,491
Does that mean somebody...

196
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:32,506
Toronto General has two units
of Lutheran B negative

197
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,671
ready to make the trip.

198
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,875
I'm gonna get
the helicopter ready.

199
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,155
I will go find the bride

200
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,406
and let her know
that her wedding day

201
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,061
is finally looking up.

202
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,199
It was just awful.

203
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,862
Not the venue,
which I had my doubts about,

204
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:46,870
but turned out
to be quite lovely

205
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,568
until all hell broke loose.

206
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,222
Well, the good news is
is most of these cuts

207
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,745
appear to be superficial.

208
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,486
Let's start hitting them
with antibiotic ointment,

209
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,270
and let's get as many
of them glued as possible.

210
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,759
- On it.
- What happened to your elbow?

211
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:59,405
Oh, my.

212
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:02,321
- I'm deformed!
- I'm sorry.

213
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,105
I'm sure this isn't what
you pictured when you RSVP'd.

214
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:06,194
Ow.
No, it wasn't.

215
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,915
Knowing the family, I expected
subpar food and a cash bar,

216
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,636
but not an explosion
during the I dos.

217
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,681
An explosion?
I thought it was a fire.

218
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,017
Kaboom.

219
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,292
Suddenly, the room was full
of smoke, the thick kind,

220
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:20,469
- like at Korean barbecue.
- Oh.

221
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,732
And you said
you're feeling back pain?

222
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,734
Oh, like when
you swallow wrong,

223
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,776
and it feels like
the food is stabbing your back

224
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:26,650
from the inside.

225
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,782
Dr. Turan,
help me get him on the side.

226
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:30,305
Nice and easy,
nice and easy, now.

227
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,480
You got it.

228
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,743
Were you
at the wedding alone?

229
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:35,650
Alone?
I've been married for 40 years.

230
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,356
I'm never anywhere alone.

231
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,595
My wife's a few beds over.
Glad she's OK.

232
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
The minute it happened,

233
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,360
everyone started
screaming, running.

234
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:44,143
My wife needed me,
and I couldn't find her.

235
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,320
Oh!

236
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:46,931
All right,
start an IV of Toradol.

237
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:48,802
All right, Stan, I'm gonna have
to cut off your tux.

238
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,238
But it's a rental.

239
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:52,893
Agh!
Oh.

240
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:54,416
That actually feels better.

241
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,095
Pass me some of those 4x4s.

242
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,506
I'm gonna get started
on this side.

243
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,812
Set aside a week.

244
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,248
Do you have
any idea what could have

245
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,978
- caused so many tiny cuts?
- I don't know.

246
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,689
Maybe when I ran through
the champagne glass tower.

247
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,734
- Face-first.
- Need to irrigate.

248
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:09,431
You sure
you didn't fall on your back?

249
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,877
Yes, because I remember
pushing myself up,

250
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,827
like a push-up,
to look for Tamara.

251
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,857
That's when the entire wedding
ran across my back.

252
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,461
Everything look OK?

253
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,087
Is there any chance
you might have been shot?

254
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,220
- Shot?
- Who would do that?

255
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:27,318
Who would erect
a 10-foot-tall crystal monster

256
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,929
in the middle of a party?

257
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,939
Even if there hadn't been
an explosion,

258
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:32,846
someone was going
through that thing.

259
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,195
All right.

260
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,846
Well, I think
you're good to go.

261
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,372
Oh, but what about my ankle?

262
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,331
Tamara, wow.

263
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:40,985
It's just the wedding
that keeps on giving.

264
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,856
- Uh-huh.
- OK, OK.

265
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,728
Ow, ow!

266
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:45,900
Is it broken?

267
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,686
Sprained is my guess,
but we should

268
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,712
probably get an X-ray
just to be safe.

269
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,992
Ow.

270
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,353
What?

271
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,129
Go ahead and dress the wound.

272
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,951
Oh, how's Tamara Leckie doing?

273
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,605
Well, I think
she's done with weddings,

274
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,613
but she's gonna be fine.
How's her husband?

275
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:02,223
Well, I was convinced
he had been shot,

276
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,331
but there's
three inches of something

277
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:04,526
jammed through his back.

278
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:05,690
What do you mean, something?

279
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:07,272
It's definitely not a bullet,
but whatever it is,

280
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,839
it's long and thin.

281
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,234
Yeah.

282
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,728
- Yeah.
- Okay.

283
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:15,933
Just give me
a few minutes.

284
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,401
Hi.

285
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,502
Hey, Lily.

286
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,287
So I thought
it might be helpful

287
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,940
to get you out
of all that chaos

288
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,290
for a few minutes, right?

289
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:26,536
A little peace and quiet.

290
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,252
Also, Lily, your mom is
right outside of that window,

291
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,469
so if you need her
for anything, you let me know.

292
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,665
I'll take you right to her.
Deal?

293
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,218
Bit of good news,

294
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,837
your physical exams
all came back,

295
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:45,708
and they show
no bodily harm whatsoever.

296
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,774
I don't know
what you saw at that wedding.

297
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,974
I bet it was really scary,
but I promise you,

298
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,031
you are safe now.

299
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,218
- Safe now.
- Yes.

300
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,009
Yes, safe.
I promise.

301
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,335
Lily, do you think I can
ask you some questions?

302
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:20,524
Lily, do you think I can
ask you some questions?

303
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:30,343
Lily, I need you to try
to stay with me please.

304
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,280
Please.

305
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:37,971
Please.

306
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:45,452
OK, I'll be right back.

307
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,765
I saw her speaking.
That's good, right?

308
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,226
So this is not...

309
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:56,312
just trauma.

310
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,281
Your daughter
is suffering from catatonia.

311
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:03,954
That's not... she just needs
to go home and rest.

312
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:07,435
No, she needs to be admitted
to the behavioral health ward.

313
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,848
Right now.

314
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:18,697
- No pulse.
- Go again.

315
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,654
He's back.

316
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,439
The blood just arrived
in New York.

317
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:26,933
- I need it here.
- I know.

318
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,848
They should be calling me
any second.

319
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,499
- How'd the bride react?
- I couldn't find her.

320
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,626
They must have
taken her to Baptist.

321
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,809
Hold on.

322
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:35,115
Yeah.

323
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,595
Let's get more Propofol.

324
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,728
No, no, no.

325
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,508
I don't really care
about protocol.

326
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:42,993
There's
an extenuating circumstance.

327
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,515
I have... can you...

328
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,953
If you'd listen...

329
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,005
The blood is stuck in customs.

330
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,310
Homeland Security
won't release it

331
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,554
for two to three days.

332
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,274
This man
will be dead before that.

333
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,877
Yeah, hi,
this is Dr. Max Goodwin,

334
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,211
medical director
of New Amsterdam.

335
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,625
Can you do me a favor
and connect me with the head

336
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,453
of Memorial's rare blood bank?

337
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,785
So you're OK letting
a precious lifesaving resource

338
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,554
rot in a warehouse
because of red tape?

339
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,281
Yes, yes, that's two units
of Lutheran B negative.

340
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,358
Memorial Hospital in Seattle
said you might have some.

341
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,926
Just say you are OK with
someone dying because of it.

342
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,797
- I will leave you alone.
- You're my fifth call.

343
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,886
- You are my ninth call.
- Lutheran B negative.

344
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,280
- You are my 11th call.
- You're my 14th...

345
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,324
- Call.
- No?

346
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,722
What?
I know.

347
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,073
I know it's a long shot,
but this guy

348
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,680
is getting married today,
and I was kind of hoping

349
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:46,030
for a miracle.

350
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,110
You're not gonna believe it.

351
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,234
You found
Lutheran B negative?

352
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,995
I found Rh-null.

353
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,259
- Are you serious?
- Sorry. What is Rh-null?

354
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:58,958
Rh-null is the only
universal blood for people

355
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,359
with rare blood types.

356
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,546
One in 3,000 people
who have Lutheran B negative,

357
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,530
but less than 50 people
have ever been known

358
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,532
to have Rh-null.
I mean ever.

359
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,838
- That's why they call it...
- Golden blood.

360
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,797
And there are
two fresh units of it

361
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,407
waiting for us
at a small hospital

362
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,540
in Hamilton, Bermuda.

363
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,749
- In Bermuda?
- 90 minutes away.

364
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,643
That won't help us.

365
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,696
Any blood that we import
is gonna get stuck in customs.

366
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,897
I know, and that's why we're
not gonna import the blood.

367
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,491
OK, so what
are we gonna do?

368
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,140
We're gonna
import the donor.

369
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,054
And we're gonna leave
in 45 minutes.

370
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,232
<i>♪ 'Cause when you see me</i>

371
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:41,043
So the medical director
of Hamilton United designated

372
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,871
two units of Rh-null blood
to be released to you

373
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,538
upon completing
this export request.

374
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,889
Actually, change of plans.
We don't need the blood.

375
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:49,312
We just need the...

376
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,007
The donor.

377
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:00,256
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid, unfortunately,

378
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,716
donor information
is confidential.

379
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,132
They may not even live here.

380
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,719
People donate
in other cities all the time.

381
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:06,249
Mm-hm,
but the two units of blood

382
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,492
set aside for me
weren't frozen,

383
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:10,115
which means they were donated
in the last 42 days,

384
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,351
and this bank
has had a steady supply

385
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:14,531
of Rh-null
since 2017, which tells me

386
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,730
that the donor does live here.

387
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,298
I just really need you
to tell me where that is.

388
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:19,562
Understood.

389
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,478
Again, I cannot give out
personal information.

390
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,609
You can.
You can, actually.

391
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,481
We have...

392
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:27,568
Sir, would you mind just...

393
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,309
Just taking a look
at the donor's file.

394
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:30,745
You don't have
to show it to us.

395
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,963
Just take a look at it.

396
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,100
OK.
I'm looking at it.

397
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:41,234
OK, now look
at all the donations

398
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:44,106
that he or she has given
in the last five years.

399
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,631
I mean, think about all
the lives that they have saved.

400
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,459
This is...
This is someone who really

401
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,241
wants to help other people.

402
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,467
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't just...

403
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:58,773
Listen...

404
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,079
All I can give you
is the forms.

405
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,123
Somebody's gonna die
unless you

406
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:02,298
give us this information.
No, what?

407
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,691
- No, it's fine.
- It's not fine.

408
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,738
No, we... we flew here for...
What are you...

409
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:07,826
We should go.
It's fine.

410
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,957
- It's fine.
- Thank you.

411
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,829
- Hey, thank you.
- Have a good day.

412
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,266
Uh, I'm sorry.
What... what was that?

413
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,355
I mean, what was that?
Will you help me out?

414
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,010
We came all this way, and you
push me out of the room?

415
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,099
I'm one minute away.
What?

416
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,835
There's no need.

417
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,059
He looked at the donor's file
long enough

418
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,085
for me to get this.

419
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,436
What is that?

420
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:33,547
That's the donor's address.

421
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,505
How?

422
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,328
Well, when you're deaf,

423
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:38,987
you pay a lot more attention
to reflections.

424
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:41,538
You know, like, glasses,
for example.

425
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:44,890
- Hm.
- Oh, you're good.

426
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,343
I know.

427
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,694
- She's good.
- I know.

428
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,696
- Let's go!
- Well, let's go.

429
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,089
- Yeah, we're going, OK.
- All right.

430
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:57,593
She's tenacious.

431
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:02,837
Oh, my Lord.

432
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:05,788
Yep, that definitely
is a high heel.

433
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:08,093
Yeah, and it is
really in there.

434
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,398
You were trying to rescue me,

435
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,488
like my knight
in shining armor,

436
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,015
and I trampled you.

437
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,757
- Honey, honey.
- Don't be nice to me.

438
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,367
I ran over you like roadkill.

439
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,725
You've been walking
all over me for 40 years.

440
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,369
Now we have a picture
to commemorate it.

441
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,624
The good news is that it
missed all your vital organs.

442
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:28,994
Which means that,
despite the last several hours,

443
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:30,735
you two are actually
pretty lucky.

444
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,914
- Whoa, whoa!
- Tamara!

445
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:38,177
- Need a little help here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

446
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,482
Do not move, OK?

447
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:40,658
If the heel moves
in the wrong way,

448
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,164
- you could die.
- But what's happening?

449
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,688
There's nothing
blocking her airways.

450
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:45,255
All right, all right.

451
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,171
OK, OK.
I got you.

452
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:49,043
I got... wait, what's...

453
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,767
What are these cuts?
What are all these cuts?

454
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,060
When everyone
rushed the door,

455
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:54,759
she crashed
into the champagne tower.

456
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,140
She inhaled the glass.

457
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,172
It's shredding
her intestines.

458
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,414
We need to get her
to an OR now.

459
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,416
Is she gonna be OK?
Is she gonna be OK?

460
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,722
Is she gonna be OK?

461
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:13,664
Hey.

462
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:16,563
The waiting is hell, I know.

463
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,176
Did the doctors explain
the meds she's on?

464
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,062
They tried.
I could barely focus.

465
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:26,660
Was it benzo
something, something?

466
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:30,055
Benzodiazepine, yeah.
It's basically a calming agent.

467
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,859
It's often very effective
at easing people

468
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,827
out of catatonic states, so...

469
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,594
Often, not always?

470
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,839
Yeah.

471
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,687
What if she
doesn't come back?

472
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:50,950
Hey, hey.

473
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:53,948
I promise you we're doing
everything we can.

474
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,777
- OK?
- She's got to wake up.

475
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:58,687
Please make her wake up.

476
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,826
I keep replaying it in my mind.

477
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:03,765
After that maniac
started the fire,

478
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,445
- she must have been so scared.
- I'm sorry.

479
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,789
I thought... someone started
the fire on purpose?

480
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:10,222
I thought it was an explosion.

481
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,257
Protect your children.

482
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,718
We all need
to protect our children.

483
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,889
What's happening?

484
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,476
- I need a team in here now!
- She's seizing!

485
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:26,861
- Crash cart!
- I'm right behind you.

486
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,781
Come on, guys,
make room, make room.

487
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,750
- All right, on it.
- Call zero stats.

488
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:33,570
- Paging OR 3.
- Start on Lorazepam drip.

489
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,798
- Give me an army-navy.
- But there's no time to work...

490
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,437
Heart rate's rising.

491
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,558
- She's bleeding.
- From where?

492
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:47,777
I cleared the stomach.
No glass.

493
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:51,496
BP's dropping.
Give me another unit a blood.

494
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,130
Must have passed
into her small intestine.

495
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:54,660
I'm gonna run the valve.

496
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,138
OK.

497
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,956
All right,
how are you doing, Stan?

498
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:14,175
I abandoned my wife.

499
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,825
Stan, even if you didn't
have a serious injury,

500
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,872
there's no way they would have
let you in the OR with her.

501
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:24,558
No, I abandoned her
at the wedding.

502
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:30,951
A tetanus jab, please.

503
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:32,922
When I heard
that explosion,

504
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:34,530
I just took off.

505
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,331
I didn't look for her.

506
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,201
I didn't even think about her.

507
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:42,691
I ran.

508
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,226
I left her behind.

509
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,967
Now she might die
because of it.

510
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:50,623
Hey, you can't
blame yourself for that.

511
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:51,972
Watch me.

512
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,957
Oh, you don't know
what it is to know

513
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,253
you failed someone you love...

514
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,175
to know they're hurt
because of you.

515
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,244
And you think
back to that moment,

516
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:06,335
wishing you could have
done something different,

517
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:10,489
but you couldn't
because you weren't in control.

518
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:13,613
Your body decided
that it had to survive.

519
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:18,428
And now your soul's stuck
picking up the pieces.

520
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,652
Right?

521
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,876
I'm telling you
you can't blame yourself.

522
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,811
No good comes of it.

523
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:32,161
All you can try to do is atone.

524
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,436
How do I do that?

525
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,981
By telling her the truth.

526
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:47,786
Come on, come on.
God.

527
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,683
I'm not feeling any resistance.

528
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,772
BP down 60 over palp.

529
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,905
It's got to be
in here somewhere.

530
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:57,386
Dr. Reynolds,
we're losing her.

531
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,739
The shard, It's cut
its way out of the bowel.

532
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,115
It's in her abdomen.

533
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,317
HR, 78 BPM.

534
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:08,255
Dr. Reynolds,
use the forceps.

535
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,670
I've got to be able
to feel the glass.

536
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:10,693
It could cut your glove.

537
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:12,287
Come on.
Where are you?

538
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:14,272
Up on the monitor.

539
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,856
Where are you?

540
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:26,676
One minute,
you're Mr. By-The-Book,

541
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,677
the next,
you're "Indiana Jones",

542
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:28,999
just going at it on your own.

543
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,897
Yeah, well,
I should have waited.

544
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,054
Maybe she's alive
because you didn't.

545
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,186
All right, let's repair
the bowel and close her up.

546
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:43,322
Whew.

547
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:56,388
- Yes, can I help you?
- I really hope so.

548
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,968
I'm Max Goodwin,
medical director

549
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,374
of New Amsterdam Hospital
in New York City.

550
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,841
This is Dr. Wilder,
the chair of hematology,

551
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:05,140
and we are here because we are
trying to save a man's life,

552
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,455
and we are running out of time.

553
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,733
Is there someone in this home
with Rh-null blood type?

554
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,590
How did you get this address?

555
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:12,975
Uh...

556
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:18,117
Well, um, we stole it

557
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,738
from the donor registry
at the blood bank.

558
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:24,951
Uh, wow.
OK, yeah, we did do that.

559
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,866
But does that person live here?

560
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,645
If you stole it,
you know they do.

561
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:31,724
- Can we speak to that person?
- No.

562
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,133
No, you can't.

563
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:35,723
Showing up to someone's house
to demand their blood is...

564
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:36,802
I don't even have
a word for it.

565
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:37,964
You're doctors.

566
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,942
Yes, we are,
which is why we're trying

567
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:41,826
to save our patient's life
the only way we know how,

568
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,795
and that is to bring the donor
back to New York with us

569
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,544
in one hour where they can
donate their blood in person.

570
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,684
Please leave.

571
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:49,961
Respectfully,
we can't do that.

572
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:51,351
We need to speak to the donor.

573
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:57,201
The donor
doesn't need to talk to you.

574
00:25:57,512 --> 00:26:00,567
All they do is give and give
to doctors, to scientists,

575
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:02,263
to anyone who begs them
for their blood,

576
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:04,497
even when there's
none left to give,

577
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:06,552
even when they turn yellow
from anemia,

578
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:07,927
even when they need
their family

579
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:09,764
to carry them to bed
because they're too weak

580
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:11,254
to make it up the stairs.

581
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,560
Today, their daughter
is giving birth,

582
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,220
and I'm not
gonna let them miss it.

583
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,960
For once, they're gonna get
to be just like everyone else.

584
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:23,209
But they are not
like everyone else.

585
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:24,685
They're special.

586
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,536
They can save lives
that nobody else can save.

587
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,230
What is a better legacy
to bestow on a child than that?

588
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,246
Don't come back here.

589
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:37,880
Ma'am, please, if we...

590
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,440
Hey, Lily.

591
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,653
My gosh, you gave us all
quite the scare earlier.

592
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:54,693
But you know, we got your meds
right in the sweet spot now.

593
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,566
Everything's looking good.
How are you feeling?

594
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,403
You... you hurt anywhere?
You OK?

595
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:05,310
You know, no one
is gonna make you talk.

596
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:06,879
I promise you that,

597
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:10,056
but if you want to,
I'm here, OK?

598
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,929
No rush,
no pressure whatsoever.

599
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,834
In fact, I'm low-key
kind of psyched,

600
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,154
because that means I get to do
with you what I never

601
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,891
get to do with my patients.

602
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,067
I get to talk.
Yes.

603
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,939
Lucky you.

604
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:25,825
Dr. Frome is in the building.

605
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,295
You know, your day today
in a lot of ways

606
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,279
reminded me of my own wedding,
believe it or not.

607
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:34,903
So I decided to bring along
these bad boys to show you.

608
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,824
Look at this.
See?

609
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,841
Two grooms, me and my husband.

610
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:44,740
I know, he's very handsome,
isn't he?

611
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:48,834
We had an officiant
who was an ordained priest

612
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,794
but also a stand-up comedian,
so that was a lot.

613
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,317
And... oh, my niece.

614
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,363
My niece was the flower girl.

615
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:58,523
And what's fun about her is
that during my father-in-law's

616
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:01,656
lovely toast, she decided
to tackle the ring bearer,

617
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,415
grab the ring,
and try to eat it.

618
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,635
She's four.
It's not her fault.

619
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,015
But I would say that,
all in all,

620
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,640
if I had to choose one word
to describe that day,

621
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:15,687
it would be beautiful.

622
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,338
It was a beautiful day.

623
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:21,898
What about you?

624
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:24,444
If you had
to describe the wedding

625
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,742
that you were at today
in one word,

626
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,334
what would that word be?

627
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:34,706
Well, I wasn't there,
but I would go

628
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,053
with something like scary?

629
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,495
You know, your mom told me
the fire was not an accident,

630
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:43,976
and I don't think there's
anything scarier

631
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,223
than seeing somebody
do something bad.

632
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,614
You know these scared feelings
you have?

633
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,134
They're tricky because
they don't... they don't go away

634
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,876
unless you talk about them.

635
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,508
And it's totally OK
if you don't

636
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:55,596
have the words to tell me.

637
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,163
You know,
that's why I brought this.

638
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,513
I find that it's helpful
if you make the story

639
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:02,386
about them and not about you.

640
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,129
All right, so why don't we...
Why don't we start easy, OK?

641
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,608
Why don't you show me

642
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:12,032
where the bride
and the groom were?

643
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,267
Can you do that?

644
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:28,977
Nice.
OK.

645
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,330
Good.

646
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:34,548
Good, very good.

647
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:35,680
All right.

648
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,029
Let's keep this party
rolling here.

649
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:40,094
What about the flower girl
and the ring bearer?

650
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,861
Where were they?
Can you do the same thing?

651
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:44,476
Show me where they were.

652
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,163
Thank you.

653
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,654
Yes, good.

654
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,294
So good, so good.

655
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,188
Where was the person
who started the fire?

656
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:01,880
Where were they?

657
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,677
Do you know them?

658
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,169
Oh, a mask?

659
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:31,388
They were wearing a mask?

660
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:32,998
OK.
All right.

661
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,609
So a...
A man wearing a full mask

662
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:38,348
standing next to the bride
started the fire on purpose.

663
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,790
That's good.

664
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,531
Lily, that's really good.

665
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,098
Thank you.

666
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:47,404
You know,
I know today was scary,

667
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:49,667
but you are by far
the bravest flower girl

668
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,795
I have ever met.

669
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,884
Yeah, I know what I know.

670
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,122
Yeah.

671
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:18,957
Is he OK?

672
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:23,478
Who?

673
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,834
My husband.

674
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,370
Welcom to L.A.

675
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,345
It's the hospital.

676
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:38,611
I'll let them know.
Hey.

677
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,204
Wait, wait.

678
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,915
What about CPS?

679
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,822
No, no, no, just... just
lock down the whole hospital

680
00:31:56,907 --> 00:32:00,566
until the police get there, OK?
Yeah.

681
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,241
What's wrong?

682
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:10,554
Tell me.

683
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:15,579
The groom, the man
that we've been flying

684
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:16,755
between countries to save,

685
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,410
he was about to marry
a little girl.

686
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,235
It was a child wedding.

687
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,955
Dr. Goodwin?

688
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:38,821
Did the donor
change their mind?

689
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,870
Yes, I did.

690
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:44,283
I wouldn't be able
to look at my granddaughter

691
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:47,370
knowing that someone died
because I didn't help them.

692
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,163
I don't... I don't get it.

693
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,894
I mean, we've all treated
bad people before.

694
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:20,184
This time
just feels different.

695
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,139
Different is
an understatement.

696
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,368
I feel like
I need 10 showers.

697
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,064
I mean,
I've treated murderers

698
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,589
and straight-up killers.

699
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:37,548
I shouldn't feel like this.

700
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,589
So why do we?

701
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,872
Because it was all of them.

702
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:53,779
It wasn't just
the mother or the groom.

703
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:57,285
It was every one of those
patients supported this.

704
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,856
So...

705
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:09,598
It turns out it wasn't a fire.
It was a smoke bomb.

706
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:14,481
Lily's older brother,
who was only 15 himself,

707
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,082
he wasn't trying
to hurt anybody.

708
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,520
He was just... he was trying
to save his sister.

709
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,279
Yeah, well, at least
there's one sane person

710
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,934
in that poor girl's family.

711
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,083
The police should lock up
every last one of those people

712
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,603
and lose the key.

713
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:30,114
Yeah.

714
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,561
Nobody's getting arrested.

715
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:35,465
What?

716
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:37,832
Because there's
no federal law

717
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,966
against child marriage
in this country.

718
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,379
That's why.

719
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:45,145
Because it only became illegal
in New York last year,

720
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,131
so Lily's mother
drove up to West Virginia

721
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:51,379
and got herself
a 100% legal marriage license.

722
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:55,458
In some of these states,
they could have married her off

723
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,109
when she was five.

724
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:03,184
Right, so nobody is
gonna get punished for this.

725
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,484

May I come in?

762
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:43,588
I don't remember us
making any plans.

763
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,719
Uh, Dad.

764
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:58,111
I got to say something
that's gonna be hard to hear.

765
00:38:03,486 --> 00:38:05,444
I think you may be bipolar.

766
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:07,614
Bipolar?

767
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,530
Yes, and I think
that you've been living

768
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,755
with it for most of your life.

769
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:18,974
So all the times
you made choices that, uh,

770
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:21,610
caused you to...

771
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:25,227
lose things, I...

772
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:26,882
I think this is...

773
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,465
I think this is why.

774
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:37,266
So this bipolar,

775
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:39,243
this is
a real medical condition?

776
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:41,543
Yes.

777
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,118
So all the stuff
I did to you, your mama,

778
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,071
to your sisters...

779
00:38:47,156 --> 00:38:49,071
It's not your fault.

780
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,628
It's not my fault?

781
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,452
No, Dad.

782
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:59,613
Everybody been making me out
to be the bad guy,

783
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,610
but I'm just a sick man?

784
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,268
That's right.

785
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:07,182
So I'm gonna need you
to come in to New Amsterdam

786
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,072
- tomorrow, OK?
- For what?

787
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:12,028
Oh, for testing,
and so we can come up

788
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,640
with a plan for treatment.

789
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,518
I don't want
to do any of that,

790
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,158
but I do think your mama
owes me an apology.

791
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:20,916
- Your sisters too.
- What?

792
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,476
I'm not
all those names

793
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,620
they've been calling me
for years.

794
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,708
None of it is my fault.
I couldn't control none of it.

795
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,736
I'm sick!
I got a condition.
