1
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,832
- Previously on
"New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,356
- Our marriage is over.

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,247
I finally know the direction
that I want to be headed in.

4
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,881
Will you go on a date with me?

5
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,013
- Why are you acting like

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,927
everything is over
and done with?

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,669
- I don't know, just 'cause
you're leaving in six days.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,856
- ♪ Rescue me or take
me in your arms ♪

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,512
♪ Rescue me, I want
your tender charm ♪

♪ 'Cause I'm lonely

11
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,080
- I thought I heard a crash.

12
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,473
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

13
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:42,477
We were just reading up
on the, uh, compliance...

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,478
- Meeting.
- Meeting.

15
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,045

00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,185
I knew it. Casey.

21
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,665
- What?
- You owe me 20 bucks!

22
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,059
- Yeah.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,714
- Ooh.

24
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,498
I gotta quit using these stairs.

25
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:12,985
- Get a room.

26
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:15,118
- ♪ Come on and rescue me

27

This is so...

29
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,435
I don't know what word to use.

30
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:30,699
- Fun. I haven't had fun

31
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,701
in a long time.

32
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,181
Come here.

Hi, there.

37
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,753
Doctor.

38
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:46,018
- ♪ Can't you see
that I'm lonely? ♪

39
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,764
Mm!

40
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,377
- I gotta say,

41
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,249
we made damn good use of
my last week in New York.

42
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,904
- Mm. You sure I can't
convince you to stay?

43
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,254
- Mm, not when
they're handing out

44
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,648
$20,000 bonuses like candy.

45
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,041
- Well, I can get you free
coffee at Pain De Vie.

46
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,434
Mm.

47
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,001
You know I got the plug.

48
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,611
- Ohh. Do you?

49
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,396
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,138
Oh. You might get a call today

51
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,314
about a gig in Tanzania.

52
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,926
I, uh... I listed
you as my reference.

53
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,669
- Hm.

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,800
Tanzania.

55
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,454
- I know.

56
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,891
You think you could
sing my praises,

57
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,329
convince 'em I'm a real catch?

58
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,203
Floyd?

59
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,987
- Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, no problem.

60
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,165
I'll tell 'em exactly
what they need to hear.

61
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,601
- Thank you.

62
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,472
- Yeah.

63
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,866
- Hi, is this, uh,
Martin McIntyre?

64
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,172
Am I saying that right?

65
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,261
- Uh, yeah, you
know who this is.

66
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,697
- Yeah, hi. This
is Iggy Frome.

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,873
I am your date for this evening.

68
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,222
- Oh, my God.

69
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,964
I need a night out tonight
after this morning.

70
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:05,359
Sameera and Raffi were
at each other again.

71
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,535
- Sameera and Raffi,
what, are those your cats?

72
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,860
'Cause, you know, you
definitely do not want

73
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,684
to be talking about your
kids on a first date.

74
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,366
That's a... That's
a major turnoff,

75
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,541
big no-no.
- Okay, okay,

76
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,325
so you're, uh, really
going full steam

77
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,197
on this fresh start thing, huh?

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,633
- I'm sorry, have we met?

79
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:19,914
I think I'd remember
meeting you.

80
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:20,983
You sound cute.

81
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,289
- Okay, stranger, look,

82
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,681
I'm late for my first session.

83
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,075
So can we agree upon where
we're meeting tonight?

84
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,512
Uh, Darnellé or that Persian
place... what do you think?

85
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,011
- Hmm, yeah, I don't
know those places.

86
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,473
Those sound like, uh,
old standbys for you,

87
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,562
but, uh, yeah, I'm
drawing a blank.

88
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,128
Iggy.

89
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:39,219
- Hey, tonight, everything
is for the first time.

90
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,457
Since I'm the one
who asked you out,

91
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,395
I'll let you off the hook.

92
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,613
I will pick the place,

93
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,832
I will send you the address,

94
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,051
and I will see you
there at 7:00, okay?

95
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,444
- Oh, okay.

96
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,707
- Oh, and Martin?
- Mm-hmm?

97
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,970
- I'm really looking
forward to meeting you.

98
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,757
- Okay. See you.

99
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,373
Ugh.

100
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,984
I hate clocking out when
the sun's coming up.

101
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,291
- Oh, come on. You love
pancakes for dinner.

102
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,075
- Ugh. How do you
have so much energy?

103
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,034
- Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I've shed

104
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:15,429
decades of emotional
trauma... My mom, my sister.

105
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,058
But I am finally out
from underneath it all,

106
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:19,433
so it is time I made some
big changes in my life.

107
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,695
So...
- Quitting medicine?

108
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,479
- I sold my apartment.
- Oh.

109
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,065
But you're definitely
not moving in with me.

110
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,656
Nah.
- Relax, relax.

111
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,634
No, I actually found the
perfect place in Battery Park.

112
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,051
It ticks all my boxes.

113
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,681
There's actually an
open house at 9:00 a.m.,

114
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,545
but my realtor says they
can sneak me in early.

115
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,380
Wanna come, be my fresh eyes?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

116
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,599
Battery Park's all
the way downtown.

117
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,451
We're not gonna
make it before 9:00.

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,671
- How fast can you get
us to Battery Park?

119
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,673
- Downtown?
- In rush hour?

120
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,545
- Well, there's a
two bedroom, two bath

121
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,349
with a view of the Hudson
that's got my name on it

122
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,896
if I can get there
before 9:00 a.m.

123
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,984
- Doorman?
- Check.

124
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,507
- Private rooftop?
- Uh, with a pool

125
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,900
and a vegetable garden.

126
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,337
- Hop in.

127
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,773
We might even use the sirens.

128
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,428
Oh, ye
of little faith.

129
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:05,716
- Please put your
hands behind your back.

130
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,089
- What do you
mean, under arrest?

131
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,458
I peed on the street.
What's so wrong with that?

132
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,633
- Hi, good morning, officers.
- I had to pee.

133
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:10,764
Where I was supposed
to pee? Dogs do that.

134
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,312
The dogs pee on the trees.
- Hey, hi.

135
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,376
Good morning, officers, hi.
- Why can't I pee on a tree?

136
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,357
- Hey, how you
doing? Hi, Carla.

137
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,663
You seem upset. Are you okay?

138
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,926
- Yeah, will you please
tell Starsky and Hutch

139
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,623
to stop harassing regular people

140
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,885
who have done nothing wrong?

141
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,558
- Ma'am, public urination
is against the law.

142
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:23,932
- Ooh, "public urination."
- Ah.

143
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,326
- It wasn't public until
you two started looking.

144
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,457
You pervo.

145
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,893
- Hey, office... officers, hi.

146
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,697
I'm... I'm Dr. Frome. I
work at New Amsterdam.

147
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,157
Can I just take
her off your hands?

148
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,029
What a guy!

149
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,987
It's... it's like I'm,
what, an old couch

150
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,424
from, uh, Craigslist?

151
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,773
- Ri... right, yeah.

152
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,383
- Is she your patient?
- Um, no.

153
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,777
No, not exactly. Carla
is a frequent flier.

154
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,232
She's been through
the hospital a bunch

155
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,867
with these kinds of issues.

156
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,042
So I know her.

157
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,696
- Don't think your
treatment's working.

158
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,655
- She is an alcoholic with
serious mental illness.

159
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,154
Uh, she can't even
control her bladder

160
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,417
with what she's put
her body through.

161
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,832
So taking her to jail,

162
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,748
that's not gonna do
anybody any good, right?

163
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,751
Create more paperwork
for you guys, so...

164
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,320
- We can't just turn her loose.
- Sure.

165
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,558
- If you're taking
responsibility,

166
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,715
you'll have to admit
her to the hospital.

167
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,239
- Yeah, I'll do you one better.

168
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,328
I'll take her to court.

169
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,380
- Lilo.

170
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,339
Did we have an appointment?

171
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,775
- I know you're busy,

172
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,561
but, uh, it's about
my transplant.

173
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,214
Right.

174
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,652
Lilo, look, I haven't
heard anything from UNOS.

175
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:33,828
And I promise I'll call you

176
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,743
the minute a lung
becomes available.

177
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,614
And I know waiting
can be frustrating...

178
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,225
- Oh, it's not that. I... I
just need some medication.

179
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,709
The nurse said I had to see you
before I can get 'em refilled.

180
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,665
- What medications?

181
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,629
Azathioprine,
cyclosporine, prednisone.

182
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,588
Lilo, these are all
immunosuppression drugs

183
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:57,242
for someone who is
already post-transplant.

184
00:06:57,286 --> 00:07:00,115
- I am post-transplant.

185
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,073
- What?
- I...

186
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,945
I got a new lung.

187
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,516
- How?

188
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,389
- I bought it.

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,092
- Yeah, great natural light.

190
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,703
- Yeah, nothing
says "fresh start"

191
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,313
like floor-to-ceiling windows.

192
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,880
- Is that a private elevator?

193
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,751
- Uh-huh.
- You really need all that?

194
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,579
- Yeah, of course I need it.

195
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,059
It's turnkey.

196
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,582
You've seen my place.
I'm helpless on my own.

197
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:34,715
I can just move right in

198
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,151
and not have to do a damn thing.

199
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,240
- Paramedics needed,
Midtown West.

200
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,504
Chainsaw attack.
Injuries on scene.

201
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:42,766
- Unit 223 responding.

202
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,332
Oh, great.

203
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,074
Now I'm gonna have
to pay all cash.

204
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,032
- Did they just say
"chainsaw attack"?

205
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,257
Speech time.

206
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,868
Um, thank you all for coming.

207
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,000
Um...

208
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,352
I don't know what to say.

209
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:07,487
Five years ago, I was dying.

210
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,489
My cancer treatment
wasn't working.

211
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,621
I couldn't swallow
my own saliva.

212
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,102
I couldn't stand
without support.

213
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,625
I didn't know if
I was gonna live

214
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,498
to see my own daughter be born.

215
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,545
But then this place,

216
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,070
New Amsterdam, saved me.

217
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:30,945
And so it is a great honor
and perhaps a fitting legacy

218
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,817
to announce today
that our partnership

219
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,994
with Ithaca Pharmaceuticals
has won the battle

220
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,866
against bulky
large-cell lymphoma.

221
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,610
And we did not just
find a treatment.

222
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,263
We found a cure.

223
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,095
- To curing cancer.

224
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,577
Aw, you did it, Max.

225
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:58,668
- Hey.

226
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,550
- The clinical trial
that you just toasted?

227
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,290
It's a sham, Max.

228
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,611
- This is it.
- Uh, bring the EPK

229
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:29,873
in case we need to tourniquet.

230
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,745
- On it.
- Whoa, hang on.

231
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,137
Chainsaw attack.

232
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,444
I'm going in first.

233
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,018
- It sounded worse on the radio.

234
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,368
- So dangerous.

235
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,458
I am sorry.

236
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,156
- Go get me a suture kit.

237
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,331
Hi.

238
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,856
Hi. Ooh, ow.

239
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,032
Uh, yeah, okay.

240
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,296
- One of the kids bite you?

241
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,428
- Shouldn't have
tried to juggle four.

242
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,841
- Whatever happened
to bowling pins?

243
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,867
- One must rise to
the increasing demands

244
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,911
of an ever hungry public.

245
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,043
- Hm. They're ten.

246
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,871
They'd be entertained
if you farted.

247
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,830
- Let's get him loaded up
and back to New Amsterdam.

248
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,397
- Does he really
need to go to the ED

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,138
for a simple laceration?

250
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,574
I mean, it's gonna take hours.

251
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,489
I could just stitch
him up right here.

252
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,709
- That must be an
amazing apartment.

253
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:25,015
- Laundry in unit.
- Um, excuse me.

254
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,190
Hello?

255
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,496
- Sorry, man.
- Oh, no, no, no.

256
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,952
If... if you could
patch me up right here,

257
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,891
that'd be outstanding.

258
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,197
I got a bar mitzvah on the
East Side in about an hour.

259
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,895
- See?

260
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,742
Even the juggler doesn't
want to go to the hospital.

261
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,638
Tell Carmona to keep
the engine running.

262
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:41,379
Thank you.

263
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,033
All right, let's
get you stitched up.

264
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:50,040
- You're all right.
- Ah, I... I hate these places.

265
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,869
Feels like I should've worn
a pantsuit or something.

266
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,368
- Yeah, I mean, I get
that you don't have

267
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,525
any positive associations
with courtrooms, believe me.

268
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,092
But, uh, this is a
little different.

269
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,485
This is CARE court.

270
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,878
Check it out.

271
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,622
Yeah.

272
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,189
Well, I thought that, uh,

273
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,060
"People's Court" was pushing it.

274
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,777
- All right, well, you
know, the... the basic idea

275
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,368
is that this is
designed to keep you out

276
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,936
of the criminal justice
system, not put you back in it.

277
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,025
So people with long-standing
compounded issues

278
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:20,767
like mental illness, addiction,
chronic homelessness,

279
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,483
they get the care and the
treatment that they need.

280
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,075
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,555
Hi. Good morning, guys.

282
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,533
Uh, this is Carla.
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.

283
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,013
I don't know, Doc. You
know, maybe I'll just

284
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,081
be sneakier when I pee.

285
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,343
- Carla, hey, hey, I... I...

286
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,494
I know that you
hate accepting help.

287
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,998
I know that. I know.

288
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,435
And I can only imagine how
shaming and insulting it is

289
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,804
for an obviously
intelligent human being

290
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,743
to have all these
people insinuating

291
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,485
that you can't
manage your own life.

292
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:46,314
But what you're
doing is not working.

293
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,663
It's not.

294
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:52,146
I mean, don't you want a
shot at something more?

295
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,631
- This is Dr. Reynolds.

296
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,590
- Dr. Reynolds, this
is Dr. Selemani.

297
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,983
- Dr. Selemani, yes.

298
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,682
Uh, Nurse Gabrielle
Morris is on my staff.

299
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,033
Um, actually, can
I call you back?

300
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,687
This isn't a great time.

301
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,820
Yeah.

302
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,647
Yes, uh, seven hour
time difference.

303
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,649
I'll call you
back ASAP. Thanks.

304
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,610
- Here are your
labs, Dr. Reynolds.

305
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,612
- Thank you, Nurse Gabrielle.

306
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,619
- What is it?

307
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,490
- Lilo's new lung,

308
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,970
his body's rejecting it.

309
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:34,971
- I don't get it.

310
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,035
They said everything went great.

311
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,017
- Who said?

312
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,235
- The doctors.

313
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,368
- Okay, Lilo, listen to me.

314
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,432
I'm gonna need the
medical records

315
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,631
from your transplant, okay?

316
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,198
I'm gonna need the
donor's blood type,

317
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,677
HLA match, the age,

318
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,549
medical history.

319
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,638
I mean, hell, do you even
know who this person was?

320
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,466
- No, I have no idea.

321
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,815
And I don't care.

322
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,644
I was on your donor
list for two years.

323
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:58,690
Two years of waiting and
struggling to breathe,

324
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,649
two years of you telling
me to be patient.

325
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,216
- Well, that's how it works.

326
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,348
- I wasn't gonna sit
around twiddling my thumbs

327
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,436
until I died.

328
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,047
So I researched online.

329
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,439
I drained my 401.

330
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,701
I went to Honduras.

331
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,357
- Honduras?

332
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,446
- Well, don't look
at me like that.

333
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,058
It was a real
hospital, real doctors.

334
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,451
They found me a lung right away.

335
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,062
No waiting, just results.

336
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:25,456
So I'm sorry if I don't exactly
know where it came from.

337
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,763
But I was busy
trying not to die.

338
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:32,899
- Um, so your body's
rejecting that lung,

339
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,266
and the only way we're
gonna keep you alive

340
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,076
is if we take it out...

341
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,512
today.

342
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,518
- Let's go, let's go!

343
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,085
Come on, people.
Money never sleeps.

344
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,260
- You're a monster.

345
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:47,783
- Lincoln Center
to Battery Park?

346
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,108
If we hurry, we
can still make it.

347
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,526
- Lower East Side,
two car collision.

348
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,181
People trapped in vehicles,
possible fatalities.

349
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,183
All available units,
please respond.

350
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,014
- There are two
other rigs nearby.

351
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,035
If you want, we can say we're
still working things here.

352
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,106
- No, lights and
sirens. Let's roll!

353
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,498
- Unit 223 en route.

354
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,897
- It is right there
in the data breakdown.

355
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,639
- Yeah, which clearly shows
the efficacy is well above

356
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,336
the combined SEER
stage survival rate

357
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,382
for B-cell lymphoma.

358
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,470
- Yes, you were correct.

359
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,080
The success rate is 89%.

360
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,734
Astonishing.

361
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,999
- So?

362
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,523
- Look at the study's
participant breakdown.

363
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,090
- Okay.

364
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,008
Uh, ages 25 to 65,

365
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,882
89%...Caucasian.

366
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,842
- That is a non-diverse
participant pool.

367
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,061
Those numbers do not reflect

368
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,889
New Amsterdam's
patient population.

369
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,954
It definitely does not reflect
the general population.

370
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,023
If we do not test this
on a wider demographic,

371
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,766
how can we prove that it
is safe and effective?

372
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,856
The last thing that we want
is another tha... tha...

373
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,858
Sorry, sorry, what?

374
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,816
- Thalidomide...
- Thalidomide.

375
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,620
It's a drug from the
'60s that they would give

376
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,168
to pregnant women for nausea...
- Mm.

377
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,344
- And they didn't test
it on pregnant women.

378
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:13,129
So they didn't know that it
would cause birth defects.

379
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,481
- If we do not test
Lymphodril properly,

380
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,484
this miracle cure could wind
up being a death sentence

381
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:25,011
for anyone who is not white
between the ages of 35 and 65.

382
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,969
- How could I have missed this?

383
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,800
- It was a blind trial.
We all missed it.

384
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:35,021
- Yeah, but this is everything
that I've fought against.

385
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,979
This is Big Pharma at its worst,

386
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,242
and I just signed off on it.

387
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,815
- So what do we do?

388
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,995
- The only thing we can do.

389
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,388
We can't release this trial data

390
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,085
for FDA approval.

391
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,829
- But...
- That means...

392
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,963
- Yeah. We're gonna kill
the cure for cancer.

393
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,926
- What was he
thinking? It's insane.

394
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,014
- He didn't know.

395
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,407
- He didn't want to know.

396
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,539
Buying an organ is
illegal for a reason.

397
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,193
Now I have a patient
who's gonna suffer

398
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,891
lifelong consequences because
of a stupid decision he made...

399
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,415
Assuming he survives.

400
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,088
- And you can bet the donor
didn't hand over the lung

401
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,026
out of the goodness
of their heart.

402
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,245
I've worked in countries

403
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,116
where people are killed
for their organs.

404
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,398
- You wanna know the worst part?

405
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,032
Now I have to take a
perfectly good lung

406
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,425
and throw it in the incinerator

407
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,316
when there are people who
could benefit from it.

408
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,776
But because of how
it was procured,

409
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:35,820
nobody gets it.

410
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,040
- Unless...

411
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,564
- Unless what?

412
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,306
- What if there's a way
it doesn't go to waste?

413
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,399
- Good morning, Your Honor.

414
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:53,012
I first met Carla, uh,
after a nice long bender.

415
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,145
She suffered acute
alcohol poisoning.

416
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,712
She was admitted
to New Amsterdam.

417
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,367
She came to behavioral
health for a consult.

418
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,500
And I diagnosed her with
post-traumatic stress disorder,

419
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,851
offered her help by way
of therapy and medication.

420
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,592
And Carla said no.

421
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,941
Didn't you?

422
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:12,596
Over the next decade,
Carla and I have replayed

423
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,904
that first visit many,
many, many times,

424
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:19,342
always with the same
result, haven't we?

425
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,821
Yeah. Now, I would

426
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,171
try that hard for anyone.

427
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,738
I would.

428
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,306
But, uh, Carla is...

429
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:28,395
Um, she's kind

430
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:32,268
and warm and very funny.

431
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:34,792
And she's got a lot to give.

432
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,360
We need her to stick around
so she can keep on giving it.

433
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,449
I beseech the court
to enter Carla

434
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:43,105
into the full CARE program
with mental health care,

435
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,889
uh, rehab services, and housing,

436
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,543
the full meal deal.

437
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,026
- Thank you, Dr. Frome.
- My pleasure.

438
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,463
- Carla.
- Hm?

439
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,204
- Do you have anything to add?

440
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:58,425
- Um...

441
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:02,646
yeah, I just... One
question out of curiosity.

442
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,866
Who is that guy?

443
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,390
- Uh, I'm your
court-appointed advocate.

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,090
- Well, he's... he's advocating.

445
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,875
He just... he made a big
speech and everything.

446
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,791
So what are you advocating
for that he isn't?

447
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,140
- Your rights,

448
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,509
because if you enter
the care program,

449
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,274
you'll be giving all of 'em up.

450
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,668
Tell
me that isn't true.

451
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,062
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

452
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:32,328
- Is that true?

453
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:38,943
- Come on!

454
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,555
Help. Help!

455
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,991
They're still inside.

456
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,949
- I need a trauma bundle
and cervical collar!

457
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,603
You take the passenger.
- Already on it.

458
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,171
- Are you with me, sir?

459
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,130
Airbags didn't deploy.

460
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,349
Collar.
- My son's hurt.

461
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,263
Help my son.
- I'm o... I'm o...

462
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,222
I'm okay, Dad.

463
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,832
- We're gonna help everyone.

464
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:03,272
- It's a chest laceration,
possible pneumothorax.

465
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,491
He's lost a ton of blood.

466
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:05,883
- His pulse is weak and thready.

467
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,670
- He's going in
and out of shock.

468
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,324
Can you smell that?
- Yeah.

469
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,084
The engine's gonna blow.
We... we gotta move.

470
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,153
- Passenger's coming out.

471
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,719
Move, move!

472
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,592
You're gonna be okay.

473
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,289
- Ah.
- Oh, it's jammed.

474
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,161
The seatbelt's jammed.
- Here.

475
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,336
- Okay. Get the gurney.

476
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,685
Go, go.

477
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,167
What's your name, sir?

478
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,777
Paul. Paul.

479
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,910
- And what do you have
planned today, Paul?

480
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,129
- Soccer.

481
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,827
- Well, you might
be a little late,

482
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,917
but we're gonna get
you there, okay?

483
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,223
Okay. All right.

484
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,443
Casey, we gotta go!

485
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,402
Come on. You get
the shoulders.

486
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,752
- Okay. All right.

487
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,252
- Carmona, Whitaker,
you're with us, okay?

488
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,668
The kid's in the second bus.

489
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,758
- On my count.
One, two, three.

490
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,414
- All right.

491
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,242
- All right. Come on.

492
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,809
- You got him?

493
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,768
Okay.

494
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,030
We gotta go.

495
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,946
- Hey, he's not gonna make it.

496
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,471
You know that, right?
- Let's go!

497
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,434
- Max, this is Ithaca
VP, Eric Hillbach.

498
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:19,958
- Tell me what I'm
hearing isn't true.

499
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,848
- I wish I could, all right?
We don't like this either.

500
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,720
- You're actively withholding
your own trial data

501
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,442
for a drug that has been proven
to literally cure cancer.

502
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,792
- Karen...
- Don't "Karen" me.

503
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,491
This was a huge breakthrough
that could change the world.

504
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,623
And now what? You're
having second thoughts?

505
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,625
- Without that data, we
don't get FDA approval,

506
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,148
and this drug will
die on the vine.

507
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,237
- Yeah, and it should,

508
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
because your trial
was inequitable,

509
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,675
and you know it.
- Nearly all of participants

510
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:44,417
were white from the
perfect socioeconomic class

511
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,221
to afford this drug,
should it come to market.

512
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,550
- And they all had cancer.

513
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,267
- They did, but if this
is the only demographic

514
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,008
that we're testing, then
how are we gonna know

515
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,469
that this drug is safe and
effective for everyone?

516
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,166
- Dr. Goodwin,
Lymphodril targets

517
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,039
the specific genetic
defect in the cancer.

518
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,475
So trial demos don't matter.

519
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,998
Only people's genes matter.

520
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,827
- I think that what mattered
was getting fast results

521
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,089
and saving money.

522
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,589
- Right, that's why
you did a blind trial

523
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,528
with limited parameters
so you didn't have

524
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:09,971
to go out and do
community outreach,

525
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,922
and you didn't have to
earn people's trust.

526
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,054
- Max.

527
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,577
This drug is a huge deal,

528
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,232
and while it may not have
been tested on all of mankind,

529
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,582
there is irrefutable
proof that it saves lives.

530
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:20,844
- Some lives.

531
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,169
- If we don't bring
this drug to market now,

532
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,152
there are patients
who will actually die.

533
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:25,695
You want to own that?
- No, I just want to own

534
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,069
a trial that doesn't
say "whites only."

535
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:30,854
- This is madness.

536
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,553
These were your
parameters, not ours.

537
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,032
- Uh, what do...
What do you mean?

538
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:38,079
- The participant field,
the expedited timetable,

539
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,298
every parameter was set

540
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,995
by the New Amsterdam
oncology department.

541
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,320
- What are you saying,
that somebody here

542
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,824
made these decisions?

543
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,913
- From our department? Who?

544
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,353
- Who is it, Max?

545
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,615
- Helen Sharpe.

546
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,897
- Can't you go any faster?

547
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,159
- Welcome to my world.

548
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,354
Street's clogged.

549
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,442
- Yeah, well, we're bigger.

550
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,338
Just push the other
cars out the way!

551
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,208
- VFIB.

552
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,300
- Okay. Clear.

553
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,388
Shocking.

554
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,696
- Still no pulse.

555
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,045
- Going again.

556
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,047
Clear. Shocking.

557
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,222
- I got nothing.

558
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,485
- Damn it. Going again.

559
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,095
Clear. Shocking.

560
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,011
- Nah, still nothing.

561
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:42,249
We're gonna have to
start chest compressions.

562
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:44,101
Lauren...
- I don't have a bone saw,

563
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,756
cautery or retractor
or anything.

564
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,237
I...

565
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,891
Give me your knife.

566
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,109
- What are you doing?

567
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,937
- I'm figuring it out.

568
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,910
- What the hell are you doing?

569
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,216
- I'm opening this guy up.

570
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,915
And then what?

571
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,700
- Okay. Okay.

572
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,485
I'm gonna start his heart.

573
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,964
- With what?

574
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:23,837
- Hey, do me a favor.

575
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,405
Can you, uh, hold
this retractor?

576
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,844
Okay.

577
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,628
- Got it.
- All right, all right.

578
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,550
Hey, I know this rig can't fly,

579
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,770
but if you don't get
us to the 'Dam quick,

580
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,511
this guy is toast!

581
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,038
Carla.

582
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,735
- No one wants to
take away your rights.

583
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,215
- Yeah? Well, that's not

584
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:56,304
what my advocate
over there said.

585
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,890
- You want to live a
happier, less stressful life

586
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,264
with your PTSD and your
addictions under control.

587
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,744
Right?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

588
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,069
- Okay, great.
Well, the CARE court

589
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:04,530
can help you achieve that goal.

590
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,314
All you have to do is
stick to the program,

591
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,533
and your rights are your own.

592
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,404
- Carla, if you go
into this program,

593
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,885
what are the chances that
you will go off your meds

594
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,713
or continue drinking?

595
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:17,586
- It's pretty close to
100%, if I'm under oath.

596
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,414
- If that happens,
the CARE court can

597
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,503
legally compel you
into a conservatorship.

598
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,462
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

599
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,159
- Yes, if she
becomes an impediment

600
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,595
to her own treatment.
- We are way,

601
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,509
way past that point.

602
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,250
- I just think it's only fair

603
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,402
that Carla knows exactly
what she'd be signing up for.

604
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,515
- Yeah, what am I
signing up for, Iggy?

605
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,300
- Conservatorship means that
this court would be empowered

606
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,780
to make every choice for you...

607
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:40,304
Who you see, where you stay,
when you take your pills.

608
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:41,871
Is that what you want?
- If you comply,

609
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,022
that is not going to happen.

610
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,179
- She just said she won't.

611
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,180
- I'll help you.
- Let her answer.

612
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,374
- I'll help you.
I will help you.

613
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,836
You'll have help.
You can do this.

614
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,315
You can do it.

615
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,406
- No.

616
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,323
- So Your Honor, it
would be a violation

617
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,804
of her rights to enroll
her into the CARE program

618
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,240
against her wishes.

619
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,378
- Then take away her rights.

620
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,616
Mandate her into
the program today,

621
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,207
right now.
- Wait a minute, Doc.

622
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,401
What are you doing?
- Your Honor,

623
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,577
I intervene with
people who are about

624
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,298
to die by their own
hand all the time.

625
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,821
- So now we're
equating her refusal

626
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:19,996
of help with self-harm.

627
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,060
- Look at her medical record.

628
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,390
Her liver is cirrhotic.

629
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,261
Her kidneys are in failure
because of drinking

630
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,568
she admitted she
has no control over.

631
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:27,893
What... what... What
else would you call that?

632
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,615
- A drinking problem.

633
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,966
- For people like Carla,

634
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,707
a drink might as well be a gun.

635
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,838
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

636
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,100
There is zero evidence

637
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,687
that Carla will die
with her next drink.

638
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,975
- How slow a death is
slow enough for you?

639
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,411
One hour?

640
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,586
A day? A week?

641
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,457
This woman is killing herself

642
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,392
right in front of us, and
I am trying to save her.

643
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,723
And I'm asking
the court. I am...

644
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:53,595
I am imploring the court
to help me save her.

645
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,641
Mandate her into
the program today

646
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,425
against her will if you have to.

647
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,210
It is the only way
that we can save her.

648
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:07,609
- Okay, we're gonna
resect the lung.

649
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,959
Gentle.

650
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,138
Okay.

651
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:17,532
All right.

652
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,231
Well, I see minimal
inflammation.

653
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,277
Now we're gonna
perfuse the organ.

654
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,408
Is the box ready?

655
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,845
- Ready.
- All right.

656
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:30,850
Okay.

657
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,330
Here we go.

658
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,599
It's ventilating.
- Yeah.

659
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,211
It'll be in a
near-physiological state

660
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,821
in no time.

661
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,302
- Dr. Reynolds, why
go through all this?

662
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,651
We can't transplant that lung

663
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,479
into any of our other patients.

664
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,370
- That's why we're gonna
put it where it belongs...

665
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,744
In the original donor.

666
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,399
Talk to me.

667
00:26:58,442 --> 00:26:59,443
- They're in a small town

668
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:00,967
just outside of San Pedro Sula.

669
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,205
- All right, how soon
can we get 'em here?

670
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:03,665
- We can't.

671
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,537
They won't travel. They
won't even talk with us.

672
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:14,981
- How could Helen do this?

673
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:18,724
I mean, she knows that
trial diversity is an issue.

674
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,944
Of all people, she
would've shut this down.

675
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:24,599
- Maybe under normal
circumstances, yes, yes.

676
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,863
But when the trial started,

677
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,125
things were different.

678
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,866
- Di... how?
Medical bias didn't

679
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,389
start three years ago.

680
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,742
- You don't see it.

681
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,352
- See what?

682
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,834
- She did it to save your life.

683
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,712
- No, she, uh... no.

684
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,758
I mean, my cancer was
totally different.

685
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,067
- But they both shared
similar genetic mutations.

686
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,721
The research was new.

687
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,157
It would not have been a stretch

688
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:04,465
to believe that Lymphodril
could have cured you too.

689
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:12,168
She chose the fastest
way to make that happen

690
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,041
because she loved you.

691
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,699
- Coming through,
coming through!

692
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,111
Watch your back!
- We're not stopping,

693
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,963
just passing through.
Gotta get to the OR.

694
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,530
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

695
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,706
- I thought you were
apartment hunting!

696
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,970
- Come on.

697
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,319
Come on, Paul. Come on.

698
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,538
Stay with me.

699
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,409
Don't you quit on me.

700
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,020
- Get cardiac bypass ready.
- Okay.

701
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,499
- We got it from here.

702
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,866
- You're a good guy, Iggy.

703
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,216
You, uh, care

704
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,915
and all that good, cozy stuff.

705
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,396
- Just give it a chance, Carla.

706
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,745
Come on, please.

707
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,227
- I can't take that chance.

708
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,057
Even I would bet against me.

709
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,494
If you were any
smarter, you would too.

710
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,673
See you around, right?

711
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,719
- Yeah.

712
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,904
- See you around.

713
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,785
- She's gonna die
in the streets.

714
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:00,048
- Probably.

715
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,745
Land of the free, Iggy.

716
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,617
Land of the free.

717
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:28,990
- Mr. Murillo, hi.

718
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,513
My name is Dr. Floyd Reynolds,

719
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,689
and this is Nurse
Gabrielle Morris.

720
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:33,733
Do you speak English?

721
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,566
Okay, um...

722
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,354
- Oh, no, no, no.

723
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,972
- Oh.

724
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,155
- Thank you for meeting with us.

725
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,679
- Is this going to
be another lecture?

726
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,855
Well, we
are about to submit

727
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,032
the, uh, data for FDA approval.

728
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,903
- And you're okay with that?

729
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,600
- Uh, no. No, actually,

730
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,515
neither of us are.

731
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,300
- That is why we are
immediately starting

732
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,953
an expanded trial of Lymphodril.

733
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,477
On whose dime?

734
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,479
- Well, the trial
inequities were on us,

735
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,697
but, uh, Lymphodril
is your drug.

736
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,614
They're your profits,
so it's your dime.

737
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,228
- This is a list of
health organizations

738
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,553
that serve populations
that were not

739
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:18,839
included in the original trial.

740
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,884
- Howard University
College of Medicine,

741
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:23,061
Great Plains Tribal
Chairmen's Health Board,

742
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,280
uh, Mission Health Cooperative.

743
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:26,760
- They're all
ready to run trials

744
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:28,196
on the demographics
that we missed,

745
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,416
Native American,
African American,

746
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,373
Asian, Latinx, Middle Eastern...

747
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,333
- Uh, this may come
as a surprise to you,

748
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,944
but we bring drugs to
market to make money,

749
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,076
not hemorrhage it.

750
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,599
Why would we do this?

751
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:43,255
- You have to admit, the
world is a diverse place.

752
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,909
If you want to be in
business in 20 years,

753
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,433
you have to include everyone.

754
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,436
- Yeah, and if you don't, we
can just walk out the door.

755
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:51,934
And then we'll bury
these trial results,

756
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,525
and then nobody gets this drug.

757
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:00,098
Or... we can do this right.

758
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,630
- Okay.

759
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,025
Okay.

760
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,071
- Thank you.

761
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,594
Thank you.

762
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:25,166
- Oh, Paul came through.

763
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,125
Don't be so thrilled.

764
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,256
- Of course I'm thrilled,

765
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,216
but I lost the stupid apartment.

766
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,435
- Ah.
- So much for fresh starts.

767
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,307
- Ah, it's a big city, LB.

768
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,744
Huh? You'll find
the right place.

769
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,139
Like here.

770
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,792
- Uh, excuse me.

771
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:44,316
Are... are you
showing this place?

772
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,752
- Yes, I am.

773
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,016
- Ah, never mind.

774
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,017
If it's a turnkey that you want,

775
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,150
this definitely ain't it.

776
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,543
Matter of fact, this is like
the opposite of a turnkey.

777
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:57,764
This is like, uh,
black hole chic,

778
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,506
a blank canvas
without the canvas.

779
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,247
Eh, you gotta pick
out every fixture,

780
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,684
every light bulb,
every wall socket...

781
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:09,819
Paint coloring, floor covering,

782
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,170
walls, ceilings.

783
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,433
- I love it.

784
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,305
I love it.

785
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,240
You mean your interior
designer is gonna love it.

786
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,875
- No. No, I... I... I'm
gonna do it all myself.

787
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:25,444
- Lauren, um, you lived in
your apartment for ten years,

788
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,272
and you never even
hung a poster.

789
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,597
- Well, I just
turned the metal trim

790
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,189
inside an ambulance
into a chest retractor.

791
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,755
I can do this.

792
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,670
I mean, I need to do it,

793
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:35,821
'cause that's the only
way it's ever gonna feel

794
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,195
like it's really mine, you know?

795
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,414
If... if I make every decision,

796
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,938
if I do the work thoughtfully,

797
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:46,334
meticulously, painstakingly.

798
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,031
That's the way I wanna live.

799
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,819
- All right. All right.

800
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:58,216
I think she's gonna take it.

801
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,696
You are crazy.

802
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,222
- Oh, my God, I love it so much.

803
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,703
- I didn't know
you spoke Spanish.

804
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,357
- Yeah. Yeah, I've
done my fair share

805
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:11,577
of traveling myself, you know?

806
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,492
I even spent the
first six months

807
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:14,754
of my residency in the DR.

808
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:15,972
- Mm.

809
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:19,062
Well, it was pretty sexy.

810
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,542
- Oh.

811
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,390
Well, would you like to go
to dinner with me tonight?

812
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,111
I can order in Spanish.

813
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,286
- You know, I'd love to,

814
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,463
but I... I need to
make it an early night.

815
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,987
I leave for Tanzania tomorrow.

816
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,293
- Tomorrow?

817
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,737
- The recruiter,
he said that he had

818
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:36,645
never heard a recommendation
like you gave me.

819
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,082
He said that he had to
make up an emergency

820
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,388
just to get you off the phone.

821
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:45,915
Yeah, you said that you
went on and on so much,

822
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,397
sounded like you
were in love with me.

823
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,577
- I think I am.

824
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,331
- Hi. Martin?

825
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,289
Hi. How are you doing?

826
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,551
I'm Iggy.
- Iggs...

827
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,509
- Oh, wow. Nice to meet you.

828
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,598
I... oh God, I'm
mucking this up already.

829
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,208
Look at you. I
didn't think you were

830
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:21,342
gonna be this, uh, attractive.

831
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,039
- Thank you. Uh, are we gonna

832
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:23,997
do this all night?

833
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,259
- Oh, fully, yes.

834
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,628
We are definitely doing
this all night long.

835
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,697
Because, uh, I didn't
know what you were into,

836
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,569
I took a safe shot, and, uh...

837
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,223
- Roller skating.
- Yeah,

838
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,182
'cause who doesn't
love roller skating?

839
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,401
- Sure.
- Hi.

840
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,403
Um... uh, shoe size?

841
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,100
- You know my...

842
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,754
- What?

843
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,496
- It's 11. My shoe size is 11.

844
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,149
- 11, nice.

845
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,544
Uh, one 11, and I am a 12.

846
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,677
There you go, 11.
- Yep.

847
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,069
- Thank you very much.

848
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:54,462
And, uh, that is for you.

849
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:55,942
Keep the change.

850
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,813
Uh, so what did you say
you do again, Martin?

851
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,686
- Iggs, stop.

852
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,644
- What?

853
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:06,822
- Look, what if we try
this and it doesn't work?

854
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,477
I don't know if I
can handle that.

855
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,828
I know the kids can't handle it.

856
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:18,181
We can't keep
playing make-believe.

857
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:21,054
- Yeah, I know. Um...

858
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,752
I... I'm scared too.

859
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,886
But you know, if... If we
both want a fresh start,

860
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,454
like, really want a fresh start,

861
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:32,282
I don't know how else to do it.

862
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,546
Do you?

863
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:46,688
- So... where are you from?

864
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,516
- I am from Wisconsin.

865
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,126
Where are you from?

866
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,607
- I am from Massachusetts.

867
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:54,479
- You're from...
Of course you are.

868
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:55,847
- What do you mean,
of course I am?

869
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,109
"I'm
from Massachusetts."

870
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:00,354
- No, I... I lost
my accent years ago.

871
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,660
- You lost your what?

872
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,183
- I lost my accent.

873
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,490
I
don't talk like that.

874
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,941
- Yeah.

875
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:41,760
- ♪ We're home, we're
home, we're home ♪

876
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:45,807
♪ Oh, we've come home

877
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,810
♪ We've come home
