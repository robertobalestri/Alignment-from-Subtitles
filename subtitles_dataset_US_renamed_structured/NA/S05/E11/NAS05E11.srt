1
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:08,571
<i>- Previously on
"New Amsterdam"...</i>

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,695
<i>- Dr. Helen Sharpe is
here in New York City</i>

3
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,859
<i>representing the NHS'
fight against cancer.</i>

4
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,109
- Did you know she
was in New York?

5
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:26,671
- No, not until I saw her on TV.

6
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:28,353
- I wish I could
have seen your face.

7
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,470
It's not funny, all right?

8
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:30,534
Elizabeth did see my face.

9
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,436
Did she take a video?

10
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:32,718
No, she didn't.

11
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:34,075
Let's just say it
wasn't the best

12
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,401
way to start a relationship.

13
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,642
Wait, you and Elizabeth?

14
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,245
- Almost, until I saw
Helen and basically

15
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,568
frickin' short
circuited, which I'm sure

16
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,748
is what every woman wants
in a prospective boyfriend.

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,133
- Did you think that we'd still
be boyfriends at this age?

18
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,233
No, I did not.

19
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,474
Yeah. So you gonna see Helen?

20
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,458
I don't know. Yes. No. Maybe.

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,220
I... she hasn't even
reached out, OK?

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,377
I don't even know if
it's on the table.

23
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,498
- You're not even a
little bit curious?

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,744
- Of cour... which part?

25
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:57,301
- I mean, if she still
has feelings for you.

26
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,508
If some part of her wishes
she could take it all back.

27
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,266
I mean, what if she came back
to New York for a reason?

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,431
I know, I know, but I can't.

29
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:03,873
I can't be curious, OK?

30
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:07,477
Not about any of it, because
I can't open that door.

31
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,075
I can't fall back
into something that I

32
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,520
worked so hard to get over.

33
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,083
I just need to find
Elizabeth, apologise,

34
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:15,546
make this right, OK?

35
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:21,813
Hey.

36
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:22,934
Hi.

37
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,816
Hi.

38
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,098
Hi.

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,181
911.

40
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:32,665
And I have a coffee 911.

41
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:36,950
- Um, you know what, would
you mind interpreting for me,

42
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,508
because I'm just a
little more clear when

43
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,634
I'm not using the
wrong words, or, uh,

44
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,856
unintentionally swearing.

45
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,441
- Max, please do not include Ben

46
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,464
in our private conversations.

47
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,495
Oh, thank God.

48
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,597
Thank you.

49
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
Hmm.

50
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:37,085
- So, this is my emergency, huh?

51
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,848
- Oh, it's urgent,
Dr. Reynolds.

52
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,930
- Come here.
- Mm.

53
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,032
Mmm.

54
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,897
I can't believe it.

55
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:50,860
One more week before
you have to go.

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,264
- That is the beauty of
dating a travelling nurse.

57
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,425
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,147
What is that?

59
00:03:57,247 --> 00:04:00,591
Less time, and more heat.

60
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,557
I might have a meeting.

61
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:07,479
Do you have a meeting?

62
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,882
I can't remember right now.

63
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,984
OK.

64
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,010
Manny?

65
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,687
- There's the guy that
sliced into the phrenic nerve

66
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:19,893
in anatomy lab.

67
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,793
- No, no, that's only
'cause the cadaver shook

68
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,172
when you dropped
that slice of pizza

69
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,196
in the abdominal cavity.

70
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:25,735
- What's up, man?
- It's been a minute.

71
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,461
- Yeah, too many. Too many.

72
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,223
How you doing? You look good.

73
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:30,625
What are you doing here?

74
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,507
It's my son.

75
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,689
He's in the ICU.

76
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:40,716
It's a fusiform aneurysm

77
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,198
in the vertebral basilar artery,

78
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,580
very close to the
Circle of Willis.

79
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:47,982
- That's deep in the
base of the brain, yes?

80
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:48,845
Yes.

81
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,407
Yes, where the blood travels.

82
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,851
But the aneurysm
can blow any minute.

83
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,894
Manny, we need to
operate immediately.

84
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,817
I've called Dr. Emilio Nieves.

85
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,020
He is the best neurosurgeon
on the East Coast.

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,903
- You know how delicate cutting
into that part of the brain is.

87
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:08,147
Slightest vibration,
my boy's own heartbeat

88
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,869
could throw Nieves
off by a millimetre

89
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,186
- and he could never wake up.
- Right. Right.

90
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,473
But that's not
going to happen, OK?

91
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,235
I'm going to stop
Manny Jr.'s heart

92
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:16,917
before Nieves starts.

93
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,360
We're going to get his body
temp down to 45 degrees,

94
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,881
put him in cold plegia.

95
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,364
All right, suspended
animation. All right?

96
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:25,807
That way there's no
pulse to throw Nieves off

97
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,889
as he makes the
incision to reconstruct

98
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:31,333
the basilar artery using
an internal mammary artery.

99
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:35,177
And when he's done, I'll
rewarm your son's body,

100
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:38,902
restart his heart, and
everyone goes home.

101
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:43,126
- Hearing it as a
doctor, it makes sense.

102
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:47,071
- But when it's your child...
- Hey.

103
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:51,175
I still owe you for totalling
that '66 Dodge Dart.

104
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,140
Don't I?

105
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,564
Let me make it up to you.

106
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,448
<i>♪ ♪</i>

107
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:04,090
Dr. Dyson, exactly how long

108
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,447
do you and your
team need for this?

109
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:07,009
- A quarter of New
Amsterdam's thallium allotment

110
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,255
is unaccounted for, Dr. Bloom.

111
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:09,896
- Right, and I'm not
trying to diminish

112
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,819
the severity of a missing
radioactive element.

113
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,101
But my ED is clean,
and my mood is bad,

114
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,584
so I would appreciate
a real measure of time.

115
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,908
Uh, as long as it takes.

116
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,750
- 50-year-old male, hypotensive,

117
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,067
experiencing shortness of breath

118
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,713
due to multiple bee stings.

119
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,715
- Oh, damn it, Dave.
- You know him?

120
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,874
- Yeah, only because this is
his third time here this week.

121
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,319
He's in anaphylactic shock.

122
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,797
- Yeah, I was
transferring a beehive,

123
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,038
and the cover ripped
for some reason.

124
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:33,983
- Maybe because
you're an accountant.

125
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,285
That's what I do.

126
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,487
Who I am is an
urban outdoorsman.

127
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,292
- OK, let's get him
on 250 milligrams

128
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,272
of hydrocortisone and 50
milligrams of Benadryl.

129
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,176
- My eye feels
like it's on fire.

130
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,497
Ahh! Ahh!

131
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:48,477
- There's a stinger in
the inner canthal region.

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,378
- Dave, I need
you to stay still.

133
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,619
- I don't like things in my eye.

134
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,261
- Then you should stop
leaving your office, hey?

135
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,267
Hold him still.
Max, Max, uh...

136
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,870
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.
- Hold him still.

137
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,636
- Got it.
- That was fast.

138
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,998
OK, let's take him to Bay 24,

139
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,556
and let's monitor him
for the rest of the day.

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,962
Got it.

141
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,203
- No, wait! No, stop!

142
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,325
- I can't be here all day.
- Why not?

143
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,888
- I'm taking my employees
on a Great Escape.

144
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,651
- Sure, as long as it's
in Bay 24, that's fine.

145
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:19,054
- Sorry, Great
Escape? What is that?

146
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:21,377
- Day-long team-building
trips that take New Yorkers

147
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,699
off the grid and up a mountain
for an eye-opening escape

148
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,501
from city life
and city problems.

149
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,024
The tickets are also
expensive and non-refundable.

150
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,546
Yeah, I'll take them.

151
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,668
I'll take all of them.

152
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,511
Fine, but I only do Zelle.

153
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:39,197
- You won't even
do patio seating

154
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:40,874
at a four-star restaurant
and now you want

155
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,160
to venture off into the wild?

156
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,878
- I just think it'd
be nice to spend a day

157
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:46,164
outdoors with my friends
and my coworkers, right?

158
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,504
- Hm, this is because Helen's
back in New York, isn't it?

159
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,245
- No, no, no, I just
want to spend more time

160
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,131
with the people who are
actually in my life.

161
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,854
And after everything that
you have been going through,

162
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:56,956
wouldn't that be nice?

163
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,863
Brunstetter, page Candelario.

164
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,809
- That's what I'm talking about.

165
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,713
Great idea, two words.

166
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:14,717
- Cape Cod.
- Nope.

167
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,440
Corporate retreat.

168
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,841
That is very different.

169
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,319
- It is very different,
but everything

170
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,325
is packed and prepared
and ready to go

171
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:23,985
so that we can have
some food, some fun,

172
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,930
and maybe a little adventure.

173
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,412
Max, I have appointments.

174
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,010
- That's why I've got
substitute doctors who

175
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,575
can step in at a moment's notice

176
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,419
so that we can take a day to
remember what truly matters.

177
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,741
Plus, we'll probably
spend some time in a, uh,

178
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,906
Tent, so maybe we
could, uh, you know,

179
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:42,868
do important doctor stuff.

180
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,970
- I'll go.
- Sorry.

181
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,174
So what do you think?

182
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,641
Yes! Thank you.

183
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,563
Value of shared assets.

184
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,765
Division of property.

185
00:08:57,865 --> 00:08:59,447
Child custody rights.

186
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:03,091
I guess divorce comes down
to these little sticky notes.

187
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,184
- Hey, buddy, you want
to climb a mountain?

188
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:16,666
Yes.

189
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,628
Thank you. Thank you.

190
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:20,791
That was easy.

191
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:23,474
Throw on a backpack, amigo,
because I am taking you

192
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,715
to climb a mountain.

193
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,517
I guess Helen texted you.

194
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,479
She did.

195
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:30,361
I don't know if I want
to see her, though.

196
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,560
I don't even know if I want
to be in the same city as her.

197
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,366
- 'Cause you don't
want to be tempted?

198
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,567
It's like this.

199
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,347
I just found out Luna
has a peanut allergy,

200
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,652
so naturally I purge the
whole house of all peanuts,

201
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,171
all peanut butter, because even
though she knows that it could

202
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,698
make her stop breathing,
she still loves it,

203
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,500
and she probably always will.

204
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,263
So the only thing to do
is to remove it completely

205
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,225
so it doesn't, you
know, kill her.

206
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,827
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,905
Max, look, I got a big surgery
so I'm going to have to pass,

208
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,031
but I understand and
fully support you

209
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,673
getting the hell out of here.

210
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,395
Thanks, buddy.

211
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,781
You going to get that?

212
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,534
Max.

213
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,176
Get out of those scrubs.

214
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:20,818

229
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,423
Are we almost there?

230
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,665
'Cause this is a lot of steps.

231
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,990
- Welcome to the
top of the world.

232
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,194
- Wow.
- Oh, it's amazing.

233
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:47,996
- Wow.
- Whoa.

234
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,098
This is unreal.

235
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,322
Where are we?

236
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,145
Tennessee, this is amazing.

237
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,108
It's incredible.

238
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,611
- Nope. Nope. No.
- Oh.

239
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,714
Whoa.

240
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,096
Wow.

241
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:07,516
- How high up do
you think we are?

242
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,141
- I... 100, maybe, 150 feet.

243
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,243
It's 288 feet.

244
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:15,547
OK, well, that's, uh, high.

245
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,649
- Maybe Iggy had the
right idea hanging back.

246
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,033
Wait, Max, is Iggy OK?

247
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,515
Why didn't he come?

248
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,438
- He, uh, he just wanted
to be alone for a minute.

249
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,440
I think he's going
through some stuff.

250
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,164
- Yeah, well, he's
missing out on a lot.

251
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,264
Yeah.

252
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,887
All right, so now what?

253
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,810
We're going over the edge.

254
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,254
- We're go... how's that?

255
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,736
- One by one, we're
going to harness up,

256
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:44,679
use this belay line to rappel
down the face of the cliff.

257
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:48,744
Any questions?

258
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,706
Uh, I'll go first.

259
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:51,707
Are you crazy?

260
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,910
- All I heard is
"I'll go first."

261
00:12:57,294 --> 00:13:00,477
- Cardiopulmonary
bypass initiated.

262
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,240
Time to stop the heart.

263
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,444
- Core temp is
down to 45 degrees.

264
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,546
- All right. Here we go.

265
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,169
ACT 466.

266
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,780
Wait for it.

267
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,949
OK, patient is in
suspended animation.

268
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,751
Dr. Nieves, you're up.

269
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,509
Time for you to show
off. You got one hour.

270
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,795
We'll need every second.

271
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,897
Three-hole punch.

272
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:46,049
- I always thought he was
throwing away his career,

273
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:48,131
with starting a family so young.

274
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,996
Now I realise how wrong I was.

275
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,502
And if I can't have it,

276
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,985
least I can do is make
sure he doesn't lose it.

277
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,507
Radiation safety team.

278
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,744
- Hey, hey, hey, get
the hell out of here!

279
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,390
- We are tracking
a radiation spill.

280
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,490
Get the hell out!

281
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,033
We are doing a surgery.

282
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,357
- We discovered our
thallium supply had a leak.

283
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:13,439
Probably spilled in here.

284
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,877
- Do not come into
the surgical field.

285
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,723
Found it! It's in here.

286
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,845
We need everybody to
evacuate immediately.

287
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,088
- My patient has a
blade in his brain.

288
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,529
If we try to move
him, he's dead.

289
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,892
- He also is being
exposed to potentially

290
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,894
lethal amounts of radiation.

291
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,861
Not just the boy,
everybody is being exposed.

292
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,423
- OK.
- Come on.

293
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:46,396
- All right, people,
here's the deal.

294
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:48,154
These excursions aren't
just about physically

295
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,560
getting out of the city.

296
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,037
It's about getting away
from the thoughts that

297
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,363
cloud what really matters.

298
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,045
If I stood in the
middle of Fifth Avenue

299
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,327
and I asked people what
their deepest desires were,

300
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,169
I'd probably hear a
lot of people saying

301
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,052
they want to be rich.

302
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:01,449
That is not what
they really want.

303
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:02,614
So what do they really want?

304
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,376
Can we speed this up, please?

305
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,098
It's different for everyone.

306
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,062
And in my experience, this
is the best way to find out.

307
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,384
Because when you take a
backwards leap off an almost

308
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:14,908
300-foot-high cliff, well,

309
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,151
what you really want tends
to become very clear.

310
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,592
Yeah, are we good to go?

311
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,030
- Oh, sounds like
someone's excited

312
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:21,796
for their first rappel.

313
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,521
- As you're in freefall...
- Yeah.

314
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,924
- Just think about what
you really want in life.

315
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,169
That's it?

316
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,271
We're just going to...

317
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,795
OK, uh...

318
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,960
OK.

319
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,436
Oh.

320
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,961
Whoo.

321
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,283
Ahh!

322
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,752
OK, last but not least.

323
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,514
- Yeah.
- Any questions?

324
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:34,878
- Uh, think I'm ready
as I'll ever be.

325
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:36,280
- All right, you
know what to do.

326
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,002
Yeah.

327
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,104
OK.

328
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,587
OK. Wait.

329
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,751
What if I don't
know what I want?

330
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:50,215
Step back and find out.

331
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,753
I'm a little bit jealous.

332
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,355
- Oh, my God.
- I got to be honest.

333
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:45,357
It's unbelievable.

334
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:46,599
Max.

335
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,280
Max, incredible, right?

336
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,383
Yeah, it's incredible.

337
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,315
Hey. Hey.

338
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:55,997
Oh, my God.

339
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,318
Let's get her on her side.

340
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,420
Easy, easy, easy.

341
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:01,763
How's her pulse? Anything?

342
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,805
Starting chest compressions.

343
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:05,127
- Non-responsive.

344
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,849
A broken femur, shattered wrist,

345
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,492
possible pelvic fracture.

346
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:10,853
Max!

347
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:14,858
- We need an evac.
Call an evac.

348
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,780
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

349
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,418
- Who's got the SAV pump?
- Check around her body.

350
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,739
It might have fallen
out of the bag.

351
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,225
I know she has one.

352
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,226
- OK.
- Oh.

353
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:23,788
- Got it, got it.
- You got it?

354
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,269
Oh, yeah.

355
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:29,714
Damn it.

356
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:30,872
- All right, try
this cell phone.

357
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,898
Yeah, yeah. Give me a sec.

358
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,080
OK, OK.

359
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,922
No, we got a problem here, guys.

360
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:38,400
- All right, if we don't get
a rescue helicopter here,

361
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,686
she's got no chance.

362
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,283
- Wait, when was the last
time any of us had service?

363
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,925
- Back where we parked,
right? I'll go back.

364
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,291
I'll go back.

365
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,772
I'll follow the trail.

366
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:48,153
I'll get... I'll hit service
before then, probably, right?

367
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:53,080
What other option do we have?

368
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:55,864
I'm going. I'm going.

369
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,793
- These protective
lead shields were

370
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,795
designed for X-rays
and should offer you

371
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:08,398
some protection in here.

372
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,160
Closing sutures.

373
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,717
- You need to put
this on, Dr. Reynolds.

374
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:12,843
Not going to happen.

375
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:13,864
I'm not going to
compromise my mobility.

376
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,081
- You're risking
further exposure.

377
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:16,687
- I don't care. The
patient comes first.

378
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:20,531
This particular patient is
too important, all right?

379
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,894
Is it really necessary to
clear the observation deck?

380
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:25,137
- Thallium is an airborne
radioactive substance.

381
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:27,239
We clear the area.
That's protocol.

382
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,064
This is the last operating
room running on this floor,

383
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,787
so I would strongly advise you
and your team to find a way...

384
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,790
There isn't one!

385
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,754
All done here.

386
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,134
Surgical reconstruction
complete.

387
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:43,998
- You and your team
need to exit the zone.

388
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,360
- This way, please.
- Show-off.

389
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,602
Good luck, Floyd.

390
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,368
- All right, begin
reperfusion and rewarming.

391
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:54,690
Reperfusion started.

392
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,773
- Dr. Reynolds, these
dosimeters measure exposure.

393
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:59,695
The second any of
them starts beeping,

394
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,377
we need to pull you
out, no argument.

395
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,779
Fine, let me work.

396
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,324
Gonna have you back in no time.

397
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:26,505
OK.

398
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,380
Hello?

399
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:56,279
Hello?

400
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,958
Hey.

401
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,921
Hi.

402
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,825
Uh, I'm Iggy.

403
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:21,627
Are you OK?

404
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,309
Just lost.

405
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,412
Are you OK?

406
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,355
Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

407
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:29,476
I just... I fell.

408
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:31,038
It's nothing.

409
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,160
- My family is out here camping.

410
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,263
I just got separated from them.

411
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:37,525
OK, but they're nearby?

412
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,927
I don't know.

413
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,889
You lost too?

414
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,652
- No, I'm not lost, I'm, uh...

415
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,694
No, I'm looking for cell
service, but I got to...

416
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:46,856
I got to keep going, so...

417
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:48,177
Can I come with you?

418
00:22:48,277 --> 00:22:50,700
Then you can call
my parents too.

419
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,802
Can you run?

420
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,145
OK, come on.

421
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,513
- What is that?
- Smart AED.

422
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,956
It uses the phone's
battery as a charge.

423
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:07,359
I got it the last
time Vanessa OD'd.

424
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,480
OK.

425
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,322
This one goes here.

426
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,647
OK, clear.

427
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:20,453
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

428
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,556
Going again.

429
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,025
- Slow but steady.
She's alive.

430
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:38,273
This rock face is unstable.

431
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,511
We got to get her out of here.

432
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:40,636
Let's move these.

433
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,183
There's no way.

434
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,526
They're too heavy.

435
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,643
- It's bedrock, it's
not going to move.

436
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,730
She's wedged in.

437
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:55,973
Her rhythm is unstable.

438
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,136
- Her body is going
in and out of shock.

439
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,819
- What if Iggy doesn't
make it in time?

440
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,100
We need to build a fire.

441
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,297
- The smoke could
draw attention.

442
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,623
I'll help you.

443
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,513
Come on.

444
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,615
Oh, God.

445
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,278
You move fast.

446
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:21,482
- Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm worried
about it getting dark.

447
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,444
Work out a lot?

448
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:24,645
I try.

449
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:26,087
Good for you.

450
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,449
My family loves exercise.

451
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,132
I just really never
gotten into it.

452
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,733
Worried you're
going the wrong way?

453
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,455
My sense of direction is awful.

454
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,177
My brother says if
I have two choices,

455
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:37,140
I should choose one
and go the other way,

456
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,462
but he's also kind of douche.

457
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,266
- Hey, uh, is your
family anywhere nearby?

458
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,606
You think, like... does any
of this look familiar to you?

459
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,713
- I actually need to
tell you something.

460
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,474
I didn't get separated.

461
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,577
I ran away.

462
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:54,319
Why would you do that?

463
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,720
Don't get snippy.

464
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,124
It's not like you didn't run
away when you were my age.

465
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,607
What are you talking about?

466
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:03,609
- You ran away after
your dad found you

467
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,768
sneaking a candy bar for
your new secret hiding place

468
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,794
under the porch.

469
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:11,698
So he slapped you
in the head, hard.

470
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,142
And then you ran away.

471
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,984
A couple of hours
later, you wussed out,

472
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,086
and you went right back.

473
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:22,110
Who are you?

474
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,752
I'm you.

475
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,079
This is all my fault.

476
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,557
- It's your fault that
our guide's anchor

477
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,843
broke free from the mountain?

478
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:36,063
- We're only here because I
was trying to avoid Helen.

479
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,368
- Tennessee would
be here either way.

480
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:41,372
Only with a bunch
of tax accountants.

481
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:43,694
- Look, she'd be dead
if we weren't here,

482
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,796
and so would they.

483
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:48,740
So, thank God you're
avoiding Helen.

484
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,222
Clearly, the right move.

485
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:52,324
- Give me that.
- OK.

486
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,310
Done this before?

487
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,512
- Jewish summer camp,
when I wasn't sneaking off

488
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:01,614
- to smoke with the boys.
- Mm.

489
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,563
- You know, for months
after she left...

490
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:13,828
For months, I would have done
anything to see her, anything.

491
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:18,293
Just to ask her why.

492
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:24,901
I used dream of this moment.

493
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,151
- You're doing the
right thing, Max.

494
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:35,512
Look, you going to see Helen,

495
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:38,235
it would be like me going to see

496
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,757
a hundred milligrams
of Adderall.

497
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,366
- Whatever she has to
say, it's not gonna help.

498
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:51,510
Just keep looking
forward, not behind.

499
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,820
- Think I'll take
that as a sign.

500
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:03,884
What was that?

501
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,336
Rock slide.

502
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,645
I've got Ben.

503
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,367
Yeah, I got Tennessee.

504
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:25,467
Stop, stop.

505
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:27,451
This whole side
is going to fall.

506
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:31,475
Don't!

507
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:33,457
Just go.

508
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,572
I need you to listen to me.

509
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,376
We got to get you out of here.

510
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:54,281
I got to get you out of here.

511
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,924
There's only one way to do that.

512
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:01,169
My foot.

513
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,770
No. Please, no.

514
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,688
- The rockslide will kill
you. It's the only way.

515
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:06,895
Tennessee, look at me.

516
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,377
It's the only way.

517
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:13,983
OK.

518
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,085
- OK.
- My bag.

519
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,950
In here.

520
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:39,572
Bite down on this.

521
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,978
Hold her steady.

522
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:51,145
OK.

523
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:53,247
Look at me.

524
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,269
It's OK.

525
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,511
Here.

526
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,423
OK.

527
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:09,245
Are you ready?

528
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,982
- Did I hit my head?
- You wish.

529
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:26,945
That would mean you don't
have huge emotional issues.

530
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:30,068
- You're not real, and I don't
have huge emotional issues.

531
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,510
Yeah, right.

532
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,874
You can't even tell your
friends how sad you are.

533
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,355
I don't have time for this.

534
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,274
- Oh, like you don't have time
to sign your divorce papers?

535
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,719
I'm not going to.

536
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,379
I'm gonna ask Martin
for another chance.

537
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:43,239
- Come on, we both know
that's not going to happen.

538
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:46,046
Plus, you dumped him, which
frankly blows my mind,

539
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:47,328
because he's super hot.

540
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,628
Like, I'm psyched to meet him.

541
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,571
- You'll understand
when you're older.

542
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:54,296
True love is worth fighting for.

543
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:56,294
I had to leave because I
had to figure out who I was.

544
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:57,579
I did that.

545
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,942
Now I can go back.

546
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,464
Classic us.

547
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:03,146
Running away and going back.

548
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:04,827
Why did you go back?

549
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:07,751
I mean, you ran away, hung
out in a park for four hours,

550
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,011
and then you went right back,

551
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:10,309
even though nothing had changed.

552
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,995
Like, what's the point?

553
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,518
Uh...

554
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:16,621
I don't know.

555
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,364
It wasn't all bad.

556
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,546
It wasn't.

557
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,390
I missed my mom.

558
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:30,796
I, uh, I missed my brother when
he wasn't being a jerk to me.

559
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:35,722
I didn't want to say goodbye
to those things forever.

560
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:40,227
Eventually, you did leave.

561
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:41,989
Never came back.

562
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,216
Yeah.

563
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,100
I realised that was the
price of a better life.

564
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,405
Sometimes it's scary to walk
away from the good things,

565
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:59,589
but you have to.

566
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,974
It's what you have to
do to move forward.

567
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,136
- That's the funny
thing about being lost.

568
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:08,779
Clearly it's not about
knowing your way forward.

569
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,302
It's knowing that the
answer isn't looking back.

570
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:58,715
Got it.

571
00:31:58,815 --> 00:31:59,935
All right, let's get her up.

572
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:01,438
Easy. Watch her head.

573
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,563
Got her?

574
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:07,685
OK, you're doing great.

575
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,947
- You're doing great, Tennessee.

576
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:12,991
- Keep moving! Keep moving!

577
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,380
Max, there's too much blood.

578
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,097
- All right, all right,
set her down, set her down.

579
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,264
Easy, easy.

580
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:26,066
How's she doing?

581
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,868
Fast and weak.

582
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,866
- All right, she's going to
go into hypovolemic shock

583
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,027
unless we tighten
the tourniquet.

584
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,233
It's soaked through.

585
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,675
- Uh...

586
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,401
Yeah, she's right.

587
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,503
We need to cauterise her leg.

588
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:43,285
We have the fire.

589
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:44,487
- We don't have...

590
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,589
Metal. We need metal.

591
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:50,193
A carabiner?

592
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,096
It's going to have to do.

593
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:54,694
- All right, we got
to get him off bypass.

594
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:55,819
What's the core temp?

595
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:01,185
- You need to step
out of the OR.

596
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:03,828
Now!

597
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,271
Core temp is 98.6.

598
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,435
OK. Come on.

599
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,237
Let's go. Follow me.

600
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,023
Ready, Dr. Reynolds.

601
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,207
OK.

602
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:21,524
We're going to take
him off bypass.

603
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:23,130
Suture?

604
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,172
Good. All right.

605
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,179
Get those paddles ready.

606
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,821
All right, restarting the heart.

607
00:33:35,564 --> 00:33:37,186
Charging.

608
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,988
Clear.

609
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:42,771
OK, going again.

610
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,814
Charging, clear.

611
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:48,599
Going again.

612
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,701
Charging, clear.

613
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,882
- Dr. Reynolds, you need
to step out of the OR.

614
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:56,167
Going again. Charge.

615
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,291
- Dr. Reynolds,
you need to leave.

616
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:01,393
Come on.

617
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:03,575
- You shocked the
heart four times.

618
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,897
Three times is protocol.

619
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:06,254
- You need to come with me.
- Come on.

620
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,019
Come on.

621
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,821
The patient is unresponsive!

622
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,219
- Not going to lose you.
Not going to lose you.

623
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:11,380
- You've been exposed to
high levels of radiation.

624
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:12,764
You need to come
with us right now.

625
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,348
Come on. Damn it!

626
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,712
OK.

627
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:20,434
All right, hold her.

628
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,439
Hold her tight.

629
00:34:37,193 --> 00:34:38,415
He's not going to die today.

630
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:39,656
Intracardiac epi.

631
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:41,698
On it.

632
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:44,181
Inject just above my fingers.

633
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:46,283
One milligram epi in.

634
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:49,107
Dr. Reynolds, call it.

635
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,309
Come on, come on, come on.

636
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,832
- There's nothing
more you can do.

637
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:55,193
Get yourself to safety.

638
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,475
Wait a minute, wait.

639
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:57,476
Dr. Reynolds, call it!

640
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,038
Wait a second.

641
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,840
I got something.

642
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,522
Yeah, I got something.

643
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:05,685
Oh, my God.

644
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,134
- All right, get him
to a new OR, now.

645
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,712
Lauren.

646
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,662
Over here!

647
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,384
Hey!

648
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:10,866
Hey!

649
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,988
Over here!

650
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,030
Hey!

651
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,133
Hey!

652
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,619
Iggy did it!

653
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:29,727
<i>Hey, Floyd.</i>

654
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:32,109
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

655
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:38,016
<i>Floyd, my oldest friend.</i>

656
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,601
<i>Thank you for saving my family.</i>

657
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:46,406
<i>Consider the car debt repaid.</i>

658
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,190
<i>Thank you.</i>

659
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:01,402
- Um, I'm...

660
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:04,706
I'm sorry, the radiation
has got me all, uh...

661
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,991
I just...

662
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:13,056
It's just between, uh, you know,

663
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:16,539
this and you leaving.

664
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,662
- Why do you act like everything

665
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:20,764
is over and done with?

666
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:25,770
- It's 'cause you're
leaving in six days.

667
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,234
Yes.

668
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:32,197
Only 'cause you never
asked me to stay.

669
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,177
Iggy, hey.

670
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:51,619
You OK?

671
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,940
Hey.

672
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,262
Yeah, yeah, fine.

673
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:56,264
I'm just embarrassed, mostly.

674
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:58,106
- What were you doing
up on a mountain?

675
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:01,790
Um, I was gaining clarity.

676
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:07,957
I, uh... I signed
the divorce papers.

677
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,795
- We don't need to worry
about that right now.

678
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:10,840
Yes. Yes, we do.

679
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,282
Yes, we do.

680
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:15,245
Because I have been, um...

681
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:17,128
I've been having a really
hard time accepting

682
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:20,131
that what we had is over.

683
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:24,095
But sometimes to move forward,

684
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,199
you have to leave
something behind.

685
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,503
Our marriage is over.

686
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,985
I am certain of that now.

687
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:40,674
You seem pretty OK with it.

688
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,776
Yeah.

689
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:44,674
Because I finally
know the direction

690
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:46,040
that I want to be headed in.

691
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:56,492
