have I got to tell you

that your couch is
a sciatica waiting to happen.

68
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,414
You gotta go back

Don't blame me.

00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,976

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,834
Every month Leyla's visa's
supposed to be sorted

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,187
and she's supposed to move out

74
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,583
and every month they throw
something new at her.

75
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,976
You have a two bedroom.
Just use the other one.

76
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,351
Floyd, I know me.
If I'm living there,

77

into bed with her.

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,563
- Better her bed than mine.
- Come on.

79
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm giving you till tomorrow,

80
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:58,101

else's couch to not sleep on.

00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:06,337
Okay, so these flapjacks,

82
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,123

circles, yeah?

83
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,604
- No one says flapjacks.
- That...

84
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,953
Well, these objects
that I call flapjacks

85
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:18,436
and you call pancakes,
are they similar or congruent?

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,082
- Similar.
- Okay. Hey, Harper.

87
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,268

- Again.

123
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,316

124
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,406
Uh, I don't know. I can't ask.

125
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,366
- You can't ask?
- Well...

126
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,501

127
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:06,019
Look, it's taken decades
to get here, you know?

128
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,738
I have a relationship
with the man.

129
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:09,480
What kind of relationship is it?

130
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:10,926
I mean, you don't see the guy.

131
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,168
You don't tell him how you feel.

132
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:15,464
Well, at least I know
I'll never lose him again.

133
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,247
Well, I hate this, you know?

134
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:21,175
You are an incredible person

139
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,933
Uh, because clouds.

140
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,798

141
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,561

- Gonna have fun today.

154
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,167
We know the children's
foundation can't help everyone.

155
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,389
We just hadn't seen Brady
that excited about something

156
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,574
since before the diagnosis.

157
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,324
What did he say
when you told him?

158
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:40,129
You know Brady.
He's putting up a brave front.

159
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:41,878
But he's devastated.

160
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:44,835
I mean, how else is
a 12-year-old supposed to react

161
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,300
to being denied his dying wish?

162
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,331
<i>New Amsterdam
has a wonderful board</i>

163
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,410
and a truly amazing
medical director.

164
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:00,392
We have a large
volunteer group and...

165
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:07,788
<i>A lot of celebrities
owe us a few favors.</i>

166
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,774
What are you saying, Dr. Wilder?

167
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,863
What I'm saying is that we

168
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,495
can make Brady's wish come true.

169
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,630
So what is it?

170
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,541
I want to be the star
of a Bollywood musical.

171
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,986
Male, 30s,
multiple fractured ribs.

172
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,519
Patient was trampled
when some march

173
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,957
was disrupted by protestors.
Vital signs stable.

174
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,917
Okay, bay 23.

175
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,994
I liked it better when
they protested on Facebook.

176
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,230
More coming.

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,193
Patient was hit in the head
by a glass bottle.

178
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,761
- She sustained...
- She is a they.

179
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:45,691
Okay, I'm gonna need
transport for a CT scan, stat.

180
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,539
Brunstetter, Brunstetter,
over here.

181
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,369
Bay 23. Alert ortho.

182
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:54,176
Keith James, 43-year-old man
with chemical burns.

183
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,091
Induced dyspnea
due to pepper spray.

184
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,226
I tried to shield him.
Doug's asthmatic.

185
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,043
- It was so fast.
- You did great, Keith, okay?

186
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,871
We're gonna take
good care of him and you.

187
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,539
34-year-old female,
fractured wrist,

188
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,831
extensive lacerations from
glass shards in the field.

189
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,083
They just came out of nowhere.

190
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,202
We got you.

191
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:10,420
They just started attacking us.

192
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:11,509
Why?

193
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:12,946
Why were we attacked, everybody?

194
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,643
- Sex worker rights now.
- Yeah.

195
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,078
Our bodies, our business,
our choice.

196
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:20,079
- Sex work is...
- Work!

197
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,741
Sex work is work. Sex work...

198
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,360
It's not even 10 a.m. yet.

199
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,190
- Max.
- Hey.

200
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,106
Hey.

201
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,591
- And then you say...
- Yeah, sorry.

202
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,080
- How can I help?
- There he is. There it is.

203
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,479
- A little rusty.
- Yeah, that's cool.

204
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,143
You'll get there.
So, hey, listen,

205
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,071
I missed the first day
of drop-offs today

206
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,247
because me and Martin have
the new nesting schedule.

207
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,980
I'm jonesing for
some cute kid stories.

208
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,766
You got a cute kid.

209
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,434
Luna, tell me about her.
Was she nervous?

210
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:49,568
Was there extra hugs?
Were there tears?

211
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,136
- Just mine.
- Oh.

212
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,965
Well, that's okay.
It happens to the best of us.

213
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,880
You know, with Raffi,
I was a blubbering mess.

214
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:57,681
Well, Luna asked
why Helen wasn't there.

215
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:01,316
Oof.
That is not a cute kid story.

216
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:02,478
Not really. No.

217
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,023
More of a tragic Dickensian one.

218
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,259
- Yeah.
- You think I could get

219
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,563
some kind of bulk discount

220
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,622
if I buy years of therapy
in advance for Luna?

221
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,505
I mean, yes, big discount,
but also,

222
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,422
maybe ease up on yourself
a little bit.

223
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:15,355
You're doing great work in
the face of massive pain, Max.

224
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,818
Thanks for the reminder.

225
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:18,473
Look, Luna feels loved, right?

226
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,475
She feels free to ask big,
hard questions.

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,000
You're doing great work
here at the hospital.

228
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,392
- You're moving on.
- I'm-I'm not.

229
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:27,424
I'm not.

230
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:32,013
I mean, I can't really move on
until I understand why

231
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,888
Helen did what she did,
and she doesn't even know.

232
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,728
And when I look back
on the relationship,

233
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,599
when I think about Helen...

234
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,801
I just see love.

235
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:48,740
Yeah, I know.

236
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,068
Okay, look, since you're about
to buy therapy in bulk,

237
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:55,365
I'm gonna drop a freebee on you.

238
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,130
If your memories aren't
giving you the answers

239
00:11:58,222 --> 00:11:59,568
you're looking for,

240
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,656
maybe you're remembering
the wrong ones.

241
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,817
<i>Is this even real?</i>

242
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:19,130
I've thought about nothing...
but you.

243
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,974
And this

244
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,654
for so long.

245
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,919
Thought it, but...

246
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,052
I didn't know how to say it

247
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,107
or maybe was afraid to.

248
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,455
But now...

249
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,693
I feel like
I have a future again

250
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,763
with you.

251
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:48,560
Just like this.

252
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:55,155
I should never have let you in.

253
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,427
Max.

254
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,955
Max!

255
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,388
I've got fantastic news.

256
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:09,652
We've just been gifted
$10 million

257
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,521
to fund a new clinic.
No strings attached.

258
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,303
- No strings?
- Maybe like a thread.

259
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,076
- Oh, a thread.
- A silk thread.

260
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,410
- Invisible to the human eye.
- Which is?

261
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,279
The corporation just wants
their name on the clinic.

262
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,108
- That's it?
- Yes.

263
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,632
- That's easy.
- Right?

264
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:26,808
What's the corporation?

265
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,638
A company called...

266
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,501
What's that?

267
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:34,026
- Wholesome Home Goods.
- Wholesome Home Goods.

268
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,747
As in the company whose
cleaning products I don't buy

269
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,880
because they lobby for
abstinence-only education

270
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,275
and try to defund
Planned Parenthood

271
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,582
and promote conversion therapy?
That Wholesome?

272
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:46,218
What's also true is
they make great sponges.

273
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,300
Karen, Wholesome's lobbying
efforts hurt the very patients

274
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,171
in this hospital,
and when people come here

275
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,919
with a ruptured uterus
or they're suicidal because

276
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,575
they're being bullied
for their sexuality

277
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,924
or any other of
the direct consequences

278
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,311
of their agenda,
sponges aren't gonna help.

279
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:02,663
They're not going to use
our good reputation

280
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,591
to launder their bad name.

281
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:06,914
You can swallow this poison pill

282
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,711
and help thousands of people

283
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:11,091
or stay on your high horse
and help no one.

284
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:13,200
One question for you.

285
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,779
What would Veronica have done?

286
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,466
She would've taken the money.

287
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:21,708
She would have.

288
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,630
All right, so take a seat.

289
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:29,592
I'm, uh, Dr. Frome,
as you already know.

290
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,858
Alex, what do you say?

291
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,615
You're meeting someone new.
Alex, what do you say?

292
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,662
It's, uh, nice to meet you,
Dr. Frome.

293
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,309
I'm Alex and
how's your day going so far?

294
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:44,958
Good. Thank you. Yeah.
Real good. How about you?

295
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:50,466
Uh, not very good because
my doctor, Dr. Lloyd, died.

296
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:55,236
He died on September 1, 2022.

297
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,271
Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.

298
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,432
I-I'm sorry.

299
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,391
You were a patient of his
for a long time.

300
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,233
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,552
Ever since he was diagnosed
with autism at seven.

302
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,857
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,685
Dr. Lloyd was
a special therapist.

304
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,396
You bet ya,

305
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,171
so we need somebody special
to replace him.

306
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:17,738
Now Alex has been
regressing a little bit

307
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:20,388
since, uh, Dr. Lloyd died.

308
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:23,220
He's been having trouble
self-regulating

309
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,051
and he's gotten a little bit, uh,

310
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,619
physically aggressive with me.

311
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,849
- Okay.
- So...

312
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:36,999
And that hasn't happened in
20 years, so we need your help.

313
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,313
Okay.

314
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,489
But you will not
be doing this alone.

315
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,677
- Yeah.
- He's been working

316
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,243
with this team
for the last 20 years.

317
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,764
Occupational therapist,
speech therapist,

318
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:48,927
the whole nine yards.

319
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:53,499
And these people are totally,
totally committed to his care.

320
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,632
I mean...

321
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:56,939
Half the names on this list

322
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,680
wrote the books
on that shelf right there.

323
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,200
- No kidding.
- This is the dream team.

324
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,863
Yup.

325
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:05,841
So will you take us on?

326
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,930
Hmm.

327
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:12,661
- Um...
- Al.

328
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,014
Oh, that's okay. That's okay.
Uh, yeah, I will.

329
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:18,754
- Oh!
- I will. Yeah.

330
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,148
Good.

331
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,271
- On, uh, on one condition.
- What's that?

332
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,575
I, uh, I want you to replace
every name on this list.

333
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:36,146
Hey, can I sleep
with you tonight?

334
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,552
On your couch.

335
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:41,172
Only slightly less disturbing.

336
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,728
I mean, I would prefer
the bed because of my sciatica,

337
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,688
but I'll take the couch
'cause I snore.

338
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,075
- I'm... I just...
- You have no right!

339
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,859
- No right!
- Keep your voice down.

340
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,677
Keep my voice down.
Are you serious?

341
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:55,122
Hey, hey, what's going on?

342
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,966
What's going on is this doctor

343
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,029
ran an HIV test
without my consent.

344
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:00,859
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

345
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,426
There's a bunch
of consent forms...

346
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:05,654
Exactly and I never signed
anything and he never asked.

347
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,543
Dr. Huxley, is this true?

348
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,787
I thought she'd want to know.

349
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,149
I thought I was helping.

350
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,847
This is exactly
why we were marching today

351
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,389
because you people
who should know better

352
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,166
keep putting your own morals,

353
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,802
your own judgments onto my body.

354
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,745
Well, is Brady going to India?

355
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,010
No, he's not.
I can't clear him for travel.

356
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,533
Why not?

357
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,622
Are you saying you would
send a child with lymphoma

358
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:45,886
jet-setting across the world
to a country teeming

359
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,372
with unfamiliar pathogens?

360
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,630
Yes, I would've cleared him.

361
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:52,079
Okay, what if I said yes?

362
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,615
How would you even get him
on a Bollywood movie set?

363
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,693
Do you know
any Bollywood directors?

364
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:59,250
I would've found a way.

365
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:02,556
I'm sure you would've,
but the answer's still no.

366
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,872
Well, then you have to tell him.

367
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,609
Hey, listen,
there's all sorts of cool stuff

368
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,990
you can do around the city.
How about Yankees tickets?

369
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:20,288
Yeah, I guess
that could be good.

370
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,919
Can I ask you something?

371
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:26,607
Why Bollywood?

372
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,685
It's what I watched
during chemo,

373
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,388
and there was a lotta chemo.

374
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:31,521
Mm-hmm.

375
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:33,796
- Always a fan?
- No.

376
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,075
But Mr. Bhaskar,
he was in chemo too.

377
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,067
Same schedule.

378
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,724
He used to watch
these movies on his iPad...

379
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:46,333
and this one day he saw me
watching over his shoulder.

380
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,724
And I thought he'd get really
mad because he's super grumpy,

381
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:53,091
but instead,
he turned the subtitles on

382
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,325
and we watched together.

383
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,982
And after that, we always
watched Bollywood together.

384
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,263
Oh, I don't think I've ever
seen a Bollywood movie.

385
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,091
Well, you have to.

386
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,921
It has fighting and dancing.

387
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,341
And the hero always wins,

388
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,693
and the right thing
always happens in the end.

389
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:12,217
And whenever I watch them,

390
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:15,508
at least for a few hours,
I forget I'm sick.

391
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,615
My parents don't have that.

392
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:22,982
Nothing makes them forget,

393
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,591
so being in
my own Bollywood musical

394
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,029
would be big enough
to make us all forget

395
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,357
for a little while at least.

396
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:39,434
I don't care what it takes,

397
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,214
we're getting that kid to India.

398
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,304
Max, I don't know
how to tell you this.

399
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,583
I don't want to get married
in a castle.

400
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,110
I don't know
if I want any of it.

401
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:15,990
There you are.

402
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:18,591
Uh, the answer is
still no, no, and no.

403
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,799
Unless the board took a vote,
and now the answer is yes,

404
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,187
- which is what happened.
- What?

405
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:23,552
I'm protecting you
from yourself, Max.

406
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,598
I'm protecting this hospital
from your hasty decisions.

407
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:28,383
The kind of decisions that

408
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:30,123
made me hire Veronica Fuentes
in the first place.

409
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,741
You mean moral decisions?

410
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,093
Max, I love your morals.

411
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,133
I'm on a first-name basis
with them at this point.

412
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:38,226
And I'm not gonna defend
the Wholesome brand,

413
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,601
but I am gonna defend

414
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:42,179
this hospital's ability
to provide healthcare.

415
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,485
Right, but let me
just ask you this.

416
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,616
How would you feel if
you walked into a clinic

417
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,038
with the name Wholesome on it

418
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,062
if you were gay
or you needed an abortion?

419
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,491
How much faith would you have

420
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:52,668
in our ability to act
in your best interest?

421
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,530
That's why
I'm chair of the board

422
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:55,919
and you're the medical director.

423
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,485
Figure it out, because
we're taking the money.

424
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:03,766
- Dr. Frome.
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,549
All due respect,

426
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,909
everyone on this list

427
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:10,964
has helped make my son
who he is today.

428
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,035
Well, yeah.
Yeah, everyone on this list

429
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,039
helped guide Alex
when he was a child,

430
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,214
but he's an adult now.

431
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,997
He needs someone
to guide him as an adult.

432
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:20,565
Do you know how many schools
he's been kicked out of?

433
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:23,395
How many misdiagnosed,
mis-guided treatments,

434
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,311
how many mind-altering
medications

435
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:27,746
he's had to suffer through?

436
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,791
I can imagine the difficulty.

437
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,532
But that's all you can do.

438
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,221
All right.

439
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,830
Dr. Phife, legend,
but I guarantee you,

440
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,502
he's using the exact same interventions

441
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,626
he used 40 years ago.

442
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,759
And Dr. Scarborough,
I mean, very impressive,

443
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,022
but he doesn't even
have a practice anymore.

444
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:44,806
Okay, wait.
Scarborough loves Alex.

445
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,460
He has committed
to his treatment

446
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,330
long after he retires
from Columbia.

447
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:49,768
You want stability
for Alex, you do.

448
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:50,987
I understand that.
Of course you do.

449
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,424
- But what happens when...
- Shut up.

450
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,078
The next therapist
on this list retires or dies?

451
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,080
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Okay, Alex...

452
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:57,733
Shut up. Shut up!

453
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,730
- Shut up!
- Don't!

454
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:08,211
Shut up. Shut up.

455
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,267
Shut up.

456
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,097
Shut up...

457
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:17,880
<i>Dr. Ching, call Recovery.
Dr. Ching, call Recovery.</i>

458
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,757
I'm sorry. The tests were run
before I could cancel them.

459
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,193
But here are the results.

460
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,850
I can't take these.

461
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:29,809
Rhoda, Rhoda, please.

462
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:31,985
Please don't let
our failure here today

463
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,292
negatively impact your health.

464
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,902
I marched today in public
for the first time in my life.

465
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,905
Do you know how hard that was?

466
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,428
To walk down 5th Avenue
announcing to the world

467
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:44,128
that this is who I am,
this is what I do for a living.

468
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,522
Knowing how the world
feels about what I do.

469
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:49,568
If I take these results
for a test

470
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,178
that you performed
without my consent,

471
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:54,790
I might as well
not have marched at all.

472
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,050
You're absolutely right.

473
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:04,148
Just so I'm clear, you want
to put a seriously ill,

474
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:08,064
immunocompromised child
on a 14-hour flight to India

475
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,893
to appear in
a Bollywood musical.

476
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,113
Well, actually
it's a 17-hour flight.

477
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:15,158
Even better.

478
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:16,420
Well, this particular musical...

479
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,379
- "Khilata Hua Guaab."
- Oh.

480
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,380
And it shoots in Mumbai.

481
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,687
Which is naturally where
all the good ones shoot.

482
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:27,344
- Naturally.
- So... you're in?

483
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:29,389
Oh, I was in as soon as
you said you had a crazy idea

484
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,088
that no one else would approve.

485
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:32,958
Hey, so Brady's going to India.

486
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,658
Unfortunately, I am not
the one you need to convince.

487
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:39,095
There's no way
I'm approving any part

488
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,314
of this dangerous
and insane request.

489
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:42,360
- If you'll just...
- No.

490
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:44,230
- Maybe you should...
- No.

491
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:45,884
Then you're gonna have
to be the one

492
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,279
to tell a child
he can't have his dying wish.

493
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:51,150
I am the CEO of
a billion dollar company.

494
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:53,239
I'm used to being
bearer of bad news.

495
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:54,806
What room is he in?

496
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,767
Imagine every plot of
every movie you've ever watched

497
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:02,684
crammed into one single movie,

498
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,295
and that's a Bollywood musical.

499
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,080
The hero finds the girl,

500
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,213
he rebels against his parents,

501
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:12,345
he makes a shady business deal
that he thinks is legitimate

502
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,199
but results in a police chase
through the city.

503
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:18,262
There's a wedding,

504
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,582
a promise of children,

505
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:24,261
and everyone is reunited.

506
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,347
If I was in
my own Bollywood musical

507
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:31,843
for just one day,

508
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:34,128
I could live an entire life.

509
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,963
When does this musical
start shooting?

510
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:41,097
- In two days.
- Well, we got to move fast.

511
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,767
Mumbai's almost ten hours
ahead of New York,

512
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:44,247
so I need to tell
my private jet service

513
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:46,293
- to find me a pilot immediately.
- Thank you, Karen.

514
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,120
There's no time
for self-congratulations.

515
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,254
We have to get Brady to India.

516
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,126
Crash cart.

517
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,949
I got it.

518
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:00,882
- BP's dropping.
- He's crashing.

519
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,795
We got to get him
to OR one, now.

520
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,441
<i>I just stopped talking.</i>

521
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,876
<i>You want answers?</i>

522
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:13,055
Just... just...

523
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:15,449
Listen. Max, I need you

524
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:18,233
to stay out of my family.

525
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,888
<i>I guess I thought
that we were a family.</i>

526
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:23,065
'Cause I don't know what I want.

527
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,675
I'm so...

528
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,486
<i>Sorry. Sorry...</i>

529
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,793
- Max, watch out.
- Sorry, sorry.

530
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,246
It's okay.

531
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,292
I'm a little
stuck in my head today.

532
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,417
Well, that's funny,
'cause I wished my staff

533
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,941
used their heads more today.

534
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:41,387
I had a patient population
of sex workers,

535
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,214
and it completely threw
the entire ED.

536
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:45,173
- Mm.
- Rookie mistakes,

537
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:47,567
offensive jokes, microaggressions,

538
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,700
aggressive aggressions.

539
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,528
You know, I would be shocked
if any of them ever came back

540
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,703
here ever again and this is
New Amsterdam, you know?

541
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:56,228
Can you imagine how they get
treated anywhere else?

542
00:25:56,312 --> 00:25:58,575
I might be able to help.

543
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:02,538
How?

544
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:06,017
Where do you buy your sponges?

545
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,807
As soon as he finishes
that game, we'll be gone.

546
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,982
I think you'd be
making a big mistake.

547
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,463
Hmm.

548
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:16,944
That outburst you just saw,

549
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,338
that's how he responds
to all change.

550
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:23,125
I'm talking about
the smallest thing.

551
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:26,780
I mean, a bruise on a banana.

552
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:28,521
Mm-hmm.

553
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,523
And you are asking him

554
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:34,179
to change everything
all at once.

555
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:37,225
No.

556
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:41,838
When the next person retires
or passes away,

557
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,798
that's when I'll replace them.

558
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:46,667
Well, what if
that person is you?

559
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:55,156
There are people in place.

560
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,376
People from the list?

561
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,593
Yeah.

562
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:06,037
The regressions
that you're talking about,

563
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,386
the setbacks,

564
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,693
let Alex have them...
Let him have them

565
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:13,564
while you're still here
to help him through.

566
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,571
He didn't talk
until he was eight.

567
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,575
Until then he would
bite himself,

568
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,881
he would hit himself,
he would scream,

569
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:27,450
he would thrash
around on the floor.

570
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:30,671
Now, he goes to a job.
He's got friends.

571
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,891
He's got a weekly poker game,

572
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,948
and-and we talk.

573
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,385
All the time, we talk.

574
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:43,161
I finally have my son,

575
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,364
and you want me
to give all of that up.

576
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,038
Yeah, I do.

577
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,776
All I want...

578
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,557
with the time I have left

579
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:10,188
I just spend that time
loving him

580
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,625
and him loving me.

581
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:17,500
I know, I know...

582
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:19,936
but, Grace, I-I'm only
asking you to do

583
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,635
what I ask of all my parents.

584
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:25,160
I am asking you
to sacrifice your comfort,

585
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:28,908
your happiness to ensure that
Alex thrives without you.

586
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,051
And that sucks.

587
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:34,404
It is the cruelest part
of being a parent,

588
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:38,095
but you need to
struggle now with Alex,

589
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:41,822
so Alex doesn't struggle
when you're gone.

590
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:45,040
Ooh.

591
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:02,153
Clamp.

592
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:04,112
Needle driver with 3-0 VICRYL.

593
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,470
- Richardson.
- We got a bleeder in there.

594
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:09,155
Got it.

595
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,844
Looks like that's the last one.

596
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,891
- Field is drying up nicely.
- Wait, wait, wait.

597
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,692
That's a size able tumor.

598
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:27,830
It's encasing the aorta.

599
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:30,887
- Can you resect it?
- Can you?

600
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:45,168
The cancer has spread
throughout Brady's body.

601
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,794
There's nothing more we can do.

602
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,071
We are so sorry.

603
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,211
There's no chance
he can travel now.

604
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,785
I don't think
anyone's wishes are coming true today.

605
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,120
Hey, Alex.

606
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,034
Um...

607
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,130
do you think maybe we could
pause the game for a sec?

608
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,338
Where's my mom?

609
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:32,820
She's right out there.
She's sitting right outside,

610
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:34,692
but she wanted us
to have a chat.

611
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:36,303
I don't want you
to be my therapist.

612
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:38,481
I want Dr. Lloyd
to be my therapist.

613
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,401
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

614
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:42,501
I get it, and I bet
you're having some

615
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:45,938
pretty intense feelings
around Dr. Lloyd right now.

616
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,843
So why don't we pause the game

617
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:49,278
and we can just chat about them?

618
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:51,628
Dr. Lloyd lets me play games
when we talk.

619
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,202
Yeah, we'll do that
sometimes too.

620
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,819
I love games, but right now,

621
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,817
maybe I can really
use your focus.

622
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:59,225
Mom.

623
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,811
- Alex, just stick with me.
- Mom!

624
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:03,429
Okay, so you're having a big
feeling... big feeling right now.

625
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,421
Right? So why don't we try
to identify it?

626
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:09,440
- Is it anger?
- Um...

627
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:12,944
- no.
- Is it sad?

628
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:16,108
- No.
- Is it scared?

629
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,804
- Yes. I-I'm scared.
- Scared. Okay.

630
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,035
Why don't you try
to give it a number?

631
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,171
All right?
One is totally not scared.

632
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,319
Five is, like, really scared.

633
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,936
- Number four.
- Four. Okay.

634
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,636
That's... yeah,
that's pretty scared,

635
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,856
but at least
it's not a number five.

636
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:35,554
Yeah, you know
this technique, right?

637
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,645
From Dr. Lloyd.

638
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,960
That's where I learned it too.

639
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:40,982
You know, you and I
can use this technique.

640
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,809
Yeah, Dr. Lloyd's techniques
help me identify my feelings.

641
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:47,116
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

642
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:48,684
Between you and me,

643
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:52,124
Dr. Lloyd does not deserve
all the credit there.

644
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:54,192
Or Dr. Hedlund or Dr. Alger.

645
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:56,282
Honestly, any of the doctors
you worked with.

646
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:58,668
You know who deserves
the real credit?

647
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,887
You.

648
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:02,942
You made all the progress,

649
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:06,231
and so any doctor you work with
whether they're new, old,

650
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,387
they all have one thing
in common.

651
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,590
You.

652
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:15,030
All right? Now, I'm just...
I'm here to help.

653
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:18,433
If you want it, you got it,
but the choice is yours.

654
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:19,910
Always.

655
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:26,965
Okay. Okay. Cool.

656
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,149
Family values are at the core
of everything we do,

657
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,541
and we're proud New Amsterdam

658
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,021
is part of the Wholesome family.

659
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,544
We couldn't be happier, Patrick.

660
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,373
You've got quite
the reputation, Dr. Goodwin.

661
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:48,246
People say you're something
of a social justice warrior

662
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,118
and that you'd never accept
our gracious offer.

663
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,554
Well, I try not to let
my personal opinions

664
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,470
stand in the way of my
patient's access to healthcare.

665
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:56,689
I appreciate that,

666
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:59,170
but we're not so different,
Dr. Goodwin.

667
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,521
You've got your patients,
I've got my customers.

668
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,524
We both have strong brands,
but if we're to expand,

669
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,569
we have to dip our toes
into each other's water.

670
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:07,919
I couldn't agree more.

671
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,920
And with a little paint
and some staff training,

672
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,269
we'll get this up
and running in no time.

673
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:13,575
But I did make sure
that the sign was ready

674
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,536
for your arrival, so...

675
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,361
what do you think?

676
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,980
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No. Why?

677
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:28,286
Would you like your name bigger?

678
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,986
I would like our name
taken off right now.

679
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,772
- Hmm. Can we do that?
- No, we can't, Max.

680
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:37,252
I told you Wholesome's name
is the one nonnegotiable.

681
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:40,995
Hmm. Yeah, sorry.
I did try. Believe me.

682
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,129
So you're trying to shame us

683
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:45,912
because you dislike our values.

684
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:47,087
Actually, the opposite.

685
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,611
We're trying to alleviate shame.

686
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,788
See, you picked this hospital
because you wanted

687
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,442
to legitimize your brand in the
eyes of those who aren't buying

688
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,794
what you're selling
literally and figuratively.

689
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:59,779
But sex workers are also
looking for legitimacy,

690
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,420
not just in what they do, but
in how they're treated for it.

691
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:05,248
And our job is to remove
the barriers between

692
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:08,688
them and good healthcare,
so while we are legitimizing

693
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:11,603
your brand, you are
legitimizing their profession.

694
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:14,257
It's a win-win and, um...

695
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:17,348
probably the most wholesome
thing you've ever done.

696
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,337
The Wholesome
Sex Workers Clinic.

697
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,469
- You heard about that, huh?
- Did I hear about it?

698
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:54,560
The WSWC?

699
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,299
It's all anybody's
talking about, man.

700
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,955
It's quintessential
Max-ism, right?

701
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,478
Systemic change to help
vulnerable patients

702
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:04,047
with a nice, fat dallop
of poetic justice right on top.

703
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,657
Yeah, doubters can go home.

704
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:08,790
There is nothing that
Max Goodwin can't fix.

705
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,315
Except for one thing.

706
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,012
Right.

707
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:16,726
I just keep thinking about
these moments with Helen

708
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,975
that I just kind of
brushed aside.

709
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:22,607
You know, the ones that
we never really... figured out.

710
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:26,766
You know, if your feelings
for her change,

711
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,811
that's okay.

712
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:30,941
It's not that. I-I...

713
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,686
I still love her.

714
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,949
Ah.

715
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:39,359
You know, there was, like...

716
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,404
It was the best.

717
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:54,093
And there were just
so many good moments.

718
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:01,928
It made the bad moments
feel like nothing.

719
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,459
But I guess for Helen,

720
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,021
they might've been everything.

721
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,115
You know, she was
dealing with a lot.

722
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,421
The truth about her family,
who she was,

723
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:19,208
who she wanted to be.

724
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,342
Maybe she needed
to deal with that alone.

725
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:23,866
- She did.
- Yeah.

726
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,217
I know she did
'cause she told me,

727
00:36:28,345 --> 00:36:30,435
but I just tried to fix it.

728
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:40,493
'Cause I wanted to fix it.

729
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:43,886
Well, the truth of the matter is

730
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,607
there are some problems that
aren't yours to repair.

731
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:54,456
So what do I do now?

732
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:03,645
Hey, listen, my man,

733
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:06,603
I'm sorry we couldn't
get you to India,

734
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:09,911
but we got you
a little something

735
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:12,061
to remind you of Bollywood.

736
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:15,545
Oh. Cool.

737
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:21,923
Oh, wow. Baby, you're gonna
look like Shah Rukh Khan.

738
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,404
Thanks, Dr. Reynolds.

739
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:24,926
You got it.

740
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,686
That was weird.

741
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:35,154
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

742
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:38,505
- You're just in time.
- For what?

743
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,029
We told you that
we couldn't take you to India

744
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:44,576
to star in a Bollywood musical, so...

745
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:48,516
we brought
the Bollywood musical to you.

746
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,561

752
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:40,610
So what do you think about me
sleeping in the spare room?

753
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,523
Um,

754
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:45,898
yes, of course,

755
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,835
but I should tell you something.

756
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,453
Who is it?

757
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:53,066
