1
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,334
Okay, I know, I know.

2
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:33,729
I know--come here, come here.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

3
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:35,383
You're okay.

4
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,690
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

5
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:58,101
- Look, the air
quality's terrible.

6
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,668
My guess is allergies.

7
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,713
When you hear hoofbeats,
think horses,

8
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,759
not zebras, okay?

9
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,153
Our treatment's been working,
your tumor's been responding.

10
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,329
Let's not panic just yet.

11
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,577
- Felt like the city was...

12
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,145
screaming in my face all night.

13
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:48,195
Well, that means you definitely
should stay right here in bed.

14
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:59,728
Is everything all right?

15
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,123
- I'm just tired.

16
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,429
Give me a few minutes,
and I'll be right.

17
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,405
- Hey, you.

18
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,624
- Ah, so this is where
the party's at.

19
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,758
- Uh, yeah, I do feel good.

20
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,629
- Thanks to the 12-straight
hours of morphine

21
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,805
Dr. Handler has been pumping
into your system.

22
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,591
- Okay, whatever. I mean,
like I even need morphine.

23
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,334
With my tolerance,
I'm not even high right now.

24
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,205
- Well, I must say,
for a woman that just

25
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,642
went through major
reconstructive leg surgery,

26
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:47,558
you look absolutely ravishing.

27
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,518
- Really?

28
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:51,649
- No.

29
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,824
And if you believe that,

30
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,175
then you're
most assuredly high.

31
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,527
Party's over.

32
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,709
- Martha Randle, collapsed
in her cell at Rikers.

33
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,841
She's G3P4 with
a history of fibroids

34
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,582
producing heavy menstrual flow.

35
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,845
Hypotensive,
tachycardic, and febrile.

36
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,934
Also complaining
of numbness in her leg.

37
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,632
- Can you please tell me
where is the numbness?

38
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,416
- Up and down my right leg.

39
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,939
- Okay.

40
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,856
Can you please lift
your leg for me?

41
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,558
- Wait.

42
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,647
What's wrong with me?

43
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,214
I can't move my leg.

44
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,998
I can't move my leg.

45
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,869
- Dr. Proctor, this is Martha.

46
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,523
- Martha, I'm an OB/GYN.

47
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,395
We're going to get
you sorted out, okay?

48
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,874
I need to order blood
and urine cultures.

49
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,789
- I think you'll
find Staph aureus.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,269
- Toxic shock?

51
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,531
- Martha,
have you been using tampons

52
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,924
for longer than recommended?

53
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,014
- I used my last one...

54
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,581
for nine...

55
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,409
- Nine hours shouldn't
cause this much damage.

56
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,715
- She means nine days.

57
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,892
Alert me the moment
the MRI is ready.

58
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,764
- Nine days?
How did you know?

59
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,940
- Martha is not my
first patient from Rikers

60
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,333
with toxic shock.

61
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,639
How many more
before someone dies?

62
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,686
- Where are we going?
- To find Max.

63
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,253
- Mm.

64
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,255
- Max, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

65
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,039
- Well, it's a very busy day,
then I heard you were

66
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,997
running my best doctor out
of town, so I made some time.

67
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,695
- Honestly, Max,
I can handle it.

68
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,262
- Yeah, I know you can,
but you shouldn't have to

69
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,567
because you did nothing wrong.

70
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:26,396
- She was arrested
in a heroin den.

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,963
- Safe injection sites
aren't flop houses.

72
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,313
They're the future.
And for helping her patient,

73
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,749
who most doctors would
have let die in the street,

74
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,708
you want to reprimand
the most accomplished,

75
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,579
most selfless,
not to mention coolest

76
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,928
doctor in this hospital?

77
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,931
- She broke the law.
She got caught.

78
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:43,283
You'll have our disciplinary
action by end of day.

79
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,765
- Imagine if you
hadn't have turned up.

80
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,027
That might've gone poorly.

81
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,334
Why didn't you tell me?

82
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,944
I didn't hear any
of this until I--

83
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,424
- I didn't want to burden you.

84
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,601
Burden me.

85
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,516
- Please, always.

86
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,868
- Max...

87
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:06,436
we need to talk about Rikers.

88
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,613
Martha Randle is in Rikers
for marijuana possession,

89
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,963
and now she may not live
to see the end of her sentence.

90
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,705
- It's not just tampons.
I've had a dozen patients

91
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,925
tell me that pap smears and
mammograms are being withheld

92
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,753
as punishment,
and now they have cancer.

93
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,494
- So much of this
is preventable.

94
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,365
One routine visit at Rikers,

95
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,759
and most of my inmate
patients wouldn't even be here.

96
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,718
- Hey, guys, I got the 911.
What's going on?

97
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,025
- Uh, Rikers.
- Rikers again?

98
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,809
Man, that place
is a mental-health catastrophe.

99
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,376
My patients go in for a month,

100
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,812
they come out
with a lifetime of trauma.

101
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,031
- Hey, anybody else thinking
what I'm thinking?

102
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,641
- That basic preventative care

103
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:38,860
would cut the rate
of illness in half there?

104
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,383
- That's not what
he's thinking.

105
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,993
- No?
How many more guesses do I get?

106
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,474
- Casey, grab me
ten exam table rolls,

107
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,476
ten boxes of paper
patient gowns, and all

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,522
the female hygiene products
you can fit in the van.

109
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,698
- The van?
- Yeah, also get a van.

110
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,613
- Oh, that's what
he was thinking.

111
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,832
- Wait, you're not
serious, are you?

112
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,660
- Whatever you're in jail
for doesn't mean you deserve

113
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,488
to die because you
couldn't get a checkup.

114
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,011
These women are our patients.

115
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,492
They need our help, and we're
gonna give it to them,

116
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,842
so we are going to Rikers.

- Sir, New Amsterdam
doctors are here.

136
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,623
- Warden Hughes,
I'm Dr. Goodwin.

137
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,363
Thanks for having us.

138
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,453
We're very excited
to get our clinic under way.

139
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,542
The mayor said that
you could show us around?

140
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,500
- Did he?
- Let's go, ladies!

141
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,285
- Well, this is
the dining hall.

142
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,114
Upstairs is the rec room.

143
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,508
Through there
are the cell blocks,

144
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,554
and that concludes our tour.

145
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,860
- Thanks for your hospitality.

146
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,776
- Look, I tried to stop this
fiasco every step of the way,

147
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,126
but seeing as the mayor
answers your calls

148
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,128
and not mine, follow me.

149
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,741
- Play nice.

150
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,656
- Warden, I get that you
don't appreciate me

151
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,484
going over your head
to the mayor, but our goal

152
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,616
is not to embarrass you
or to get in your way.

153
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,531
- You're 0 for 2 there, Doc.

154
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,490
- We just want
to provide basic checkups.

155
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,535
A one-day clinic to treat
your female inmate population.

156
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,319
- For everyone?
- That's right.

157
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,930
All 600 of the women
incarcerated here.

158
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,671
- With zero prep time
and no additional COs--

159
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,499
hell of a plan.

160
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,457
- I imagine Martha Randle
would say that any plan

161
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,763
is better than
what you have now,

162
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,895
or she wouldn't
be in our hospital.

163
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,594
- If you'd like to donate a box
of tampons, we'll take them.

164
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,510
Beyond that,
if inmate Randle felt sick,

165
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,294
she should've gone
to Sick Call.

166
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,427
- She did, and they said that
she didn't seem sick.

167
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,256
This was a full day before she
collapsed from a massive stroke

168
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,433
caused by poison, so I can see
how she'd seem fine.

169
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,915
- What happened
to playing nice?

170
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,700
- I said you play nice.

171
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,571
- Oh, good cop, bad cop.
I love it.

172
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:49,964
Very appropriate.

173
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,357
- Liars, liars!
You're all liars!

174
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,841
Oh, that's right!
Oh, that's right!

175
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,669
I'm crazy, huh?
- That's enough!

176
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:03,325
- Get off of me!
- This is the examination room.

177
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,851
Your attention.

178
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,810
The New Amsterdam doctors

179
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,247
are here to tell you
how to do your job.

180
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,773
- Sorry, this is it?

181
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,819
Um...where do you provide

182
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,777
pap smears or procedures
that require undressing?

183
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,474
- Right here.

184
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,694
- What about mental health?
You--you do that here?

185
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,435
- Everything, right here.

186
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:29,569
- But no one is going to ask
for care without privacy.

187
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,961
This is what's
causing your problem.

188
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,573
- Our problem is
a health-care budget

189
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,358
of about
$5 per inmate per day.

190
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,752
We had a heroin overdose
this morning, and that's half

191
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:42,233
of today's cash gone--
it's not even lunchtime yet.

192
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,366
We're doing the best
we can with what we have.

193
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,281
Now, I'm a results guy.

194
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:49,501
If you can improve things, I'll
be the first to say thanks.

195
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,416
And if you can't,

196
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,636
I'll be the first to tell
the Mayor all about it.

197
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,340
- Suspected heroin OD
from Rikers.

198
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,733
Severe pulmonary distress.

199
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,605
- Did you push Narcan?
- Two amps, no response.

200
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,737
- She might be having
pulmonary edema.

201
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,522
Renal function?
- Creatinine is 1.8 and rising.

202
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,698
- What's that mean?

203
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,613
- Push 60 mg IV Lasix.

204
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,267
Set up an intubation tray
and a stat cardiac echo.

205
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,488
It means she's in trouble.

206
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,325
- Just breathe.

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,503
I want a pill.

208
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,809
- I bet you do.

209
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,506
- No, I am serious, Zach.

210
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,030
- You asked me
to monitor your hydrocodone--

211
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,467
a job I happen
to take seriously.

212
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,295
So here's the deal.

213
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,950
Over the next 24 hours,
you're allowed four pills,

214
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:51,346
so this
has to last you six hours.

215
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,609
What I recommend
is that you wait...

216
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,350
you take this in one hour.

217
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,961
- Can I take, like,
half now and then half later?

218
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,702
- If you want
to sacrifice pain management

219
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,879
in the name of a quick
and dirty fix, go nuts.

220
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,099
But for maximum pain relief,

221
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,927
wait one hour.

222
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,893
Fine.

223
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,722
- Brilliant.
See you in 60.

224
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,942
Lucky me.

225
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,780
- Martha, count backwards
from five, please.

226
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,607
- Five...

227
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,828
four, three...

228
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:41,004
- Very good.

229
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,832
I'm going to ask some
questions and your answers

230
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,747
will let me observe
your brain function.

231
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,488
Do you have children?

232
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,446
- Yes.

233
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,057
- Very good.

234
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,407
Now, if you could
share a memory.

235
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,714
Any happy one will do.

236
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,021
- My son's fourth birthday...

237
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,807
we went to this play center.

238
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,723
Ball pits, arcades...

239
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:08,075
Man, he loved it.

240
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,819
There was this--this room

241
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:16,083
full of trampolines,
wall to wall.

242
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:21,175
And Darrell charged in like
a lunatic, doing flips,

243
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,744
making faces.

244
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:30,053
And his smile was just...

245
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,892
- Do they visit?

246
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,810
- Some people at Rikers,
if they know you got kids

247
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,421
and they want
something from you...

248
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,906
It's better that
they don't come.

249
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,695
Did you find what you needed?

250
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,658
- Martha, it appears
you have a marantic embolism.

251
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,139
The bacteria
from our vaginal infection

252
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,097
has traveled to your brain.

253
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,621
We need to remove
the clot surgically.

254
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,719
- Um, hi.

255
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,765
A moment of your
attention, everybody.

256
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,160
- Everybody, listen up.

257
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,857
- Uh, yeah, hi, guys.

258
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,164
My name is Dr. Frome,
I'm from New Amsterdam.

259
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,644
And I noticed that
your exam room here

260
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,255
is a little on the small side,

261
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,084
so I'm setting up shop
in the consult room to discuss

262
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,261
really anything
that's on your minds.

263
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,871
Free of charge.
- Yo, we got

264
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,091
this old Humpty Dumpty-looking
fool up in here.

265
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,660
Yo, Dopey, where the rest
of the seven dwarves at?

266
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,706
- That's good.
- Show some respect, inmate.

267
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,665
- That's okay, I can handle it.
I've been to middle school.

268
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,234
- Ooh, Doc got jokes.

269
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,151
- What'd I say, Pearl?
Keep talking, it's a write-up.

270
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,025
- May I?

271
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,678
Hi.

272
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,159
It's Pearl, right?
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,726
- Is it always like
that between you two,

274
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,249
or you just putting
on a little show for me?

275
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,861
- That's how CO Sanchez is.

276
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,950
Want to know why there
ain't no trees on Rikers?

277
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,734
- I don't know, do I?

278
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,997
- Sanchez needed 'em all
for the big stick up...

279
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,781
Wait, you writing me up?

280
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,174
- I said you keep talking,
it's a write-up.

281
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,784
You just kept talking.

282
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,612
- Oh, no, no,
I asked her a question.

283
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,092
She was answering my question.
- Take her out of here.

284
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:37,659
Rec privileges revoked.

285
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,182
- Hold on, hold on,
I asked her a question.

286
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,664
- You a punk, Sucia Sanchez.

287
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,710
No wonder you're
free of charge.

288
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,324
- If this is real,
I swear to God...

289
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,326
- They set up in the cafeteria.

290
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:57,679
- Nurse Kamoe, can we get these
two to the urgent-care table?

291
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,028
- Right this way.

292
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,728
- Not a word.
Shut it down.

293
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:04,991
This is over.

294
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,998
- Warden, you said
that if I can improve things,

295
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,695
you'd be the first to admit it.

296
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,566
Well, this is an improvement.
- Improvement?

297
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,046
You're in flagrant
violation of regulations.

298
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,656
The exam room isn't small
for the hell of it.

299
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,962
The COs need
a clear line of vision

300
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,007
on the inmates at all times.

301
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,747
- Yeah, and they've got one.

302
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,054
The patients get privacy,
and the COs can still see.

303
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,664
- You were given enough COs

304
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,318
to secure a hallway,
not an open area.

305
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,233
There are 50 people
in this line.

306
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:33,323
The regulations regarding
COs-to-inmate ratios are clear.

307
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,672
Shut it down.

308
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,370
- Can we rotate more COs in?

309
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,111
- With written permission
from their union.

310
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,634
Should take about a month.

311
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,290
- Yo.

312
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,639
You here for back pain?

313
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,293
Form a line in A Block hallway.

314
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,166
Come on.
Let's go--A Block.

315
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,603
Did I stutter?
Let's do this.

316
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,692
Word's got out
y'all got new mattresses.

317
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,826
Most folks here crying back
pain are just angling for dibs.

318
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,349
- Lambona.

319
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,874
- Ignore her scheming ass.

320
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,920
A Block's got their own Cos,

321
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,968
so that should ratio
y'all's ratios, right?

322
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,360
Game on.

323
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,364
- Thank you.
Max Goodwin.

324
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,846
- Jackie Connor.

325
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,241
- Farther...

326
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,808
Almost there.

327
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,901
Mm.
A little farther...

328
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,816
Looking good.

329
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,298
And the clot is out.

330
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,300
Will you please inform
Ms. Randle's family?

331
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,999
- Can't do that.

332
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,392
- They should know Martha's
procedure was successful.

333
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,351
- No can do.
It's a security risk

334
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,396
to let them know
she's out of Rikers at all.

335
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,054
- She almost died.

336
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,274
You don't want
her children to know?

337
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,233
Her husband?
To offer comfort?

338
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,415
- Pearl, you got a visitor.

339
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,113
- Seriously, dude?

340
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,853
You trying to get me
thrown in the SHU?

341
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,160
- No, no, I came to apologize.

342
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,336
I did not mean to cause
any trouble for you.

343
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,859
- It's not your fault.

344
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,774
Sanchez is always
up my ass for no reason.

345
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,864
Last week she gave me a shot
for excessive eye-rolling.

346
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,779
- Wow.

347
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:24,043
You know, power structures,
they can--they can get muddy.

348
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,001
- Save it, Doc.

349
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,873
Sucia Sanchez is just mean,

350
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,267
always has been.

351
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,011
- You mean
since you've been here?

352
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,189
- Since Mrs. Brenneman's
second grade class!

353
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,366
- Oh.

354
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,109
- Yeah, we were friends.
Sucia Sanchez and Burly Pearly.

355
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,980
- Yeah, so what happened?

356
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,853
- She got her ass arrested
and put in my jail.

357
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,855
Doc, I know half
the women in here.

358
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:56,727
I treat them all the same.
- Yeah, except you don't.

359
00:17:56,771 --> 00:18:00,340
That write-up you gave Pearl
felt pretty personal.

360
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,082
- I'm a female CO.
The men watch.

361
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,214
They see you
go soft for one second,

362
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,129
that's your career.

363
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,957
- Right.
- So, yeah...

364
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,350
it's a tight leash on Pearl.

365
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,308
That's Rikers, bro.

366
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:13,875
That bridge outside--

367
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:17,096
you leave your friendships
at the other end.

368
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,406
Okay...

369
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,373
Oh, come on...

370
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,443
Oh, yes.

371
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,879
Oh, God, okay.

372
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:25,903
- And table three is now open.
Don't make me repeat myself.

373
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,254
Natasha, get on up there.

374
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,560
Yeah, Lindsay, it's cool,
just take your time.

375
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,127
It's not like
there are, you know,

376
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,911
sick people here or anything.

377
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,218
- When you get out of here,
just call me for a job.

378
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,872
- Do I look like
I have time to chitchat?

379
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,178
Just move the trash.

380
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,835
- You okay?

381
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,534
- Uh, yeah, just,
um, swallowed funny.

382
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,623
- You didn't look
like you swallowed funny.

383
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,277
- I keep telling my face

384
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,235
to do the swallowed-funny
expression better.

385
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,325
- You keep asking me to burden
you, but that goes both ways.

386
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,240
- Hey, you have a second?

387
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,633
- Sure, what's up?

388
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,243
- It's not for me,
it's my girlfriend.

389
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,506
She's got some intense
symptoms going on.

390
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,509
Big mood swings out of nowhere,
putting on some weight.

391
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,381
But she's too embarrassed
to ask for help.

392
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,513
Could you--
- Of course, where is she?

393
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,254
- Solitary.

394
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,259
- Well, you're gonna have
to hand over those bags.

395
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,608
You can't bring those in here.

396
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,523
- Well, we need
tools to treat her.

397
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,395
- Right, and I need
the dangerous inmate

398
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:25,136
not to get her hands on things
she can kill you with.

399
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,008
The bags?
- Makes sense.

400
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,322
Charly, you got company.

401
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,634
- Charly, these folks
are here to see you.

402
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,943
- It's okay.

403
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:52,120
Hi, uh, I'm Max Goodwin,
and this is Helen Sharpe.

404
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,862
We're doctors,
and we're here to help you.

405
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,256
- Your girlfriend, Dezi, said
that you were experiencing

406
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,607
some problems, uh,
so she asked us to come by.

407
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,479
How are you feeling?

408
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,133
- Um...

409
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,876
can you...can you describe
your symptoms?

410
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,575
- Uh, are you
pulling your hair out,

411
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,143
or is it coming out on its own?

412
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,194
- You mind if I take a look?
Is that okay?

413
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,848
Just...

414
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,807
Your specific pattern
of hair loss may be--

415
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,156
- Don't touch me.

416
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,984
- Watch it, Charly.
- We're okay.

417
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,942
Sorry.

418
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:35,250
- Back up.
You back the hell up.

419
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,646
Coming in here laughing at me?

420
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,303
You laughing at me?

421
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,913
Huh?
Answer me.

422
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,218
- Nobody
is laughing at you.

423
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,482
- Oh...

424
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,527
you don't laugh at me.

425
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,660
I laugh at you.

426
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,879
Okay.

427
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,014
- Charly, Dezi said...

428
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,624
- You don't say her name!

429
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,974
Get out! Get out!

430
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,543
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

431
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:10,154
- Get the hell out of here!

432
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:13,157
- Come on, let's go.

433
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,203
- You know,
holding down that call button

434
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:16,683
won't get me here any faster.

435
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,902
- I'm sorry.
I-I need another pill.

436
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,600
- What happened
to the one that you had?

437
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,123
- It's gone. I have looked
everywhere for it.

438
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,646
- Gone?

439
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,952
- Look, someone
must've come in here

440
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,693
and cleaned
while I was asleep--

441
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,608
- Dr. Bloom, we can't just
give you another pill.

442
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,087
- Says who?
- Says you, remember?

443
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,872
"No matter what I say,
don't give me anything

444
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,743
more than what's prescribed."
- That was different.

445
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,832
That was to stop me
from abusing the medication.

446
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,531
Just test my blood.
You'll see that I'm clean.

447
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:39,836
- We can't.
The morphine from

448
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,185
this morning
is still in your system.

449
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,839
- Oh, my God,
all I'm asking for

450
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,624
is that you replace one,
tiny little pill.

451
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,974
Is that too much to ask?
- I will page Dr. Ligon, okay?

452
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,716
- No, Eddie, you know what?
I'm sorry, I'm just...

453
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,719
I'm just in so...so much pain.

454
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,900
- So why not thyroid disease?
That would explain the hair.

455
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,728
- Charly was
the opposite of restless,

456
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,730
and she wasn't sweating.
- Keep it moving, please.

457
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,906
- Then ringworm
or a fungal infection.

458
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,690
- Makes sense with the hair,
but you're ignoring

459
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,823
what we saw when she just
stood up--she was wobbling.

460
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:11,955
- If the muscular weakness
started around the same time

461
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,610
as the behavioral changes,
then it could be heart disease.

462
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,786
- You're thinking about the
distention in her neck veins.

463
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,571
- Yeah, or even
rheumatoid arthritis.

464
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,747
- Time to go.
- Uh, just--not done.

465
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,792
- Let me save you some time.
She's nuts.

466
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,881
- Hair loss, venous distention,
weight gain--

467
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,014
she's got so many symptoms
that any doctor would want her

468
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,146
under observation
yesterday, but to simply

469
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,977
dismiss them because of her
psychological issues is...

470
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,763
They're not psychological.

471
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,634
- Hey!

472
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,941
- So I would like to start

473
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,986
by saying thank you both
for being here.

474
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,771
- I'm just here 'cause
Warden said I had to.

475
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,294
- I'm just here
'cause the door is locked.

476
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,165
- I know, I know.

477
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,298
Just when you thought nothing
could get worse than jail,

478
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,387
along comes
couples therapy, right?

479
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,128
I'll make this quick.

480
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,956
There are issues from your past

481
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,133
that are impacting
your ability to get along

482
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,917
in the present, right?

483
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,180
So I would like to help
you navigate those issues.

484
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,792
- Issue is she
needs to obey me.

485
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:08,185
Our past ain't got
nothing to do with it.

486
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,753
- So why did you
stop being friends?

487
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,712
- She drifted
into a bad way of life.

488
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,844
- Girl, I'm in here
on a misdemeanor.

489
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,978
You talking like
I'm Pablo Escobar.

490
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,806
- Okay, Pablo,
then why don't you tell me--

491
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:21,155
why do you think
you two fell out?

492
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,461
- I don't know.

493
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,854
She wouldn't tell me,
even though I asked.

494
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,987
- You hooked up
with that loser Justin Karn

495
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,425
and never wanted
to do anything ever again.

496
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,296
Don't lie.

497
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,821
- So why did you being
with Justin mean that

498
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:37,824
you couldn't spend
your time with Sanchez?

499
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,920
- You know how it is.

500
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:53,404
If I spent time with
my friends without him, he'd...

501
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,015
hit me or whatever.

502
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,282
- I didn't know that.

503
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,463
- So, when you get
an infraction in here,

504
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,770
does that feel similar?

505
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:12,859
- Like I'm right back there.
- Right.

506
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:15,035
- So what, then,
that's on me?

507
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,732
- No, nobody's saying that.

508
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:18,908
- Good, 'cause
I didn't put you in jail.

509
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,257
I'm just doing my job.

510
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,346
- Right, and like you told me,

511
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,958
if you don't do your job,
the guys see it.

512
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:26,699
- Damn right.

513
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:30,137
- Right, so you both
have been controlled by men.

514
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:35,751
- Look, I need this job.
I got kids.

515
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,103
- You got kids?

516
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:42,149
- Hector and Ruby.

517
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,198
- Ruby like your tía.

518
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,418
- You remember her?

519
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,077
Look, I can't be talking
about this with you, chica.

520
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,383
I'm a CO, you're an inmate.

521
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,255
That's all we can be.

522
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,040
- That's true.

523
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,434
You--you can't be friends
while you're in here,

524
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:09,263
but you can look
at each other...

525
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,265
just for a second

526
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,441
and remember that
there's more to who you are.

527
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:49,477
I told y'all to go.

528
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,522
Charly, just look at me.
- Dr. Goodwin.

529
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,046
- I'm good, I'm good.

530
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,787
Dr. Sharpe, can you
stand in the doorway

531
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,963
and hold up your hand, please?

532
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,442
- Take five steps back,
little man.

533
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,966
- Just look at me.

534
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:03,186
Focus on my eyes
and don't turn your head.

535
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,535
Just stay with me.

536
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,189
- I don't want to look
in your dumb-ass eyes.

537
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,451
Why would I look at you?

538
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:10,019
- Because you
can't see the walls.

539
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,198
Right? How many fingers
is she holding up?

540
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,897
Without looking--
can you tell me?

541
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,161
You're having
peripheral-vision problems.

542
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,163
They probably started around
the same time as your hair loss

543
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,382
and your leg weakness--
maybe neck pain, too.

544
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,820
We think you have
a brain tumor

545
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,386
and it's pressing
on your optic nerve,

546
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,998
and that is what
is causing all of this.

547
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,827
That's why you feel
the way you do.

548
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,178
It's why your emotions
have been so intense,

549
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,094
the behavior that
got you in the SHU...

550
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,183
it's not your fault.

551
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:51,104
- So I-I'm not...

552
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,369
I'm not...
- You're not crazy.

553
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,588
You're sick.

554
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,416
And we're gonna get you
to New Amsterdam,

555
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,201
and you're gonna get better.

556
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,205
Okay?

557
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,380
Okay.

558
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,909
- You stay strong.

559
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,042
Your surgery was a success.

560
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:20,046
- So I get to go
back to Rikers.

561
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,398
- In order to confirm
that Ms. Randle's embolism

562
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,921
is fully cleared,

563
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,184
I need to perform
a radionuclide scan.

564
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,186
It emits a great
deal of radiation.

565
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,448
- And?

566
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,146
- I suggest
you stay out here,

567
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,191
unless you prefer
not to have children.

568
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,333
Got to be quiet.

569
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,901
- Darrell!
- Shh.

570
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,077
Mom, The doctor
said we have to be quiet.

571
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,732
- Okay.
Come here, babies.

572
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:58,171
Oh, look at you.

573
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,477
You got so big.
Are you okay?

574
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,655
Look at you.

575
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:10,052
- I forgot how nice
it is to have you so close

576
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,967
that I can stop by
just to steal a kiss.

577
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:14,665
- Can't steal
what I want to give.

578
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,494
- Come here, you.

579
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,582
Mwah.

580
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,975
Hey, about this morning,

581
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,237
I know I need
to give you some space.

582
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,717
- Don't even.
We're all good.

583
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,154
- I'm just really excited
that you're home.

584
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,678
So, sorry for
misplacing my chill.

585
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,946
- San Francisco Memorial

586
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,513
offered me
a full-time position...

587
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,473
- Hmm.
- As Head Legal Counsel.

588
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,431
I didn't know how to tell you.

589
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,520
And I'm so sorry to drop
this on you in the middle

590
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,392
of the day,
but I-I love you...

591
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,133
- Well, what did you tell them?

592
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,007
- I said I'd consider it.

593
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,795
- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.

594
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,492
Excuse me.
What happened?

595
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,015
Where are you hurt?
- Blood's not mine.

596
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,364
I just got
knocked against the wall.

597
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,584
- Go, go.
- Stay back.

598
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,630
Tell me what happened.

599
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:16,771
- Four injured!
We need the medics.

600
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,817
- She's got three deep lacs.

601
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,340
- I need two ambulances--

602
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,081
four inmates,
multiple lacerations.

603
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,299
Get 'em to New Amsterdam.

604
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,348
- How's she doing?

605
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,524
- To be honest,
Dr. Ligon, not great.

606
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,439
She's exhibiting
drug-seeking behavior.

607
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,788
She was just trying to lie
to me about losing a pill.

608
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,050
I mean, I knew that Bloom

609
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,531
had a bit of a reputation,
but this was--

610
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:40,926
She was screaming at me.
- You mean Dr. Bloom?

611
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,363
- Yes, I-I didn't mean
any offense.

612
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,017
- Dr. Bloom is
one of the finest doctors

613
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,019
I've ever worked with,
and I trust that

614
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,543
you're not one to put stock
into petty rumors.

615
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,023
- No, of course not...

616
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,025
- If Dr. Bloom said
that the pill got lost,

617
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,636
then the pill got lost,
understand?

618
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,725
- Yes, Doctor.

619
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:03,426
- Hey, how you feeling?

620
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,562
- Thank you...

621
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:11,043
for what you said.

622
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,654
- Oh, you heard that.

623
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:18,702
- I looked everywhere for it.

624
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:22,402
I mean, I seriously thought
that I was going crazy.

625
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,186
I mean, at one point...

626
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,058
I thought
that I must've taken it

627
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,975
and then forgotten
that I'd taken it.

628
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:33,108
But I know in my heart...

629
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,545
I didn't do it.

630
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,941
And you believe me?

631
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,770
- Well, let's not write
a sonnet about it, shall we?

632
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,479
- Why do you believe me?

633
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,963
- Why?

634
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,140
- You've got no reason to.

635
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,012
- I don't follow.

636
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:12,495
- As one addict to another...

637
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,630
The only way
that you could be...

638
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,549
Certain that
I didn't take it...

639
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,205
Is if you did.

640
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,819
- Addicts do two things.

641
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:36,215
Get high and blame other
people for their mistakes.

642
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,567
You're doing the latter...

643
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,613
or is this both at once?

644
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,152
- Yes?

645
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,024
Ella, I want to offer you

646
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,679
support I learned
from the blogs I found.

647
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:07,159
- You read blogs?

648
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,204
- About how to be
a helpful grandparent.

649
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,076
Have you heard
of "meal trains"?

650
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,729
Perhaps I can conduct one.

651
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,253
- Uh, Vijay...

652
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,865
- What is it?

653
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,829
- I have
obsessive compulsive disorder.

654
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:29,181
- I understand.

655
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:32,880
It is not uncommon
for pregnancy to cause OCD.

656
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,882
- Right, uh...

657
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,058
but this is not
from the pregnancy.

658
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:40,235
- Okay, so
when was it diagnosed?

659
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,195
- About 12 years ago...

660
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,806
uh, after I was hospitalized.

661
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,205
Uh, they put me on high doses
of Zoloft and Trazodone,

662
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,208
but now I'm pregnant,
so no more meds.

663
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,819
I've been talking
with Dr. Frome,

664
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,734
'cause I don't...

665
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,823
I don't know
if I can do this.

666
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:09,656
- You will make
a wonderful mother.

667
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,616
- But in order
to be a wonderful mom,

668
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,575
I have to put this kid first.

669
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:18,230
And so I made a plan

670
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:21,798
to make sure that
I can manage my OCD.

671
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:25,846
And I'm gonna move
back in with my parents.

672
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,153
- That sounds very wise.

673
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,026
- In Idaho.

674
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:38,598
I-Idaho.

675
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:41,166
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,785
Mm.

677
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:54,092
- Rough day?

678
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:57,965
- Just...tell me.

679
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,795
Is it getting worse?

680
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:09,150
- See the lack
of signal right here?

681
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,156
Tumor's gone.

682
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,333
- But my--my throat.
I was--

683
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:20,248
- Allergies.

684
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,034
Max...

685
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:29,997
You're in remission.

686
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,662
- Hey.
- Hi.

687
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,316
I just heard
that Jackie's stable.

688
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,882
That's great news.

689
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,101
- Yeah, all four of them are.

690
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,798
How'd you leave it
with the warden?

691
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,671
This was not his
favorite day at the office,

692
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,020
but he surprised me.

693
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,022
- Yeah, in that he didn't
stab you as well?

694
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,024
In that he...

695
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,201
has asked us to go back.

696
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,726
The warden is a results guy,
and he liked our results,

697
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,685
so I suggested
that Rikers become part

698
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,208
of our med school rotation.

699
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,688
We could send students over

00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,820

and Behavioral Health...

701
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:13,214
and he's requesting extra
COs to ensure their safety.

702
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:16,043
- That's great--
that's great work.

703
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:19,438
I thought
you'd be more pleased.

704

00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,229
