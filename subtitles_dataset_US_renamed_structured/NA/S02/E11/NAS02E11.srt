1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,180
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,485
- I have Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,444
I'm gonna move back in
with my parents.

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,445
In Idaho.

5
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,187
- Maybe you can
move in with me.

6
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,451
- What do you think
would happen

7
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,713
if you stopped helping people?

8
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,019
What would they see?

9
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:22,022
- They would see
what a complete loser I am--

10
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:25,112
corny, nerdy, fat.

11
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:29,290
- San Francisco's sounding
really good right about now.

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,769
Let's get out of here.

13
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,816
- The pattern of your behavior
can actually be indicative

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,558
of a more substantive
diagnosis per the DSM-5.

15
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,602
- Such as?

16
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,604
- Narcissistic Personality
Disorder?

17
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,824
- Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

18
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,347
as cochair of oncology,

19
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,176
as well as your duties
as deputy medical director.

20
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:02,149
- ♪ Computer, what's the point
in this? ♪

21
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,281
♪ You do all the thinking

22
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,848
♪ Where are we?

23
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,462
♪ Just building shelters
in the snow ♪

24
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,116
- At the center,
where they belong,

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,204
so I am introducing

26
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,119
a new initiative
to change that,

27
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,382
one that reconnects
all of our doctors to our...

28
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:20,515
- ♪ I know it's fallen down

29
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,389
♪ Got my headphones on

30
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,739
♪ And I won't hear a sound

31
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,140
- Ligon did what?

32
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,576
- I know.

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,144
Who could've guessed
that having sex with my doctor

34
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,886
and fellow drug addict
would turn out poorly?

35
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,844
- Are you okay?

36
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:47,411
- No, not really.

37
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,587
But is it crazy to think
that this all happened

38
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,373
at exactly the same time
I get a large chunk of money

39
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,852
from my family's trust?

40
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,290
- What, you think
the money's cursed?

41
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,769
- I think bad things happen

42
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,467
anytime my family does
anything,

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,296
but especially
when there's money involved.

44
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,862
- How much are we talking?

45
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,386
- Whatever amount
is in your head,

46
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,735
times it by ten,

47
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:10,173
and then taint it with
toxic family relationships.

48
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,393
- Well, just buy a house
in the Hamptons

49
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,830
so we can grow old
and "Grey Gardens" together.

50
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,398
- How are you holding up?

51
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,313
- Great.

52
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:22,446
It's good.
I've got so much time freed up.

53
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:24,231
- Helen.

54
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,623
- It's horrible.

55
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,625
Honestly, I thought
that it would be easier,

56
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,586
but I feel like I'm trespassing
in my own hospital.

57
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,891
But I'm not gonna dwell on it.

58
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,241
I'm just gonna keep
my head down

59
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,678
and just focus on my patients.

60
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,071
- Well, look,

61
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,683
at least they still let you
monitor my drug tests.

62
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,814
- Yes.

63
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,208
Still allowed
to watch you pee.

64
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,606
- Hey, missed you
at the department head meeting

65
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:52,694
this morning.

66
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,565
- Oh, I'm sure
it went swimmingly.

67
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,219
How's my little munchkin
doing today?

68
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,307
- I don't like you being
out of the loop.

69
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,569
I didn't get to tell you
my big idea.

70
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,614
- Is Luna going on rounds?

71
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,963
Everyone loves seeing
baby boss.

72
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,965
- Actually, it's time
for our six-month checkup,

73
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,445
so we're headed
to the Ped's wing

74
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,794
for some important vaccines.

75
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,274
- Gosh.
Have fun.

76
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,884
- Wait, I didn't get to
tell you my big idea.

77
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,538
- No need.
- But I want to tell you.

78
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,669
- I have patients.

79
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:12,975
- Sounds like you have
zero patience,

80
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,324
with a C.

81
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,673
See what I did there?
It's a pun.

82
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:18,198
- It's hilarious.
Gotta go, bye.

83
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,895
Terrible.

84
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,899
- Hi.
- Just one sec.

85
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,341
I can take that.

86
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,996
Welcome home.
- Thank you.

87
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,650
That was beautiful.

88
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,129
- Hot chai is ready.

89
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,002
- Oh, thank you, I just--
I have to rush off to work.

90
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,873
- Okay, then I'll quickly
show you my home.

91
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:42,874
- Okay.

92
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,746
- This is the kitchen.
- Yeah.

93
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,271
- And this is the living room.

94
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:49,403
- Kay.

95
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,882
- That's my mandir.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,017
And this will be your room.

97
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,803
- I-It--it appears
occupied.

98
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,979
- Yes, this was Rohan's room.

99
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,242
- You don't say.

100
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,721
- When he first left home,

101
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,463
his mother insisted that
we leave the room as it is,

102
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,552
in case he needed to come back.

103
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,294
We will squeeze you in.

104
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:14,558
And this is his famous
posters wall.

105
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,647
- Right.
- You cannot touch these.

106
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,475
Come with me.
- Kay.

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,738
- I have to show you something.

108
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:32,620
And my wife's sewing room
is perfect for the baby.

109
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,363
- Where will the crib go?
- Oh...

110
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:38,800
No need to change much.

111
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:39,975
Oh.

112
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,546
What about here?

113
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,809
- Uh, great.
- I'll show you

114
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,680
the bathroom now.
- Kay.

115
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,315
- Elandra Siefert,
33-year-old woman.

116
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,360
Restrained driver in a MVA.
Multiple crush injuries.

117
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,666
- What do you got?
- Hemothorax.

118
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,711
I suspect a lacerated
pulmonary artery.

119
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,104
She's losing blood by the pint.

120
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,627
- When can we get her
to the OR?

121
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,803
- Tying off an arterial pumper
now, then she's all yours.

122
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,718
- Ma'am why don't you come with
me so the doctors can work?

123
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:28,980
- No, she's my sister.

124
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,591
- Floyd, this is gonna be
a long surgery.

125
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:31,983
You sure you're up for it?

126
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,811
- Wound's healed, I'll be fine.
What about you?

127
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,335
- Wound's healed.
I'll be fine.

128
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,120
- B/P 80/40 and dropping.
Tachy at 130 and rising.

129
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,383
- Yo, we gotta go.
- Okay, I'm almost there.

130
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,776
- Breathing pattern
ineffective.

131
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,517
- Okay, she's all yours.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,345
- Is Elandra on
any medications,

133
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,476
or has she had
any health scares?

134
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,825
- No meds.
She was a Marine.

135
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,958
She's crazy healthy.
Please help her!

136
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,481
- Okay, all right, we're gonna
do everything we can.

137
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:52,656
Let's go!
- Incoming!

138
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,918
- Out of the way.
- Trey Masterson.

139
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,833
18, with an anaphylactic
reaction.

140
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,705
Epi Auto Injector times two
with no response.

141
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,402
- High-dose Epi.

142
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,753
- Original B/P 130 over 70,
down to 110 over 50.

143
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,495
- Heart rate 148.
O2 sats 84 and dropping.

144
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,888
- Okay, doubling dose.

145
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:10,021
- Heart rate at 160.
- Okay, but O2's up to 90.

146
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,546
- We got him.
- Trey?

147
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,852
Trey, has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

148
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,027
- No.
- Okay.

149
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,551
Any medical history
we should know about?

150
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,510
I had lymphoma.

151
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,729
Four years ago.

152
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,774
- Okay.
- Dr. Sharpe treated me.

153
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,385
- Okay, okay,
we're gonna run some tests

154
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,125
to figure out what caused
this allergic reaction,

155
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,866
and let's page Sharpe.

156
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,959
- Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Goodwin.

157
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,571
I'll let Dr. Elder know
you're here.

158
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:40,748
- Thanks.

159
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,706
- Oh.

160
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,456
- Is anyone--

161
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,675
- Oh, sorry.

162
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:57,112
- Thanks.

163
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,809
- Are you gonna walk for me?

164
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,942
Are we walking today?

165
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,119
- How old is yours?

166
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,642
- Six months.

167
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,514
- Walking's right around
the corner.

168
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,993
- Yeah, so I've heard.

169
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,214
I keep putting her
on the treadmill, but no luck.

170
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,825
- Well, this wobbly girl
is Bobbi.

171
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,915
- Oh.
Hey there.

172
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,179
This sweet girl is Luna.

173
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:25,967
- You know, it's nice
that the adults

174
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,142
don't have to put
the qualifiers

175
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,752
before our names too.

176
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,102
- Actually, I think we'd treat
each other better if we did.

177
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,891
Hi, I'm "anxious in hospitals"
Alice.

178
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,156
- I'm "hiding behind my smile"
Max.

179
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,469
- Hey.
Have you heard Max's big idea?

180
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,079
No screens?

181
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,602
- That is a big idea.

182
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,169
- No screens in patient rooms,

183
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,127
no tablets, no computers.

184
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,955
He's not serious, is he?

185
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,914
- He's definitely serious.

186
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,785
- But we don't actually
have to do it, do we?

187
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,613
- You most certainly do,
and not only that,

188
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,876
but as chair, it's your job
to share this new rule

189
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,225
with your entire department.

190
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,184
One down.
Good luck with the rest.

191
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:12,883
- Dr. Sharpe.
- Dr. Baker.

192
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,712
- Don't say my name nicely when
it's clear how furious I am.

193
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,844
This is unacceptable.

194
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,106
- I'm not sure
what you're referring to.

195
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,107
- No screens?

196
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,195
- I had nothing to do
with that.

197
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,023
- Then veto it!
We need screens.

198
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,503
This isn't the Stone Age.

199
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,287
- As I'm certain you've heard,
I'm no longer management.

200
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,984
I am just a doctor
like yourself,

201
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,987
keeping my head down
and focusing on my patients.

202
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,600
- Dr. Sharpe.

203
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,776
No screens during any
patient encounters

204
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,212
is, frankly, outlandish.

205
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,300
- Dr. Eliraz, long time.

206
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:39,823
I'm doing well.
Thank you for asking.

207
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,955
- Dr. Sharpe.

208
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,217
- Without looking
at a computer screen,

209
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,001
I can't keep my patients' names
straight.

210
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,002
- I suspect that's why

211
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,569
Dr. Goodwin instated
the policy.

212
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,528
More face-to-face
emotional engagement.

213
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,573
- Since I was an intern,
I've always had a screen

214
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:51,792
in my exam room.

215
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,010
- We can't do our jobs
without our screens.

216
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,185
- You have to make this
go away.

217
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,622
- Enough!

218
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,971
I am not the deputy
medical director,

219
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,276
I am not a department chair,

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,669
I am not anyone who is
in charge of anything,

221
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,149
so my advice to all of you
is to suck it up,

222
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,759
swallow your pride,
keep your head down,

223
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,979
and do the one damn thing
that Max has asked of you,

224
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:07,677
which is what I am
trying to do!

225
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,113
And just for the record,

226
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,333
you should bloody well know
your patients' names.

227
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,033
- Hi, Luna.
Can you say hi?

228
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,645
Say hola.
Shalom?

229
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,082
- Bobbi, you wanna say hi
to Luna?

230
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,650
She's totally thinking "hello."

231
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,217
- Yeah, totally got that.

232
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,523
What are you in for?

233
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,351
- Bobbi keeps getting
these ear infections.

234
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,657
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

235
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,049
They're scared they could
delay her speech,

236
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,356
so an ENT's putting these tubes
in her ears.

237
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,749
- Tympanostomy.

238
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,012
- That's the word
I keep meaning to write down.

239
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,579
Maybe you could toss them
on in,

240
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,581
seeing as you're already
in scrubs.

241
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,321
- Yeah, I'm not really
an ear guy,

242
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,801
but if she had Ebola--

243
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,716
- In that case, we'll stick
with the ear infections.

244
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,588
- That's fair.

245
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,198
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yep.

246
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,330
- You can come on back now.
- Oh, great.

247
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,202
Hope the doctor
gets to you soon.

248
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,552
- Thanks.

249
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,206
Nice to meet you.
- You too.

250
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,294
- And Luna.

251
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,209
- Yeah, she's totally
thinking "bye!"

252
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,297
- Say "bye!"
- Bye!

253
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,646
- Bye, Bobbi.
- Bye, Luna.

254
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,563
- And on a scale of one to ten,
how bad is the pain?

255
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,217
- Maybe a four,

256
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,697
but it's nothing
compared to my knee.

257
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,133
- So it's your knee as well.

258
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,613
And what number would you give
your knee?

259
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,527
- Well, if my foot is a nine,

260
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,833
then I'd say my knee
is an eight.

261
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,227
Shouldn't you be typing this
into a computer?

262
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,707
- I've got it all right here,
okay?

263
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,754
So, it is your shoulder,

264
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,626
your knee, and your foot.

265
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,627
And that is everything.

266
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,672
- And my skin is very dry.

267
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,282
- Huh, so that's not
everything.

268
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,676
- I wasn't sure if you did
skin stuff.

269
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,982
- Okay, Mr. Pembroke,

270
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,853
why don't you just tell me
all of your concerns?

271
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,073
- Well, the only other thing
I can think of

272
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,814
is muscle aches...

273
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,293
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,600
- Blurred vision, exhaustion,

275
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,081
headaches, constipation,

276
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,778
oh, and I'm always freezing.

277
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,823
- Okay, I'm gonna go

278
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,302
and get this logged
into your chart

279
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,435
before I forget, and then
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

280
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,090
Okay, so you've got
shoulder pain,

281
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,309
connected to the knee pain,
connected to the foot pain,

282
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,835
dry skin, blurry vision,
muscle aches, exhaustion,

283
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,751
constipation, and...

284
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,146
Oh, no.

285
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,584
- Making the incision between
the sixth and seventh rib.

286
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,891
Get me a pair of.

287
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,893
- Gonna need a saline flush.

288
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,156
- Isolating pulmonary artery.

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,506
- Polypropalyne sutures.

290
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,770
Need a new carton
of lap pads.

291
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,467
- Suture.

292
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,556
500 milliliters.

293
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,297
- That should do it.

294
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,474
- Her heart rate's
still rising.

295
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,867
- Should be slowing down.

296
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,347
- And her blood pressure's
dropping.

297
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,698
- I got all the bleeders.
- There must be something else.

298
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,438
- Hypotensive, tachycardic--

299
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,876
- And a lacy red rash.

300
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,660
- That's a transfusion
reaction.

301
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,880
Her body's rejecting the blood.
Disconnect it!

302
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,405
And call hematology!
- Assess for DIC.

303
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,928
- She's oozing blood
everywhere.

304
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,583
- BP is still dropping.

305
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,932
- Gauze.

306
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,371
Come on, come on.

307
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,766
Dr. Reynolds,
tell me what's happening.

308
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,202
- Where's Sharpe?

309
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,464
- If there's an issue
with the blood product,

310
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:07,683
the chair of hematology
gets paged,

311
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,945
and right now, that's me.

312
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,338
- Sorry, just habit.

313
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,774
- You suspect a transfusion
reaction?

314
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,950
- Yeah, a big one.

315
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,778
- Okay, I'm on it.

316
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,608
- down.
- Get a new one.

317
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,349
- Dr. Sharpe.

318
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,437
Long time no see.

319
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,439
- Hello, Trey.

320
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,962
How are you feeling?

321
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,747
- Like someone who was almost
murdered by crab cakes.

322
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,400
They figure out
why it happened?

323
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,536
What is it?

324
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,632
- Trey, I have some bad news.

325
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:49,725
The newfound allergies
that you have

326
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,814
are from your lymphoma,

327
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,903
which means that it's returned.

328
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:00,344
- So, it's back to chemo?

329
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,693
- The cancer has spread

330
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,391
too aggressively
for chemotherapy.

331
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,872
It's beyond anything
that we can treat.

332
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,354
- But we beat it.

333
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:11,616
You and me.
You said we beat it.

334
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,532
- It's not fair,
and it doesn't make any sense,

335
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,317
and I am so sorry.

336
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,366
- How long?

337
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,846
- Four months.

338
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,935
Maybe six.

339
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,244
Are your parents here?

340
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,332
I'm gonna call them.

341
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,855
- No, don't.
- Trey--

342
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,596
- I don't want them to know.

343
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,628
- Have you got a minute?

344
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,716
- Oh, hi.

345
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,849
Yeah, actually,
I'm glad you're here.

346
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,850
Would you say that I have

347
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,591
Narcissistic Personality
Disorder?

348
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,420
Because the DSM says that
people who are narcissistic

349
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,466
are typically quite haughty.

350
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,989
Is that how you would
characterize me?

351
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,948
Haughty?
Just give it to me straight.

352
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,514
Am I haughty?

353
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,516
- You know, I heard
a really good hypothetical

354
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,735
to tell if you're a narcissist.

355
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:27,954
- Good, what is it?

356
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,085
- If a colleague shows up
at your office

357
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,347
during the work day,

358
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,740
do you assume they're there
for a reason,

359
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,350
or just to hear you talk
nonsense?

360
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,529
- Lay it on me.

361
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,662
- His name's Trey.

362
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:43,578
He's 18, and he wants
to die alone.

363
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,625
- The mutiny is upon us.

364
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,627
- Why does no one ever stop me
with good news?

365
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,673
Honestly, I'm gonna start using
the air ducts.

366
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,588
- The neurology
and neurosurgery departments

367
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,806
are in open revolt.

368
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,591
- So naturally, you come
to an oncologist.

369
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,028
- Max's ban on screens
is completely impractical.

370
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,595
Screens are vital

371
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:03,511
even for the most basic
neurological patient encounter.

372
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,556
- Do you know what's most
interesting about neurology?

373
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,644
- What?
- I couldn't tell you.

374
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:07,689
It's not my department.

375
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,909
- My clinic is in chaos.

376
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,345
You must help.

377
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,694
- I can't.

378
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,783
I don't have a position
of authority, Vijay.

379
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,829
There's no reason for roving
gangs of rebel neurologists

380
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,354
to listen to me.
- Max listens to you.

381
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:22,704
It's not about your title.

382
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,924
You have Max's ear.

383
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,838
Please.

384
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,579
For the patients.

385
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,198
- Yeah.

386
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,026
- Just so you know,
your big idea

387
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,984
is going down
like a lead balloon.

388
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,551
- Look there's something--

389
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,727
there's something wrong
with Luna.

390
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,772
- Max, what--do they know
what it is, or--

391
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,514
- Not yet.
What do you need?

392
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,081
- Nothing.

393
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,865
I'll handle it.

394
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,052
- A small bump, Dr. Goodwin.
Likely a lipoma.

395
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,314
- Do you wanna biopsy it?

396
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,663
- I don't want you to panic.

397
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:11,100
- Well, I have--
had cancer.

398
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,406
- Cancer is so unlikely.

399
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,582
- Yeah, I know, I know,
but it could be,

400
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,498
or it could be a hemangioma
or a Budd-Chiari malformation--

401
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,847
- I highly doubt that.

402
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,544
- I don't want to doubt, kay?
I'd like to know.

403
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,633
I need to know.

404
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,374
- I could biopsy it, but--
- Okay.

405
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,507
- We could be opening up
ourselves to a false positive--

406
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,379
- Do it.
Kay?

407
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,905
Hey.

408
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,516
- It has come to my attention

409
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,736
that you have been brazenly
disregarding Max's directive.

410
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,173
- Because it's crazy.

411
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,696
- And yet, I'm fairly certain
it wasn't optional.

412
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,741
- We need our screens
for consults.

413
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,916
- And Max believes

414
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,701
having your faces buried
in your tablet

415
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,833
only alienates you
from your patients.

416
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,531
Now, I've spoken with Max
directly

417
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:51,880
and he would like you
to get this done,

418
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,882
so tell me, how can I help?

419
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,057
- Do you know
how much information

420
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,754
we're expected to enter
for each patient?

421
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,408
- 36 pages.

422
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,367
- 2/3rds of which is insurance
coding and billing questions.

423
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,542
- And we have no choice
but to do it

424
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,891
during the consults.

425
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,066
- Since it takes
about 15 minutes of scrolling

426
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,285
to fill it all out.

427
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,634
If we can't do it
during the patient visit,

428
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,027
we'll have to do it after.

429
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,550
- Which means each patient
will take twice as long,

430
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,117
and we'll end up seeing
half as many patients.

431
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,816
- And some of us
are not the fastest typists.

432
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,209
- Okay.

433
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,821
So, what if we were to hire,
say, medical scribes

434
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,953
who could input the data
while you were consulting.

435
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,694
Would that help?
- That would be incredible.

436
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,000
- You can do that?

437
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,654
- No, but Max can,
and if Max wants this done,

438
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:27,872
then consider it done.

439
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,439
Six new medical scribes
coming your way.

440
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,746
That's--thank you.

441
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,488
Thank you!

442
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,925
- See, I knew Max
would listen to you.

443
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,538
- How about an indoor
rock climbing wall?

444
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,975
- Okay, what part of
"this money is cursed"

445
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:44,976
didn't you understand?

446
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,500
- Sauna and hot tub?
- No.

447
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,762
- Jet skis.
- Sure.

448
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,590
- Really?
- No.

449
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,809
Eli, Eli, Eli.
Okay.

450
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,203
Now you, you nearly had me
stumped,

451
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:55,683
what with your litany
of issues.

452
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,511
I mean, the headaches,
the knee,

453
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:00,079
the inability to regulate
your body temperature.

454
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,081
I mean, I really had
to dig deep,

455
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,084
and I searched far and wide.

456
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,782
I mean, I even consulted
a dusty old medical text.

457
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,741
But I have figured it out.

458
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,134
I know what you have.

459
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,093
It is called a low thyroid,

460
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:18,053
and it explains
all of your symptoms.

461
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,012
- Even the cut on my leg
that won't heal?

462
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,797
- What cut on your leg
that won't heal?

463
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,929
- Did I forget to mention
that one?

464
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:28,107
- Yeah, must've slipped
your mind.

465
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,545
- So, do I still have
a low thyroid, Dr. Bloom?

466
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,766
- No.

467
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,813
Okay, so,

468
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,815
cut on your leg

469
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,078
that won't heal...

470
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,128
Constipation...

471
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,173
headaches...

472
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,221
- Dr. Sharpe.

473
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,700
- Sandra Fall from billing.

474
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,659
- Why did you requisition
six medical scribes?

475
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,574
- I didn't.
That was Max.

476
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,880
- Except the entire neurology
department said it was you.

477
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,839
- Doesn't that sound
like something Max would do?

478
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:05,883
- Unfortunately, yes.

479
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,146
So, why didn't he sign
the paperwork?

480
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,799
- You know, that also
sounds like something

481
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,105
Max would forget to do.

482
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,802
- I can't approve
the requisition of new staff

483
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,630
without the medical director's
signature.

484
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,676
- Okay, wait.

485
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,068
Turn around.
- Why?

486
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:19,201
- Plausible deniability.

487
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,076
Okay, you can turn around now.

488
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,862
That looks like Max signed it
to me.

489
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,038
- That does seem like something
Max would do.

490
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,697
- Have you ever heard
of magical thinking?

491
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,698
No?

492
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,570
It's the belief that

493
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,138
our thoughts
can shape reality.

494
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,922
The idea that
our deepest wishes

495
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:48,143
can somehow shape
the physical world.

496
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,884
Or sometimes, we hope

497
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,060
that if we don't talk
about something,

498
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,629
it won't happen.

499
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,065
- You think I'm in
some weirdo headspace

500
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,240
where if I don't tell
my parents,

501
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,807
I think I won't die?

502
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,026
- I think it's possible.

503
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,115
- Okay, no.
That's not me at all.

504
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,856
I'm fully clear
on my situation.

505
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,556
- Okay.
- In six months, I'm toast.

506
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,122
- Yeah.

507
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,215
So, why not tell your parents?

508
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,868
- Look, I'm 18,

509
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,131
and three years of that was
spent sidelined with cancer,

510
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,612
so experience-wise,
it's like I'm 15.

511
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,919
I've got less than a year left,
and I want to go live.

512
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,051
- That's great.
Why don't you tell them that?

513
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,010
- If I did,
every time I leave the house,

514
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,273
I'll have to deal
with their sad faces.

515
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,883
That I'm choosing
to spend my last days

516
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,581
with people that aren't them.

517
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,147
- Okay, I get that, Trey,

518
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:39,629
but you know there are physical
signs of cancer, right?

519
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,764
Bottles of painkillers,
your body will be in decline.

520
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,069
- So?

521
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,767
- So your parents are bound
to notice that,

522
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,943
don't you think?

523
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,337
Terminal cancer's not really
something you can hide.

524
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,341
- That's why I'm leaving.

525
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,690
- Leaving?

526
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,257
- I've been thinking about it
all morning.

527
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,259
My buddy Jem is doing
a semester in Barcelona.

528
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm gonna take the semester off
and go crash with him,

529
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,958
then after that,
I'll go wherever.

530
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:08,223
Peru, climb the Andes,
hopefully lose my virginity.

531
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,008
It's okay to laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

532
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:15,143
- There's just so much
I haven't done.

533
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,798
- So, your parents
are gonna hear about you dying

534
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,887
on a mountain
thousands of miles away,

535
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,280
all alone?

536
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,890
- And it'll be awful for them.

537
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,239
- Yeah.

538
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,373
- But it's gonna be awful
for them no matter what.

539
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,679
At least this way,
it won't be awful for me.

540
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:34,815
- Yeah.

541
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,864
Okay.

542
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,084
I'm gonna go get
your discharge paperwork.

543
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,833
I know.

544
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,835
I know, I know, I know.

545
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,358
I know, I know, I know.

546
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,360
I know.
- Everything okay?

547
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,928
- They need to run some tests,
but--

548
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,669
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

549
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,758
Sorry.
Can't seem to--

550
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,673
- Don't worry about it.

551
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:10,894
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

552
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:17,858
My wife would have been
better at this.

553
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,381
- Have you tried the Ss?

554
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,212
Give it a try?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

555
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,953
Hey, hey.

556
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,869
Oh, hi.

557
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,396
Hi.

558
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,882
Raising a child by yourself
is hard.

559
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:45,451
- Yeah.
Hoping it gets easier.

560
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,409
- It won't.

561
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:50,064
But you get better
at getting through it.

562
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,892
Yeah.

563
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,286
- Ms. Healy?

564
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,724
The doctor will see you now.

565
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,856
- There we go.
- Thanks.

566
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,206
Hi.
Hi!

567
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,904
Yeah, was that better?

568
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:08,996
Good luck.

569
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,780
- Thanks.
You too.

570
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,438
- Hang another liter
of normal saline.

571
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,570
- She has a positive ANA

572
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,006
and double-stranded
DNA antibodies.

573
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,007
- She has Lupus?

574
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,443
- And it's making antibodies

575
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,010
that are reacting to the
transfused red blood cells.

576
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:24,533
- That's why she rejected it.

577
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,274
- Any blood we give her needs
to be meticulously matched

578
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,450
to dozens of proteins on the
surface of her red blood cells,

579
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,756
or she'll react again.

580
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,453
- Okay, so get it up here.
- We don't have any.

581
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,281
But I'm gonna search
every hospital and blood bank

582
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,848
until we find it.
- Well, you better hurry,

583
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:37,285
or she's gonna bleed out
on the table.

584
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,949
- Where's Bobbi?
- Still back there.

585
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,341
- Oh.
- They let me watch

586
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,822
as she went under, but then
said I had to wait here

587
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,258
till after the procedure.

588
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,825
- Yeah, that's typical.

589
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,829
- Since my husband passed, I...

590
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,354
I hate having her
out of my sight.

591
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,444
I know she's okay, but--

592
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,228
- I know, um...

593
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,710
Come with me.

594
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,417
- Are you sure we can be
back here?

595
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,897
- I know a few people.

596
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,986
You can leave that there
if you want.

597
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:37,432
Chuck Turnbill's one of
the best ENTs in Manhattan.

598
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,480
Now you get to see why.

599
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,792
- Thank you.

600
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,141
- Sure.

601
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,842
- Dr. Goodwin,
we have Luna's results.

602
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,887
- Excuse me.

603
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,245
- We want medical
scribes too.

604
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,508
- Oh, do you now?

605
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,900
- We heard what you got
the neurosurgeons,

606
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,293
and we want
the exact same thing.

607
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,164
- Mm, but I distinctly recall
you telling me

608
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,688
how much you love your screens,

609
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:18,168
so hiring medical scribes
isn't gonna solve your problem.

610
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,779
- So what are you gonna
give us?

611
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:20,997
- Home visits.

612
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,956
- Home visits?

613
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,523
- To forge authentic
connections

614
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,002
with the people that you treat,

615
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,483
you need to do far more than
just set your screens aside.

616
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,530
You need total immersion
in the lives of your patients.

617
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,271
- Even if we wanted to do that,
which we don't,

618
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,925
our schedules would never allow
for that.

619
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,014
- I'm cancelling all
pulmonology clinic appointments

620
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,538
for the next month.

621
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,278
That should free up some time.
- Wait, you can't do that.

622
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,845
- I'm not doing it, Max is.

623
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,194
- You talked to him about us?

624
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,022
- Yes, and he agreed
this is exactly what you need.

625
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,458
You and your colleagues
are gonna start

626
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,112
visiting your patients
in their home,

627
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,071
and you are really gonna
get to know them.

628
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,899
Max suggested
that you could start

629
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,335
by learning their first names.

630
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:00,994
- Eli.

631
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,386
Okay.

632
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,954
Now, I think I figured out
what is wrong with you,

633
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:09,002
and this is the treatment.

634
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,047
- It looks big.

635
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,919
- Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

636
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:18,228
So look, I went over
your landfill of symptoms

637
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:21,188
a million times, and...

638
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,799
the only diagnosis
I could come to

639
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,366
was malnutrition.

640
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:31,285
Now, Eli, are you
having trouble buying food?

641
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:34,070
- My Social Security check
pays most of my rent,

642
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,986
but to cover the rest of it,

643
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,988
I sell my food stamps,

644
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:42,557
and eat fast food
'cause it's cheap.

645
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,168
- Okay.

646
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:49,085
Well, look, you can't do that
anymore.

647
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,391
- I knew I was cutting corners,

648
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,133
I didn't know I was hurting
myself.

649
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,961
- What about the shelter?

650
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,354
I mean, they offer
three healthy meals a day.

651
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:00,009
- I won't take food away

652
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,055
from people who really need it!

653
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,405
- You really need it.

654
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:06,886
I mean, your body
is basically starving.

655
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:13,240
Have you heard of something
called Meals for Seniors?

656
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,851
I mean, it is a great program
that is designed to help

657
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,374
with the nutritional needs
of the elderly.

658
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,246
- I've been on a waitlist
since June.

659
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,293
Of 2016.

660
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,908
- I don't understand.
Why can't you find a match?

661
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,039
- Your sister needs

662
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,563
an extremely particular
blood product,

663
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,958
and so far, no hospital
within 6 hours

664
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,700
has it on hand.

665
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:42,312
I'm so sorry, Justine.

666
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,140
If there's any other
family members

667
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:47,578
you wish to call,
now would be the time.

668
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:50,581
- Elandra's a Marine.

669
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,933
She did three tours
in Afghanistan,

670
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:56,326
and now a commute to work
is going to kill her

671
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,980
because you don't have blood?

672
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,292
- You paged me?

673
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,337
- Look, I know I'm stepping
over Castro,

674
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,688
but my patient needs
all the help that she can get,

675
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,298
and I'm not gonna let
chain of command

676
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,170
get in the way
of saving her life.

677
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,259
Will you help?

678
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,435
- Ella.

679
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,654
I have something for you.

680
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,569
I realized mine
were a little old,

681
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,223
so I thought maybe
these new ones

682
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,399
will make you feel
more at home.

683
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:28,532
- Vijay, I really appreciate
what you're doing.

684
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,447
I just--

685
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,448
your home?

686
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:32,928
- You mean our home.

687
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,277
- Yeah.

688
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,236
There's so much
of your old life there,

689
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,674
so much of everything,
really, and...

690
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,284
I just--

691
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:42,721
there's no space
for anyone else.

692
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,070
There's no space for me.

693
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,246
- Oh, we will move
Rohan's books.

694
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:47,551
- It's not about the books.

695
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,640
I just--

696
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,251
feel like I picture myself
there,

697
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:54,515
and I just--with my OCD,
and--

698
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,952
I know that you are just
trying to be helpful,

699
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:58,649
and that really means so much.

700
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:00,651
I just--it's just not
gonna work for me.

701
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,135
- I...

702
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,355
I'm sorry I did not think of--

703
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,531
- No, I'm sorry.

704
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,533
I--

705
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,100
you're being so great, and I--

706
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:18,191
- You need to do what is best
for the baby, and--

707
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,454
and for you.

708
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,239
- I'll come by after my shift,
and I'll pick up my things.

709
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,509
- Where will you go?

710
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:35,425
- I'll go stay with a friend
till I figure it out.

711
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:41,997
- Okay.

712
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,484
- It's not cancer.

713
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,399
It's not some obscure
infection.

714
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:55,445
Luna has an epidermoid cyst,
a simple fold of tissue.

715
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,708
A small injection of steroids
and she'll be fine.

716
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:00,624
- That's great news.
Thank you.

717
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,322
- But if I may, Dr. Goodwin,

718
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,845
today you let
your parental fears

719
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,717
override your medical judgment
and mine.

720
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,545
- What do you mean?

721
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,417
- From now on,
when Luna visits this office,

722
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,375
I don't want her coming
with Dr. Goodwin.

723
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,725
I want Luna coming
with her father.

724
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:20,253
- Got it.

725
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:25,127
- Okay.

726
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:29,175
For your discharge,
my mountain-climbing friend.

727
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,177
Here you go.
- Sweet, thank you.

728
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,048
- So, listen, before you leave,
if you don't mind,

729
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,051
I have one more shrink thought
for you.

730
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,445
What do you say about making
a video for your parents?

731
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,709
- What kind of video?

732
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,406
- Well, when you leave,
and you say good-bye,

733
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,625
your parents aren't going
to know

734
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:47,062
that that's really good-bye,

735
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,890
so why don't you give them
that gift?

736
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,805
The real good-bye?

737
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,676
And then when I receive word
that you've passed,

738
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,418
I will make sure
that they get it.

739
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,246
- Yeah.
Seems like a good idea.

740
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,292
- Great, okay.
I'm gonna set this up.

741
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,860
We'll get you off to Aconcagua
in no time, my friend.

742
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,132
- What should I say?

743
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:14,524
- I mean, that's up to you,
really,

744
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:17,397
but try to remember that
when your parents see this,

745
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,486
they're gonna be dealing
with the fact that you're gone.

746
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,140
All right?
So--

747
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:24,447
I don't know, maybe tell them
how you want to be remembered.

748
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:26,319
Five most important memories.

749
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,238
- Hi, Mom and Dad.

750
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,501
Hi.

751
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,417
When you see this,
I'll be gone,

752
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,725
and I thought you'd like
to hear this message from me.

753
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,814
Anyway,

754
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:45,904
here are my five most important
memories.

755
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,303
Okay.
Here's one.

756
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,610
The day I got diagnosed
with cancer.

757
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,177
We were driving home
from the hospital,

758
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,440
and you offered to get me
ice cream.

759
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,659
And I was 15, and trying to be
a tough guy or whatever,

760
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,792
so I said no.

761
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,447
But later that night,
you brought me some anyway.

762
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,492
Rocky Road.

763
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,799
And it had been years since I'd
asked you to get me ice cream,

764
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,366
but you remembered
my favorite flavor,

765
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,369
and that made me feel so good.

766
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,330
Number two.

767
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:24,464
Playing Toss the Trey
when I was little.

768
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,553
Might be my first memory,
actually.

769
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,858
Getting tossed up in the air,

770
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:32,211
and not worrying
if you were gonna catch me.

771
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:34,735
And...

772
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,872
And...

773
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,223
and Thanksgiving.

774
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,964
When I tried to eat
Dad's stuffing after chemo,

775
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,227
but I got sick, and I...

776
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,537
And you had to help
clean me up.

777
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,236
And I hated it, but I remember
having this thought of,

778
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,934
"Jesus,

779
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,284
what would I do if I didn't..."

780
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,944
"If I didn't have you?"

781
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,738
Could you--could you
press stop, please?

782
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,796
- You hired unbudgeted
medical scribes?

783
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,755
You cancelled clinics?
You forged Max's signature?

784
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,453
Usually, I save my indignation
for Max,

785
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:41,932
but this time,
you outdid even him.

786
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,630
- Mm, it has been a busy day.

787
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,805
- This isn't a game, Helen.

788
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,546
You're on a branch
all by yourself,

789
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,200
and if you don't want me
to run you

790
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,289
out of this hospital for good,
you better start talking.

791
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:51,551
- Do you mind walking
a bit faster?

792
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:52,856
- I do mind.

793
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,336
Did you learn nothing
from your recent demotion?

794
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,903
- What I learned
is that sometimes

795
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,644
we have to bend the rules
in order to help our patients,

796
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:00,386
and it certainly helps that
I have no titles to stop me.

797
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,517
- God, you sound just like him.

798
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,302
- Good, because everything
I did today,

799
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:04,738
Max would have done too.

800
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:07,219
Patients are the most important
part of this hospital,

801
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:08,829
the center of everything
that we do.

802
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,222
- Believe it or not,

803
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,659
emulating Max's reckless
and irresponsible behavior

804
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,139
is not gonna win you
any points.

805
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:17,316
And where the hell
are we even going?

806
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,845
- Ma'am, inside this cooler,
you'll find the synthetic blood

807
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,499
that you requested.

808
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,501
- What's going on?
Who are you?

809
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,894
- When the Marines found out
one of our own was down,

810
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:31,982
we were determined to help.

811
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,420
- Thank you, Colonel.

812
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:35,551
You were saying?

813
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,597
- That blood will help
Reynolds' patient?

814
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,469
- It will.
- Then go!

815
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,515
- Your call is very important.

816
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,082
Please continue to hold,

817
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,866
and the next available Meals
for Seniors representative

818
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,867
will assist you.

819
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,348
- Meals for Seniors.
This is Linda.

820
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,698
- Hi, Linda,
this is Dr. Lauren Bloom

821
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,003
over at New Amsterdam.

822
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,397
I've got a patient
who is on your waitlist.

823
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,660
- I'm sorry,
I know it's frustrating,

824
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,445
but it can take years
for a client

825
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,011
to work their way to the top.

826
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:03,710
There's just too many
hungry elders.

827
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:07,627
- Right.

828
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,324
Well, look,
how much would it cost

829
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,631
to wipe out the waitlist?

830
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,936
- Are you trying to bribe me?

831
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,416
- No.
No.

832
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,896
I just wondered how much
it would cost

833
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,638
to service everyone
who's been waiting?

834
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,857
- That's a big number.

835
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,685
- Try me.

836
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,820
Oh, Eli.

837
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,213
I called Meals for Seniors.

838
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,823
Turns out they had an opening
after all.

839
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:36,699
- Hey.

840
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,005
- Hey!

841
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,660
Bobbi just wanted to make sure
Luna was okay.

842
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,358
- She is.
And Bobbi?

843
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,534
- She is.
- Good.

844
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:47,493
- That's my number.

845
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:50,365
- Oh, I'm not really--

846
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,888
- The number's for Luna.

847
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,934
For a playdate.
- Playdate?

848
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,544
- Yeah, you know,
babies on blankets,

849
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,460
spilled Cheerios, toy battles.

850
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,461
- Right.

851
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:02,377
Playdate, yep.
Heard of those.

852
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,293
- Yeah, welcome to the next
level of parenthood, Max.

853
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,606
- You gave my sister
experimental blood.

854
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,824
- Synthetic blood.

855
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,783
It's used mainly
for battlefield injuries.

856
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,785
- Which isn't actually blood
at all.

857
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:21,570
Scientists take hemoglobin,

858
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,963
the molecule
that carries oxygen,

859
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,400
and they wrap it
in a polymer coating.

860
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,402
Which means that
your sister's body

861
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:28,708
gets the oxygen that it needs,

862
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:31,537
but won't reject the blood
carrying it.

863
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,539
- Elandra's responding well
to the treatment.

864
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:37,282
She's gonna pull through.

865
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,545
- I didn't know any of this
was an option.

866
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,894
- It wasn't.

867
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,636
But Dr. Sharpe
made it happen anyway.

868
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,033
- Oh.

869
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,078
- Thank you.

870
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:06,963
- Floyd, you paged?

871
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,487
- I don't know
how I'm gonna say this,

872
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,491
so I'm gonna just say it.

873
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,494
- Okay.

874
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:18,845
- So Evie took this new job
in San Francisco,

875
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,977
and it's everything
she's ever wanted,

876
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,762
but it means it's gonna be
a lot of changes

877
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,024
happening for us,

878
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,504
and I just wanted to be
straight up with you

879
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:28,420
about my future here.

880
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:29,899
- Well, I think that's amazing.

881
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,074
Yeah, I totally get it.

882
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,554
And look, we'll make
whatever happens next

883
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,426
as painless as possible.

884
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,862
- I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

885
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,037
- Thank you.

886
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,995
- Sure.

887
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,475
It's crazy.

888
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,825
You and I have been linked
since my very first day here.

889
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:43,870
You were my first hire.

890
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,001
- Mm-hmm.
- You know that?

891
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,176
- Mm-hmm.
- Best decision I ever made.

892
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,482
- Oh, thanks.

893
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,354
- Look, just know that
whatever you need from me,

894
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:50,355
I got you.

895
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:51,573
- I'm flattered, I really am,

896
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:52,879
and I'm definitely gonna
take you up on that.

897
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,576
- Good.
I know how brutal

898
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,622
long distance
relationships can be.

899
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:57,797
- Oh, no, no, I'm--

900
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,364
- Just take a few weeks
and help Evie move

901
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,495
and get settled and--

902
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,757
- Max, that's very generous,
but that--

903
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,063
- Yeah, well, good.
You deserve it.

904
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:04,804
We'll make it work,
for both of you.

905
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,762
Right? We got this.
All right?

906
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:09,025
'Cause teamwork
makes the dream work!

907
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,418
Right, buddy?

908
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:20,080
- How did you get him
to change his mind?

909
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,734
- I didn't.

910
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,910
I think Trey just realized that

911
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:27,392
he can't finish his story

- Luna's fine.
She's totally healthy.

947
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:44,093
Turns out I was the one
who needed a little help.

948
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,096
- Did you get it?

949
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,228
- Yeah.

950
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:50,230
Think so.

951
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,928
Oh, and I heard my "no screens"
idea went down without a hitch.

952
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:54,277
- Indeed.

953
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,757
Smooth as silk.
- Good.

954
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:58,325
Best ideas usually are.

955
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,718
Good night.

956
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,245
- I'm kidding!
It was a joke.

957
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,551
It was a disaster.

958
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:10,163
I heard it was horrible.

959
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:11,730
I know.

960
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,732
I know everything that you did.

961
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:17,213
I know that my ideas only work

962
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,780
because of you,

963
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:20,216
and so, I just wanted to say--

964
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,217
- No.

965
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,262
- No?
- No.

966
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:24,220
You were gonna thank me,
right?

967
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:27,267
- I was.
- Good, no.

968
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,834
Because I'm gonna thank you.

969
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,966
- Why?

970
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,099
- I finally felt
what you must feel

971
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,927
every time you turn
this hospital on its head,

972
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,971
and it is quite the rush.

973
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,017
It is thrilling!

974
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,235
And I want more of it.

975
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,063
I want it every day.

976
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:43,283
But Max, I have been
your safety net for so long

977
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:44,763
that if I go down this road,

978
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,895
I am gonna need you
to start being mine.

979
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,815
- How can I help?
