00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,409
- I can't believe
they're still sleeping.

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,499
- I know.

3
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:25,329
I think they actually
sleep better with company.

4
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,463
Me too.

00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,508

- Mm-hmm.
You?

13
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,754

Not since...
- Me either.

21
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,477
Really?

22
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,873

- I don't think I'm ready.

26
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:42,624
- You don't have to be.

27
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,323

- Oh, you must want

36
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,172
- I knew Castro
was up to something,

37
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,522
but making her patients tumors
look worse

38
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,394
than they actually are
so that when they get better

39
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,917
it makes her trial
look more effective?

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,397
- So her trial's a sham.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,615
- I don't know the extent
of it.

42
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,487
I only know that
she's falsifying her data.

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,185
- You have to take this to Max.
- I can't.

44
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,710
Max made it policy to go public
with our mistakes.

45
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,321
To own them.

46
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:30,237
If this gets out, New Amsterdam
will lose our NIH funding,

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,455
and that is millions
of dollars.

48
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:32,848
- What about Brantley?

49
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,284
- She'd just sweep it
under the rug

50
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,372
to avoid a PR nightmare.

51
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,896
- Well, then what are you
gonna do?

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,551
- Blow up her trial.

53
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,902
- I'd read about
pituitary veinous sampling.

54
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,687
I've never
actually seen it done.

55
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,645
- Many less experienced
neurologists

56
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,345
fear this procedure because it
requires a precise localization

57
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:54,522
and sturdy hands,
which in my case is not...

58
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,788
Give me a moment, please.

59
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:05,576
Ella, I don't think
you should touch that.

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,362
- Oh, that is a she,
and her name is Calliope.

61
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:09,798
We'll call her Callie
for short.

62
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,669
I didn't think I'd ever
be ready for another pet

63
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:12,844
after Gertie died.

64
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:13,932
- Pet?

65
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,892
To live with us?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:19,199
Well, Dr. Frome thought
it might be a good idea

67
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,289
if I had an emotional support
animal to help manage my OCD.

68
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,334
And she's pretty much
the cutest, isn't she?

69
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,858
- Yes, she's cute.
Very cute.

70
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,558
I should be going.

71
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,473
- Oh, okay.
Well, we'll see you at home.

72
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,259
- Hmm.

73
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,262
Cancel the veinous sampling.
- Wait--what?

74
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,524
- Will you do that, Agnes,
please?

75
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,656
- I can't.

76
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,310
Mr. Bagey's is already
being prepped!

77
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,578
- Okay, you are more
than welcome

78
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,406
to sit down if you want.

79
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,410
Anywhere you like.

80
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:01,763
So, you are aware

81
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,287
of why your parents sent you
here to see me, right?

82
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,637
Uh, it's for refusing
to go to school.

83
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,727
And, uh, your parents say you
came back about two weeks ago

84
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,338
a different kid.

85
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,731
Won't come out of your room,
easily upset.

86
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,559
- I can't be in my room?

87
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,301
- Well, not if it means
skipping school, no.

88
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:26,048
Danica, why do you keep looking
at the door?

89
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,361
Do you--do you feel unsafe
right now?

90
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,844
Do you feel that way a lot?

91
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,846
Did something happen at school?

92
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:49,289
Danica, why are you afraid
to go to school?

93
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,076
- Because I can't stop
seeing Megan

94
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,557
lying on the floor
with a hole in her head.

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,950
That's why.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,434
- I think you guys
seriously buried the lede.

97
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,609
How could you not tell me

98
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,045
Danica was in
a school shooting?

99
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,744
- What--what school shooting?
- I think we'd know

100
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,398
if there was a shooting
at our daughter's school.

101
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,095
- There wasn't.

102
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:23,018
- How was dinner with mom?
- Oh, it was great.

103
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,846
After 20 years,
I finally told her

104
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,021
what a nightmare it was

105
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,458
being raised
by such a raging alcoholic.

106
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,331
But instead of apologizing
and accepting responsibility,

107
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,376
she said she didn't
remember it.

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,813
- Wow.
She tried to gaslight you?

109
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,424
That's messed up.

110
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:40,818
- Guess I'll add that to her
list of irredeemable qualities.

111
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,994
- Dr. Lauren Bloom?
- Yes?

112
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,520
- You've been served.

113
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,826
- Why did you tell your mother
that our wedding

114
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,132
might not be in San Francisco

115
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,873
when you know
it definitely will be?

116
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,744
- It's called
"stepping out the truth."

117
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,877
- Mmm, it's called "lying."
- I just heard.

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,011
How big
a going away party do you want?

119
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,622
Oh, no, no, no, no.

120
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,014
No thank you.

121
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,755
Um, I'm trying to keep this
all low key.

122
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,583
- Not gonna happen.
- Of course.

123
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,150
- You were saying?

124
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,935
- Well, look, my sisters and I
learned early that with Mama,

125
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,807
you gotta roll
the truth out gradually

126
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,939
so she has time to acclimate.
- Mmm.

127
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,071
- Dr. Reynolds?

128
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,942
- Oh, no going away cards,
please.

129
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,509
- You've been served.

130
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,035
- You have an administrative
meeting at 2:00.

131
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,951
- Great.
- And dermatology wants to know

132
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,911
if you could touch base
about new exam lights.

133
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:32,043
- Sounds like a plan.

134
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,394
- Have you been replaced
by a pod person?

135
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,743
- I don't think so.

136
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,136
- You hate meetings,
and these are the worst.

137
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,182
- Well, I'm just in
a very good mood,

138
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:43,403
and nothing gonna change that.

139
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,884
- Hospital's being sued.
- Okay, that didn't last long.

140
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,539
- High profile case--we're
talking community backlash,

141
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,063
media circus, and a ridiculous
amount of money on the table.

142
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,414
HCC and the mayor's office
have already called

143
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,676
to make sure
we don't screw it up.

144
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,199
- Who is it?
- George Whitney's family's

145
00:06:57,242 --> 00:07:00,028
accusing us of malpractice
and wrongful death.

146
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,899
Every doctor involved
in his care

147
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:03,640
is being sued,
including--

148
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:04,989
- Dr. Max Goodwin?
- Yes?

149
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,469
- You've been served.

150
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,350
Okay, why are you stressed?
You're out of here, aren't you?

151
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,004
- Really?

152
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,354
A patient died,
and we're being blamed for it.

153
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,487
- We didn't do anything wrong.

154
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,228
So all we can do now
is tell the truth,

155
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,359
and we're gonna be fine.

156
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,231
- Deposition prep
isn't about the truth.

157
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,407
It's about finding weak spots
in our stories.

158
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,495
So we see how strong

159
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,019
the opposition's case is
against us.

160
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,935
- Thank you, Dr. Optimism.
- He's right.

161
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,592
Hospitals go down
because of cases like this.

162
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,033
- Lauren?
I'm ready for you.

163
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,046
- To gain access to the tumor,

164
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,876
we first locate
the internal jugular vein.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,444
- BP normative,
respiration spontaneous.

166
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,143
- I'm not getting flash-back.

167
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,537
- Abscess in the airway.

168
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:17,192
- The needle broke.

169
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:20,108
- How did it break?
Needles don't just break.

170
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,936
- Well, this one just did.

171
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,503
- There's ectopy
on the monitor.

172
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,505
- The needle may be lodged
in his right ventricle.

173
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,550
If we don't get it out,
he will get a heart attack.

174
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,987
Page cardiothoracic.

175
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,250
You get him to an O.R.
- Where are you going?

176
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,557
Dr. Kapoor, what's happening?

177
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,385
- This is all happening
because of that cat.

178
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,953
What?

179
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,999
- Nurse supervisor
to main floor.

180
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,915
Nurse supervisor
to main floor.

181
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,308
- B.

182
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,573
Ready to go.

183
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,575
I'll check back
in a couple minutes.

184
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,626
- May.
Morning.

185
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,932
Uh, would you be able to get

186
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,543
a couple of extra blankets for
the chairs in there, please?

187
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,980
It's freezing.
- Sure.

188
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,635
- Thank you.

189
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,535
- Here you go, Dr. Sharpe.
- Thank you so much.

190
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
Uh, everyone
will appreciate this.

191
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,629
- We were in Mr. Marks'
history class

192
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,327
when there was this bang.

193
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,635
Mr. Marks started screaming.
Telling us to get down.

194
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,336
I looked out into the hall

195
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,166
and there was this man there
with a gun.

196
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,562
He was shooting into the class
across from us

197
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,738
over and over again.

198
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,222
Then I saw Megan coming back
from the bathroom.

199
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,487
And my brain was like,
"Go help her!"

200
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,056
But I couldn't move.

201
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,582
And then he shot her.

202
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,761
Mr. Marks was shoving a table
against the door.

203
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,416
Everyone was crying.

204
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:41,075
And I was just standing there,
staring at Megan on the ground.

205
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,086
Then the bell rang,

206
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,828
and the man stopped shooting,

207
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,612
and Megan got up.

208
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,051
And they told us
it was just a drill.

209
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,271
A stupid drill.

210
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,622
- Megan was part of it?

211
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:11,322
- So was the man firing blanks.

212
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,543
But it all felt real.

213
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,589
- Her school didn't tell us
that there would be

214
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,636
anything like this.

215
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,467
- No one knew.
Not even the teachers.

216
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,602
I know it wasn't real.
I...

217
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,174
But I feel scared all the time.

218
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:40,177
I can't go back there.

219
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,490
- Four weeks ago, a patient
named George Whitney

220
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,580
entered the ED.
Do you remember this patient?

221
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,104
- Of course I remember him.
He was, uh--

222
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,106
- Lauren, don't give more
information than was asked.

223
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,717
- Right.

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,414
Okay.

225
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,329
- Do you remember
George Whitney?

226
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:02,634
- Yes.

227
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,419
- Can you describe
Mr. Whitney's condition

228
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,463
when he entered your care?

229
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,338
- George Whitney,
30-year-old man,

230
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,035
collapsed at a street fair

231
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,820
with blurred vision, shortness
of breath, and hemiparesis.

232
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,909
Tachy, hypotensive, and
tachypneic in the field.

233
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,693
- Any allergies, Mr. Whitney?

234
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,434
You taking any medications?
- No.

235
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,783
- Okay, let's get him
to trauma one,

236
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,480
and hook him up to a monitor
on O-2.

237
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:23,743
What do we got here?

238
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,918
- How many patients were
admitted that day

239
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,441
to the best of
your recollection?

240
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:27,529
- Eight patients,

241
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,313
all presenting
with the same symptoms.

242
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,663
- And what did the police say
happened to these people?

243
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:32,839
- Some sort of smoke device
went off

244
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,101
at a Middle Eastern
Street Fair.

245
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:35,755
- They were exposed
to more than just smoke.

246
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,669
- People complain of
a weird smell at the scene.

247
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,542
- Double vision, descending
paralysis, diaphoresis.

248
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,892
Botulism toxin.
- This was a terror attack?

249
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,807
- Casey, dilute one vile
of anti-toxin

250
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,462
in 100 cc's normal saline
and infuse as slow IV drip

251
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,898
with close
hemodynamic monitoring.

252
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,204
- Copy that.

253
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,641
- But that's not what
the patient received.

254
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:53,903
- Well, that's what I told
Casey to give them.

255
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,340
- Casey wasn't working
that day.

256
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,646
- Of course he was.

257
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,824
- Nurse's schedule.
Casey's not on it.

258
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,567
- But I thought...

259
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,006
I don't...

260
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,966
- Would you care to revise
your statement, Dr. Bloom?

261
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,536
- All right, you're up.

262
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,800
- All right, let's see
what we got.

263
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,367
- Hey, doc.

264
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:46,608
- Tell me I'm crazy.
Did you sabotage my trial?

265
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:50,481
- You didn't give me a choice.

266
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,489
- What the hell
were you thinking?

267
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,751
Switching my patient's meds?

268
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,101
- Everyone got their chemo.
Everyone's safe.

269
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,190
That's all that matters.
- Oh, that's all that matters?

270
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,061
There's no control group
anymore.

271
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,194
Everyone's been dosed
with the trial additive.

272
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:10,284
- I guess you'll just have to
start your trial over again.

273
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,897
Are you really that jealous
that you have to kill it?

274
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:18,379
- I know what you did
with your patients' baselines.

275
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,473
- I only did that because
the preliminary data

276
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:28,780
showed the drug was not working
well enough on this protocol.

277
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:29,999
- Then you report that.

278
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,261
If the drug doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

279
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,394
- It will work,
when I have more time

280
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,743
to get the parameters
of the trial right,

281
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,397
and I will once it gets
to phase three.

282
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,746
- You have to shut
this down now.

283
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,356
The entire trial
has been compromised.

284
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,402
- The trial, yes,
but not the drug.

285
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:44,100
I am bringing it
to phase three.

286
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,147
- Then I am taking this to Max.

287
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,238
- If you were willing
to do that,

288
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,935
you would have done so already.

289
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,291
That's what I thought.

290
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:09,909
- These are the best active
shooter drills available.

291
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,085
These drills could save
our students' lives.

292
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,260
- Okay, if I showed you an MRI

293
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,783
from a kid
that was in your drill,

294
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,263
or an MRI from a kid
that was in an actual shooting,

295
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,655
do you know what you'd see?

296
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,962
- They would be similar?
- They would be identical.

297
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,833
Right down to
the long-term problems,

298
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,184
from the fear, the depression,
the anger, the anxiety.

299
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,012
The full PTSD buffet.

300
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,796
Trauma doesn't happen
because you're in danger,

301
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,886
it's because you think you are.
- So what would you have me do?

302
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,975
Pretend school shootings
don't exist?

303
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:33,976
- No.

304
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,195
- Ignore the law?
- No.

305
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,370
- God forbid a real shooting
happens here.

306
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:39,242
I'll be damned if my kids
aren't prepared.

307
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,288
- Okay, look,
I recognize that you are in

308
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,465
an impossible situation here,
but there are alternatives.

309
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,075
There are desktop
training programs.

310
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,512
One where the kids don't have
to act out traumatizing events.

311
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,340
Because all that does
is make them believe

312
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,168
that they've already
been through one, like Danica.

313
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,604
- Well, I'm sorry about Danica,

314
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,956
but I haven't heard
any other complaints.

315
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,261
- Well, how many students
have checked in

316
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,133
with the school's counselors?

317
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:03,005
- With all the budget cuts,
we don't have any.

318
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,009
- Well, you do now.

319
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,317
- I'm not seeing patients
today.

320
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,319
- Um, I just--

321
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:16,497
okay, how much can substance
abuse affect someone's memory?

322
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,501
- Depends on substance and the
degree to which it was abused.

323
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:24,896
Genetics can also be a factor.
Why are you asking?

324
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,946
- Um, I abused Adderall
for a while.

325
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,513
Now I'm forgetting things.

326
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,167
- What kind of things?

327
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,473
- Details about a day

328
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,649
that I should've remembered
everything about.

329
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,347
And my alcoholic mother says

330
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,045
she can't remember
the last 15 years, so,

331
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,569
I don't know, given my stellar
gene pool and my own issues,

332
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,744
maybe I'm just--

333
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,529
- Lauren, there's
a significant difference

334
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,226
between the type of memory loss

335
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,186
associated with a lifetime
of substance abuse

336
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,144
and your situation.

337
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,192
- Are you sure?

338
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:02,630
- I see you every day.
I work with you every day.

339
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,936
There is nothing
that concerns me.

340
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,027
- Okay.

341
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,333
- Your mother's condition,
on the other hand,

342
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,944
is much more serious.

343
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,645
And very real.
She may never remember.

344
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,567
- Dr. Goodwin, isn't it unusual
for you to dedicate

345
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,570
your entire day to the ED
given the scope of your duties?

346
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:33,139
- Uh, yes, but because this
was such a high profile case,

347
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,446
the mayor asked me to monitor
the victims personally.

348
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,188
- So you were there in your
capacity as medical director?

349
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,147
- That's right.

350
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,279
- Double vision, descending
paralysis, diaphoresis.

351
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,238
Botulism toxin.

352
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,631
- This was a terror attack?
- Brunstetter.

353
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:51,244
Dilute one vial of anti-toxin
in 100 cc's normal saline

354
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,375
and infuse as a slow IV drip

355
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:53,420
with close
hemodynamic monitoring.

356
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,117
- Copy that.

357
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,598
- Technician to X-ray one.
Lab technician to X-ray one.

358
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,121
- Forget the dilution.

359
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,036
Push anti-toxin in a
a single IV injection.

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,342
- I have to clear that
with Dr. Bloom.

361
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,170
- No, there isn't enough time,
okay?

362
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,736
Patients could die
unless you push the full dose

363
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,348
of anti-toxin now.

364
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,698
- So you countermanded
Dr. Bloom's order?

365
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,656
- Yes.

366
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,397
- Then she wasn't at fault
for giving an order

367
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,877
that was never carried out?

368
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,531
- I don't know if we should be
assigning blame, I think--

369
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,662
- Did all eight patients

370
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,229
respond to your treatment,
Dr. Goodwin?

371
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,581
- All but one.

372
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,455
- Kay, I got it.
It's weak, but it's there.

373
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,283
- What do you got?
- V-fib arrest.

374
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,588
A tachy hypotensive.

375
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,068
We're in the middle of an echo
when he arrested.

376
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,591
- Global left ventricular
hypokinesis.

377
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,419
We gotta to get him
to the O.R. now.

378
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:37,986
- Would you say the decision

379
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,770
to treat with a full dose of
anti-toxin was made in haste?

380
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,164
- During an emergency,

381
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,993
doctors have to make
a lot of decisions in haste.

382
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,603
- But you weren't there
as a doctor.

383
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,171
To your own admission, you were
there as medical director.

384
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,304
- I have to wear multiple hats
every day.

385
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,522
- Which hat were you wearing

386
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,045
when you countermanded
Dr. Bloom's order

387
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,351
to follow
the dilution protocol?

388
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,092
- My doctor hat.

389
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,485
- But obviously,
Nurse Brunstetter saw you

390
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,661
as the medical director.
- While that may be true,

391
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,271
I don't know what affected
their decision--

392
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,664
- Which may have meant
Nurse Brunstetter

393
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,492
may have felt unable
to contradict your directive--

394
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:06,797
- I have no idea

395
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,669
what Nurse Brunstetter
may or may not have felt--

396
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,192
- A directive that may have led

397
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,499
to George Whitney's
cardiac arrest.

398
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,196
From where I sit,

399
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,503
because you wear multiple hats,

400
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,331
one of your patients died.

401
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,904
- Okay, um, hi, everybody.
My name is Dr. Iggy Frome.

402
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,297
You can just call me Iggy.

403
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,081
Um, first of all, I'd like
to thank Principal Colvin

404
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,214
for allowing me
to speak to you all today.

405
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,477
Bet you're all pretty pumped
to be missing some class, huh?

406
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,523
Yhoo!

407
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,786
- They're missing gym.

408
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,005
- Yikes.
Uh, okay.

409
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,009
So I promise you that I'm here
for a good reason, guys.

410
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm here to talk to you
about the shooting drill

411
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,752
that happened
a couple weeks ago.

412
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,667
I want to talk to you about how
that made you feel.

413
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,671
- Yeah, okay, all right.
Yeah, fair enough.

414
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,195
I hear you loud and clear.

415
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,501
Talking about our feelings
is not your favorite subject.

416
00:19:58,545 --> 00:19:59,807
I don't blame you.

417
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,765
Why don't we try something
a little different.

418
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,767
Try something easier.
You guys like easy?

419
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,682
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good, me too.

420
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,293
Um, I'm gonna say something,

421
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,860
and if you agree,
clap your hands twice.

422
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,558
That's it.
Can you handle it?

423
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:12,950
- Yes.
- Of course you can.

424
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,040
All right, this assembly
seems crazy boring.

425
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:20,567
- Whoa.
Wow, all of you.

426
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,872
Okay, step two.

427
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,874
I'm gonna say something,
and again, if you agree,

428
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:26,703
uh, this time just come walk
down onto the court with me.

429
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:27,878
Okay?
Ready?

430
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:30,229
I sometimes feel scared
about guns.

431
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,891
- I do.
I'm scared about guns.

432
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,721
Really?
I'm the only one?

433
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,115
I find that a little hard
to believe, but okay.

434
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,856
I have had a dream

435
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,945
about the shooting drill
since it happened.

436
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,601
It doesn't need to be
a nightmare necessarily.

437
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,907
Just a dream.
Any kind of dream.

438
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,910
Yeah.

439
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,739
Good, thank you.
Come on down here.

440
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,263
Yeah, come on down.
Take a spot.

441
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,917
Anywhere on the floor with me,
okay, guys?

442
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,049
Thank you.
Okay!

443
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,833
Here's another.

444
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,313
I avoid going to where I was

445
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,054
where the shooting drill
happened.

446
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,276
Yeah, I would too.

447
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,759
I sometimes have a hard time
concentrating in class

448
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,806
because I'm thinking about
someone charging in with a gun.

449
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,988
Yeah, that would make it hard
to concentrate, wouldn't it?

450
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,946
All right, one last one.

451
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,862
When I have felt scared
since the drill,

452
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,864
I thought that
I was the only one.

453
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:48,307
Find somewhere around me.
Make sure you can all hear me.

454
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,134
Make room for everybody.
Okay.

455
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,963
We're all here.
Take a look around.

456
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,313
Look at your classmates.

457
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,274
Your feelings are not weird
or wrong

458
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,886
because we've all got them.
You've all got them, okay?

459
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,061
But those feelings,
they're not--

460
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,411
they're not gonna
just go away.

461
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:06,716
They are going to find
somewhere inside of you

462
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,022
and make a home, all right?

463
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,894
The only way to avoid that
is by talking.

464
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,635
We have to talk to each other.

465
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,202
You have to talk
to your parents.

466
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,248
Talk to your counselors.

467
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,864
So let's start talking.

468
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:33,003
You look how I feel.

469
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,092
You first.

470
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:41,664
So, I'm gonna
tell you something,

471
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,973
and I need you to not react
like "Max the Revolutionary."

472
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,846
- Which Max do you need?
- The sane medical director.

473
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,196
- Really want me
to pick a lane today.

474
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,242
- Did something happen
at deposition prep?

475
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,766
- I don't know.
I...

476
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:02,076
Starting to wonder if maybe
I'm doing this wrong.

477
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,860
- Doing what wrong?

478
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:12,260
- I wear these scrubs
so I can actually help

479
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,219
people, but what if
I'm not helping?

480
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,049
What if I'm just
making things...

481
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,792
Worse.

482
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,012
I mean, maybe I should
just wear a suit.

483
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,535
You know?

484
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,321
And actually sit at my desk
like a sane medical director.

485
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,283
Maybe it's time

486
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,285
I stopped trying to be
all things to all people.

487
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,465
- The Max who is all things
to all people

488
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,294
is the Max that we all need.

489
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,428
I need.

490
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,216
How can I help?

491
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,264
- Actually,

492
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,963
I don't need you to.

493
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,052
I have to handle this one.

494
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,883
- Dr. Flores was able
to remove the needle

495
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,928
from Mr. Bagey's heart
with no damage.

496
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,887
He should make a full recovery.
- Good.

497
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,889
Then I'm staying right here
for the rest of the day

498
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,934
to avoid doing more harm.

499
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,023
- Is there something going on
with you today?

500
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,896
- There is nothing wrong
with me.

501
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,288
- Good.

502
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,248
- The problem is the cat.

503
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,946
- Why do you keep bringing up
this cat?

504
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,818
- Ella's cat.

505
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,559
The harbinger of bad luck.

506
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,125
From the time it has showed up,

507
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,519
my entire day
has been disastrous.

508
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:40,087
And now it's going
to live with me

509
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,221
to destroy my life.
No, no, no, no, no.

510
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,310
I have to get rid of this cat.

511
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,058
- Hey, did you reorder
any of those--

512
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,973
- Kapoor says
it's probably true.

513
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,584
- Did I miss part of
this conversation?

514
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:02,022
- He said those 15 years
are probably gone.

515
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,504
From my mom.

516
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,810
- Completely?
- Could be.

517
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,858
It just pisses me off,
you know?

518
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,207
I mean, if I have to remember

519
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,339
every brutal detail
about my childhood

520
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,559
then she should have to
remember it too.

521
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:20,519
- Look.

522
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,346
I know you're hurt,

523
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,348
I know you've been carrying
around these feelings

524
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,611
for a lot of years,

525
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:30,006
but maybe it's time
to stop looking backward.

526
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,532
You know,
start looking forward.

527
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:51,201
- I don't see Max with you.
- You were right.

528
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,161
I do need Max.
- Hmm.

529
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,425
- This entire hospital
needs Max.

530
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:01,908
And six months ago he was
dying, and I couldn't save him.

531
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:04,954
But you did.

532
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,568
You knew precision oncology
was the future

533
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,048
long before anyone else.

534
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:15,922
But if I could figure out
that you falsified your data,

535
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,577
then NIH will too,
and that kind of scandal--

536
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,405
- You expect me to believe
you're worried about me?

537
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,059
- Not you.

538
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,192
Your work.

539
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,586
It's the only reason
that Max is alive.

540
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,547
- Then, what are you gonna do?

541
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,989
- I'm gonna help you
get away with it.

542
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,661
- Dr. Floyd Reynolds,

543
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,011
can you describe for me
in detail

544
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,404
what happened in your O.R.

545
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:05,928
during George Whitney's
LVAD operation?

546
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,685
- Bypass is ready when you are.
- Ah, rib spreader.

547
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,427
- Why were you placing the left
ventricular assist device?

548
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,472
- Mr. Whitney suffered
from Acute Coronary Syndrome

549
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:31,345
from a blockage in his left
main coronary artery.

550
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,738
- Did this have anything to do

551
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,957
with Dr. Goodwin's
administration of anti-toxin?

552
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,438
- No, no.
Max had nothing to do with it.

553
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,005
It was
a pre-existing condition,

554
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,964
most likely exacerbated
by the events of the day.

555
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,966
- Once you decided an LVAD
was necessary,

556
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,665
you made a second choice.

557
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,319
To install it via
a full median sternotomy

558
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:52,496
rather than the less invasive
catheter introduced LVAD.

559
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,542
Why?

560
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,500
- Well, he was unstable

561
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,025
and needed immediate help
stabilizing his blood pressure.

562
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,636
And a sternotomy
was the fastest way.

563
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,509
- So why weren't you able
to stabilize Mr. Whitney?

564
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:08,121
- TF on one.
- He's stoking out.

565
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,514
- The embolism in the MCA
is not responding to TPA.

566
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,603
- Then we need to go
with plan B: embolectomy.

567
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,170
We need to go in there
and suck it out.

568
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,216
Advancing through
the internal carotid

569
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,132
and through and into
the middle cerebral artery.

570
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,742
- You're right there.

571
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:24,093
- Performing embolectomy.

572
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:27,401
- The brain should be
re-perfusing now.

573
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,664
D-fib arrest!

574
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,666
- Intrathorvacic paddles.

575
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,363
Clear.

576
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:36,671
He died on the table.

577
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,152
- What was the cause of death?

578
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,067
- Embolic stroke.

579
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,286
- And what caused the embolism
to his brain?

580
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,725
- Sometimes they just happen.

581
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,298
- You don't think it was
because you just performed

582
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,258
an incredibly invasive
procedure on Mr. Whitney?

583
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,346
- No.

584
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,565
Uh, sometimes embolisms
just happen.

585
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,655
You know, they're a risk
for any surgery.

586
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,751
- Did you make the decision
to go more invasive,

587
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,578
before or after

588
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,756
you learned George Whitney
was a white nationalist.

589
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,716
- Did you make the decision
to go more invasive

590
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,153
before or after you learned
George Whitney was the one

591
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,589
who released the botulism toxin

592
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:28,201
at the Middle Eastern
Street Fair?

593
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,261
- Next question.

594
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,967
- Dr. Nottingham,
thanks for coming in.

595
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,838
Please take a seat.

596
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,152
I'm not recording this.

597
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:07,588
No one's gonna get in trouble,

598
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,069
I just need you to tell me
the truth.

599
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,592
- The truth?

600
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:14,551
- I need you to tell me exactly
what happened in the O.R.

601
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,423
during George Whitney's
LVAD surgery.

602
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,909
- Chest is open.

603
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,998
- Lab results are back.
- And?

604
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,174
- White count 5.2.
Hematocrit 39.

605
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,829
Botulism anti-toxin
276 micrograms--

606
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:31,960
- Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

607
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,570
276?
- Correct.

608
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,789
- That's twice
the expected level.

609
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,312
Did he get a double dose?

610
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,445
- Maybe he predosed himself
assuming he'd be exposed.

611
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:39,707
- Why would he do that?

612
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,883
- Maintain paralysis
through a sternotomy.

613
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,580
- Because he's
a white supremacist.

614
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,408
This racist son of a--

615
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:46,670
he almost killed seven people

616
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,324
and now we have to
save his life.

617
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,979
- Dr. Nottingham, we do not
judge the people on this table,

618
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,981
we just treat them.

619
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,896
- So you realized
George Whitney

620
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,898
was the perpetrator
after you made the decision

621
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:00,119
to perform the more invasive
LVAD procedure?

622
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:01,903
- Yes.

623
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,992
Dr. Reynolds had already
cracked the chest

624
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,647
when I saw the tattoo.

625
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,911
- Thank you, Dr. Nottingham.

626
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,044
Uh, you can go.

627
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,921
- Evie, I'm impressed.

628
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,663
You're even interviewing
the residents.

629
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,666
So, what's
the hospital's liability?

630
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,975
- Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Bloom,
and Dr. Reynolds--

631
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,933
none of them caused
George Whitney's death.

632
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,457
- That's good to hear.

633
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,198
- But if I put any of them
on the stand,

634
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,722
the plaintiff's attorney
will rip them to shreds.

635
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,463
- Why?

636
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:43,249
- They all made choices that
would appear suspect to a jury.

637
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,947
I know this will be
a big pay out,

638
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,863
but to avoid a bigger one,
we need to settle.

639
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,656
- Oh, he's coming in hot.

640
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,223
- Forgive me, Ella,

641
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,747
but your cat cannot enter
our home.

642
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,880
- Why?
- You know me.

643
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,969
I'm--I'm educated,
and reasonable,

644
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,884
and modern, but to a point.

645
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,844
But black cats--wherever
they go, bad luck follows.

646
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,585
- So you're superstitious.

647
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,501
- Yes, and I'm ashamed
to admit it.

648
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,634
Because for you it may be
a silly superstition,

649
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:21,983
but for me it's real.

650
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,899
The stress this cat
has caused me is unbearable.

651
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,249
- I understand completely.

652
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:28,903
- You do?

653
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,688
- Unbearable stress
over irrational fears?

654
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:34,169
That's pretty much how my OCD
makes me feel every single day.

655
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,866
Like, sometimes I think
I'm losing it,

656
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,521
and I would never want you
to feel that way too.

657
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:43,135
- Does this cat
really help your OCD?

658
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:46,877
- Yeah, uh, so, um.

659
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,705
Like, if I'm obsessing
over something,

660
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,098
and I can't stop.

661
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,013
Like my pregnancy or what kind
of mom I'm gonna be.

662
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,581
Callie does this little thing
where she flips belly up

663
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,844
and then she tucks her head
under my hand.

664
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,107
It just gives me something else
to focus on.

665
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,109
It--she brings me back
to Earth.

666
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,026
- Then you must keep this cat.

667
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,247
- Really?
Are you sure?

668
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,249
- Yes.
That's my final decision.

669
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,947
But there's one thing
you must do.

670
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,993
Change its name.

671
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,255
- What's wrong with Callie?

672
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,909
- Kali is a sacred
Hindu goddess.

673
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,782
Often associated with
the bloody death of demons.

674
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:30,269
- I didn't help Megan.
- I didn't help Megan.

675
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:35,013
- I was scared like a baby.
- I was scared like a baby.

676
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,669
Got it?
Okay, now you mirror me.

677
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,629
I wanted to run to Megan.

678
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,848
- I wanted to run to Megan.

679
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,764
- But I was doing
what the teacher said.

680
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,245
- But I was doing
what the teacher said.

681
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:53,031
- I did the best that I could.

682
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,298
It's okay.
You can say it.

683
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,778
I did the best I could.

684
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:05,260
- Yeah, you did.

685
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,609
You see?

686
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,089
The story itself
is less powerful

687
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,135
than the way we tell it,
isn't it?

688
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,096
I'm just...

689
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,274
I'm really sorry.

690
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:21,711
- For what?

691
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,888
- For all us adults making you
kids deal with this problem

692
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,847
rather than fixing it
ourselves.

693
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,414
That's not fair.
- Yeah.

694
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:31,765
We've received your
thoughts and prayers, thanks.

695
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,116
- But you know
what gives me hope?

696
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,162
- What?
- You.

697
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,686
You and your whole generation.
You've blown me away.

698
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,819
You're already taking on the
big issues way better than us.

699
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,691
- No pressure.

700
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,172
Yeah, no pressure.

701
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,305
So for now, your only job
is to do the exercises,

702
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:54,222
and I promise you,
the fear will subside.

703
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:56,398
You will feel safe again.

704
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:58,705
We all will.

705
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,942
- I didn't think
I'd ever hear from you again.

706
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:23,251
- I didn't think
you would either.

707
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:25,906
- So why did you wanna
meet here?

708
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,913
- I thought maybe we could try
and make some new memories.

709
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,799
- I'm here to tender
my resignation.

710
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,368
- Why--why would you resign?

711
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,762
- My study's been compromised.

712
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,329
- How?

713
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,812
- It's entirely my fault,

714
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,902
but my duties as chair
compromised my focus.

715
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,818
Things fell through the cracks.

716
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,385
- What?
No.

717
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,387
Listen, we can
work something out, okay?

718
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,737
You can start your trial over.
Here.

719
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,742
- No.
Thank you.

720
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,918
I need to be centered
on my research right now,

721
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,182
and I cannot do that here.

722
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,835
- Castro needs to go somewhere

723
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,968
where she can be more vigilant
about her process.

724
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:31,232
It's an important trial.
People will be watching.

725
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,930
With more scrutiny than ever.

726
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,326
- She's right.

727
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,765
- Okay.
Then, um,

728
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,855
I guess I accept
your resignation,

729
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,857
effective--
- Immediately.

730
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,818
- I'll help her get her things.

731
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:58,041
After you.

732
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,434
- Be well, Max.

733
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,275
- Why didn't you just tell me
the truth about George Whitney?

734
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,586
- Well, I thought--

735
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,372
- You thought you could just
step out the truth?

736
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:28,028
Didn't you?

737
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:31,814
- Whatever you think you know,
you don't.

738
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,266
- TF on one.

739
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,050
- He's the terrorist?

740
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,486
- You're just now
figuring that out?

741
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,140
Pre-dosed himself
with the anti-toxin,

742
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,316
in the event that
he'd be exposed.

743
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,404
- It doesn't look like
it worked too well.

744
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,493
- Nope.
Racist son of a--

745
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,932
Tried to kill seven people,
now we have to save his life.

746
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,464
Sorry, I--

747
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:15,162
I don't know why, uh--

748
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:18,557
Just do what we do,
and do it well.

749
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,256
- Why didn't you
just tell me that?

750
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,389
You didn't do anything wrong.

751
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,305
- But I did.

752
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:30,960
As a role model,
as a leader,

753
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:34,660
I never should have said
those words.

754
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,531
Not in my O.R.

755
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,058
You know, I remember
the first time knowing

756
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,060
I wanted to be a doctor.

757
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,367
I was learning
about Bessie Smith.

758
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,456
- Empress of Blues.
- Yep.

759
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,371
Died after
being refused service

760
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:53,374
in an all-white hospital.

761
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:56,682
Buried in an unmarked grave.

762
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,600
I knew right then that I wanted
to become a doctor,

763
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,341
without prejudice.

764
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:09,259
And I hate that you or anyone

765
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:12,001
had to see that
I couldn't do that.

766
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:14,395
- But you are that.

767
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,006
You live that every day.

768
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,705
That's one of the many reasons
why I'm marrying you.

769
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:26,320
But let me tell you one thing,
Dr. Reynolds.

770
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:33,371
If you ever step out the truth
with me...

771
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,986
I will seriously mess you up.

772
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,739
- Okay, what was that?

773
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:55,349
- Exactly what you saw.

774
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,960
- What I saw
was pure theatrics.

775
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,658
- Max, I handled the situation.

776
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,965
- I can see that, but what
exactly is the situation?

777
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,663
- Well, let's just say that

778
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:08,057
Castro hasn't changed since
I fired her the last time.

779
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,711
She is a very talented doctor,

780
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:12,105
but she's always gonna let
ambition get in her way.

781
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,499
- Then why did you
bring her back?

782
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,764
Why did you give her
half your department?

783
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:26,336
- You have a good night, Max.

784
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,035
- I wanna know.
- I think you already do.

785
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:35,171
- Then just tell me.

786
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:38,218
- For God's sake, Max.

787
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,350
