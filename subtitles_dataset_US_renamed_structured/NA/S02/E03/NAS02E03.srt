1
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,008
- I've been down an assistant,
and I need someone

2
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,140
who can keep the trains running
at one of the most

3
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,664
complex health institutions
in the country.

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,318
- I have specialized
in logistics

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:18,148
at not-for-profits with
client bases north of 100,000.

6
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,237
- Well, I oversaw
operational budgets

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,065
at best-in-class
public hospitals

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,588
in Boston and Philadelphia.

9
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,503
- Boston andPhiladelphia.

10
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,157
Uh, you'll need
to be proficient

11
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:30,204
in a bunch of boring yet very
complicated admin software

12
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,336
that, uh, frankly,
I don't know how to use.

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,424
- I have four years experience

14
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,774
consulting on
next-gen EHR coding.

15
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,385
- Well,
I've secured multiple grants

16
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:40,040
to install electronic records
systems at rural hospitals.

17
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,693
- Wow, is that a pie chart?

18
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,694
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,609
- It's very...detailed.

20
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,481
- I don't own a computer.

21
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,399
- You don't, um...

22
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,315
Any medical sector experience,
or?

23
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,186
No, sir.

24
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,187
- No.

25
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,319
It's, uh--

26
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,191
- Todd Benson.
- Todd Benson, yeah.

27
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,672
Uh, quick question, buddy,
I don't mean to be rude,

28
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,369
but are you sure
you're at the right interview?

29
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,936
- Yes sir, um,

30
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,721
I've had a little trouble
transitioning from my last job.

31
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,506
- Which was what, exactly?

32
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,507
- Well, on a given day,

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,422
I would organize
information flow

34
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,859
between the British,
the French, the Afghans,

35
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:20,123
and 90 Chinook helicopters.

36
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,298
- You're a veteran.

37
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,474
- Yes, sir.
Army, four tours.

38
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,868
- Is that on your, uh, résumé?
- No, sir.

39
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,784
I found that it
freaks some people out.

40
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,568
Oh, right.

41
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,744
Well, uh, Todd,

42
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,529
I'm sorry to say this,

43
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,314
but I don't know
if you're the right...fit.

44
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,535
As much as I'm deeply indebted
for your service.

45
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:45,148
- I need this job,
Dr. Goodwin.

46
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,324
My VA insurance
can't cover a gopher hole,

47
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,761
and more than that, I...

48
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,460
I need a place
to feel useful again.

49
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,767
- Well, um, how about this?

50
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,901
Why don't I have HR keep you
in mind for something that, uh,

51
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,685
better suits your skill set?

52
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,514
- I spent six years
in the Middle East,

53
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,168
coordinating four languages,

54
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,605
$3 billion worth
of military gear,

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,434
and the lives of my friends.

56
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,610
I may not know computers,

57
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:16,266
but if there is one thing my
skill set definitely includes,

58
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,313
it's knowing how to
make the trains run on time.

59
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,619
All I'm asking
is you give me a shot.

60
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,412
- Welcome to--

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,721
- I am so sorry,

62
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,854
but in order for
the drug tests to be valid,

63
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,204
I have to, um, to watch.

64
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,424
- Well, I have peed in front
of you a million times.

65
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,730
You just weren't the
deputy medical director then.

66
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,732
And, my job didn't
depend on the results,

67
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,169
and you know what?

68
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,171
I kinda wish I hadn't worn
such sexy underwear.

69
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,783
How about we
change the subject?

70
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,263
I'm thinking about adopting--

71
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,700
- I have been having sex
with my physical therapist.

72
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,832
- What?
No.

73
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,051
Zach Ligon?

74
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,748
- I know, I know, I know,
he's the worst.

75
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,273
- He is smug and shallow, and--

76
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,449
- I needed a distraction, okay?

77
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:10,233
- He's your doctor!
- He's my colleague.

78
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,235
Who then tragically
became my doctor,

79
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,758
but you know what?

80
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,978
I'm totally over it and
it's never gonna happen again.

81
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,546
- I mean, I shouldn't judge.

82
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,983
After all, this is the most
intimate I've been anybody

83
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,246
since Akash and I broke up.

84
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,379
- Then I am glad that
I wore my sexy underwear.

85
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,514
Oh...
I don't know.

86
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,561
Before the crash, I thought
I'd figured it all out.

87
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,607
Not just with him,
but as a doctor.

88
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,087
- You know what?
Don't do that.

89
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,915
Look, it didn't work out
with a guy you were dating.

90
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,612
Join the club.

91
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,310
You're killing it as a doctor.

92
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,877
Look how much money you raised
for precision oncology.

93
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,445
- "Dr. Helen" raised
that money, not Dr. Sharpe.

94
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,751
- Oh, God.

95
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:53,015
Don't be so quick
to discount your celebrity.

96
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,538
'Cause life...

97
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,932
it's a little bit
like a drug test.

98
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,240
It counts more...
when people watch.

99
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,418
- You have the face of a man

100
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,854
who just paid off
his student loans.

101
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,943
- Hey, Evie's coming back
from San Fran tomorrow.

102
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,901
- Been six weeks already?
That went fast.

103
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,338
For you.

104
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,557
I'm planning a wedding
by myself.

105
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,603
I can't relate
to people in love.

106
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:22,305
- Renée, Renée, Renée...

107
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:23,915
- Don't say it, Dr. Reynolds.

108
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,352
- Well, what's it been?

109
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,789
Two weeks since our
coronary artery bypass?

110
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,444
Looks like you reopened the
vein at the extraction site.

111
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,489
- I fell.

112
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,448
- Well, that's quite a fall,
Renée.

113
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,014
- The fall wasn't so bad.

114
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,974
It's just that
I couldn't get up.

115
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,323
- How long
were you on the ground?

116
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,020
- 14 hours.

117
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,762
- Renée.

118
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,416
- I know, I know.

119
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,506
Ever since Patrick passed,

120
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,291
it's just been me.

121
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,381
- Well, who found you?
- The delivery man.

122
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,992
He knocked on my door
by mistake.

123
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,081
He was looking
for my neighbor.

124
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:02,345
It was so humiliating.

125
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,696
- No, come on.
No, hey...

126
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,524
I'm here.

127
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,614
I'm gonna get you fixed up,
all right?

128
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,616
Vince Martinelli, 47.

129
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,576
BP 80 over 40, he's tachy
with a heart rate of 130.

130
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,621
Diaphoretic and showing signs
of dehydration.

131
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,449
Found him collapsed at a
construction site over on 19th.

132
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,624
- Thanks,
we'll take him from here.

133
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,626
Mr. Martinelli?
My name is Dr. Bloom.

134
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,324
- Am I dying?
- Not if I can help it.

135
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,673
Let's hang
a liter of PlasmaLyte.

136
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,152
We're gonna run another EKG

137
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,763
to figure out what's going on
with your heart, okay?

138
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,981
Has this ever happened to you
before?

139
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,635
- No, never.

140
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,637
Been feeling like I was coming
down with the flu all week,

141
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,160
and then this happened.

142
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,814
- Well, good news is you're
not having a heart attack.

143
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,076
- When can I be
back on the job?

144
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,382
- One step at a time, okay?

145
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,688
- No hours, no pay, Doc.

146
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:43,125
- I get it, but there is
something going on.

147
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,648
You notice
anything else recently?

148
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,781
- Yeah, well...

149
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,829
My pee...

150
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,441
I've seen some blood in there,
too.

151
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:56,791
That's bad, right?

152
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,409
- Todd, I know that
your military service

153
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,020
has instilled in you
a deep respect for rank,

154
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,066
but if you're gonna replace
my old assistant,

155
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,024
then I need you to be
way less respectful.

156
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,461
- Yes, sir.
- No, sir!

157
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,376
See, there's no sir-ing
at New Amsterdam.

158
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,682
Just loosen up,
speak your mind, you know?

159
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,988
- Yo, Max,
wait up.

160
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,556
- Yeah, see, Dr. Reynolds
is a perfect example

161
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,427
of our informal,
laid-back vibe.

162
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,689
- Uh, permission
to speak freely?

163
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,517
- Granted.
- Todd--

164
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,779
- I got a post-op patient

165
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,215
who has just readmitted
after falling.

166
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,043
Now I gotta stitch up
her graft on her leg, again.

167
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,480
- Medicare should cover
the surgery.

168
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,742
- Well, they should.

169
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:35,786
What they don't cover
is the in-house checkups

170
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,918
my patient really needs

171
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,049
to make sure
she doesn't come back again.

172
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,442
- You're talking about
a live-in nurse?

173
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,922
- No, no, Max,
just check-ups.

174
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,706
Look--this isn't the first time
this has happened here.

175
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,534
Unless we do something,
it won't be the last.

176
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:45,796
- All right, I'm on it.

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,450
I will take it to the board
this morning.

178
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,104
- Yes, sir.
- Nope, don't start that.

179
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,105
- Yes, sir.

180
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,715
- That's not a thing!

181
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:58,722
Is it possible

182
00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,767
we got the wrong day?

183
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,422
Or...time or, uh, place?

184
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,727
Is this the right room?

185
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,077
- Well,
you're five minutes early.

186
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,645
- How did that happen?
- Punctuality shows discipline.

187
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,255
If you can't rely on someone

188
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:13,781
to be on time, how can you rely
on them for anything else?

189
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:17,741
- Guess we've just been...
kind of winging it, Todd.

190
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,222
- Vince Martinelli's labs,
hot off the press.

191
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,966
- Normal, normal, normal,
within range...

192
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,402
wait, wait--

193
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,796
his cobalt serum value
is 60 micrograms per liter?

194
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,624
- Cobalt poisoning.
How'd he get that?

195
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,016
- Okay, uh, page Sharpe

196
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,801
and get the Department
of Public Health on the line.

197
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:36,891
We may need to shut down
his construction site.

198
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,242
- Resolve to renew
our partnership

199
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,505
with Le Bernardin
for next year's gala.

200
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,941
Second?

201
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,596
The motion proceeds.
All in favor?

202
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,816
Then très bien
for Le Bernardin.

203
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,907
Next item, the gala's theme.

204
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,212
I'm thinking...

205
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,953
masquerade.

206
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,999
- Point of order, uh...

207
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,217
Sorry,
am I saying that right?

208
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,697
Is it point of order?

209
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,786
- It's a thing you can say.

210
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,918
- Good, point of order.

211
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,789
This is a waste of time.

212
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,748
Uh, masquerade,
no masquerade--

213
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,140
doesn't really matter.

214
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,794
I'd like to talk about
Renée Hamrick.

215
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,100
- Max, we have an agenda--

216
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,972
- Renée Hamrick
had heart surgery here

217
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,583
three weeks ago,
and she made it.

218
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,628
But because
of nonexistent post-op care,

219
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:21,152
she ended up back
in our hospital today,

220
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,764
to do it all over again.

221
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,548
So I would like to propose

222
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,725
the New Amsterdam
Visiting Nurses Agency.

223
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,814
We sent select nurses
to our patients' homes

224
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,207
to provide after-care check-ins

225
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,949
and at this year's gala
we can all raise a glass,

226
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,907
knowing that
what happened to Renée Hamrick

227
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,040
will never happen again.

228
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,781
All in favor?

229
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,565
- Someone has to second.

230
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,307
- Can I get a second?

231
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,222
Can I get a second?

232
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,615
- No second.

233
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,226
Dr. Goodwin's
characteristically uplifting

234
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,012
yet exorbitantly priced
proposal is rejected.

235
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,711
Selecting
our newest board member.

236
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:58,755
- That's it?
This is our--

237
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,800
- The binders in front of you

238
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,671
have a bio
of Lamont Hallstrom.

239
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,978
Lamont is a top dog
at AQP's hedge fund

240
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,588
and he's eager to serve.

241
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,851
Now, we vote tomorrow morning,
10:30 sharp.

242
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,592
But since
he's running unopposed--

243
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,160
- Yeah, actually,
he's not running unopposed,

244
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,857
and correct me if I'm wrong,

245
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,164
but our by-laws state that any
member can nominate candidates,

246
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,688
so as a member...

247
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:21,604
I happen to have
the perfect candidate in mind.

248
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,216
- So, who's your
perfect candidate?

249
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,045
- No idea, Todd, but I've got
24 hours to figure that out.

250
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,873
- Oh, so you lied
to your superior?

251
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,924
- The board is what you get
when power is in the hands

252
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,316
of rich people whose only
friends are other rich people

253
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,144
who've never even met
a regular guy like you or me.

254
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,232
- But you're rich.

255
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,625
- Me?
No, not by a long shot.

256
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,062
- Are you debt-free
and making six figures a year?

257
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,977
- Uh, well--
- Then you're rich.

258
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,762
- Yeah, but not, like,
rich-rich.

259
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,242
- Are most of your friends
other doctors?

260
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,287
- I mean, kind of, but--

261
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,505
- So then
your friends are rich.

262
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,072
What are you getting at, Todd?

263
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,639
- Well, actually,
you're a lot like the board.

264
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,206
- I'm like those guys?
No, no, no.

265
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,555
They--they're board people,
okay?

266
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,643
They all went to Harvard.

267
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,644
- Where'd you go?

268
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,124
- Brown,
but that's liberal Ivy.

269
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,168
It's totally different.

270
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,343
- Okay.
- You know what, Todd?

271
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,606
You're dismissed.

272
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,176
- Rohan Beta!

273
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,439
Is there a game tonight?

274
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:15,745
Did I forget to put it
in my calendar?

275
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,009
- No, no,
we didn't have plans.

276
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,010
I have some news.

277
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,011
- News?

278
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,404
Come, sit, sit.

279
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,493
What is your news?

280
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,626
- Um...my band...

281
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,629
we, uh, kind of have
this cool thing going.

282
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,369
- What cool thing?

283
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,720
- It's a tour, a big tour.

284
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,199
Huge, actually.

285
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,027
We're gonna be on the road
for months.

286
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,115
Now,
I know you don't approve--

287
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,116
- No, no, no, no.

288
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,553
You're following your dreams.

289
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,773
I'm very proud of you, Beta.

290
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,557
I would like to help.

291
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,734
Can I send you some money
while you're on the road?

292
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,692
Isn't that what you call it?
On the road?

293
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:50,780
- Yeah.

294
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:53,696
But no,
I need to do this on my own.

295
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,438
There's one thing
you could do for me.

296
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,222
- Anything you need.

297
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,399
- Look out for Ella for me.

298
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,358
I don't want her
to feel too alone.

299
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,708
- Oh, of course I will.

300
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:19,330
- You guys are so annoying--
seriously!

301
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,724
- No, guys, we have to start
over--he didn't say anything.

302
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,812
- It doesn't matter!
- Yes it does.

303
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,814
that's the point of the game.

304
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,642
Say something!

305
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,210
- Okay.
- It's always the same thing

306
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,603
with her--it's like she's
the only one with problems.

307
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,735
- Okay, okay, Shoshanna.

308
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,345
It's fine to have
emotions in here.

309
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,869
Obviously, that's
the whole point,

310
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:39,307
but let's try to remember
intent versus impact, okay?

311
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,744
Emily, what's going on?

312
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:42,832
What's happening with you?

313
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,791
- I just feel alone.

314
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,227
- Why do you think
you feel alone?

315
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,272
Come on,
back in the circle here.

316
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,840
- Nobody cares
what I think.

317
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,537
I don't matter
to anyone.

318
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:53,756
- #truth.

319
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,540
Shoshanna, please.

320
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,847
You know,
it's okay to feel alone.

321
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,457
We all feel alone
from time to time, right?

322
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,720
Even when we aren't, right?

323
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,634
Daniel, what about you?
How do you feel?

324
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,550
- Yeah, I guess
I feel alone sometimes.

325
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,291
And I...

326
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,379
and I just...

327
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,642
- Ooh, hold on.
Emily?

328
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:11,643
You okay?

329
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,211
- Something...

330
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,213
something smells weird
in here.

331
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,869
Like rotten eggs.

332
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,916
- Okay, well, I'm--
I don't smell anything, so--

333
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,308
- I smell it, too.

334
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,658
Like,
really gross rotten eggs.

335
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,312
- Um, you're all smelling it?

336
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,314
Okay, uh, let's be safe.

337
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,576
Everyone, come on,
let's get up.

338
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,621
Up and out of the class.

339
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:35,493
We will go
to a less stinky locale.

340
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,147
Come on, Emily, you'll be okay.
Come on.

341
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,238
All right, everybody down.
Yep, you know where to go.

342
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,239
- Something wrong?

343
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,719
- Um, maybe, yeah.

344
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,548
Can you get maintenance?
We may have a gas leak.

345
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,771
- Great news
for Renée Hamrick.

346
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,642
- Oh, the board approved
visiting nurses?

347
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:54,948
- Not yet,
not by a long shot.

348
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,732
But, once they approve
my new candidate,

349
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,733
I am confident they will.

350
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,169
- That's fantastic.

351
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,389
Who'd you, uh, sucker into
signing up for that?

352
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,697
No, no.

353
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,351
- Yeah.

354
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,484
Just hear me out,

355
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:10,702
because I need
an ally on the board,

356
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,269
one of us, someone who can
make sure that

357
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,576
when programs like the Visiting
Nurse's Agency come up,

358
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,708
Brantley can't just--
brush 'em aside.

359
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,233
- What time are the meetings?
- 10:30 on Wednesday.

360
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:21,539
- Look, Max, I'd love to help,

361
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,672
but the reason that the board
meets at 10:30 every Wednesday

362
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,326
is because
they don't have other jobs.

363
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,544
I have surgery.

364
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,850
- It would suck
to miss surgery,

365
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,374
but, it could mean that
the next Renée Hamrick

366
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,855
wouldn't need
additional surgery at all.

367
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,726
So, think about it.

368
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,206
Come on buddy,
what do you say?

369
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,861
Me and you,
shaking things up.

370
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:42,734
- All right, I'm in.

371
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,519
- Yes, yes!
Thank you.

372
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,304
- Dr. Reynolds?
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,479
- No.
- No?

374
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,698
- $4.75.
- Keep it.

375
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,395
- Oh, thank you.
- No, don't thank her.

376
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,570
she's undermining elections.

377
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:53,876
- No one's undermining
anything, Max.

378
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,964
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,226
- I'm giving you reality,

380
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,402
a thankless task
which appears to be my lot.

381
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,448
- Dr. Reynolds is accomplished.

382
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,538
He is dynamic, he knows
this hospital inside and out.

383
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,322
- Can Dr. Reynolds raise
seven figures?

384
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,367
No.

385
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,759
Can he donate it himself?
No.

386
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,848
Ergo, he's out.

387
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,327
Money is how programs

388
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,982
like the Visiting Nurse's
Program gets funded.

389
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,679
If you want to play this game,

390
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,334
bring me a candidate
the board can actually use.

391
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,727
- Like another rich sycophant?

392
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,556
- Like a CEO, a hedge fund
manager, or a celebrity.

393
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,601
Better yet, all three.

394
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:24,602
Happy hunting!

395
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,782
Oh, oh.

396
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,437
- Okay, um...

397
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,612
- Is Emily gonna be okay?

398
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,527
- I'm handling it, Daniel.

399
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,007
- You didn't exactly
answer the question.

400
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,530
- Okay, you know what?
That's enough.

401
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:40,749
Head to the classroom,
everybody.

402
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,577
Thank you, I'll be there
in a second.

403
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,621
Thank you.

404
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,406
Here, yeah, come on.
Take a seat.

405
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,280
Not feeling any better, huh?

406
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:53,283
- My head still hurts
and I'm seeing spots.

407
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,850
- Yeah, you know, natural gas,

408
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,634
it can deprive
our body of oxygen

409
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:58,810
and it causes all these
nasty little symptoms.

410
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,334
It's called hypoxia.

411
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,466
- No gas leak.

412
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,772
- I'm sorry, what?

413
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,469
No gas leak?
Um, hang on.

414
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,949
Just keep breathing,
okay kiddo?

415
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,559
What are you talking about?

416
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,431
Emily is literally retching
her guts up on the floor.

417
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,086
- Building services checked
the entire floor twice.

418
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,832
- All right, page Kapoor.

419
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,704
Thank you.

420
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,706
- I don't want any trouble.

421
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,316
- I understand that,
Mr. Martinelli,

422
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,796
but we need you to tell us

423
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,493
what you've seen
at your construction site.

424
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,756
- Any old signs of labels
talking about cobalt,

425
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,975
or other heavy metals?

426
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,324
- No, nothing like that.

427
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,760
- What about old insulation?

428
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,371
- They're running
a clean shop, I swear,

429
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,720
and they're square by me,

430
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,591
especially how they treated me
since my accident.

431
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,766
- What accident?

432
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,855
- I was welding early on
on the joists,

433
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,988
fell 10 feet
and shattered my hip.

434
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,816
- Gosh, you're lucky
that was all.

435
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,861
- And I was out a while.

436
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,690
But the foreman,
after my hip replacement,

437
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:53,865
put me on site hauling.

438
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,738
He didn't have to do that.

439
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:00,002
- Um, what do they have
you doing as a site hauler?

440
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,569
- Driving the trash away.

441
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,963
It's the cushiest job
I've ever had for the money.

442
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,835
- Mr. Martinelli, are you okay
if we check something?

443
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,359
- With that?

444
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,404
- All you're gonna feel

445
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,623
is a slight pinch
and some pressure.

446
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,034
- Bloom, that's not blood.

447
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,172
- What the hell?

448
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,521
- Mr. Martinelli,

449
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,611
you're being poisoned
by your artificial hip.

450
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,961
- Emily's symptoms could be
caused by any number of things.

451
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,615
I need to order
some further tests.

452
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,920
- Oh, come on,
don't give me that.

453
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,748
Your beautiful mind
already has a diagnosis.

454
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,923
No.

455
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,013
I have a hypothesis.

456
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:57,451
I suspect Emily is suffering
from a complex migraine.

457
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,105
- A complex migraine?
- Iggy!

458
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,976
Come quick,
something's wrong.

459
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,977
- What?

460
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,200
- Oh, whoa.

461
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:12,031
You might need to revise
that hypothesis.

462
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,296
- So, Renée Hamrick is here

463
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,514
for an I&D
in the primary closure

464
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,299
of her left leg's
saphenous vein graft site,

465
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,257
and the position
looks good to me.

466
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,824
We're ready to proceed.

467
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,304
- Okay.

468
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:25,609
- Alicia, go ahead and start
the general anesthetic.

469
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,090
And for you,
I've got some good news.

470
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:32,877
- Usually you wait till
after the surgery to say that.

471
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:35,228
- I was just appointed
to the hospital board.

472
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,882
And for my first act in office,
I intend to make sure

473
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,015
you have someone
to check on you post-op--

474
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,147
free of charge.

475
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,322
- You can do that?

476
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,888
- Oh, absolutely.

477
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,194
See you when you wake up.

478
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,196
- Dr. Reynolds!

479
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,244
- I'm in the middle
of something.

480
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,854
- Okay,
I have some bad news,

481
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,247
so I'm just gonna say it really
fast: you're not on the board.

482
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,118
- What?
Well, who'd you get?

483
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,293
- No one.

484
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,990
They just, you know,
didn't want you.

485
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,472
Max, I just promised this woman

486
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:05,171
that we would look after her
this time around.

487
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,433
- And we're gonna
keep that promise.

488
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,174
- How, exactly?

489
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,393
I think I know.

490
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,571
- Do you know how hard
the FDA makes it

491
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,530
to answer one simple question?

492
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,879
- What's the question?

493
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,533
- If we put this hip
into someone's body,

494
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,882
will it kill them?

495
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,449
- Is that a real question?

496
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,973
- The FDA stopped approving
metal-on-metal hips in 2016

497
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,540
due to higher risks,
but how does that help

498
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:30,283
the 3,000 patients that we gave
these hips to before 2016?

499
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,458
- I am so glad you asked that,

500
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,286
because that is
exactly the kind of issue

501
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,548
that you are gonna be solving

502
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,420
when you are on the board
of New Amsterdam.

503
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,682
- On the board?

504
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,293
You're my first choice.

505
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,425
You don't want Dr. Sharpe,
you want Dr. Helen.

506
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,427
- Yes, that is true,
Brantley needs a celebrity.

507
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,559
- Max,
when you first got here,

508
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,213
you asked me to scale down
on publicity

509
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,997
and scale up on medicine,

510
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,999
which gave me purpose,
a renewed sense of self,

511
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,262
something I could really use
right about now.

512
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,481
- I know, but I really need

513
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,483
one of us on the board
to make a difference,

514
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,137
someone who
represents our views,

515
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,399
and Brantley already
nixed Reynolds.

516
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,488
- Oh, gosh, I thought
I was your first choice.

517
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,403
- First in my...heart.

518
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,406
- Oh Max, I would love
to help you and this hospital,

519
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,408
but Brantley
will never approve me,

520
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,887
celebrity or not,

521
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,151
because effective chairmen
only approve board members

522
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,282
that they agree with,

523
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,371
and that's most definitely
not one of us.

524
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,506
- Okay.

525
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:27,601
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Whoa.

526
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,255
It's not a covert operation,
Todd.

527
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,778
- You need anything?

528
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,649
- Nope, I'm all good,
and by all good I mean all bad,

529
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,216
but in your free time,

530
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,740
feel free to run some errands
or stop by the VA.

531
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,438
- Unless I have
six weeks of free time,

532
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,135
I won't be able to deal
with the wait at the VA.

533
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,702
- Oh, well, let me make a call.
I'll get you in.

534
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,660
- Nope, thank you--I don't
want any special treatment.

535
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,445
It's what you get
with socialized medicine.

536
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,316
- Oh, and you're not
a fan of socialized medicine.

537
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,318
- It's un-American.
- It's un-American?

538
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:53,017
What could be more American
than helping people?

539
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,019
- A system
that embraces competition

540
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,544
rather than relying on
a captive patient population.

541
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,155
- We are standing
in a public hospital,

542
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,417
and as the guy
who runs this place

543
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:02,853
chock full of
socialized medicine,

544
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:06,292
let me assure you, Todd,
we're doing a good thing here.

545
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,642
- But in a socialized market,
there's no incentive

546
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,296
for hospitals
to provide better care.

547
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,211
- This hospital
has 1,000 beds,

548
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,648
sees over 100,000 emergency
room visits every year.

549
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:15,779
We don't--
- Max!

550
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,652
Max! Hey, hi!
We, uh--hi.

551
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,655
So, we feel obliged to tell you
that we may have an outbreak

552
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,352
of Legionnaire's disease
in the hospital.

553
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,788
But, uh, it's cool.

554
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,399
We have it
totally under control.

555
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,400
- Uh, we don't.

556
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,271
Not yet, but very soon.

557
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,272
- Yeah, it's, like,
old water systems,

558
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,578
faulty AC units, you know.

559
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,319
It was only a matter of time.

560
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,537
- Good, got it?

561
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,104
Okay.

562
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,107
- You were saying?
About this hospital?

563
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,330
- Okay, this plasmapheresis
machine will filter your blood

564
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,506
and it'll help save
your remaining kidney function.

565
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,725
- How is this
even happening?

566
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:52,076
- The ball joint and the socket
of your artificial hip

567
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,469
are made of a cobalt alloy.

568
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,166
The metal parts
are rubbing against each other

569
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,429
and the friction is causing

570
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,648
the cobalt to flake off
into your bloodstream.

571
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,824
- How do you stop it?

572
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,134
- We are, uh, going to need
to replace your hip, Vince.

573
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,223
- Ah, no.

574
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,662
And how do we know
this won't just happen again?

575
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,316
- Wedlow Medical,
the manufacturer,

576
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,491
claims to have
fixed the problem

577
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,623
with their newer models.

578
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,320
- Claims to have fixed it?

579
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,104
This is my body!

580
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,628
Who's gonna pay
for the surgery?

581
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,846
Or the time I'm out of work?

582
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,500
It took eight weeks last time.

583
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,763
You think my worker's comp
is gonna cover this again?

584
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,287
No way.
- Vince--

585
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,419
- No, this'll bankrupt me.

586
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,421
- Listen to me,
Mr. Martinelli.

587
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,466
That is not gonna happen,

588
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,728
I promise you
I'll make sure of it.

589
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:37,252
- And then who the hell
is gonna pay?

590
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,863
- They are.

591
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,738
- The antibiotics
aren't working.

592
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,088
Symptoms
are just getting worse.

593
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,612
- For which patient?
- For all of them.

594
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,266
- Fevers are all over 100,

595
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,746
Daniel's vomiting
has increased

596
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,400
and Shoshanna's
shortness of breath--

597
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,402
- Um, where is Shoshanna?

598
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,675
Shoshanna,
what are you doing here?

599
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,764
- "Low stimulus room."

600
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,809
- Okay.
- I couldn't take any more

601
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:16,160
of the crying and the puking
and "Will Emily be okay?"

602
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,248
- How are you feeling?

603
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,338
- Fine.
- Fine?

604
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,210
- May I?

605
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:25,648
Breathe, please.

606
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,478
Once more.

607
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,395
- No bronchial constriction.

608
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,657
Any nausea?

609
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:35,658
- No.

610
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,401
- Normal.

611
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,185
- Hey, Shoshanna.

612
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,665
How long have you
been in here?

613
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,407
- Not long, I just needed
someplace quiet to journal.

614
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,149
- How come
she is the only one better?

615
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,717
- You keep journaling, okay?

616
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,420
- Iggy, this is hardly
any time for stress eating.

617
00:22:58,464 --> 00:22:59,465
- What?

618
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:00,857
No, I'm not stress eating,
Vijay.

619
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,468
I think I know
how I can fix this.

620
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,512
- How?

621
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,864
- With these.

622
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,087
- You really think
this is gonna work?

623
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,219
- Well, you know what they say
about a spoonful of sugar.

624
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,178
- Okay.
- Yeah.

625
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,223
You have something called MPI,

626
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,791
but this
will make you feel better.

627
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,098
- When?
- Almost instantaneously.

628
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,797
- ♪ I do declare you're gonna
miss your candyman, yeah ♪

629
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,625
- Is this candy?
- Nope, it's medicine.

630
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:30,626
Fast-acting.

631
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,627
- Just one pill?

632
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:32,628
- Just one pill.

633
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,282
- Can I chew it?
- No.

634
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,893
- ♪ I do declare you're gonna
miss your candyman, yeah ♪

635
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,286
♪ I'm keeping you
safe and warm ♪

636
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,330
Swallow.
- ♪ Yeah, baby

637
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,681
♪ Keeping you out of harm

638
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,773
- Are you sure
this isn't candy?

639
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,209
- Yes.

640
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,690
- ♪ Yeah, baby,
keepin' you out of harm ♪

641
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,866
♪ Where you gonna go
when it start to storm ♪

642
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,568
- Should I take one, too?
I could've been exposed.

643
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,092
- No, no, no,
you're too old to contract it.

644
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:04,530
- Too old?

645
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:08,011
- Yes, MPI stands for
"Mass Psychogenic Illness,"

646
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,883
also known as Collective
Obsessional Behavior,

647
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,711
also known as...

648
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,060
- Mass hysteria?

649
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,061
- Bingo.

650
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,628
Yes, MPI tends to crop up

651
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,804
in isolated, pressurized
groups of young people,

652
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,893
much like
fancy boarding schools...

653
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,155
our psych ward.

654
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,156
- Or Salem.

655
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,723
- Yeah, and once
it gets rolling,

656
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,028
it transmits by line-of-sight,

657
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,421
much like an actual
physical virus.

658
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,076
That's why Shoshanna improved
once she was isolated.

659
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,340
- So wait, after all this,
no one was actually sick?

660
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,820
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

661
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,343
And the symptoms are about
as real as they get, clearly.

662
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,302
But, um, a psychological
problem requires...

663
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,913
a psychological cure.

664
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,134
Preferably cherry-flavored.

665
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,319
- Hi, uh--oh, sorry.
You okay?

666
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:57,104
- I'm working on it.

667
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,671
- Good, 'cause I'm in
a bit of a pickle.

668
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:02,631
Um, so, I need help filling
an extra seat on the board.

669
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,328
- Oh, I'm in.
Oh, thank you.

670
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,504
You know what?

671
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,114
The busier I am,
the less pain I feel.

672
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:08,942
- Actually,
I was kind of hoping

673
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:11,814
to fill it with your mother.

674
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,120
- My mother?

675
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,601
- Yeah, okay, hear me out.
You said that she runs

676
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,254
in wealthy socialite crowds,
right?

677
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:18,647
Which is great,

678
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,301
because Brantley will assume
that she is one of them.

679
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:23,347
But here is where
the plan gets really good--

680
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,611
she will secretly
be working for us, right?

681
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:26,829
Our man on the inside.

682
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,092
You can tell her
how to vote and what to back

683
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,354
and what to bring
to the floor--

684
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,400
- Like a puppet?

685
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,010
- Yeah,
more like a Trojan Horse,

686
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,011
but for the good guys.

687
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,447
Max.

688
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,319
She can't be trusted.

689
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,581
- Well, that's okay, I mean,

690
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,800
even if she doesn't go with us
every time, it--

691
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,802
- No. No, I mean
she can't be trusted

692
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,978
to show up, anywhere.

693
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,457
Except for maybe
a hosted bar.

694
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,808
And even if we programmed her,
she would still vote

695
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,811
for whoever was doing
the shaking and the pouring.

696
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,813
- Got it.

697
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,205
I didn't know that, sorry.

698
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:56,380
- No, no, don't be.

699
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:57,643
No, it helps to be reminded

700
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,167
I am genetically
predisposed to it.

701
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,256
Guess you're gonna
have to go with plan B.

702
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,693
- Yeah, plan B failed...

703
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,913
several plans ago.

704
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,122
- Paging Dr. Goodwin.

705
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,870
- Page me
as soon as she wakes up.

706
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:52,045
- Will do.

707
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,180
- Evie.
- Hey babe, how's it going?

708
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:59,748
- Well, I, uh,
just had to redo a surgery

709
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:00,967
because our health care system

710
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,230
only goes halfway
when it matters.

711
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,885
- That sounds frustrating.
- Oh, well, it is.

712
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,930
But I'll be all right,
you know why?

713
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:11,107
Because you are coming home
to me tomorrow.

714
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,023
Evie?

715
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,332
- Okay, so don't freak out,
this is good news.

716
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,248
HHC is so impressed
by my work,

717
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,206
they've asked me to stay here
for two more weeks.

718
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,341
- Two more weeks?

719
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:30,474
- I know, but I have to
see this job through.

720
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:35,088
What's the point of only going
halfway when it matters, right?

721
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,266
I gotta go.

722
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,310
Floyd, wait, I--

723
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,452
- Vijay?
- Ella?

724
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,149
- Have you seen Rohan?

725
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,238
He was supposed to meet me here
two hours ago.

726
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,631
- Yes, I saw him.

727
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,765
He came to say good-bye
before he left on the tour.

728
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,810
- What tour?

729
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:06,293
- Um, his tour on the--
with the band?

730
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,990
- Oh, my God.

731
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,557
For the last two hours

732
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,212
I've been trying to convince
myself this wasn't happening.

733
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,258
I should've known
he couldn't handle it.

734
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,565
But to disappear
like a coward?

735
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,306
- I don't understand.

736
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,178
- There's no tour, Vijay.
He lied.

737
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,266
He bailed.

738
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,356
- W-why would he do that?

739
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,797
- I'm pregnant.

740
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,114
- Dr. Kapoor, Dr. Kapoor!

741
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,379
- Get me Ativan, now!

742
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:52,948
- 1 mil Ativan.

743
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:53,949
- I thought everyone
was getting better.

744
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:54,994
- They were.

745
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:57,387
Everyone else is,
just--Emily...

746
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,999
- 60 lpm, high flow 02.

747
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,218
- Pulse ox 95.
- What's wrong with her?

748
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,307
- I don't know!

749
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,614
- She's stabilizing.

750
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:09,312
I-I'm sorry.

751
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,459
- Because you personally
brought this to our attention,

752
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,374
Wedlow Medical is willing
to cover the cost

753
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,246
of Mr. Martinelli's
new hip replacement.

754
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,379
- And?

755
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,772
- We'll also cover

756
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:38,864
Mr. Martinelli's rehabilitation
and lost wages.

757
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,562
- Yeah, no, that's not
gonna work for us.

758
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,129
Because I discovered

759
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,958
that when the FDA banned
metal-on-metal hips,

760
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,179
your company simply coated
those defective hips.

761
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:55,663
Mr. Martinelli would like
your 100% ceramic hip.

762
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:58,884
- The one that won't poison me.

763
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,320
- Those are triple the cost.

764
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,931
- Oh, I wasn't done.
We'd also like Wedlow Medical

765
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,629
to provide the ceramic hip
free of charge

766
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,457
to any new patient

767
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:11,244
who suffers a malfunction
of your coated devices.

768
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:14,595
- Dr. Sharpe, we don't have to
offer your patients anything.

769
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,902
We're in full compliance
with the FDA, in fact,

770
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,078
we only took this little
meeting because, frankly,

771
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:21,080
we're big fans of Dr. Helen.

772
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,000
Brilliant.

773
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,698
Then Dr. Helen will go on TV
and broadcast to the world

774
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,700
how Wedlow Medical's
poorly designed products

775
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,354
harm patients.

776
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,404
And perhaps I'll bring this
to drive my point home.

777
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,581
It's joint fluid.

778
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,323
We found it inside
Mr. Martinelli's body.

779
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,283
- You do that,
and we'll crush you

780
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:51,762
with so many defamation suits,

781
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:54,461
you'll never
practice medicine again.

782
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:57,681
- I'd like to see you try.

783
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,248
- They'll destroy you.

784
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,121
They have bottomless pockets
and a fleet of lawyers and

785
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,645
they will destroy everything
that you have ever worked for.

786
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:07,300
- They only see me as
Dr. Helen, a TV personality,

787
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,258
so I intend to put
that personality to good use.

788
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,520
- Yeah, and what about
Dr. Sharpe?

789
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,305
- She is out
fighting for her patients,

790
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,263
something that you do
every single day, and yet,

791
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,482
you're asking me
to pull my punches.

792
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,613
Why would you do that?

793
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,050
- Because this will
end your career,

794
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:21,618
and I can't do this
without you.

795
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,755
I'm not...

796
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:29,409
fully...

797
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:31,193
here.

798
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,983
Part of me is still...

799
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,289
on that ambulance.

800
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,773
- You push me away,

801
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,602
and you expect me
to understand.

802
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,734
And then you need me?

803
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,649
And you use your feelings
as leverage.

804
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,738
- You think I'm using Georgia
to manipulate you?

805
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,001
- I don't what you're doing

806
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,002
because you won't ever
talk to me.

807
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,046
- I can't talk to you.
- Why?

808
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,050
- Because I'm trying
to spare you.

809
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:05,053
I don't want you to feel...

810
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,186
this.

811
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,318
I don't want you
to experience...

812
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:12,539
this...

813
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:17,413
and it's not fair.

814
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,763
I know.

815
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,201
- None of this is fair.

816
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,246
We can just toss "fair"
out the window.

817
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:31,210
Max, when you need me,
I am here for you.

818
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:37,085
For all of it.

819
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,088
But not at the expense
of my patient.

820
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:47,617
- As awful as it sounds,
in regards to

821
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,228
some of the larger
medical device companies,

822
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,708
we've just become guinea pigs
for their inferior products.

823
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,319
- It's not as if
it's a microwave

824
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,929
that you can return
or get recalled.

825
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,757
- Exactly.
We're talking about products

826
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,455
that are surgically implanted
into your body.

827
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:03,851
In your spine,
your heart, the hip.

828
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,984
And if these products fail,
you get sick.

829
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:09,422
Or worse, you die.

830
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,685
I have a brave,
hardworking patient

831
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,426
whose life has been
turned upside down

832
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:14,731
by one of these products.

833
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:17,256
The time has come
to make a stand.

834
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,822
- When we come back,

835
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:22,522
Dr. Helen will reveal which
company to avoid and why.

836
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,569
- And, we're out!

837
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:49,723
- And we're back in 3, 2...

838
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,204
- Welcome back
to "The Night Shift".

839
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,902
I'm here with Dr. Helen,
who has come to warn us

840
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:57,774
about a company that harmed
one of her patients.

841
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,342
Dr. Helen?

842
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,437
- I'm...

843
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,700
actually not here

844
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:14,226
to shame any one
particular company,

845
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:18,752
because in truth, they're all
in compliance with the FDA,

846
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,928
and that's where
the real fault lies.

847
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,017
- So you're taking on
the FDA?

848
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,715
- It appears that way,
doesn't it?

849
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:29,676
The FDA need to enact real
regulations on medical devices

850
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,679
that protect patients,
not corporate profit.

851
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:34,550
We need clinical trials

852
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,683
before implanting heavy metals
into our body.

853
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,512
We need oversight.
We deserve that much.

854
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,776
- So what can our viewers
at home--what can they do?

855
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,474
- Call your representatives,
demand to be heard.

856
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,867
If we want change,

857
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,782
then we have to be
the ones to initiate it.

858
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,024
- Dr. Bloom,
we don't have a session today.

859
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,417
- We do.

860
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,984
For the next seven minutes.

861
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,946
- Remember to sit still,
Emily.

862
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,524
Dr. Kapoor,
the results are up.

863
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:43,576
- You have what is called
a meningioma.

864
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,753
A tumor on the lining
of your brain.

865
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:49,364
It's been causing
all your symptoms.

866
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,585
- Yeah, that sounds a lot worse
than it actually is.

867
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,326
- Meningiomas
are usually benign.

868
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:57,459
Once we remove them, you
will be back to your old self.

869
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,940
- Did everybody have one
of these tumors, too?

870
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,071
- No, they didn't.

871
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,682
They saw you getting sick

872
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,598
and then they believed
that they were sick, too.

873
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,861
- So I did this to them?

874
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,471
- No.

875
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,125
Emily, you didn't do anything.

876
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,520
They saw you and
they were affected by you.

877
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:16,870
You know what that means?

878
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:18,524
- That they all hate me now?

879
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,787
- No, it means that
you're not alone...

880
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,585
That we're all connected.

881
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,688
- Main hoon na.

882
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:53,776
- What?

883
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,777
- In Bollywood movies,

884
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,606
they would say,
main hoon na.

885
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,043
- Vijay, if you're here
to make excuses for your son,

886
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,915
you should leave
before I lose it.

887
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,222
- I went to Rohan's apartment,

888
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:08,487
to his office,
called up his sponsor...

889
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,490
I couldn't find him.
My son is gone.

890
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,231
- Yeah, well...

891
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:16,016
- When life overwhelms him,
he...

892
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,453
he always runs away.

893
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:20,977
But not me.

894
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,980
I wish for you to know that.

895
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,549
- Vijay?

896
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,946
- Main hoon na?

897
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,687
What does that mean?

898
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,780
- "I'm there for you."

899
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,276
It's time
for the board meeting.

900
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,582
- Ugh, we promised we'd
help that woman and we failed.

901
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:04,978
I don't have the votes for
the Visiting Nurse's Program.

902
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:06,632
- Well...

903
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:07,807
a nanny state program
like that

904
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,548
probably wouldn't have
worked, anyway.

905
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:13,682
- I get that we
all have different...

906
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:14,988
political beliefs, Todd,

907
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,947
but that woman needs help,
and she needs it now.

908
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,253
- I understand that.

909
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,211
And self-reliance is the key
to a good life,

910
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,909
and it doesn't take
taxpayer money to achieve.

911
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:24,519
- Okay, okay, what about this?

912
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:27,827
What if instead of wagging your
finger or disagreeing with me,

913
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,611
what about you help her?

914
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:33,789
Give me a self-reliant solution
that helps Renée Hamrick.

915
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,618
- Get her a dog.

916
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,927
- Get her...a dog.

917
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,885
- Adopt a dog for her.

918
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,324
Then you hire a dog walker
to come by once a day.

919
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,023
- To...check on her.

920
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,721
- Twice, pick up and drop off.

921
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,506
How much
was this nurse's agency

922
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:55,507
gonna cost you per day?

923
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,596
- Um, around $200.

924
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,685
- I bet you can get
a dog walker for $20.

925
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:04,342
- Todd...

926
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,083
have you ever thought about
being on a board?

927
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:10,913
A CEO, a celebrity,
or a hedge fund manager.

928
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,088
That's what you said, right?

929
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,700
That's what this board needs,
a leader.

930
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:18,878
Uh, someone acclaimed
or someone rich.

931
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,707
Sergeant Todd Benson
is a leader.

932
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,230
He asked for loyalty
in a setting

933
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:25,885
more intense than any
boardroom, and he got it.

934
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,060
And--

935
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,670
you don't get more acclaim
than a veteran

936
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,151
with a Purple Heart and
a host of other decorations.

937
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:32,674
- You left one out.

938
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:35,068
I respect your service,
Sergeant, we all do,

939
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,723
but the category
Max conveniently skipped

940
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,638
money.

941
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:41,683
Having it, donating it,
raising it.

942
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,077
That's what
a board member does.

943
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,775
- Yeah,
that's why you need Todd.

944
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,037
Todd did something today

945
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,082
that most of you
would call impossible.

946
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:51,389
He changed my mind.

947
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,087
And he did it using the kind
of insight that you get

948
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,265
when you spend your life
making more out of less.

949
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,049
Economic diversity can lead

950
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:03,618
to innovative solutions
to dollars and cents problems.

951
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,707
Yes, money,
that's what boards do.

952
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,274
That's why this board
needs someone

953
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:10,320
who knows what it's like
to not have it.

954
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:14,194
- How do we know he's not just
going to vote however you say?

955
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,414
- Him?
No, he's gonna vote with you

956
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,808
more than he votes with me.
We can barely agree on, um...

957
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,419
literally anything.

958
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:24,073
Yeah, but we do agree
on one thing,

959
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,641
and that's that we both
want to help.

960
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,775
He just helps in a way
that's less "one of us"

961
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,124
and more like the people

962
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,040
that New Amsterdam
is trying to serve.

963
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,656
- Before we vote
on Lamont Hallstrom,

964
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,353
resolve to nominate Todd Benson

965
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:45,878
to the board of
New Amsterdam Hospital.

966
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,141
Is there a second?

967
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,974
The motion proceeds.
All in favor?

968
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,894
The votes have it.

969
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:05,071
Welcome to our newest board
member, Sergeant Todd Benson.

970
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,727
- Congratulations.

971
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,685
Oh, and the board
is an unpaid position,

972
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:13,993
so I think in this case
we can make an exception.

973
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,429
Salary equal
to what he's surrendering

974
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,865
as my assistant seems fair.

975
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,214
Can I get a...

976
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:20,347
second?

977
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:25,221
- There you go, yep.

978
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,355
- Evie, hey look,

979
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:30,400
before you say anything,
I've gotta apologize.

980
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,751
I just, uh, I miss you.

981
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:35,188
- I miss you, too.

982
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:39,497
And I'm so lucky
to be marrying a man

983
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,719
who is excited to plan
our wedding while I'm here.

984
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,115
I just...

985
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:51,770
I feel so far away...

986
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:53,946
you know?

987
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:57,079
- Well, there's gotta
be something we can do.

988
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,040
One second.

989
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,739
- ♪ But no matter
what you do ♪

990
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:08,874
♪ Even pray to heaven above

991
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,224
- Caterer needs a decision
by tomorrow.
