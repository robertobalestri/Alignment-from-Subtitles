- Only three more meetings
and you are on your own.

14
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:50,180
- If I knew being Chair
meant this many meetings,

15
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,268
I might've reconsidered.

16
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,748
- Hey, Reynolds said
the same thing.

17
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,532
- Excuse me, Dr. Goodwin,
I don't mean to interrupt.

18
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,925
Can I get your autograph?

19
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:57,840
- Iggy, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

20
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,450
- Have you seen the GoFundMe
video Max is in?

21
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:00,973
It blew up!
- Yeah, okay.

22
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,063
For the record, I didn't even
know I was in that video.

23
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,543
- And for the record, it was
also featured on "Ellen,"

24
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,110
funded in less than
three hours, my man.

25
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,546
- Yeah, well, I think that had
less to do with me

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,026
and more to do with--
I don't know, Ellen?

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,202
- Regardless, I now have--
this is a rough estimate--

28
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,769
about 6,000 of my own patients

29
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,510
all begging me to get you to
star in their GoFundMe videos.

30
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,120
- No, no, no.
That's very flattering.

31
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,730
But that is not a precedent
I wanna set at this hospital.

32
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,167
- Maximus,
you have a gift here.

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,559
You have a gift.
You should not squander it.

34
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,213
- Anyway, try to enjoy
the ride.

35
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,780
You have big shoes to fill,
but--

36
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,347
- Max, I need you down
in the ED, stat.

37
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,522
- Why?
- I'll give you a hint.

38
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,045
Come camera ready.
- No!

39
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,308
- Half my ward wants you to
cameo on their GoFundMe pages.

40
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,353
I'm not sure how
you're gonna find time

41
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:33,484
to do your actual job,

42
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,356
but if anyone can do it,
you can.

43
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,661
- Mm.

44
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:38,272
Welcome to the room
where it happens,

45
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,578
and by "it" I mean even more
boring administrative stuff.

46
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:43,842
- Reynolds leaving is making
more and more sense.

47
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,583
- Morning.
- Oh.

48
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,760
- Uh, I did not know
you were still here.

49
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:50,762
- Where else would I be?
- I don't know.

50
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:53,504
San Francisco
or maybe in a bed?

51
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,245
- Evie caught
a flight last night,

52
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,160
and the sub-letters
are already in,

53
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,641
but Floyd Reynolds doesn't
leave business half-done.

54
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,599
- Business?
- Orientation.

55
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,384
Gotta show the new Chair
the ropes.

56
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:06,691
- Oh, that's very kind,
but we just--we just did that.

57
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:10,217
- Oh, okay, but I gotta
introduce you to the board.

58
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,219
Can't just get thrown
into the deep end.

59
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,786
- Uh, Max took me
to breakfast with them.

60
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,441
- Oh, smart.
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,922
- Okay, uh, gosh.

62
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:22,316
It's just that my flight
doesn't leave until tomorrow.

63
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,797
- Oh, we got
the new couch coming in

64
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:28,626
if you wanna help carry
the old one out.

65
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,458
- It's official.

66
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,894
As of today, you are reinstated

67
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,288
as Chair of Oncology
and Deputy Medical Director.

68
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,682
- I wish I'd prepared a speech.
- I'm glad you didn't.

69
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,814
Now that you're back,
we need you to salvage

70
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,512
the Fighting Cancer
fundraiser tonight.

71
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,904
- What--what's to salvage?

72
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,558
It's being headlined
by Yo-Yo Ma.

73
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,604
- Yo-Yo's got strep.
He's out.

74
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,562
We need to find someone else
rich people like.

75
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:55,218
Also, the teenage cancer
survivors who are speaking?

76
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,481
Amazing kids,
incredibly inspiring,

77
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,744
but they're also rowdy little
teenagers

78
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,485
who need to work on
their speeches,

79
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,878
so get on them.

80
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,445
Oh, and per the fire marshal,

81
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,837
the Rose Room was too small,

82
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,491
so everything has to move
to the Atrium theater.

83
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,580
- Karen, this is an awful lot
of ground to cover by tonight.

84
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,974
- Afternoon would be better.
So glad you're back.

85
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,373
- Hello, Mateo.
How are you feeling?

86
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,289
- Just tell me.
Did it work?

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,519
May I?

88
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,616
Today, you move again.

89
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:55,844
- You're him, right?
You're the GoFundMe doctor.

90
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,281
- Max Goodwin.
- Jason Huang.

91
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,848
I'm sorry to bother you.
- That's okay.

92
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,372
Listen, I can't do
your crowdfunding video

93
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,895
if that's what you were gonna--

94
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,984
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

95
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:09,597
- But if there's anything
I can do for you as a doctor,

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,557
then let me know
and I'll be there.

97
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,778
- My dad gave up a good life
in China

98
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,910
so I could grow up here.

99
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,739
He's spent 20 years
making minimum wage,

100
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:26,918
thousands of miles away from
everyone he knew for me.

101
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:30,400
And I'm going to med
school next year,

102
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,403
full ride,
thanks to him.

103
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:37,712
But he needs surgery,
mitral valve stenosis,

104
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:40,367
just like the girl
in your video,

105
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,326
and the deductible,
it's so much money.

106
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,676
I don't know what to do.

107
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,594
- How can I help?

108
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:55,860
- Hey, Dad, you awake?

109
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,298
- Uh, I can just
come back later.

110
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,039
- No.
Please stay.

111
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,433
Hey, it's me.

112
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:07,307
This is Dr. Goodwin.
He's gonna help us, okay?

113
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,832
Can you sit over here by him?

114
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,797
All right, Dad.

115
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,973
Can you tell Dr. Goodwin
your story?

116
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,548
- Maybe we should try
this another time.

117
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,855
- No, his surgery is tomorrow.

118
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:37,989
We need this video to work,
or we can't...

119
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:42,994
okay, uh, Dad, can you just
look at the camera and say,

120
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,823
"I need your help.
Anything you can give."

121
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,393
Or just smile.
Yeah, that little girl smiled.

122
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,352
Maybe if you just smiled,
I can...

123
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,966
Smile, Dad.

124
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,750
Smile.

125
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,718
It's fine if you can't talk.
They see how sick he is.

126
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,068
It works better, right?
The sadder it is, the better--

127
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:15,723
- Jason,
you don't have to do this.

128
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,029
- Actually, I do.

129
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:22,077
What other choice do I have
but crowdfunding?

130
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,041
- Karen, I need to talk to you.

131
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:34,176
She's adorable.

132
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,179
- Well, yeah, so is
the dancing sloth that follows,

133
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,137
but that's not why
I wanna talk to you.

134
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,487
- It is why I want to talk
to you.

135
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,576
I want us to facilitate
crowdfunding

136
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,621
for everyone who needs it.

137
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,449
It'll cost us next to nothing,

138
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,147
just a camera and a room,
and we'll help so many people.

139
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,192
- No.

140
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,846
No crowdfunding.
Not for anyone.

141
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,630
- Wait, are you kidding me?
Now you're against this?

142
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,937
- Yes, I am.
- Well, that's absurd.

143
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,287
Crowdfunding empowers patients
to fight bad insurance

144
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,115
through the power
of their stories.

145
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,508
It's a Max Goodwin trifecta!

146
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,292
- No, it forces people to sing
for their supper

147
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,337
at the worst possible moments
in their lives.

148
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:08,210
We're making people pay
their bills with their dignity.

149
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,994
- We're not.
Insurance companies are.

150
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,127
- Well, I'd like them to stop.

151
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,608
- And I'd like
to ride a unicorn.

152
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,479
Crowdfunding works, Max.

153
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,916
- What if I can find
a better way?

154
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:30,406
- I'm sorry, but are you eating
smoked whitefish?

155
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,147
- In fact, I am.

156
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,627
- I love smoked whitefish.

157
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,499
My dad used to take me
to Nussbaum's every Saturday

158
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,240
after synagogue.

159
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,633
- Oh, Nussbaum's
is my favorite.

160
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:42,505
- Oh, mine too until it closed.

161
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,551
Honestly, that is
the best smoked whitefish

162
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:45,552
I've smelled since.

163
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,032
- It's the dill.

164
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,034
- Lauren Bloom,
Emergency Department.

165
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,949
- Harold Rothman,
Psychiatry.

166
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,431
Oh, until next time

167
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,434
when I'll reveal the best lox
in New York,

168
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,523
and it's not in Brooklyn.

169
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,617
Yeah?

170
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,054
- Vito's for lunch today.
You in?

171
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,708
- Uh, no, no.
Thank you.

172
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,580
Nothing for me.
I'm okay.

173
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,582
- Well, I'm just very
impressed.

174
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,193
You've been sticking with
your healthy choices...

175
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,587
- Oh.
- And you look great.

176
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,979
- Thank you.
That's very sweet.

177
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,590
I have a ways to go, but...

178
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,330
Thank you.

179
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,377
- Hey Iggy, where can I find
Dr. Rothman?

180
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,292
I forgot to ask him where
he got his whitefish.

181
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,424
- Um, don't know who
Dr. Rothman is.

182
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,165
- Uh, yes, you do.

183
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,603
Harold Rothman.
He works in your department.

184
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,735
- No.
Sorry.

185
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,042
- Why would be lie?
- Why would I?

186
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,045
Okay, let's sort this out
right now.

187
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:48,136
Harold Rothman.

188
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,268
What do we got?

189
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,271
There you go.
Left New Amsterdam in 1996.

190
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,578
- No, no.
He's very distinctive.

191
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:58,233
He's pale with, like,
bright white hair,

192
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,496
and this, like,
an old-timey vibe.

193
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,150
- Wait a second,

194
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,587
did he have a mysterious smile
and soulful eyes?

195
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,329
- Yeah.
- Okay, this all makes sense.

196
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,332
- What makes sense?
- I don't know how to say this.

197
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,726
The man you spoke to...

198
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,641
is a ghost.

199
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,034
- Thank you.

200
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,427
- Have you not heard tell,
Lauren,

201
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,168
of the Phantom
of New Amsterdam?

202
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:23,388
'Twas many a moon 'ere first
his steps were heard.

203
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,609
- Looks like someone's already
gotten the party started.

204
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,219
Dr. Sharpe!

205
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,786
- Look how gorgeous
you all look.

206
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,614
And since you're relaxing,
I can assume

207
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,138
you've all memorized
your speeches for tonight?

208
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,445
Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:41,581
Come on, rehearse now,
catch up later.

210
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,543
Jessye?

211
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,111
Can I just ask how long
you've had that limp?

212
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:53,680
- Oh.
Maybe like a week?

213
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,638
- Do you mind if I take a look?

214
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:06,214
I'd like to run a few tests
on this leg.

215
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,565
It'll be quick,
I promise.

216
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,697
- That's where my cancer was.

217
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,656
- There's no need to jump
to conclusions.

218
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,497
- Your brain's impulses are
transmitted as electricity.

219
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,238
Even since your paralysis,

220
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,153
your brain has been sending
signals to your arm.

221
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,503
- Your arm has just been unable
to hear them.

222
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:37,593
- The silicone chips
we embedded in your brain

223
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,857
send the signals through
these wires to your pedestals,

224
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,512
and from there
to the robotic arm.

225
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,470
- In a sense,
it's just a spinal cord

226
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,255
outside of your body.

227
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,604
- If you can master this,

228
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,737
you'll move on to our
most advanced robotics.

229
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,349
You'll test simulations
of cars, planes--

230
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,656
- A plane?
I can fly again?

231
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,268
- Let's just focus on
a finger today.

232
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,276
- And we're live.

233
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:12,628
Mateo, please try and move
your index finger.

234
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,419
Okay.

235
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,646
- It's okay.
This may take some time.

236
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,474
We are awakening
neural pathways

237
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,477
which you have not used
since the accident.

238
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,349
- Gotta clear out the cobwebs,
right?

239
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:42,310
- Try to remember what it was
like to move your own arm,

240
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,877
how it felt.

241
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,321
- Dr. Kapoor?

242
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,453
- He's just starting.
Give him time.

243
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,804
- It's not a time thing.

244
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,545
Every subject that's worked has
had at least some activity

245
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,939
in the motor cortex
upon initiation,

246
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,854
but Mateo has none.

247
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,595
- Move.

248
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,858
Come on.
Move.

249
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,949
- Let's start with
the elephant in the room.

250
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:15,169
Who saw me on "Ellen"?

251
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,345
Okay, just everybody.

252
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,825
Well, I'm not here to talk
about Allie Baker.

253
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:22,350
I'd like to talk about
Zhen Huang.

254
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,223
Not exactly an Allie, is he?

255
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,703
It's okay,
it's true--

256
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,445
he's not young, he doesn't have
a winning smile,

257
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:33,753
and can barely even talk.

258
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,189
So what do you think?

259
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,581
His story gonna be a hit
on the talk shows?

260
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,844
- You don't have
to go on Fallon

261
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,367
to have crowdfunding work.
- No, you don't.

262
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,369
You just have to flaunt
your misery for money.

263
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,805
And it gets better,

264
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,546
the public starts voting
with their wallets.

265
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,505
It's a Tragedy Olympics where
the contestants are dying

266
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,681
and the judges vote
not on medicine,

267
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,424
but on whose story
is the cutest.

268
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,558
- So, what are you suggesting?

269
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,907
- Let's get new judges.

270
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,996
There's only one group
who knows which patients

271
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,825
are the most deserving--
doctors.

272
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,915
So when patients can't afford
even the deductible,

273
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,875
the doctors in this room
will decide who gets the money.

274
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:12,792
I have got a $100,000 set aside
for patients like Allie.

275
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,359
And I'm willing to bet
that all of us

276
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,971
have patients
who could use a little help.

277
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,409
Mine is Zhen Huang.

278
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,758
So we're gonna decide who
gets the money

279
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,326
not with emotion with reason.

280
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,893
I'd like to present

281
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,938
New Amsterdam's response
to GoFundMe...

282
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,463
WeFundYou.

283
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,425
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Yeah, what?

284
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,687
Need a consult?

285
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,036
- No, I was just surprised
to see you.

286
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,821
I thought you already left.

287
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,434
- Whoa, whoa, hey!
Watch it!

288
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,697
Easy there, big guy.

289
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,029
- Hello?

290
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,642
Someone help me!

291
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:21,948
- Hello?

292
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,819
- I'm down here!

293
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,908
Help!

294
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,432
- Hang on!
- Help me!

295
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,306
- Okay.
Don't worry.

296
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,003
Hang in there.
I got you.

297
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,703
I'm coming.

298
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,718
- Hey, I'm Dr. Reynolds.
What's your name?

299
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,503
- Tevi.
- Tevi.

300
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:56,983
Okay, yeah.
Let me see.

301
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,680
Let me see.

302
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,421
Yeah, okay.

303
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:01,944
You've got a little bit
of trouble here, Tevi, okay?

304
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,425
When you fell,
you broke a rib, all right?

305
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:05,992
So I'm gonna
take care of you, okay?

306
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,689
First, I just gotta get you
out of here.

307
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,040
Whoa.

308
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,441
Stage 4 Hodgkin Lymphoma

309
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,964
is more deserving than
a Stage 4 Neuroblastoma?

310
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,185
- No, what I said was
my patient is more deserving,

311
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:26,490
because she's so young;
she's only nine.

312
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,362
- Yeah, g-guys?

313
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,842
Let's try to think about
this rationally.

314
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,235
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

315
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,498
- I didn't say you were
an idiot, I said it was--

316
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:38,154
- This $100,000 they're all
fighting so hard for,

317
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,330
where exactly is it
coming from?

318
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:43,464
- Funny enough, the next item
on my agenda was going to be

319
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:48,034
finding the money,
rationally and thoughtfully.

320
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,426
- Don't play stupid.

321
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,558
You're only thinking about
your patients.

322
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,994
- That is the whole point,
Steve!

323
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,561
- What's her name?
- Lisa!

324
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,171
- Let me know how that goes.

325
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,956
- What you're saying is that
she's gonna go home sick,

326
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,045
and that I'm supposed
to let her die.

327
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,872
There we go.

328
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,005
Okay.

329
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,267
All right, just relax.

330
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,053
I'm gonna get us help, okay?

331
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,274
Okay, Tevi, just relax.

332
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,015
Just breathe through
your nose like this.

333
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,279
Okay, try it.

334
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,368
Okay.
Okay, kiddo.

335
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,457
All right.
All right.

336
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,677
Tevi, listen to me.
Listen to me.

337
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,418
Now when we breathe,

338
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:27,203
we make a vacuum
with our chest, all right?

339
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,726
With that rib you broke,

340
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,207
it poked a hole from your lungs
to the outside world.

341
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,209
So now you can't make a vacuum.

342
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,994
So all we gotta do is we gotta
make you a vacuum.

343
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,257
Ah, here we go.

344
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,910
Now we're talking.

345
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,260
Okay, do me a favor.

346
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,913
Can you hold this for me
like this?

347
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,003
Hold it right there, okay?

348
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,273
- We're gonna make that vacuum,
buddy.

349
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:56,363
Here we go.

350
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,452
- Okay.

351
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,977
Now take a deep breath.
Come on.

352
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,067
It's holding.

353
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,329
Good.
Now take another one.

354
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,202
There you go.

355
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,726
That's it.
That's it.

356
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,989
Good.
You're doing great.

357
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,600
All right, you wanna tell me

358
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,255
how you wound up down here
in the first place?

359
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,084
Huh?
Come on now.

360
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,694
I promise you
I've heard crazier.

361
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,609
Oh...

362
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,698
- What?
- You're bleeding out,

363
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,396
and we've got to get you
to the OR.

364
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,093
How long before your family

365
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,443
or your friends
realize you're gone?

366
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,705
- A few hours,

367
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,968
but someone's gonna notice
you're gone, right?

368
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,111
- Don't say it.
- I'm sorry.

369
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,766
I do not know if it is
the chips, the pedestals, or--

370
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,246
- Or me.

371
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,465
- We're not registering
any relevant brain activity.

372
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,467
And your pain--
- I'm fine.

373
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,296
- The EEG shows the brainwaves
that signal pain.

374
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,168
You're not fine.
- No!

375
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:03,560
I can do it.
I just--

376
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,084
- Mateo.

377
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,390
Move.

378
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:20,403
I ran airlifts in combat zones.

379
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,449
I could land a C-2 Greyhound

380
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,581
smack in the middle
of an aircraft carrier

381
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,323
getting hit by 30-foot waves,

382
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:32,111
and now...
I can't move a finger.

383
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,291
It's in my somewhere.
I know it.

384
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,426
- Detach his arm.

385
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,167
Hook him up
to a flight simulator.

386
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,778
- The simulator is an advanced
cerebral interface.

387
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,389
- Mateo is a pilot.

388
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,609
Flying is in his blood,
his bones, his neurons.

389
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,177
- If his brain comes
to associate reawakening

390
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,831
the motor cortex with pain,

391
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,268
anything alive in there might
never wake up.

392
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,617
If he fails at the simulator,

393
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,793
it won't just be
an emotional setback.

394
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,578
It could be
a neurological one.

395
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,536
- There is no flight
without a leap.

396
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,544
Mateo, Would you like to fly?

397
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,409
- Let's get her
a pulmo consult with Loeb.

398
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,368
- Okay.
- Hey, what's up?

399
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,108
- Hi. So, funny story.

400
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,371
I was over at
the vending machines,

401
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,416
not eating candy or anything,

402
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,245
I was just looking at it...
- Iggy, I do have a job.

403
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,856
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
I do too.

404
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,469
So, I saw Dr. Rothman.

405
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,123
Pretty sure I did.

406
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,343
He's old, white hair,
pale skin.

407
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:15,823
The whole thing.

408
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,173
And I think he's just, um...

409
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,131
it's the darndest thing.
He just...

410
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,438
Vanished is the word, I guess.

411
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,441
What?

412
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,748
- Okay,
I don't really know how to...

413
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,142
I googled him
after we talked, and...

414
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,274
- And?

415
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,234
- Harold Rothman died
four years ago.

416
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:42,153
- Your limp is being caused by
a soft tissue sarcoma

417
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,807
in your popliteal fossa.

418
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,682
It's aggressive.

419
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,645
I'm gonna need
to schedule you for surgery,

420
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,343
and I'm gonna have
to call your parents.

421
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,649
- I already called.

422
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,521
I knew what you were gonna say.

423
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,310
- Jessye, if you would like
to go to a little of the party,

424
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,442
there is time.

425
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,313
- Why would I go to the party?

426
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,577
That party is for kids
who beat cancer.

427
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,970
I lost.

428
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,538
- Cancer doesn't
have winners and losers,

429
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,670
and anyone who makes you feel
that way

430
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,368
does not know what
they are talking about.

431
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,934
- You made me feel that way.

432
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,851
The stupid speech.

433
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:33,335
"I was 12 when I learned
I had cancer.

434
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,685
"I was told I was in
for the fight of my life.

435
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,905
"I battled each cell
of my sarcoma.

436
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:41,604
New Amsterdam taught me how
to fight and how to win."

437
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,827
Your party is called
Fighting Cancer.

438
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,919
So, yeah, cancer won
and I lost.

439
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,015
- No pulse.

440
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,713
Going again.
Clear.

441
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,715
Doctor, crash cart bedside.

442
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,327
- What happened?
- Sinus brady and hypoxia.

443
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,980
- Did you push Atropine?
- Times two.

444
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,026
- Okay, hang epi drip,
4 micrograms per minute,

445
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,333
and let's put on Zoll pads
for external pacing

446
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,378
in case the epi isn't enough.

447
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,379
- Bag it.

448
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,474
- Breathing pattern
ineffective.

449
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,133
- One, two...

450
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,879
Hey, why don't you
tell me how you--

451
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,228
you got here in the hospital?

452
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,100
- Alpha 1
Antitrypsin deficiency.

453
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,364
Come here
a few times a month

454
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,061
for a gene transfusion.

455
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,410
- Only at New Amsterdam?

456
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:52,196
- Sometimes at Baptist.
- Oh, then I want to know.

457
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,937
Do we have the best
elevator shafts,

458
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:57,114
or does Baptist got us beat?

459
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,247
- That's more like it.

460
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,075
All right.
Here we go.

461
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,294
One, two...

462
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,824
Yes.
Yeah.

463
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,869
You like that?

464
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,349
Pry this open,
get you to the OR,

465
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,046
and get you fixed up.

466
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:21,225
Hey!
Hey!

467
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,445
We're down here!
- We're down here!

468
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,186
- Help!
- Hey!

469
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:26,927
- Hey,
there's somebody down here!

470
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,885
Hey!
Hey!

471
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,410
Hey, we're down here!
Oh!

472
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,463
- Clear?
I've got a pulse.

473
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:44,031
- So do you think it'll work?

474
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,467
- I don't know.

475
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,513
- The insurance company says
dad's setback

476
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,297
is classified as
a new disorder.

477
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,951
We owe two deductibles now.

478
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,301
We'll have to sell everything

479
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,478
unless I post it and it works.

480
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,349
- Well, I couldn't find you
a better way,

481
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:01,004
so why haven't you?

482
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,486
- I showed my dad the video.

483
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,923
He said if he has to beg
to live, he'd rather die.

484
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,969
That's how he was brought up.

485
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,493
If I post it,
he'll never speak to me again.

486
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,541
How can the only way to save
him be losing him forever?

487
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,997
- Hey!
Oh, damn.

488
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,828
- Dr. Bloom.
- Hey, I found him.

489
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:44,091
- What?
- He's on the fourth floor.

490
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,527
- Dr. Rothman?
- Yes, the fourth floor.

491
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,442
Meet me there.

492
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,924
You know, growing up,
my Aunt Norma always claimed

493
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,273
to have the sight.

494
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,970
- Mm-hmm.
- This makes sense.

495
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,276
She always said that you can
only see

496
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,147
what you are pure enough
to receive.

497
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:59,193
Oh, she would just
be absolutely thrilled

498
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,021
if my new diet
had somehow purified me.

499
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,979
She always said, "You're never
gonna get the sight

500
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,415
if you don't stop eating
chocolate, Iggy."

501
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,547
- Iggy.
Iggy.

502
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,462
Look.

503
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,246
- Oh.

504
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,427
Dr. Rothman?

505
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,303
- How are you doing today?

506
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,613
- Wait, this is the...

507
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,919
- Alzheimer's Ward.

508
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,404
- We think we're in time,

509
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,145
but with a relapse this
aggressive,

510
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:41,104
we're gonna need to monitor
Jessye's tissues regularly.

511
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,586
Thinking about something
that Jessye said,

512
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,068
how you were asked to talk
about fighting cancer, right?

513
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:51,071
How you beat it?

514
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:54,161
Can you rip those speeches up,
please?

515
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,902
Go on.
I'm serious.

516
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,338
Take them out and rip them up.

517
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:59,906
If they're on your phones,
delete them.

518
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:09,698
Now tell me,
from the heart...

519
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,573
How does it feel
surviving cancer?

520
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,620
- Scared.

521
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,623
You know, um,
even though I'm in remission,

522
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:25,061
it feels like I'm just waiting
for it to come back.

523
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:27,498
- Um, ungrateful.

524
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,370
I, like, beat this huge thing,

525
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,546
but I feel like
I should never complain

526
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,940
or feel down
about anything else.

527
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,509
This is what people
should hear.

528
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:41,643
This is what I want you
to talk about tonight.

529
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:45,604
- So we nix the uplifting
stories of beating cancer,

530
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,389
and replace them with raw,
improvised stories

531
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,695
from terrified children?

532
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,479
- It's the truth.
People wanna hear the truth.

533
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,960
- If there's one place people
do not want to hear the truth,

534
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,701
it's a pediatric oncology ward.

535
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,138
Donors want to hear
that we're beating cancer,

536
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,661
that we're going
to beat more cancer.

537
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,620
- Those kids were lying.

538
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,752
We asked them to lie.

539
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,148
So now they're gonna tell their
stories, their real stories.

540
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,063
And for some of them,
it's not a fight

541
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,717
or it's not a fight
that they're winning.

542
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,376
Fair point.

543
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,291
So sorry.

544
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,730
- Wow.

545
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,691
- We're gonna be okay.

546
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:35,175
Because as soon as this
elevator tries to move...

547
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,177
- It was a selfie challenge.

548
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,138
- What?
- That's why I was down here.

549
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,619
See who can get
the most extreme shot.

550
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:51,278
So I forced open
the elevator doors,

551
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,585
leaned back in the chair,
and...

552
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:01,767
I'm so stupid, I know.

553
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:10,384
- The younger patients,

554
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:13,561
you know, the ones
who come here a lot,

555
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:16,216
they tend to feel left out.

556
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,393
Their friends are off
doing things and,

557
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,743
you know,
they're just stuck here.

558
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,746
Wanting people
to remember you...

559
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:30,317
That's not stupid.

560
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,711
We all want that.

561
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,718
- Hey!
Help!

562
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,111
- Hey!
- We're down here!

563
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,547
We're in the shaft!
- Help us, please!

564
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,245
Anybody! Hey!

565
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:46,768
- Please! Help!

566
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,291
Do you hear someone in there?

567
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,510
- What was that?

568
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:52,252
- Is someone down there?
- Hello? Hello?

569
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:55,211
- We're gonna get out of here.

570
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:02,697
- I'm gonna set
the plane in motion,

571
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,568
but you have to make it fly.

572
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:05,787
Like with the arm.

573
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,789
Imagine pressing a button,

574
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,660
and if your neural pathways
are connecting,

575
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,271
the sim will press the button.

576
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,490
If you don't connect,
you'll crash.

577
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,121
- Reset.

578
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,259
Reset.

579
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,663
- How many hours have you spent
in a cockpit?

580
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,883
- More than I can count.

581
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,667
This should be
second nature to me.

582
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,497
- I suspect it still is.

583
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,891
Close your eyes.

584
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:08,284
Close your eyes now.

585
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,678
Visualize the cockpit.

586
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:15,596
Tell me, what is
the farthest left indicator

587
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,685
on the instrument panel?

588
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:20,427
- The ASI.
The airspeed.

589
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,299
- Keep going.

590
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,519
- The attitude indicator.

591
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,651
Compass.

592
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,524
Up is the fuel gauge.

593
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,656
- You know this plane.

594
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,443
This is your plane,

595
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,358
not a simulator.

596
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,577
This is my plane.

597
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:42,884
- Say it again.

598
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,844
- This is my plane.

599
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:50,370
- Mateo, we are moving now.

600
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,502
You have a half-billion
dollar plane

601
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,678
that is your responsibility.

602
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,419
We are near the end
of the runway.

603
00:30:56,463 --> 00:31:00,554
You have to get us up
in the air right now.

604
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,447
- He's flying.

605
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:47,557
- Wow.

606
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,951
That's a...

607
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,518
that's a dress.

608
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,521
- Yes, and those are scrubs.

609
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,392
- That they are.

610
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:59,482
I guess this concludes our game
of name that clothing item.

611
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,702
Um, I need to talk to you
about crowdfunding.

612
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,660
- After you get dressed.
You're gonna be late.

613
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,488
- For what?
- The fundraiser.

614
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,055
- Which is tonight?
- It's in ten minutes.

615
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,709
Just throw something on
and get down there,

616
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,363
I've got to prep the kids.
- Uh, kids?

617
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,625
- The ones who are sharing
their stories.

618
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:12,974
- To raise money
for this hospital?

619
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,933
- Oh, yes.
It's a fundraiser, Max.

620
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,673
- Yeah, with the kids
that we're exploiting

621
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,937
to emotionally manipulate
people for cash.

622
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,982
- No one is exploiting anyone.
- You're damn right we're not.

623
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,724
We're cancelling
that fundraiser.

624
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,946
- Uh...

625
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,300
- It's called
therapeutic fibbing.

626
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:36,519
Instead of correcting
the patient's delusions,

627
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,173
you accept them.

628
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,001
- So everyone here treats
Dr. Rothman

629
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,960
like he's still a doctor?
- Within reason.

630
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,788
Whenever he leaves the floor
he has minders with him.

631
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:48,270
It's startling, I know,
but stability slows dementia.

632
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,446
And nothing's
more destabilizing

633
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,100
than forcing people
to acknowledge

634
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,146
they're in the grip
of delusions.

635
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,975
Excuse me.
- Have a good day.

636
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,588
- Okay, so I never
actually googled Rothman.

637
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:04,025
- Yeah, no kidding.
- I'm sorry.

638
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,986
Hey, it was just a joke
that got out of hand.

639
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,076
But I thought that he was like
a visiting doctor or something.

640
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,295
I never thought
that he was a patient.

641
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,949
And I never really thought

642
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,298
that you would think
that he was a ghost.

643
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:17,517
I'm sorry.

644
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,692
- No, Lauren,
I'm not mad at you, okay?

645
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,128
I'm mad at myself
for even half-believing

646
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,087
any of this nonsense.

647
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,132
- Okay, but that's my fault.
- No, it's not.

648
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:27,135
It's all me.
I'm the problem.

649
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,442
- Iggy...

650
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,444
- Sing a little song,
do a little dance.

651
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:32,923
Just be yourselves.

652
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,490
If you need anything, I'll...
- Helen.

653
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,144
- Yeah, I'll be with you
in just a sec.

654
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,580
- Yeah, well, I meant that

655
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,060
in the "what the hell"
kind of sense.

656
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,540
This does not look like
a cancelled gala.

657
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,976
- That's because it's not.

658
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,151
My first act as the newly
restored

659
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,023
Deputy Medical Director
was to ignore you.

660
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,198
- I can't believe
that you are okay

661
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,938
with exploiting
these children.

662
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,117
Kids?

663
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,032
Quick question.

664
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,077
Do you want me
to cancel the gala?

665
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:59,863
- Don't you, like,
need the money to cure cancer?

666
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:03,171
- Yes, but if not if it means
making you speak publicly

667
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,652
about something that you would
rather keep private.

668
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,002
- I mean, are y'all
being forced to do this?

669
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,308
- We want to do this.

670
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,092
This is how we help
the next kid with cancer.

671
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:13,529
- This is how we help Jessye.

672
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:17,316
- Max,
this isn't exploitation.

673
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,492
This is gratitude.

674
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,277
- Gratitude?

675
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,498
- You may know it
from such situations

676
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,674
as the time I saved you
from recklessly cancelling

677
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,502
an important fundraiser.

678
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,548
- Right.

679
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,334
Now I'm grateful that
you're willing to be Deputy

680
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:37,466
to a proven doofus.

681
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:42,950
And I'm also grateful
because...

682
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,692
you just showed me
how to do crowdfunding right.

683
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:02,100
- Mateo, we have to stop.

684
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,449
- No, no.
Not yet.

685
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,626
- You have an infection
at your surgical site.

686
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,497
We have to remove the implant.

687
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,630
- No.

688
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,199
No, I just wanna stay up here.

689
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,289
- But with the infection
this close to your brain,

690
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:21,119
we must stop now.

691
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,097
- Mm.
- Hey.

692
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,665
- Hey.

693
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,147
- You know that I would never
intentionally mock

694
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,323
Alzheimer's patients, right?

695
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,673
- Of course.
- Good.

696
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:57,067
- Parkinson's, though...

697
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,678
Just a little bit funny?

698
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:01,202
- That's maybe the worst joke
you've ever made.

699
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,339
- You seem really upset.

700
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,645
- Yeah, you know,
I'm--I'm--

701
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,300
I've just been going
through some stuff.

702
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,042
- That's why I'm here.

703
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,306
Wanna talk about it?

704
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,139
- So I've been on this diet,

705
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,796
and it's making me feel cold
and drowsy and weak.

706
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:35,541
And I've been having vivid
food fantasies.

707
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:40,720
And today, I temporarily
believed in ghosts,

708
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,678
which is...

709
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,463
that's not funny, really.

710
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,813
It's, um, it's more like what
happens

711
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:50,295
when my food stuff goes
a little too far.

712
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:55,213
But I don't even look good yet,

713
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,084
and people are giving me
compliments already,

714
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,477
so you do the math.

715
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,609
How terrible must I have looked
before?

716
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,612
So even if this diet
is intense,

717
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:06,746
it's necessary,
right?

718
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,145
- Mateo.

719
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:20,281
It's not fair.

720
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:24,416
I encouraged you
to go through so much.

721
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,374
To get so little in return.

722
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:34,339
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,604
- I'm not.

724
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,610
I'll never walk again...

725
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,657
But I got to fly.

726
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:59,407
- How long were you and this
kid in the elevator?

727
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:00,843
- About four hours.

728
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:03,324
Spleen isolated and removed.

729
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,934
- Music to my ears.

730
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:08,677
- There's a small tear in the
diaphragm near the sternum.

731
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,505
Can I suture?

732
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:13,508
- Ask the Chair.

733
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,295
- Show me what you got.

734
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,474

735

739
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:47,455
- Are we, uh,
really not gonna see you

740
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,501
until the wedding?
- Yeah, but it'll be fine.

741
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,330
- I'm not fine.
I'm sad.

742
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,940
- Well, you know
how these things go.

743
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,724
You know,
like I just did the surgery

744
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:58,205
and we saved the kid,
and everything was great,

745
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,815
but the whole time
I was thinking

746
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,470
this isn't my OR anymore,
you know?

747
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,821
Things end.
People forget.

748
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,476
- Tevi will remember.

749
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,262
So will every single one
of your patients...

750
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,396
and so will I.

751
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,746
- Thank you.

752
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,315
- And so will every single one
of your friends

753
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,926
who are waiting around
this corner to surprise you.

754
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,538
- Hey!
- Yo!

755
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,498
- Surprise!

756
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,805

It's just a small event.

768
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,767
- I got the surgery I needed
to survive last year.

769
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,639
- I got mine ten years ago.

770
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:11,425
- We got money to keep
our little girl healthy,

771
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,688
but what about
the next little girl?

772
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,604
Our family has
so much gratitude

773
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:19,477
and we want to help
whoever comes next.

774
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,609
- Last year, I almost died.

775
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,655
Now I'm going to college.

776
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,874
Can you help
the next person like me?

777
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:29,095
We get to tell our stories
because we're survivors.

778
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,575
- I'm a survivor.

779
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,012
And we want our friends
to be survivors too.

780
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:40,541
- Last year, I was diagnosed
with squamous cell carcinoma,

781
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,891
and, uh...

782
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,937
I didn't want to admit
that it was happening.

783
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,548
I didn't want
to talk about it,

784
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,942
not even with
my closest friends.

785
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:53,989
But in New Amsterdam and all
the amazing people in it,

786
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:57,819
they--they helped me
through it.

787
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:00,126
So I'm a survivor.

788
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:03,695
And so many others aren't,
not yet.

789
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:07,612
So that's why
I'm asking you to donate

790
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:12,747
because it's not for me,
it's for them.
