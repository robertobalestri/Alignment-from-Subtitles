1
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:17,321
- Okay, so basically you want
Bobbi to stay up for you?

2
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,280
She could at least try.

3
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,672
- Just for a few
good night kisses.

4
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,065
- Right.

5
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,545
- And then go to sleep
super easy

6
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:25,199
with no bouncing, white noise,
or tiptoeing required.

7
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,114
Very realistic plan.

8
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:29,507
- I have been using
the five Ss by the way.

9
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,553
Thank you for that.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,815
- Really knocks Luna out.
Lifesaver.

11
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,123
- The real lifesaver is
you can take Luna to work.

12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,429
Sadly, Bobbi's not into
the whole music scene.

13
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,388
- Not what she told me.

14
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,737
Is everything okay?

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,090
Yeah, I got
impossible-to-get tickets

16
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,049
for me and a friend to
see Carol Churchill's play.

17
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,833
- Oh, I'm dying to see that.
- And my friend just bailed.

18
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,791
- Oh.

19
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:57,274
- You should come.
- Um, yeah--no, uh...

20
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,710
- If you want, I mean.
No pressure.

21
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:00,321
- No, I mean if you want.
I don't wanna...

22
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,626
- If you don't,
that's cool.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,238
- I'm into it.
Yes.

24
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:06,240
- Okay.
- Okay, so--

25
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:09,069
- Great.
- Great.

26
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,114
- Yeah.

27
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:20,558
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,214
Sorry!
Sorry, I'm late.

29
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,695
I hate being the last one
here--uh, Sergeant Todd.

30
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:27,783
- Sir.

31
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,437
- Uh, are we very early
or very late?

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,221
- There's no meeting,
Dr. Goodwin.

33
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,353
- No meeting?

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,443
Why do I suddenly get the
feeling I'm being ambushed?

35
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,184
- No, no.
If this were an ambush

36
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:39,186
I would've placed myself
against that wall,

37
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,752
allowing the open door
to obscure me

38
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,667
as you entered the room.

39
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,148
I'm here to deliver a message
from the board

40
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,410
that they were
too afraid to deliver.

41
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,151
- Which is?

42
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,457
- You have to cut $2 million
from the budget

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,501
by the end of tomorrow.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,419
And may I send a specifically
worded message back with you?

45
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,421
- As soon as we've picked
what goes.

46
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,643
Now, it appears in your tenure
at New Amsterdam,

47
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:04,472
you have created more than
200 very successful programs.

48
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:05,690
- Thank you, Todd.

49
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,431
- That have
absolutely no funding.

50
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:08,867
Most never did.

51
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,480
This one here, CF56Z,

52
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,656
costs exactly 2 million.

53
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,746
We could get this done
right now.

54
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,751
- Great, CF56Z,
that would be...hmm.

55
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:26,363
"Postnatal Care for
Undocumented Mothers."

56
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,887
- That's unfortunate.
- It is, Todd.

57
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,455
- I'm not here to argue

58
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,153
which of these programs
deserves to stay.

59
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,284
I'm here to make sure that

60
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,633
2 million dollars'
worth of them goes.

61
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:38,332
- And if I refuse?

62
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,725
- Then New Amsterdam
will not make payroll.

63
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,814
And tomorrow
every one of your employees

64
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,469
will be sent home
without a dime.

65
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,653
- Notice anything
different about me?

66
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:57,264
And don't say my hair

67
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,179
because I chopped it off last
year, and I will punch you.

68
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,571
- Good morning.
- What?

69
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,833
- Good morning.
That's what people say

70
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,183
when they first interact
for in day.

71
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,706
- Yeah, well, it was implied.
Hey now--

72
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,534
- All I'm saying is that every
time I'm in the hallway

73
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,666
people are jumping out at me
mid-conversation.

74
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,841
It's rude.

75
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,626
There is always time
for manners.

76
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,323
- Outside of nuclear
submarines,

77
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,672
this is literally the place

78
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,283
with the least amount of time
for manners.

79
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,806
Now, you know what?
I'm just gonna tell you.

80
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,461
It's my leg.
I'm finally better.

81
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,202
No more braces,
no more crutches...

82
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,347
- Lauren.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,829
- Oh, we really need
to work on your manners.

84
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,222
- Hey, we need help!

85
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,571
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, please, please.

86
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,442
Somebody help my wife!
- You don't have to shout.

87
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,965
- Just please tell me
what happened.

88
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,837
- She fell, hit her head--
- No, no.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,360
- She was unconscious.
- I bumped my head.

90
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,275
It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is a big deal!

91
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,885
I just slipped for a second.
- This is serious.

92
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,409
- Please, don't make
a drama out of it.

93
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,975
- Hi, I'm Dr. Bloom.
- Hi.

94
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,586
- We're gonna figure out just
how big a deal this is, okay?

95
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,109
- I promise you,
it looks worse than it is.

96
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,720
- Let's go to bay 27.
- I slipped on our way to Shul,

97
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,853
in front everyone we know.
- Okay, Dr. Walsh!

98
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,550
Please, can you come
stitch up a lac--

99
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,986
And let's get, um...

100
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,946
- Steph Goldman.
- Mrs. Goldman a CT scan.

101
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,469
- But it's the Sabbath.

102
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,905
No electricity.
- It's not a big deal.

103
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,907
- If mom hit her head,
it could be dangerous.

104
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,692
HaShem makes exceptions
to save a life.

105
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,389
- Uh, if you could just go
with Casey,

106
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,738
and I'm gonna bring
your mom right back, okay?

107
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,044
- Mom.
Mom, wait.

108
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,003
- Can I stay with her?

109
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,005
- Ah...

110
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,399
How did I get so lucky?

111
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,401
Is it okay if she stays?

112
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,750
- Uh, sure.
Yeah.

113
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,362
- Thank you.
Come here, sweetheart.

114
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,929
I am fine.
It looks worse than it is.

115
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,757
Your mother's a klutz.

116
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,585
- It's just a little blood.

117
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,630
Right?

118
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,638
- Oh, you must be
my new mentee, Dawn.

119
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,769
- Uh--

120
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,162
- Today must be
very exciting for you.

121
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,860
I still remember my first day
working in a hospital.

122
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:56,905
Oh.

123
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,385
Thank you, but I'm--
I'm actually--

124
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,343
- Now, before you join me
on my rounds,

125
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,519
I've compiled these books
you must read to give you

126
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,914
a proper framework on Neurology
at New Amsterdam.

127
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:08,438
- Dr. Kapoor.
I'm not Dawn.

128
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,701
I'm Dr. Gibbs,
the lead programmer.

129
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,486
- Programmer?

130
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,662
Yes.

131
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,621
This is D.A.W.N.

132
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,407
The Diagnostic Assessment
Wellness Network.

133
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:23,975
I don't understand.

134
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,110
You want me to mentor an iPad?
- Dawn is a prototype

135
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,460
for what we hope will become
the most advanced

136
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,463
Artificial Intelligence program
in medical diagnosing.

137
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,117
- But, wh--I'm--
no, no, no, no--

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,466
- You'll take D.A.W.N.
with you on rounds,

139
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,685
so it can improve
its algorithms,

140
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,556
and these textbooks,
I'll just upload them.

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,862
Upload?

142
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,646
It took me years
to read those books.

143
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,648
- Well, D.A.W.N.'s connected to
the hospital's medical network.

144
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,042
So you'll have instant access
to patient files,

145
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:50,045
radiology scans,
MRIs, lab data.

146
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:54,702
With your help, D.A.W.N. will
become the future of medicine.

147
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,835
- Nice to meet you,
Dr. Kay-poor.

148
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,620
- Mm.

149
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:00,838
- It's Kapoor!

150
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,537
- I refuse.

151
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,016
- Okay, Todd, here's the deal.

152
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,061
Since we are not gonna

153
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,541
cut anything major
from this budget,

154
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,891
we're gonna make a lot of
small cuts to each department.

155
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:12,763
- My commanding officer would
call that the Fabian Strategy.

156
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,112
- That's the one.

157
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,505
- You have no idea
what that is, do you?

158
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,115
- No, I do not.
- Max, you got a sec?

159
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,595
- Yeah.
- It's about my future.

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,380
- Great, I wanna talk to you
about your future as well.

161
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,424
- You do?
- Yeah.

162
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,817
You have, uh, seven

163
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,427
dual-chamber
pacemaker surgeries

164
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,863
on the books for tomorrow?
- That's right.

165
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,475
- Yeah, so those pacemakers
are made in Mexico,

166
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,085
but the American inventors
charge three times as much,

167
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,956
so we're gonna
cancel the order,

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,872
place it directly with the
manufacturer in Mexico city.

169
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,961
It's gonna save us 50,000,

170
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,572
but it's gonna, uh, have
to push your surgeries.

171
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,704
Why not save money on shipping

172
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:42,750
and just have me do
the surgeries in Mexico?

173
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,449
- No, that--
that was sarcasm.

174
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,885
- That was genius.

175
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,583
Mexico's opening tons
of new clinics

176
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,454
in response to our
skyrocketing medical costs.

177
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,543
We could pay for you and your
patients to fly to Mexico,

178
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,719
it's gonna save them in
co-pays, and us, like, 50--

179
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,895
$100,000.

180
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,855
- So my patients are supposed
to just go to Mexico tomorrow?

181
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,204
- Yeah.
Only if they're content with

182
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,988
getting the same surgery,
with the same surgeon

183
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,903
for less money
and a better view.

184
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:08,993
100,000 down.
You happy?

185
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,560
- Sure.

186
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,041
Why wouldn't I be happy about
outsourcing American jobs?

187
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,738
- That also--
- Sarcasm.

188
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:15,957
- Yeah.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,567
- I don't know what Ralph
and Piggy thought

190
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,917
when they found it,
I think both the conch shell

191
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,877
and the boar's head symbolize
power, just different types.

192
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,139
- Knock knock.

193
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,924
I hate to interrupt
the creative process,

194
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,883
but I have the results
of your biopsy.

195
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,495
The mass in your stomach

196
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,150
turned out to be a Primitive
Neuroectodermal Tumor.

197
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:36,934
- Tumor?

198
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,675
- The good news is,
it's benign.

199
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,894
Surgeons should be able
to remove it,

200
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,591
and Cephas will make
a full recovery.

201
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,811
- What caused it?

202
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,729
- Tumors are very sensitive
to hormone levels

203
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,122
inside the body,
and in Cephas' case,

204
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,863
he had an excessive amount
of cortisol,

205
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,736
which is one of the body's
main stress hormones.

206
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,957
How does a 13-year-old
get a tumor from stress?

207
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:03,178
- That's what
I'd like to find out.

208
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,876
- Dr. Sharpe didn't
say anything

209
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,269
about the tumor
being in my brain.

210
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,010
- No, no, no, no.
Um...

211
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,490
that's a little misleading.

212
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,883
Psych is not just about what's
going on in your head.

213
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,145
Because what is going on
up there

214
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,930
can affect
your entire body, right?

215
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:19,499
In your case, excessive
cortisol levels caused a tumor,

216
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:23,154
but cortisol is triggered by
PTSD, stress, anxiety--

217
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,809
- But, I don't have
any of those things.

218
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,115
PTSD?

219
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,683
My life was pretty boring
until I came here.

220
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,162
- Okay.

221
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,816
Do you have any stressors
in your life?

222
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,644
- I'm good.

223
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,604
Home's good.
School's good.

224
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,607
My biggest stressor
is the school librarian.

225
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,913
- The librarian?
All right.

226
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,741
What's happening there?
Tell me about that.

227
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,265
- She refuses to let me
check out some books

228
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,007
because they're reserved
for gifted students--

229
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,096
even though I've been
reading them for years.

230
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,576
That's it.

231
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,883
- But that upset you.
- Yeah.

232
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,276
But they're just books.
Who cares?

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,105
- Well, yeah, but they're
not just books, are they?

234
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,629
And I think that you care.

235
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,631
I think you care
very much.

236
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,981
Tell me why.

237
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,338
- Because I'm smart too.

238
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,210
- Yeah.

239
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,778
Does anyone else in your life
make you feel that way?

240
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,259
Less than?
Diminished?

241
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,696
- I'm 13,

242
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,917
so, like...everybody.

243
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,834
- You know what?

244
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,053
Let's, uh, let's try something
different here.

245
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:40,362
Yes.

246
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,626
All right, Cephas, I'm going
to read a few remarks,

247
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,628
and you simply have to reply
one through ten.

248
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,718
One meaning almost never,
ten meaning almost always.

249
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,285
Okay?

250
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:53,070
Piece of cake.
Here we go.

251
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,725
What you think doesn't count
very much.

252
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,205
- Ten.

253
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,207
- Ten?
Really?

254
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,079
- Yeah, ten.

255
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,690
Ten it is.

256
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,257
You feel excluded, isolated.

257
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,650
- Ten.

258
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,913
- The rich get richer
while the poor get poorer.

259
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,741
- Absolutely ten.

260
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,916
- When I walk into a store,

261
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,614
I am followed
or closely watched.

262
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,703
- Ten.
These questions are easy.

263
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,144
- You feel threatened,
harassed,

264
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,189
even if you can't
articulate why.

265
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,369
- Ten.

266
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,940
- Make yourself comfortable,
there's a couch over there.

267
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,812
- Hey.
Is he okay?

268
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,249
- Yeah, yeah, he's, um--
he's okay.

269
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,860
I had Cephas answer some
questions from a Harvard test

270
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,166
known as "Unrest."

271
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,342
It is designed to, um,

272
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,431
measure someone's level
of social resistance.

273
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,824
- Social resistance?

274
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:54,349
- When people like us oppose
the values and policies

275
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,307
of the dominant culture.
- That's right.

276
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,658
- And what does that
have to do with--

277
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,225
- Your son, he feels threatened
on a daily basis.

278
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,228
Like everything he's earned can
just be taken away.

279
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,448
He's disenfranchised.

280
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,146
But because his life is
seemingly free from all this,

281
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,107
because he can't name it,
he's internalizing it.

282
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,196
- Name what?

283
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,329
- Racism.

284
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,984
I think your son's tumor
was caused by racism.

285
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,655
- Good to see you,
Mrs. Holland.

286
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,135
- Dr. Reynolds, this place...

287
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,703
no offence, but it's so much
nicer than New Amsterdam.

288
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,531
- I'm glad you approve.
I'll see you in there.

289
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,665
Wow, this is quite
the operation.

290
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,449
We're pretty proud of it.

291
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,582
For people who can't afford
American healthcare

292
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,888
or a nice safe alternative.

293
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,803
- And you only do
pacemakers here?

294
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,370
- Focusing one procedure
makes us hyper efficient.

295
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:00,763
- How efficient?

296
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,244
- Well, we can usually
knock out about 11 a day.

297
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:06,595
Ah--that's pretty efficient.

298
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,598
It may not be as fancy
as your cardio wing, but--

299
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,340
- It definitely is.
It's nice!

300
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,820
- How long have
you been Chair?

301
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:17,867
- Uh, for about a year,
but I'm leaving.

302
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,261
- Oh, I hear you.

303
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,698
Public hospitals are what
sent me packing for Mexico.

304
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,266
- Oh, I actually love
New Amsterdam.

305
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,963
- Then why?

306
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,792
- I love my fiancée more.

307
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,667
- Max!

308
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,887
Max, I need to talk to you.

309
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,889
- Yeah, what's up?

310
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,761
- She keeps coming back.

311
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,850
- Should I be made aware
of any suspicious activity?

312
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,199
- Just stand down, Todd.

313
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,679
- She wants to teach a computer
to replace me.

314
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,465
After all the personal
sacrifices I've made,

315
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,510
just to have an iPad
steal my knowledge--

316
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,077
it is not
"artificial" intelligence,

317
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,992
it is my intelligence.

318
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,689
- Max we're due in dermatology.
- I know.

319
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,648
Vijay, since I have no idea
what you're talking about,

320
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,476
I'm gonna trust you
to make the right decision.

321
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,999
- Thank you.
I won't do it.

322
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,958
No matter how much her company
is paying the hospital.

323
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,350
- Come again?

324
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:07,612
- How much are they
paying the hospital?

325
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,832
- They are--
- $160,000.

326
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,966
- Really?
That's, uh--Vijay,

327
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,403
my friend, I think
that you and the iPad

328
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,840
might've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

329
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,976
- My body's been sore, and my
girl saw this crazy rash.

330
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,544
- I have a couple of theories.
The first one I think--

331
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,764
- Diagnosis confirmed.
Lyme disease.

332
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,897
An email is being sent
to your account

333
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,116
with detailed
treatment information.

334
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:39,514
- Yes,
something to do with your--

335
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:46,738
- I'm sorry,
but let me see--I--I...

336
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,487
- What happens next?

337
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,576
- We wait for the results
from your CT scan.

338
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,014
Unfortunately, it can take
a couple hours to arrive

339
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,450
from, uh, Radiology
because--

340
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,366
- CT scan results
have arrived.

341
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,847
- Diagnosis ACA aneurysm.
- What?

342
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,413
- What? Where?
- What?

343
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,980
- What, what?
- Aneurysm is located

344
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,591
on the anterior clinoid
segment--

345
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,464
- Nobody likes a show-off,
so just shut up, okay?

346
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,912
- I-I have to go.
I need that back please.

347
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:33,046
Okay.
You keep it.

348
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,917
Every day, 9:30-9:45--

349
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,919
Sandra Fall from billing!
Hi.

350
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,529
How goes it?

351
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,053
- It doesn't go good because
you can't code for racism.

352
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:43,883
- And yet, I did, so...

353
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,928
- No, you hand-wrote
a non-option in the margin

354
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,583
like a Bern Bro during
the 2016 General Election.

355
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,585
- Yes, I did, because
there isn't a code

356
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,760
for my actual diagnosis.

357
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,848
- Okay, then change
your diagnosis

358
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,154
to an approved ICD-10 code

359
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,807
because that's how we bill
insurance companies.

360
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,157
- No.
No, I'm sorry,

361
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,680
I'm not gonna change
my diagnosis,

362
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,421
Sandra Fall from billing--
not this time.

363
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,162
Many, many times I've played it
fast and loose

364
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,467
with insurance codes
to help patients.

365
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:04,860
- Please, don't tell me that!
- Many times.

366
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,818
But this time it will
actually hurt patients.

367
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,038
Like, specifically
the 13-year-old boy

368
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,780
who is lying in our OR
with a tumor.

369
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,477
He's proof that racism

370
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,783
can cause life-threatening
medical issues,

371
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,132
and no one is doing
anything about it

372
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,786
because no one is tracking
the data to prove it.

373
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,049
And do you know why no one is
tracking the data to prove it?

374
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,965
- Because the ICD-10 doesn't
have a diagnostic code for it?

375
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,619
- Exactly.
- Dr. Frome,

376
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,926
go ahead, change the world,

377
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,624
but not until
you change the ICD codes.

378
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,801
That's--

379
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,021
- Clamp.

380
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,761
- Cephas' tumor's
nestled up against

381
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,589
the inferior mesenteric.

382
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,982
- I can definitely
get in there.

383
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,941
Forceps.

384
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,987
- NR BP 55.

385
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,946
- Dr. Ayton,
look at this.

386
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,730
Right next to the duodenum.

387
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,080
- Another tumor.

388
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,256
- Patient is hemodynamically
stable.

389
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,825
- And looks like another two
right at the celiac junction.

390
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,522
- Four total?

391
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,220
- Surgery's gonna take
a bit longer.

392
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,526
- I'll go tell his mother.

393
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,141
- Helen, from what I can tell,

394
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,665
these tumors are just going
to keep recurring.

395
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,102
And next time they might not
be benign.

396
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,540
- Stand by with
pylorus clamp.

397
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,239
- Okay, give it to me straight,
Todd.

398
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,197
- 100,000 from cardiothoracic--
- Yep.

399
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,069
- 160k from neurology--
- Yep.

400
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,635
- 45,000 from dermatology.

401
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,897
- Come on, admit it.

402
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,116
This skimming thing
is kind of working, right?

403
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,509
- So long as everyone
does their part

404
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,901
and sacrifices
for the greater good.

405
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,729
- Exactly.
- Like Communism.

406
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,035
- Max!
- Yeah?

407
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,689
- Notice anything different
about me?

408
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,299
- Actually,
I have been noticing

409
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:38,693
a lot of your patients
are being admitted

410
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,826
before they need to be.
Uh, ACS, pre-crisis diabetics--

411
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,742
The thing is, if they don't
actually end up in crisis,

412
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,092
then we can't bill for it.

413
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,051
- It's my leg.
Um, finally better.

414
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,793
No biggie.
- That's great.

415
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,882
So, it would save this hospital
a lot of money

416
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,189
if you could keep
these patients in the ED

417
00:16:56,232 --> 00:17:00,062
for observation until a crisis
diagnosis can be confirmed.

418
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,064
- If you don't mind hiring
20 more nurses,

419
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,805
a dozen more orderlies,

420
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,198
and increasing
the number of residents,

421
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,156
and adding, like,
30 beds, then sure.

422
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,115
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

423
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,725
This area is off limits!

424
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,596
You can't just keep coming back
here like this!

425
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,903
Who the hell
do you think you are?

426
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,078
Uh...

427
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,471
- So ultimately,

428
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,951
I don't think it's going to
save you any money.

429
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,216
- She seems fun.

430
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,740
- Yeah, I'll figure out
whatever, uh, that was,

431
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:28,221
but right now
I need a new strategy.

432
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:31,615
- We could always
revisit cutting CF56Z.

433
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:34,096
- You mean "Postnatal Care
for Undocumented Mothers."

434
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,795
- I mean to save this hospital.
From your own good intentions.

435
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,885
- I need some help here!

436
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,236
Grab me an orderly
and a non-rebreather mask!

437
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,846
- Hey, what happened?

438
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,239
- She just started walking
and collapsed.

439
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,110
- Okay, well, let's get her
back on her feet.

440
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,807
- I-I can't feel my legs.

441
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:50,852
- Where?
What part?

442
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,158
- All over.
Everywhere.

443
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,160
- What do her CTs say?
- Nothing.

444
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,335
They were all clear.

445
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,945
- Do we need a collar?
- Please, I--

446
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,121
I can't--I can't feel my legs.
- Mom?

447
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,036
Are you okay?
- I can't feel my legs.

448
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,342
What's going on?

449
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,126
Please!
- She didn't hit her head.

450
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,649
She just fell down.

451
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,837
- Sir.
- Sir.

452
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,144
- Hi there.
- Ma'am.

453
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,060
- Um, thank you for agreeing
to meet us here.

454
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
- We thought neutral territory
would be best

455
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,411
for what Dr. Goodwin
has to say.

456
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:29,717
- Yeah.
- Max, I think

457
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,458
I can save New Amsterdam
and the city of New York

458
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,720
hundreds of millions
of dollars.

459
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,983
- Oh, then you should
definitely go first.

460
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,898
- There's a 13-year-old boy
in surgery right now

461
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,161
having multiple tumors removed
caused by racism.

462
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:42,164
I know--I know how that sounds,
trust me, I do,

463
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,384
but yesterday, I treated
two patients with PTSD

464
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:45,907
from the exact same thing.

465
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,430
Our ED,
at least three times a week,

466
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:48,910
treats victims of hate crimes.

467
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,739
The city is spending hundreds
of millions of dollars

468
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,784
managing medical repercussions
of racism,

469
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,090
and it doesn't even know it

470
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,397
because the ICD-10
does not have a code for it.

471
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,050
- This is not
gonna save us money.

472
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,182
- How can I help?

473
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:01,749
- A campaign
to make the ICD-10

474
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,185
add racism
to their diagnostic index.

475
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,926
All I need
is a little bit of money

476
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,797
for a small team of
researchers and lobbyists--

477
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,103
No.

478
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,889
- What?
Say that again?

479
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,369
- No.

480
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,329
- That's--I've never heard you
say that word before.

481
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,069
- In order to balance
the budget,

482
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,246
Max has no choice
but to cut personnel.

483
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,335
- How awful.

484
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:25,076
- Did you guys have
anyone in mind?

485
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,392
- Back away slowly.

486
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,266
Go, go, slower.

487
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,138
Okay, break.
Break--break for it.

488
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,797
- Four tumors,
all being removed--

489
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,234
it's just going to take
a little bit more time.

490
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,063
- Why is this happening
to my son?

491
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,806
- Uh...

492
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:04,464
Cephas let me read his essay
on "Lord of the Flies,

493
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:08,294
and it's clear
just how open he is.

494
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,774
to the world.

495
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:14,213
And while that openness lets in
a lot of beauty,

496
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,085
it also lets in darker things.

497
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:24,440
- God, I really thought
that I shielded him from...

498
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,877
everything that
I have to deal with.

499
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:32,796
I jumped through hoops to get
him into a progressive school

500
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,972
with a uniform policy.

501
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,888
I got him into group sports
with diverse coaches.

502
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,499
His friends are amazing.
I--

503
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:45,940
I thought I was doing
a good job, I really--

504
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,899
- You--you are doing more
than a good job.

505
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,989
That boy is extraordinary

506
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,513
because of you.

507
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:01,999
Even here,
in this progressive hospital,

508
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,480
I deal with microaggressions
every day.

509
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,613
From people who mean well.

510
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,876
From people
who should know better.

511
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,358
That's the world
that we live in.

512
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,405
- So, then what can I do

513
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,495
to keep my son from ending up
here next year?

514
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,238
Next month?

515
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,853
- Have you been out of country
recently?

516
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,159
- No.

517
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,293
- Been bitten by an animal
or a rodent?

518
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,512
- Uh, just the occasional
mosquito bite.

519
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,514
- Started any new diets?

520
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,516
- We keep kosher.
Nothing trendy.

521
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,563
- Swam in any natural
bodies of water?

522
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,130
- No.

523
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:52,223
Do you have any idea
what's happening to me?

524
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,225
- Will you excuse us
for a second?

525
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,966
Okay.

526
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,537
Any theories?

527
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,670
- Guillain-Barre syndrome
and Zika

528
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,672
are both known
to cause leg paralysis,

529
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,413
but her tests
came back normal.

530
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,371
- And her CT came back negative

531
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,068
except for some swelling
around the spine.

532
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,941
- The only viable option right
now is to treat her symptoms,

533
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,987
push steroids to reduce
her spinal swelling,

534
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,556
unless D.A.W.N. has a different
diagnosis to humiliate me.

535
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,688
D.A.W.N.-ji?

536
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:28,434
This is bad.

537
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:35,266
This is my favorite achievement
since coming here.

538
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,399
Free daycare for all employees.

539
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,575
- I don't see how getting rid
of a few daycare employees

540
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,447
is gonna put a dent
in the budget.

541
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,101
- Well, we contract out
the daycare service.

542
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,668
It's a luxury,
I mean, it's not essential,

543
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:49,106
and if we close it,
we might break even.

544
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,108
- You're closing the daycare?

545
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,023
- Now, Mariana,
I wouldn't even consider this

546
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,200
unless I absolutely had to.
I mean, I need the daycare too.

547
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:58,246
- So do a lot of the nurses
and residents.

548
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,422
- I hear you, but--
- I don't think you do.

549
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:03,947
- Do you know how expensive
regular daycare is?

550
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,558
Not to mention,
they're only open ten hours,

551
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,560
and most of us work
12-hour shifts.

552
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,736
Are you gonna cut our hours
and pay us more too?

553
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,434
- I need to cut costs
just to make payroll.

554
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,132
- Well,
you can keep my paycheck

555
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:16,656
because if we have to pay
for daycare,

556
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,397
a lot of us will need new jobs.

557
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,972
- We're not gonna cut
daycare, are we?

558
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,152
- At the aortic arch.

559
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,763
- Anterior wall
of the left atrium

560
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,591
looks prime for placement
of the first lead.

561
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,288
- All right, advancing now.

562
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,161
- Just as good
as at New Amsterdam?

563
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,381
I'm not gonna lie to you,

564
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,470
I'm pretty proud
of what we accomplished.

565
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,168
I mean, that's what makes
leaving so hard, you know?

566
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,651
Whoa.
Is that from a lung?

567
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,349
Did I hit something?
- No, it's from her stomach.

568
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,351
Massive hematemesis.

569
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,658
- Maybe it's a bleeding ulcer
or a Mallory Weiss Tear.

570
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:05,095
- It looks like
variceal bleeding.

571
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,315
- Her cirrhotic liver
decompensated.

572
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:08,490
The blood is backing up
behind it.

573
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,665
We need to make a new pathway

574
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,362
so the blood
can bypass the liver.

575
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,755
- Heart rate's up to 130.

576
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,801
- All right, transfuse 2
units of packed red cells.

577
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:17,586
- We don't have a blood bank.
We're not a hospital.

578
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,718
I'm calling an ambulance.

579
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,067
- Her blood pressure's
dropping.

580
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,503
We don't have time.
We're working on her now.

581
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,722
- I told you,

582
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,201
we're only equipped
for cardiac emergencies.

583
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,683
- Then we have to treat
Grace's liver like a heart.

584
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,171
- She's never there anymore.

585
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,477
She's only about her trial
these days.

586
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,565
- Uh, can I run
something by you?

587
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,001
- Sure,
but where's your bodyguard?

588
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,437
- Oh, I gave him the slip.

589
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,569
- Really?
- No, that's impossible.

590
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:44,744
He's at lunch.

591
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,223
- I'm having a bit
of a budget crisis,

592
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:49,400
and I finally figured out
a way to, uh, close the gap.

593
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,098
You ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

594
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:54,405
- Okay, I want to eliminate
all over-testing.

595
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,538
- That's a great idea.
- Really?

596
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,061
- Oh, my God,

597
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,933
you're the first person who has
not wanted to strangle me,

598
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,065
or you know,
slam the door in my face.

599
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,632
What test did you have in mind?

600
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,505
- I wanna cut
yearly mammograms.

601
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,071
- Sorry?
- I know how that sounds,

602
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:09,769
okay, but
the US Preventative Task Force

603
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,640
says they're unnecessary
for women under 50

604
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,642
unless of course they fall
into a high-risk group.

605
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:16,689
- Yeah, the American Cancer
Society says 45.

606
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:19,082
A woman's individual doctor
might say 40.

607
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,389
These tests aren't one-size
fits all.

608
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,564
- I'm not saying they are.

609
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:23,652
All I am saying
is women under 50

610
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,045
are more likely
to get false positive

611
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,612
and therefore
be over-diagnosed

612
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:27,917
and over-treated
for something

613
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,484
that may ultimately be
benign.

614
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,399
- Someone may want
that peace of mind.

615
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,793
- Well, but should New
Amsterdam be paying for it?

616
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,447
- Fine, cut yearly mammograms.
- Really?

617
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,840
- Sure.
- Thank you.

618
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,407
- Except those mammograms

619
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,496
are actually money-makers
for this hospital.

620
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,672
- I walked right into this,
didn't I?

621
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,500
- If you cut mammograms paid
for by insurance,

622
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,936
I'm fairly certain

623
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,459
it's gonna make your budget
shortfall even worse.

624
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,374
- What about mammograms not
covered by insurance?

625
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,551
- So you're suggesting
two standards of care,

626
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,465
one for women with insurance
and one for women without?

627
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,859
- No, because that would be--

628
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,382
- Draconian.
- Yeah.

629
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,820
And I would be ashamed to even
be having this conversation.

630
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,299
- Don't be,

631
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,084
because I'm sure Castro
will cut whatever you want.

632
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,391
- Mm.

633
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,703
- Glad I was at lunch
for that one.

634
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,622
- These cardiac stents
are too small.

635
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,581
They're made to open
a tiny artery,

636
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,583
not make a large conduit
for bypassing the liver.

637
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,150
- If I can just get
this last stent in place,

638
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,805
the portal vein and the
hepatic vein will flow as one.

639
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,938
- Switch ultrasound
to Doppler mode.

640
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,418
- I don't see anything.
There's no flow.

641
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,159
- You missed the connection.
We must have gone too distal.

642
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,422
- BP's dropping again.

643
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,468
- Hang a bag of Dobutamine.
Titrate to 3 micrograms.

644
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,904
- I'm gonna try
to pass the wire.

645
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:44,037
See if you can grab it,
all right?

646
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,605
That'll help us
make the connection.

647
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,563
Little further.

648
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:51,653
A little further.

649
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,917
Now.
- Got it.

650
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,571
- Muy bien.

651
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,007
- Looks like flow.

652
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,880
I can't believe it.

653
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,882
- Gauze.

654
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,711
- Forgot how much
I missed real medicine.

655
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,689
- My baby.

656
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,691
- Okay, but the W.H.O.
needs a sponsor,

657
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:32,694
and I can't--I can't get
a sponsor until the W.H.O.--

658
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,740
Right exactly.

659
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:35,958
Yes.
- Iggy!

660
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,482
- Yes, I'll be there.
Thank you very much.

661
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,659
- Iggy, where have you been?

662
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,009
- Every day patients come in
with so many stressors

663
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:45,141
that I have no idea
what the problem is.

664
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:47,666
With Cephas, I know exactly
what the problem is,

665
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:48,841
but I can't to do
anything about it,

666
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:51,495
which is just crazy-maker,
you know?

667
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,149
So I just managed
to get a meeting

668
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:54,803
with a member the World Health
Organization so I can lobby--

669
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,979
- Okay, Iggy, I love you,

670
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,807
and I mean this
in the best possible way--

671
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,026
- Uh-oh.

672
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:02,681
- Forget about trying
to save the world

673
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,771
and focus on trying
to save our patient,

674
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:08,164
'cause no one else is going to.

675
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,177
- Help.
Help, please, help.

676
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,918
- Okay, deep breaths for me,
Steph, okay?

677
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,834
Deep breaths.
- Now I can't move my arms.

678
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:29,708
- Okay, let's get her on 100%
non-rebreather and a stat EKG.

679
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,014
- Squeeze my hands.
Come on, as hard as you can.

680
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:33,668
- I can't.

681
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,756
Steph!

682
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,759
- Okay, let's get her
on 2 milligrams of Ativan.

683
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:38,934
2 milligrams of Ativan!

684
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,588
Oh, Mommy...

685
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,764
I need that Ativan!

686
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,725
- Mommy, please stop.

687
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,773
- Ascending paralysis.

688
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,080
Soon she won't be able
to breathe.

689
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:56,212
- It could be
Neuro-Bechet's Disease.

690
00:28:56,256 --> 00:29:00,216
- Diagnostic accuracy
below 1%.

691
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,697
- A tumor can cause
paraneoplastic syndrome.

692
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,266
- Diagnostic accuracy
less than 1%.

693
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,224
- D.A.W.N. if you do not
have any actual ideas,

694
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,225
please shut up.

695
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:11,097
- Advise patient be placed

696
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,055
in phenobarbital coma

697
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,318
until diagnosis
can be reached.

698
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:18,278
- Tell me we're not
doing that.

699
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,889
- If we do not reach
diagnosis today...

700
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:23,892
We'll have to.

701
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:31,770
I really thought
we could do it.

702
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,902
- We knew this
would be painful.

703
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,643
Why do you think
Brantley sent me?

704
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:37,166
- I could chip away at it,

705
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,300
but every cut
just makes this hospital worse.

706
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,258
- Which is why
I still think you should pick

707
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,087
one big ticket item.

708
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,697
Will it make
the hospital worse?

709
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,308
Unfortunately, yes.

710
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,919
But will it compromise every
single one of your departments?

711
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,138
No.

712
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,662
- Yeah.

713
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,795
You know,
we were the first hospital

714
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,753
in the country
to cover postnatal care

715
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,929
for undocumented mothers.

716
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:09,024
We were trying
to be pioneers.

717
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:19,382
Now I can make payroll.

718
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,003
- Max.

719
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,440
You did the right thing.

720
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,733
- Well, it looks like
Klinger's missed

721
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,909
11 games this year,
and he's been battling

722
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,650
this injury all season.

723
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:11,173
- Oh, missed the second
free throw.

724
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,132
Miller with the rebound.
- Are we winning?

725
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:16,048
- He's got seven assists...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

726
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,006
Please, please,
don't tell my dad.

727
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,966
- Ah, the Sabbath.
No electricity.

728
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,882
- It's just a really big game.

729
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,580
- Your secret is safe
with me.

730
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,582
Nets fans have suffered
enough.

731
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,716
- May I?

732
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:38,897
You must miss many games
because of the Sabbath.

733
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,900
- Well, I kind of make
an exception for the Nets.

734
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,337
We haven't won a championship
game in my whole life,

735
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,035
but we're doing
really well this year.

736
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,863
- Hm.
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,997
- So do you break
any other Sabbath rules?

738
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,086
- No way.
Never.

739
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,700
- Shirley...

740
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:04,052
this is question is a matter
of life and death.

741
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:08,056
I believe you have
kept the Sabbath, but...

742
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,059
have you kept kosher?

743
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,673
- Vijay, you paged?

744
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:20,199
- Hot dog!
- What are we talking about?

745
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:23,724
- Shirley secretly ate
a street vendor's hot dog.

746
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,074
- Shirley got a tapeworm?

747
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,815
- And passed
its eggs unknowingly

748
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,252
to her mother with a kiss.

749
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:33,168
- Neurocysticercosis.

750
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,387
Did D.A.W.N. confirm?

751
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,215
- I turned D.A.W.N. off.

752
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:39,261
Two tablets each,
and they will be cleared up.

753
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,654
- I...

754
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,830
I don't understand.

755
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:45,093
Did I hurt my mom?

756
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:49,619
- No, Shirley.
You saved her life.

757
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,105
- Hey, there, kiddo.
How you doing?

758
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,281
- Better.

759
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,981
- Better is good.
Very good.

760
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:07,289
So listen, I have...

761
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,640
I have one question that was
not on my list from earlier.

762
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,426
You feel up to answering it?

763
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:20,128
Why wouldn't the librarian
let you take out those books?

764
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,434
- I don't know.

765
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,045
- Well, I think you do know.

766
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,047
I think you know it so well

767
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,657
that it is
eating you up inside,

768
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:30,704
and it is causing you
to be sick.

769
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:36,405
Why wouldn't the librarian
let you take out those books?

770
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:43,847
- Because of the color
of my skin.

771
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,414
But she's not racist.

772
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,155
- Yeah, I don't doubt that
for a second.

773
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,419
But, you know,
racism is so deeply ingrained

774
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,118
in our society that people,
myself included,

775
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:56,904
we often don't realize
that we're perpetuating it.

776
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,211
- So, like...

777
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,082
when people give me
nicknames I don't want

778
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,301
'cause my name is different?

779
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,694
- Yes,
that is a microaggression

780
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:08,176
because of the color
of your skin.

781
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,136
- What about when adults tell
me I speak really good English?

782
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,095
- It's because of the color
of your skin.

783
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,705
- Or when people assume

784
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:18,882
I only got into my school
'cause I'm diverse?

785
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,233
- Yes.

786
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,017
- When the teacher tells me
to lower my voice,

787
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,020
even though I'm not
the only one talking?

788
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,196
Or she makes me answer
all the Latino questions

789
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,502
'cause I'm the only one
in the room?

790
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,113
- Yes.

791
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,901
- I just thought...

792
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,991
I didn't deserve to be there.

793
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,081
I wasn't good enough.
I was a mistake.

794
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,867
- No, Cephas, listen to me.

795
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,261
All of this,
everything you're talking about

796
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,001
has nothing to do with you,

797
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,787
and everything to do
with the world around you.

798
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,269
You walking around with all
of this shame and confusion

799
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,922
and stress inside your body,

800
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,925
I can see that you don't
want to feel this right now.

801
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,189
But I'm telling you, your body
is definitely feeling it,

802
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:07,279
and that is what
is making you sick.

803
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,109
- So...

804
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,504
How are you
gonna fix the world?

805
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,289
- I'm not.

806
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,335
I can't.

807
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:24,774
But I can help you process.

808
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:27,951
Because if we can name it,

809
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,562
we can treat it.

810
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,283
- You win.

811
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:58,417
What do you want, Mom?

812
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,207
- Dinner.

813
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,843
- May, how long
has Fatima been like this?

814
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,019
- All day.
- You should've paged me.

815
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:39,197
- She's listed
as Castro's patient.

816
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,634
- Fatima, sweetheart,
can I help you get back?

817
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,288
- I'm fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

818
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,247
- Okay.
Have you seen Dr. Castro?

819
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,380
- Dr. Castro said
my numbers are good.

820
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,208
I'm good.
Better than good.

821
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,558
She said her trial's helping.

822
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:07,573
- Yeah.

823
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,531
- Max, I got some bad news.

824
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,317
- I'm already there,
so just hit me.

825
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,276
- Mexico is not the answer
to your budget crisis.

826
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,930
You know, we shouldn't be
sending our patients

827
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,672
2,000 miles away.
It erodes our hospital.

828
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,588
And American hospitals
are eroded enough.

829
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:25,112
And, Max, the other thing
I gotta tell you,

830
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,548
it can't wait anymore,
all right?

831
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,246
- Floyd, you're the best.
I gotta go.

832
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,296
Hey, wait!

833
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:38,299
Excuse me.

834
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,910
Todd.
Wait, buddy, hold up.

835
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,434
Hey.

836
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,132
Listen,
I found a way to make payroll,

837
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:48,309
save $2 million,
and not cut a single program.

838
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,397
- How?

839
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,312
Add a program.

840
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,445
- Todd, there are two ways
to meet the budget, right?

841
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:54,533
We were trying to cut costs,

842
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:57,144
but what if we tried
to add revenue?

843
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:58,624
Okay, what we need
isn't less programs,

844
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,147
it's more patients.

845
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,323
- I think you've got all
the sick people you can handle.

846
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,716
- Exactly.

847
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,588
And so does
every other hospital.

848
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:09,243
New Amsterdam has every
specialist under the sun.

849
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,940
Right? But other hospitals
can't even afford

850
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,116
to keep one specialist
on staff full time.

851
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,598
America is full of people
who have specific medical needs

852
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,383
that their local hospitals
can't meet,

853
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,036
but we can.

854
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,604
So instead of outsourcing
our patients,

855
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:25,215
we're gonna outsource
our doctors.

856
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,174
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna call it
something better,

857
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,697
but I have commitments already

858
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,004
from Bridgeport Medical
in Alabama,

859
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,527
Mount Ida Memorial in Arkansas,

860
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,312
Townsend Hospital Center
in Delaware.

861
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:37,315
Look, we can fill America's
healthcare gaps,

862
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,143
we can get fairly compensated,
and most importantly,

863
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,276
we can...

864
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,539
we can balance the budget.

865
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,367
What?

866
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,327
Am I too late?
The budget's already in?

867
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,589
- I threw it away.

868
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:52,504
- You what?
- Your budget.

869
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,505
Threw it away.

870
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:56,072
- Threw it away?
Why?

871
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:01,730
- I knew
you'd come up with something.

872
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:07,127
- Huh.

873
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,460
Hi.

874
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:38,201
You look really nice.

875
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:41,204
- So do you.
- Thanks.

876
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,206
- Here you go.

877
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,252
- Right.
Yeah.

878
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,737
Um...

879
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,617
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do this.

880
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,707
Thank God.
Me, neither.

881
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,056
- Really?

882
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,537
- Yeah, I feel incredibly
guilty just being here.

883
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,799
And I know I shouldn't,
but I--

884
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:14,760
- Yeah, no, it just
sneaks up on you, right?

885
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:23,159
- My husband was a musician.

886
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,639
He took his own life.

887
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,688
- Sorry.

888
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:31,429
- I don't talk
about that much.

889
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,432
- Yeah, no--
- Ever.

890
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,477
But the moment
I start to feel happiness,

891
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,480
a wave of panic just...

892
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,396
- Yeah.

893
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,529
- Is that crazy
to be triggered by happiness?

894
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,400
- No.

895
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,361
- Sorry I ruined the evening.

896
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,842
- No, I mean...

897
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:57,150
you--you didn't.
You didn't ruin anything.

898
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:08,770
