1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,223
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,095
Luna, say hi to your mom.

3
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,537
- Still no pulse.
- 18-gauge cardiac needle.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,321
20cc syringe.
Now.

5
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,719
Told you I got you.

6
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,677
- You could make me
co-chair of your department,

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,331
or you can find
someone else to administer

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,203
precision target therapy...

9
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,726
Max's precision target therapy.

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,555
- Dr. Nottingham dropped me
from the cardiac rotation.

11
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,687
- Dr. Nottingham dropped you
at my suggestion.

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,775
- You made a mistake.

13
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,516
I'm the best intern up in here.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,171
So good, these hands will be
coming for your job one day.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,743
- Where--where--
where's Georgia?

16
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,711
- Excuse me.

17
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,660
Big day today.

18
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,314
Hey, I'm gonna need
every department

19
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,752
in the auditorium
around noon sharp.

20
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,146
- Some of us have--
what are those called, jobs?

21
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,626
- Yeah, but this
is all about your job.

22
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,236
- So this about
my thoracoabdominal repair

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,411
in OR Six?

24
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,630
- TouchÃ©,
but this won't take long.

25
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:49,848
I promise you.

26
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,633
Don't look so worried.

27
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:52,764
- Look, last time you asked me
to the auditorium,

28
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,244
you accused me of malpractice.

29
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,681
- That was a bad day.
This is a big day.

30
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,205
Huge difference.

31
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,121
Sandra Fall from billing.

32
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,383
- Max Goodwin from medicine.

33
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,385
- I see what you did there.
Big day today.

34
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,474
- You want every department in
the auditorium at noon sharp.

35
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,605
- Wow. Good news travels fast.

36
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:08,824
- That's one way
to look at it.

37
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,391
- I also have one teeny,
tiny favor.

38
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,566
How good are you
with PowerPoint?

39
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:12,828
- Don't you have
an assistant?

40
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,178
- Oh, Dora crossed
enemy lines into HCC.

41
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,267
Said she couldn't turn down
a job with, you know,

42
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,442
regular hours and a desk.

43
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,227
- Wow. Couldn't imagine.

44
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,229
- So about that favor.

45
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,928
- So, elephant in the room,
the last time Max

46
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,234
called everybody together,

47
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,627
he fired the entire
cardio department.

48
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,368
Who's it gonna be today?

49
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,762
- Now that Helen is back,
I think Max is announcing

50
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,851
that he's taking time off.

51
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,592
- Well, that's not
very exciting.

52
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:38,723
Carrot?

53
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,508
- No.
- Okay.

54
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:43,424
- Max hasn't taken time off

55
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,816
to mourn Georgia's death.

56
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,297
- Yeah, well,
he's compartmentalizing.

57
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,907
You know, one of the healthiest
ways to navigate loss

58
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,519
is to just
give yourself some time.

59
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,912
- He needs to grieve.

60
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,567
- Vijay, you can't
make Max grieve.

61
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,482
- You're not tired
of Max acting

62
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,310
like nothing has happened?

63
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,833
- Yeah, all right,
so hey, everybody,

64
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,706
go ahead and sit or stand
or whatever feels good.

65
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,969
Dr. Sharpe in the house.
Thank you for coming.

66
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,493
So...

67
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,495
We are all here
to discuss

68
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,369
the single most important
study of the last decade.

69
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,588
And I love your enthusiasm,

70
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,852
but pretty sure I am about
to answer your question.

71
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,420
With--yep--no,
with the next slide,

72
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,726
which would be...

73
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,293
uh, sorry, just--

74
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,555
There we go. Yes.

75
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,298
This study impacts housing,
education,

76
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,344
representation,
and especially health care.

77
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:37,347
I think you all know
what I'm talking about.

78
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,307
I'm talking about
the U.S. Census.

79
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,015
Really? Nothing?
Nothing for the Census--

80
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,625
- Whoo!
- One guy.

81
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,757
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Dr. Frome.

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Appreciate it.

83
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,368
So how about this?

84
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,718
What if I told you
that your zip code

85
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,590
plays a factor
in how long you live?

86
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,288
It's crazy, right?
No? Yeah?

87
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:08,335
It's--okay--this next visual
is gonna answer your question.

88
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,380
Hit it.
Boom.

89
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:11,903
In Washington, D.C.,

90
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,819
people living
in the Barry Farms neighborhood

91
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,605
have a life expectancy
of 63.2 years.

92
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,520
But just ten miles away,

93
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,609
ten miles, there we go,
right there,

94
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,264
people living
in Friendship Heights

95
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,397
might live as long
as 96 years, right?

96
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,486
Does that--no?
Does that not blow your mind?

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,315
Just ten miles represents

98
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:37,451
a life expectancy difference
of almost 33 years.

99
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,759
Yeah.

100
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,457
- What does this have to do
with New Amsterdam?

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,719
- That's a very good question,

102
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,634
and I was just about
to get to that.

103
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:52,422
These zip codes are just
a shorthand for communities,

104
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,859
and with over 5,000 employees,

105
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:58,863
New Amsterdam
is also a community.

106
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,344
Yes, well done.

107
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,345
But here's the problem.

108
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,782
I don't know the first thing

109
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:09,047
about so many of you,
and I should.

110
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,049
I want to.
I want to know everything,

111
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,356
because I'm willing to bet
that if I can improve

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,750
your quality of life,
then our patients

113
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,535
will get better care.

114
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,450
Because how can you
take care of others

115
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,496
if you're not
taking care of yourself?

116
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:27,979
- Are we all getting raises?

117
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,547
- Yeah, I wish, but no.

118
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,027
- Are we getting
paid vacation time?

119
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,769
- No.
We're broke.

120
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:35,987
But I do have
a little something for you.

121
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,598
If you look under your seat,

122
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,601
you will find--
drumroll, please...

123
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,646
That's you, Sandra.

124
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,647
Yeah, do it.
You got it.

125
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,736
Yes, that's a drumroll.

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,652
Yes, the New Amsterdam census.

127
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,960
Yeah, okay.
- Whoo!

128
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,657
- Thank you again, Dr. Frome.

129
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,659
One guy.

130
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,661
So go ahead
and fill this form out,

131
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,010
and then you
can go back to work,

132
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,622
and I will get to work
learning more about you

133
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,363
because I just want to know...

134
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,408
How can I help?

135
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,547
Oh, God.

136
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,070
Why does this hurt so much?

137
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,638
- Probably because
you're doing it wrong.

138
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,510
You're forgetting
to extend from the knee.

139
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,685
- You know what?
I know a great place

140
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,470
I could extend my knee into.

141
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:24,471
- I'd actually
love to see that,

142
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,689
because at this rate,

143
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,821
you'll be walking
without a cane

144
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,866
in approximately...

145
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,000
200 million years.

146
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,871
- Dr. Ligon...

147
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,743
you should know
that I have always

148
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,527
found you to be insufferable.

149
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,615
- Mm.

150
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,748
- Christmas parties,
staff meetings,

151
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,446
and now I can confidently say

152
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,883
that same quality transfers

153
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,843
seamlessly to your PT sessions.

154
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,975
- And I've seen
80-year-old stroke victims

155
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,195
improve their range of motion
faster than you.

156
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,936
- You know what?
You try recovering

157
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,722
from a fractured tibia
with zero pain meds.

158
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,594
- Yeah,
I wish I could offer you

159
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,683
something besides
modern medicine,

160
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:07,427
but I'm, you know,
just a doctor.

161
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,865
Actually...

162
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,214
hold on.

163
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,738
- What?

164
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,740
- I do have one thing

165
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,134
that might help you take
your mind off the pain.

166
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,222
- Seriously?

167
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:22,659
- Huh?

168
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,052
Meep-meep.

169
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,619
But I want it back.

170
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,622
So don't go
getting addicted to it.

171
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,454
- As the new co-chair
of oncology,

172
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,499
I'm happy to announce
that every oncology patient

173
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,240
at New Amsterdam
will be eligible

174
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,763
for precision targeted therapy.

175
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,852
- If the DNA sequence
of your tumor is a match

176
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,637
for the available treatment.

177
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,987
- And all I have to do
is sign this release?

178
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,902
- And we'll sequence the biopsy
we already have on record.

179
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,948
- Which will help us determine
where the defective DNA is.

180
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,907
- So you're saying
my stomach cancer

181
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,648
may not really be
stomach cancer?

182
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,085
- Well, stomach cancer just
tells us where the cancer is,

183
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,130
not necessarily
the kind of cancer.

184
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,872
- Like a license plate tells
you what state you live in

185
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,832
but the numbers are
specific to every car.

186
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,530
- You lost me,
like, ten minutes ago.

187
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,533
Targeted therapy
is exactly like it sounds.

188
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,839
- It works
by targeting the cancer's

189
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,231
genes, proteins, and enzymes,

190
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,625
leaving the healthy
cells alone.

191
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,716
- So all the side effects
from radiation and chemo...

192
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,719
- Gone.
- Diminished considerably.

193
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,242
- So what's the downside?

194
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:25,766
- Well--
- There isn't a downside

195
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,767
to being tested,

196
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,899
and if you fall in the 5%

197
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,074
who qualify for treatment--

198
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,859
- 5%?

199
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,164
- 5%?

200
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,557
- 5%?

201
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,734
- But it means significantly
less chemotherapy.

202
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,084
Imagine coming in for two pills
instead of two hours.

203
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,217
- I'd miss
my Dr. Sharpe time, though.

204
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,829
- It also means
no more radiation.

205
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,615
- It means full remission.

206
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,184
- Well, sign me up.

207
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,969
- You had me at less chemo.

208
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,064
- See?

209
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,282
We make a great team.

210
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,335
- Manny Talis,
44-year-old school bus driver

211
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,771
with right-sided chest pain.

212
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,121
Heart rate 94.
BP 135 over 80

213
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,254
with resps of 14.
Normal EKG.

214
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,821
But when we went
to put on the EKG leads,

215
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:21,952
we found this rash.

216
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,693
- Ooh, okay,
get him to curtains.

217
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,347
Okay, Mr. Talis,
good news.

218
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,044
I don't think
you're having a heart attack.

219
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:30,308
I think the pain is caused
by the rash on your chest.

220
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,310
It's called shingles,
and it is a reactivation

221
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,183
of the virus
that causes chicken pox.

222
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,924
- Is there anything
you can do for the pain?

223
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,665
- Mm, ibuprofen.

224
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,796
- That's it?

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,061
- Oh, well,
you could try this.

226
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,715
Maybe you'll find it
more useful than I did.

227
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,674
- I'll tell you what.
I'll trade you.

228
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:50,241
One of the kids
left this on the bus.

229
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,678
- Ooh.

230
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,984
You're on.
Okay.

231
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,899
Well, I am gonna get
cardiology to sign off,

232
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,728
and if they do, then you can
recuperate at home.

233
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,383
- All right, thank you, Doctor.

234
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,167
- You're calling
the appropriate department

235
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,605
instead of doing it
all yourself?

236
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:06,954
Who is this Dr. Protocol,

237
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,390
and what have you done
to Dr. Bloom?

238
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,000
- Look at me evolving.

239
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,002
Just page Reynolds
when he's out of surgery, okay?

240
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,221
- All right.

241
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,266
- I use a clamshell incision.

242
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,965
This incision reveals
the pulmonary anatomy

243
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,229
in a spectacular fashion.
You see that?

244
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:25,233
Now, Duke, why don't you come
on over and take a better look?

245
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,671
Come on.

246
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,722
See that tissue right there?
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,288
- Go ahead and throw in
a couple of stitches.

248
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:38,681
Let's see what you got.

249
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,165
No harm in admitting
you're not ready.

250
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,296
- No, I'm ready.

251
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,168
- All right, well...

252
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,649
I hope you sew more confidently
than you sound.

253
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,006
- Dr. Reynolds.

254
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,050
- Duke, you got
about four seconds

255
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,704
till my patient goes south.

256
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,894
Mm.

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,419
- Lower chance of dehiscence.

258
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,208
- Damn, Duke.

259
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:29,863
It's like a sewing machine.

260
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:36,347
I want everyone to observe
Duke's forward sutures.

261
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,348
See that?

262
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,050
That's excellent.

263
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,185
- They might not get it now,
but as soon as people see

264
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,274
that this can improve
their quality of life

265
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:51,798
here at New Amsterdam,
then I think

266
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,886
they're really gonna
warm to it.

267
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:53,974
- Well, this person
just drew a hand

268
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,192
flipping you the bird.

269
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,064
- There he is.
I gotta say, boss, nice work.

270
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,240
A New Amsterdam census,
that is just brilliant.

271
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,155
- Thank you.
Finally someone who gets it.

272
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,852
- Except there is one community
in this hospital

273
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:03,984
that can't fill out
your census.

274
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,507
- Why's that?

275
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,030
- Well, because they're not
allowed to use pens or pencils

276
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,336
in an unsupervised setting.

277
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,207
- You mean inmates?
- Yes, exactly. Celery?

278
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,513
- But they're patients.

279
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,427
So what does that have to do
with the census?

280
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,733
- Well, if these patients

281
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,951
could fill out your census
with something

282
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,257
that wasn't considered
to be a weapon,

283
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,345
I bet they would say
they're lacking

284
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,868
in educational opportunities.

285
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,174
- Really?
Is that what they would say?

286
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,958
- Yes, they would,
because studies show that

287
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,786
education vastly
reduces recidivism

288
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,048
among inmate populations.

289
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,223
We have classrooms.
We have inmates.

290
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,355
Why are we not helping?

291
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:28,965
- Very good idea.
Put it together.

292
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,184
- Good, 'cause I already have.

293
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,231
- We're not done with the
preadolescent process group.

294
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,016
Where do I put the kids?

295
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,366
- You can't have kids
in here with these guys.

296
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,541
Are you nuts?
- Why are the kids

297
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,934
running late?
- Iggy, what's the plan?

298
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,892
- Kids, hi, kids.
Hi, guys, come on out.

299
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,111
Everybody
down to the end of the hall.

300
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,374
- I'm calling the warden.
- No, no, no need.

301
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,592
- Yes.
- No.

302
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:48,811
- Let's go.
- Just a stutter step, boss.

303
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,465
Guys, my kids,
everyone scoot down.

304
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,250
Nobody talk to the new adults.
Nobody look at the new adults.

305
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,904
Just maybe help me
beat this door down, okay?

306
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,253
Come here. Gladys!
- I'm here.

307
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,820
- Hi. Do we have
the key for this door?

308
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,561
- Uh, let me check.

309
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:02,129
- Your census will literally
be the death of us.

310
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,481
- Hello!
A little help, please.

311
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,141
- Do you really still
need me here for this?

312
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,490
- Come on.
This is exciting, right?

313
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:16,839
- I never thought I'd say this,

314
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,101
but please let me
go back to billing.

315
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,539
- All right,
just hit me with another one.

316
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,890
32% of employees

317
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,848
said they pull double shifts
more than twice a week.

318
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,067
- Max.
- See? We can't have that.

319
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,373
Let's put that
under overworked.

320
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,811
No, you know what?
Mismanagement.

321
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,336
Vijay, take a look at this.

322
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,861
300 employees
say that they get less than

323
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:41,255
two meals per week
with their families.

324
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,952
That's unacceptable.

325
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:45,259
- Max.

326
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,829
I think you should
talk to someone.

327
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,093
- That's a great idea.

328
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,575
Research shows that eating
family meals together,

329
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,795
like Luna and I
are doing right now,

330
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,318
can result
in lower obesity rates

331
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,929
and kids staying off
drugs and alcohol,

332
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,974
not to mention lower
instances of depression.

333
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:08,978
So you're all here because,
based on the census,

334
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,807
you're eating virtually
no meals with your families.

335
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,156
Tell me why.

336
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:17,900
Anyone?

337
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,902
Just shout it out.
Anybody?

338
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,340
- Come on, who has time to cook
after a 12-hour day?

339
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,473
- Long hours. Got it.
Keep them coming.

340
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,388
- Hey, my family lives
all the way in Albuquerque.

341
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,955
- Family too far.
Copy that.

342
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,305
- By the time I get home,
my kids have finished eating.

343
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,959
- Does fast food count?

344
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,351
- Really, Miguel?

345
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,875
- When you put patients first,

346
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,529
you put yourself second...
or third.

347
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,489
- So you gonna send us
home early?

348
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,492
- Yeah, I can't do that.

349
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,972
- Are you sending us
home with food?

350
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,453
- Currently,
I have zero budget for this.

351
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,151
- So what are you gonna do?

352
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:54,458
- No idea whatsoever, but--
I know. I know.

353
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,069
I'm working on it.

354
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,332
So is Luna,
so yeah.

355
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,463
We're gonna figure it out.

356
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,381
- BMI is 24.
Dead in the middle.

357
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,470
- All right, suction.

358
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:07,950
Clamp.
- Dr. Reynolds,

359
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,865
Dr. Bloom is still waiting
on that shingles eval.

360
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,173
Think you can handle that,
Duke?

361
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,957
- Yeah.
For sure.

362
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,959
- What are the four things
to do when diagnosing

363
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,005
for thoracic
varicella infection?

364
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,355
- One, measure the rash
and outline it with a Sharpie.

365
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,443
- Uh-huh.

366
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,444
- Two, check for
respiratory function,

367
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,662
making sure
the lungs are clear.

368
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,055
- Suture.

369
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,057
- Three, examine the mouth
for signs of oral lesions.

370
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,537
And four,
check the ear for vesicle

371
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,018
on the tympanic membrane.

372
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,236
- Well, go do it.

373
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,543
Clamp.

374
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,982
Duke.
- Hmm?

375
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,418
- Take off our gown.

376
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,690
- What happened
to your fidget spinner?

377
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,911
- It stopped spinning after
I threw it against a wall.

378
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,608
- So now you have
a rubber band?

379
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:00,220
- Every time I feel
the crushing pain in my leg,

380
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,048
I snap the rubber band
to refocus

381
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,527
on the lesser pain in my wrist.

382
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,051
- Is it working?

383
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,401
- Can't you tell
by my chipper attitude?

384
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,012
- I've been meaning to ask.
If you're off everything,

385
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,232
how are you managing your ADHD?

386
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,495
- There, my friend, is the
silver lining in all of this.

387
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,671
It turns out that pain
is a great focuser.

388
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,673
Now I actually
want a distraction.

389
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,588
- Dr. Bloom?

390
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,243
Dr. Reynolds sent me
to check on a shingles patient.

391
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,114
- Mr. Talis.
Right there.

392
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,376
- Thank you.

393
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,204
- He must really like you.

394
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,640
Send you down here solo.

395
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:32,252
- I can't tell if he likes me
or is punishing me.

396
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:35,298
- Yeah.
Get used to it.

397
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:45,047
- I think we got it
all surrounded.

398
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,093
- Yeah, looks like it.

399
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,398
- A few deep breaths.

400
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,052
- Oh, yeah.

401
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,144
Sounds good.

402
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,538
Now open wide.

403
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,150
Mm-hmm.

404
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,459
You can't keep me here!
I know my rights!

405
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,287
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
- I'm calling my lawyer.

406
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,897
- Could you at least
keep the robe on, please?

407
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,073
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Just come over to your bed,

408
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,466
and you can go ahead
and make that phone call, okay?

409
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,469
- Hey, Doc, we done here?

410
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:20,039
- Yeah, I think we're good.
I'll get you discharged.

411
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,258
- You people don't know
anything about health care.

412
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,390
- Heard it all before.

413
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,744
- Dr. Frome.
- Warden Salazar, hello. Hi.

414
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,487
I assure you that I purchased
all of these lawfully.

415
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,663
- All of these what, exactly?
- The classics.

416
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,665
The stuff that I'm gonna
be teaching in class today.

417
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,016
- I approved this experiment
but not your syllabus.

418
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,539
- I wasn't aware that
I had to submit a syllabus.

419
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,193
- "Autobiography of Malcolm X"?

420
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,803
- Yeah, it's a searing portrait
of race in America.

421
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,240
- "Catch-22"?

422
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,719
- Absurdist
anti-war commentary.

423
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,025
- "The Catcher in the Rye."

424
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,026
- This is censorship.

425
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,723
You are taking away
their rights.

426
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,725
- That's what happens
when you go to jail.

427
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,642
- Oh, okay.

428
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,340
Then what am I
supposed to teach?

429
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,515
- Teach them whatever you want.

430
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,125
Just don't give them any ideas.

431
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,127
- Sounds reasonable.

432
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,260
- Good luck.
Have fun.

433
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,524
- Hey, you paged?

434
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,135
- Yeah, I've got some new
budget recs for you to sign.

435
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,397
- Good. I've been
waiting for these,

436
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,529
seeing as how
you decided to split

437
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:18,140
your department
with Dr. Castro.

438
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,272
- She's great, isn't she?
- She is,

439
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,447
which still doesn't explain

440
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,102
why you gave her
half your department.

441
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,844
- Uh-oh, my chemo brain's
got me hallucinating

442
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,759
'cause I think I see...

443
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:31,153
- Max.
You look amazing.

444
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,808
- Did you get taller?
- Whoa, he totally got taller.

445
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:36,724
- I don't know about that,
but you guys look great too.

446
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:40,554
- How are you worse at lying
than you are at euchre?

447
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,295
- But I'm gonna look great
after I get my new

448
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,210
precision target treatment.

449
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,733
- Yes, we're all getting tested

450
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,169
to see if we're eligible.

451
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,388
- Yeah, we want the good stuff.

452
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,390
- I just want you
to remember the odds.

453
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,261
Max is one of the lucky ones.

454
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,786
With the treatment.

455
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,267
- It's good seeing you guys.

456
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,182
- Yeah, you too.

457
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:09,235
- Max, Max, I think what you
are doing is really admirable.

458
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,584
- Is there a but coming?
- No, no, no, no.

459
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,194
You are asking
an essential question.

460
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,630
How can we take care
of our patients

461
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,415
if we are not taking care
of ourselves?

462
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,720
- Yeah, exactly.
- But--

463
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,895
- Ah, okay,
I see what you did there.

464
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,288
You buried the but.

465
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,855
- But there is one employee
you are ignoring

466
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,858
who needs help even though
they are not asking for help.

467
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,207
- Okay, thank you.

468
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,861
- Who?

469
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,210
- You.

470
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,305
- Max.

471
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,181
- Here you go.

472
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,400
Latte for you
and one for you.

473
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,881
I'll take that.
This one goes to you.

474
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,622
- You're gonna pay
for this, right?

475
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:49,840
- Yes, I am.

476
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,712
See, the reason
that you're all here is,

477
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,496
on the census,
you answered that you each get

478
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,412
less than five hours
of sleep per night.

479
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,501
- We need more sleep.
Can we go back to work?

480
00:19:58,545 --> 00:19:59,850
- Yeah, well, the thing is,
sleep deprivation

481
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,287
is no joke, okay?

482
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,506
It can lead
to high blood pressure,

483
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,205
diabetes, weight gain,
weakened immune system,

484
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,686
not to mention memory loss
and increased errors at work.

485
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,385
- So you're caffeinating us?

486
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,951
- Actually, stimulants
like that mochaccino

487
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,345
can't begin to replace what you
lose from a lack of sleep.

488
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,479
The mochaccinos were really
just a bribe to get you here

489
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,742
so I could ask you why you
aren't getting enough sleep.

490
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,701
So...why aren't you?

491
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,660
- Well, I have
to get up super early

492
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,357
to make it to my shift
on time.

493
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,793
- Yeah, I want to sleep more,

494
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,752
but I got real-life
responsibilities, you know?

495
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,536
- I always think I can nap
during my commute

496
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,321
but too many transfers.
- Too many transfers.

497
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,670
- Right.
- Mm.

498
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,457
- So, like, do you have
any support to fix this?

499
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,504
- No, no support.
Just me.

500
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,637
But don't worry,
because I am all over this.

501
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:52,294
And if you any additional
questions or comments,

502
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,340
please take them up
with Dr. Kapoor.

503
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:59,040
- Blood pressure looks good.

504
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,608
- Lap pad.

505
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,395
How'd it go?

506
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,744
- Rash outlined.

507
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,356
Lungs and oropharynx clear.

508
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,401
- What about
the tympanic membrane?

509
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,493
Eardrum.

510
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,669
- Yes, clear.
I think.

511
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,541
- You think?
- It was.

512
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,760
- Good.
Well, come on over.

513
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,719
Show us some more
of that all-star suturing.

514
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,331
Dr. Duke?

515
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,337
We're waiting.

516
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:43,302
- Okay,
so of the approved books...

517
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,306
For this class, I have...

518
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:49,743
I have "Aladdin."

519
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:50,874
- Whoo!
- Okay, yeah.

520
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,616
- Yeah, yeah, good movie.

521
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,575
Fun movie.
Kids' movie, really.

522
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,054
Um...

523
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,839
any dads in the house?
Where my dads at?

524
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:02,712
- Yo, what's "Aladdin"
gonna teach us about anything?

525
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,540
- Well, you see, I...

526
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,634
Aladdin didn't--he didn't
start out as a prince, right?

527
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:13,897
That's not where
it began for him,

528
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,682
but he did have some skills.

529
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,466
He was a hustler.

530
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,989
- Yeah.
Yes, thank you, Bijan. Yeah.

531
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,991
- And the book
isn't called "Aladdin."

532
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,516
It's "1,001 Arabian Nights."

533
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,346
- Yeah, no, correct again.
Thank you.

534
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,825
Good for you.

535
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,653
You're right, though.
Aladdin was a hustler

536
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:31,915
and a thief.

537
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,830
But he figured out
how to use those things

538
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,658
and turned them
into a benefit for his life.

539
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:37,747
- Aladdin goes legit.
- Yes!

540
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,097
Yeah, laugh it up.
He's right.

541
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,491
Wonderfully stated.
Yes, he goes legit.

542
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:46,582
Aladdin turns his perceived
weaknesses into an advantage.

543
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,975
Right?
Do you understand that?

544
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,368
So whatever you did,
whatever it was

545
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,847
to get into Rikers can be used

546
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,110
as a legitimate skill set
when you get out.

547
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,156
- My boy Luis can use
his hot-wire expertise

548
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,679
to help humanity.

549
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,028
Come on, man.

550
00:22:58,072 --> 00:23:00,466
- Well, no, hang on, now.
Luis, tell me something.

551
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,424
Is it easy to hot-wire a car?

552
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,600
Like, could anybody do it?
- No, bro.

553
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:05,775
I mean,
if you're not careful,

554
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,516
you could shock
the hell out yourself.

555
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,431
But not me, though, 'cause,
you know, I got the touch.

556
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,780
- I bet you do.

557
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,957
So maybe I'm looking
at a future electrician here.

558
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,700
- Yo, you mean like
I'd be working for the city.

559
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,441
- Sure.
- Like, I could be getting paid

560
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,442
that union money.

561
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,878
- Why not?
- Yeah!

562
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,140
- There you go.
Why not?

563
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,621
Why not? Why not?
Yes, okay.

564
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,841
Who else?
Who else do I got?

565
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,060
Yeah, go.

566
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:32,846
- I got caught moving product.

567
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,762
- So I imagine
in your line of work,

568
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:38,721
a lot of people sell...

569
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,070
product, right?

570
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,464
So what did you do
to distinguish yourself?

571
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:45,075
- Hmm, I never came up short.

572
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,077
My suppliers always trusted me
with the good stuff.

573
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,601
- Great.
That's great.

574
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:49,645
So it sounds like
you could move

575
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:50,907
any expensive product, right?

576
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,822
You could be
a high-end car salesman.

577
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,737
- Yo, I'm done with this fool.

578
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,609
- Yo, yo!

579
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,610
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

580
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,528
All right, okay.
- Out, out!

581
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,746
Let's go!

582
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,053
Up! Everybody up!

583
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,229
Up!

584
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:11,624
Class is over!

585
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,106
- I don't think
that's sanitary.

586
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,543
- Yeah, well,
it's chew this gum

587
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:18,718
or punch someone in the face.

588
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,110
- Are those really
your only two options?

589
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:21,460
- Dr. Bloom.

590
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,591
- Reynolds give you
another assignment?

591
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:23,810
- Actually, I was here
to see Mr. Talis.

592
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,942
- Discharged. Why?

593
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,683
- Just wanted to see...

594
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,119
just wanted to say bye.

595
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,165
He's a nice man.
- Yes, he is.

596
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:38,825
- Okay.
- Thank you.

597
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,882
- I shouldn't have said that.

598
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,971
- Said what?

599
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,625
- That you were lucky.

600
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,195
After everything
that you've been through.

601
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,110
- Yeah, but I am lucky.

602
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,808
I'm in the 5%.

603
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,680
- That's not what I meant.

604
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,684
And you know that.

605
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,776
You can talk to me.

606
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,820
You've always talked to me.

607
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,169
- Stop.

608
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,999
- It's hard to know
what to say.

609
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:26,176
- I don't want you
to say anything.

610
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,178
It actually makes it worse

611
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:32,182
when people say something,
so just, please...

612
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,228
Don't.

613
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,057
Getting off here?

614
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,580
- No.
- No?

615
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,242
- What the hell happened?

616
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,591
- Started seizing
in the subway.

617
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,288
Finger stick glucose 120.

618
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,247
- Okay, get him to Trauma One
and push two milligrams Ativan.

619
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,727
- Got it.

620
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,598
- Ativan on board.

621
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,818
- BP 108 over 60.

622
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,864
- He stopped seizing.
Stabilized.

623
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:02,909
- Sat 94%.

624
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:10,003
- Airway clear.
No tongue bite.

625
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,962
- He has a vesicle
on his tympanic membrane.

626
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,964
The shingles advanced
to Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

627
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,837
He has a herpetic infection
throughout his whole body.

628
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,055
- How did we miss that?

629
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,057
- Get Reynolds down here now.

630
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:28,412
- So when I finished
going through the census data,

631
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,937
I discovered that 81 people
chose not to fill it out,

632
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,939
17 people defaced the census

633
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,028
with decidedly
colorful language,

634
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,595
and one person simply wrote,

635
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,772
"I am not your blanking
assistant."

636
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:43,036
So by using
the process of elimination,

637
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,515
here we are.

638
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,647
- So, what,
we didn't take a census

639
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:46,735
and now we're in trouble?

640
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:47,867
- No, no, nobody's in trouble.

641
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,695
I just want to know
why 60 questions

642
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,218
made y'all so angry.

643
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,612
- Because I have too much work
to answer 60 questions,

644
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,048
and I have too much work
to be here right now

645
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,093
explaining why
I don't have time to be here.

646
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:59,792
- Okay, makes sense.
Anybody else?

647
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,837
- If I don't have time
to go to my kids' PTA meetings,

648
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,926
I don't have time
to take an unofficial survey

649
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,711
so my boss can get to know me.

650
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,103
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

651
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:08,888
- Technically,
I don't even work for you.

652
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,803
I work for the city.

653
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,631
- You always call me
Sandra Fall from billing,

654
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,806
so you know what my job is,

655
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,459
yet you spent all day
making me do

656
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,852
someone else's job too.

657
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,114
I don't have time
for that, Max.

658
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,029
None of us have time.

659
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:22,858
- So it's time.

660
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,425
- For what?

661
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,645
- No, no, no, the common thread
between everyone.

662
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:31,084
All the inefficiencies
and the, you know, complaints

663
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,607
and the dissatisfaction,

664
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,695
it's all...

665
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,697
it's all because of time.

666
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,917
- So how are you
gonna fix time?

667
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:44,445
- Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
- Okay, hey, hey, hang on.

668
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,055
- Disseminated
herpetic infection.

669
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,709
It could not be clearer,

670
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,537
yet somehow it was missed
by your department.

671
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,669
- Okay, let's walk back
the accusations.

672
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,148
- You are lucky Mr. Talis

673
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,150
didn't seize while driving
a school bus full of kids.

674
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:55,543
- I gave Dr. Duke
the checklist, right?

675
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,979
And he said he checked it.
- Well, he couldn't have.

676
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,720
Otherwise,
we wouldn't be here right now.

677
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,504
Mr. Talis wouldn't be here.

678
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,723
- Duke?

679
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,159
- Yes, I went through
the checklist.

680
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,509
- Did you look in his ear?
- He said he looked.

681
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,859
- He has a vesicle
on his eardrum.

682
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,425
If he'd actually
bothered to look,

683
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,688
he would've seen it too.

684
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:10,863
- It must not have been there
at the time.

685
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,081
- There is no way
it grew in two hours.

686
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,126
- Okay, if Dr. Duke
said he looked,

687
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,736
then he looked.
- Or he's lying.

688
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,955
- Back off!

689
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:17,565
All right, this is my intern
you're accusing.

690
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,001
If there's any blame
to be dished out,

691
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,611
I'll do the dishing.

692
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,744
- Clean up your house, Floyd.

693
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,580
- I have the results.
- And?

694
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:34,930
- 17 of our patients qualify.

695
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:36,192
- Oh, my God.

696
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,759
That's amazing.

697
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,543
- I'll notify
the insurance companies,

698
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:42,024
some of whom probably haven't
even had a claim like this.

699
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,592
- Wait, there's no one
from the euchre group.

700
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,161
Willow Yun, Millie Tamberlay,
Mike Kiggens.

701
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,990
- No, none of them
were eligible.

702
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,647
Why are they called
the euchre group?

703
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:01,087
- They used to play...

704
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,003
when there were four of them.

705
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,875
And then Max got better,
and they...

706
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,051
they stopped.

707
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,226
- You're close to them.

708
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,187
Then they should hear it
from you

709
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,884
that they didn't qualify.

710
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,800
- Of course.

711
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,671
- I'll notify the ones who did.

712
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,761
See? What'd I tell you?

713
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,154
- That we make a great team.

714
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:28,984
Yeah.

715
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,999
- Now, why in the world did I
think it was called "Aladdin"?

716
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,699
- Nobody reads the book
if there's a movie.

717
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:53,095
- That is the sad truth,
isn't it?

718
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,666
Listen, I don't feel like we
had a chance to finish earlier.

719
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,581
- You're wasting your time.

720
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,844
- I don't think I am.

721
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,848
- Know why I'm here?

722
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,241
In the hospital?

723
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,851
- I don't.

724
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,244
- I swallowed a fork

725
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,072
for just a couple days
out of Rikers.

726
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,162
A fork.

727
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,991
'Cause recovering from surgery
is my idea of a vacation.

728
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:25,040
- Bijan, we all have
something to offer.

729
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:28,696
- Nah. That's what you say
to give yourself hope.

730
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,132
- Okay.

731
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,569
Well, then prove me wrong.

732
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,658
- How I'ma do that?

733
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,660
- When you get out, you're
gonna have an opportunity--

734
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,532
- You even read my file?

735
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,534
- When you get out--
- Yo, I'm never getting out.

736
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,275
I'm in for life.

737
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:46,540
Not one but two life sentences
for a crime I did commit.

738
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,197
Now tell me again
I have something to offer.

739
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,553
- I just wanted
to tell you how hard

740
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:00,902
I been practicing
my stitching.

741
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,556
It's gonna be
even better than before.

742
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,211
- Lie again,
you're gone for good.

743
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,346
- I forgot to check the ear.

744
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,957
- And you had the nerve
to lie to me about it.

745
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,219
- At first,
I couldn't remember,

746
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:14,307
but when I realized my mistake,

747
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,656
I tried to go back and fix it,

748
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:16,657
but the patient
was already gone.

749
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,354
- Why didn't you come to me?

750
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:19,878
- I panicked.

751
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,357
And then I thought
since all the other

752
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,056
diagnoses were negative
that the ear would be too.

753
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,927
- How'd that work out for you?

754
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,147
- I just wanted to impress you.

755
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,844
- Well, you didn't.

756
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:32,760
- Maybe I shouldn't
even be here.

757
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,980
- Hey, don't play
the sympathy card.

758
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,025
Because you deserve to be here.

759
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,984
Those skills you exhibited
in that OR are rare.

760
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,116
You have a gift.

761
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,945
But you're an intern,
and you're gonna make mistakes.

762
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,947
Next time, own them.

763
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,038
- Wait, you're not...

764
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,300
you're not gonna report me?

765
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,695
- I gave you
too much responsibility,

766
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,740
and you weren't ready.

767
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,220
That's on me.

768
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,310
- And Dr. Bloom?

769
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,927
- A mistake like this could
derail your whole career.

770
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,758
This stays between us.

771
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,374
- Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

772
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,740
- âª Took the breath

773
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:40,828
- Max.

774
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:43,396
- âª From my open mouth

775
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,963
- Dr. Sharpe said I could
find you here

776
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:48,096
if I can't find you
anywhere else.

777
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,838
- âª In circles
somewhere else âª

778
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:54,146
- How can I help?

779
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:55,321
- You know the one thing
on the census

780
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,323
that everyone has in common?

781
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,890
- âª When your love was home,
storing up âª

782
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,327
- Not enough time.

783
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,328
- âª On your summer glow

784
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:04,895
âª You went

785
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:09,161
âª In search of someone else

786
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,380
- You know, when I...

787
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,688
when I lost my wife...

788
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,342
I was destroyed,

789
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:18,344
like...

790
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:21,869
parts of me shattered.

791
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:26,482
So I...I started cooking.

792
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:29,181
Her recipes.

793
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:33,098
All the meals
she ever cooked for me.

794
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,056
The taste
brought back memories.

795
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,798
- âª My dear

796
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,366
- Memories brought back...

797
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,889
her.

798
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,064
40 years of marriage,

799
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:46,894
and I'm still cooking
her meals.

800
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:52,900
You know, every culture offers
you guidance on how to grieve.

801
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,207
Some people build shrines.

802
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,165
Some tear their clothes.

803
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:00,168
Some even dance in the streets.

804
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:03,215
Everybody does something,
and...

805
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,173
and you have not done anything,
and I'm...

806
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,348
I'm worried.

807
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:12,093
- âª Anchor up to me, love

808
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,095
- You don't think
I want to grieve?

809
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,882
You don't think
I want to scream

810
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,233
every time I walk
into this hospital?

811
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:26,238
- âª Oh, anchor up to me

812
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,327
- Then I see...

813
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,069
Luna, and I to change
her diaper.

814
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,766
I have to make her bottle.

815
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,941
- âª My love

816
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:35,247
- So...

817
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,467
if I let myself...

818
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,034
grieve...

819
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,428
you know, truly give in,
then...

820
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,128
I won't ever come out.

821
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,308
And I'm all she has left.

822
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:07,801
- Don't overextend.

823
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,368
Find your balance.

824
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,283
- It hurts.

825
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:14,895
- Watching you push through
this difficult process is--

826
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:19,160
how else to put it--
an inspiration.

827
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:21,989
- Do you know what?
I have tried everything

828
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:24,600
to get my mind off the pain--

829
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,646
your stupid squishy ball,

830
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:29,692
fidget spinners,
rubber bands,

831
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,955
gum--and nothing works.

832
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,957
- Not even the gum?

833
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,742
Well, that's a huge
step back for medicine.

834
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,047
- Hey, you know what?

835
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:39,963
Instead of standing there
grinning like an idiot

836
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,052
and casually insulting my limp,

837
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:44,838
why don't you do something
that actually helps?

838
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,248
- Range of motion
is suddenly improving.

839
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:06,294
- Shut up.
- Mm.

840
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,213
Nurse Chatwell, pick up 1317.

841
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:15,042
Nurse Chatwell,
please pick up 1317.

842
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,222
- Hey, I'm sorry.

843
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,703
I overreacted earlier.

844
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:28,011
It's just my leg makes
my short fuse even shorter,

845
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,753
which is really, really short.

846
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,930
And I took it out
on your intern.

847
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,237
It won't happen again.

848
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,112
- Appreciate it.

849
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,988
You seem better.

850
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:50,382
- Yeah?

851
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,340
I think I found something
that helps.

852
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,044
- I hate disappointing you
like this.

853
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,396
- You said it was a long shot.

854
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,354
- I know.

855
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,182
But I gave you hope.

856
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,707
- Eh, negative thinkers
are always right...

857
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,927
or pleasantly surprised.

858
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,972
- I knew it wasn't gonna be me.

859
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,758
It was fun to imagine.

860
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,238
But chemo is working.

861
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,065
I can't complain.

862
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,983
- Dr. Sharpe,
I think you're the only one

863
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,942
that got their hopes up.

864
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,904
- Do you still
have a deck of cards?

865
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,254
- Always.

866
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,430
But you need four
to play euchre.

867
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,303
- Well, deal me in.

868
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,527
- Have you ever played?

869
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,529
- Oh, I'm kind of sharp.

870
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,541
- Hi, hey, excuse me.

871
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,977
Hi, sorry.
Hi, sorry.

872
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,326
Can I have one minute with him?

873
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,110
- One minute.
- That's all I need.

874
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,809
Bijan, may I?

875
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,201
- Can't you just
leave me alone?

876
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:13,334
Incredibly
stubborn, loves teasing.

877
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,858
Anyway, I've been thinking
a lot about what happened,

878
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:18,470
and no matter what you did,

879
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,516
no matter how bad it was...

880
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,865
you're so smart.

881
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,824
- You don't know what I did.

882
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:28,436
- You are not your crime.

883
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
That doesn't make up
who you are.

884
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,138
You are smart.

885
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,444
You read
"1,001 Arabian Nights."

886
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,577
Those inmates in there,
they listen to you.

887
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,926
They respect you.

888
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,319
- So what?

889
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,451
What good is that
where I'm going?

890
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,105
- Well, I contacted
a program manager at Rikers,

891
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,280
and I gave him your name.

892
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,542
- Nah, I'm done
with those programs.

893
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,109
I don't want to take
more classes.

894
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,284
- No, no, no, you're not...

895
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,460
you're not
gonna take the classes.

896
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,201
You're gonna
learn to teach them.

897
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,552
Yeah, so many guys in there,
they don't know how to read.

898
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:58,988
They're done
with programs too.

899
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:01,208
They hate that stuff, but...

900
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,993
if it was coming from you...

901
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:05,473
- You want me to teach?

902
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,257
- Yeah.

903
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:11,392
So that your life,
what you have to offer,

904
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,176
which is a lot,

905
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,485
can reverberate well outside
the walls of any prison.

906
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,230
What's going on?
What are you thinking?

907
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:30,063
- No one ever told me
I was smart.

908
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,199
- All right, come on.

909
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,200
Let's go.

910
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,871
- Excuse me.

911
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,351
I'm looking for my bus driver.

912
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,658
- Bus driver's in 4223.

913
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,920
- Thanks.

914
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,535
- That's it.

915
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,494
- I did it.
I solved time.

916
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,191
- And how did you do that?

917
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,975
- With a bus.
- A bus?

918
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,542
- Yeah.
Well, buses, to be exact.

919
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,892
But for the same cost
of public transportation,

920
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,416
our employees
can pool their money,

921
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,330
charter a bus to New Amsterdam

922
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,637
from stations
in their own neighborhoods.

923
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:25,205
So many of our employees have
a two-hour commute each way,

924
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:27,076
and it's because
they're waiting for transfers,

925
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,251
dealing with delays.

926
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,297
Now it becomes
a one-hour commute

927
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,560
because it's direct.

928
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:35,258
With two extra hours
in their day,

929
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,086
our employees
can get more sleep,

930
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,958
either at home
or on a bus

931
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,525
that doesn't have a bunch
of stops and transfers

932
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,440
keeping them awake.

933
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,485
With two extra hours,
our employees can make it home

934
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:47,270
in time to eat dinner
with their families.

935
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:48,924
They'll have time
to go grocery shopping,

936
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:51,971
time to cook,
time to relax with the people

937
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,669
that they're working
so hard for.

938
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,541
With two extra hours,
they'll have time

939
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,977
for self-care,

940
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,719
time to exercise, read.

941
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,547
So when they get here,
they'll be focused, alert,

942
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,507
and ready to help
those who need it the most:

943
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,726
our patients.

944
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:11,251
- You solved time...
with a bus.

945
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:12,731
- I guess I did.

946
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:21,609
- âª You and me
belong together âª

947
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:25,483
- He walks like Max.
He talks like Max.

948
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:28,137
But...
- I know.

949
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,139
- He isn't grieving, Vijay.

950
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:33,316
- I thought the same.

951
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,362
But we are wrong.

952
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:38,017
Max is grieving...

953
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,149
in his own way,

954
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,282
whether he knows it or not.

955
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,983
- âª You and me

956
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,682
âª Belong together

957
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,297
âª You and me

958
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,692
âª Belong together

959
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,002
Hey.

960
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,482
- Hey, sweetie,
how was your day?

961
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,745
Hi.

962
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,704
Oh!

963
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:14,357
Hi.
