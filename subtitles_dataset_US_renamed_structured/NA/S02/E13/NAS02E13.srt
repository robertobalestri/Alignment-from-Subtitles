1
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,744
- She's rejecting
her heart transplant.

2
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,615
- So University
stuffed her in a limo--

3
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,226
- Drove across town--
- And dropped her

4
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,618
at our doorstep.
- Just makes you feel

5
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,186
all warm and fuzzy inside,
doesn't it?

6
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,535
- Ms. Harris?

7
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,797
I'm Max Goodwin,
the Medical Director.

8
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,364
Did your doctors tell you why

9
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,584
they were transferring you
to New Amsterdam?

10
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:05,543
- They said
you'd be better equipped

11
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,589
to handle my needs.

12
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,201
Is something wrong?

13
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,637
- Uh, they lied to you.

14
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:15,075
- Your body is rejecting
your new heart.

15
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,207
- And once they realized there
was nothing more they could do,

16
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,514
they transferred you here.

17
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,734
- Why would they...
do that?

18
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:25,085
- To keep their
mortality rates low.

19
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,611
- So...

20
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,484
they sent me...
here to die?

21
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,752
- Karen Brantley,
can I borrow you for a second?

22
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,667
- Ah, Max, so glad
you could join us.

23
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,235
- Mm-hmm.
- We said 8:30 sharp.

24
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,454
I would've reminded
your assistant,

25
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,455
but you still
don't have one.

26
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,413
- It's on my to-do list.

27
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,720
- Ozzie, this is our hospital's
very busy Medical Director...

28
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,243
- Hi.
- Max Goodwin.

29
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,462
- Pleasure.

30
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:57,117
- Ozzie Cobb has pledged
$5 million...

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,509
- 5.
- Over the next quarter.

32
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,685
- Wow.
- What can I say?

33
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,426
I love to give.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,472
Would you excuse us?
This way--just come with me.

35
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,517
You do realize

36
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,606
I'm trying
to fund your hospital here.

37
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,913
- Yeah, well, University
just dumped a patient

38
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:13,263
on our doorstep--
days, if not hours,

39
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,656
before she's expected to die.
All right?

40
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,266
You wanna know why?
Because they're cooking

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,485
their books, all right?

42
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,182
She's not gonna die
on their watch,

43
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,184
she's gonna die on ours,
and she is not the only one.

44
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,707
There have been others.

45
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,448
- Of course there's
been others, Max.

46
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:27,190
Every hospital dumps patients.
Even New Amsterdam.

47
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,759
Hello!
Sorry about that.

48
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,896
- Yes, I'm listening,
Gladys, obviously.

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,550
It's Saleem, he's on the piano.
Just--

50
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,292
- Dad, you're supposed
to be listening to me.

51
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,815
- You know what? Wait--
Oh, okay, okay.

52
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,383
No, if he's already 51/50,
then no, no can do.

53
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,819
That is a big no no.

54
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,386
- Dad!
- Yes, honey,

55
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,910
you sound amazing.
Keep going, all right?

56
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,477
No, that's what I'm saying.

57
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,436
Saleem, babe, hey!

58
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,916
Yeah, let's try a little
sotto voce, all right?

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,876
It is a headache
and it's a compliance issue.

60
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,834
- Namaste, Ella-ji.
- Good morning.

61
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,316
- I was wondering
if you would ever wake up.

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,797
- Oh.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,930
This is a lot of stuff.

64
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,237
I just--I need just cornflakes.

65
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,719
- No, no, no boxed cereal.
Not in this house.

66
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:23,725
Only fresh, healthy food
for you and the baby.

67
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,252
Stuffed parathas,

68
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,907
a little bit of curd.

69
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,953
A little more.

70
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,391
Yes.

71
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,437
- Mmm.

72
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,659
- You came home
rather late last night.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,662
It was 9:00.

74
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,839
9:07, give or take.

75
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,667
- You don't have
to wait up for me.

76
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,671
- Or if you came home earlier,
I wouldn't have to.

77
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,849
Now, about the dirty dishes.

78
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,416
- I have to go to work.
- Already?

79
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,548
- Yeah, sorry.
- Okay.

80
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,334
Ella, wait a minute.

81
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:10,293
Don't forget this.
- What's in here?

82
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,687
- Your lunch.
Freshly made Indian food.

83
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,473
Wait until you try
my special samosas.

84
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,345
- Thank you.

85
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,911
- Namaste, Ella-ji.

86
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,609
- Dr. Duarte.

87
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,914
I didn't expect to hear
from you so soon.

88
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,612
How's San Francisco?

89
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,614
- You'll be finding out
soon enough, Floyd.

90
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,746
We'd like to officially
offer you the position

91
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,401
as new Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

92
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,621
at Yerba Buena Hospital.

93
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,318
- That's...

94
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,060
- Great news, I hope.
- Uh, yeah, I, uh--

95
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,497
It is.
Uh, but before I say yes,

96
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,020
I'd like to square
some things up here.

97
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,414
Can I have a few days?
- Sure. A few days.

98
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,808
We'll talk soon.

99
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,767
- Max!
- Did you know that

100
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,639
New Amsterdam has
dumped over 30 patients

101
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:54,294
into the municipal hospice
system in the last six months?

102
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,426
- Wow, that's a lot.
- 30 within six months.

103
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,993
That's not just a lot.
It's appalling.

104
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,082
- Completely agree.
That's absolutely horrific.

105
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,084
But I'm gonna need you to
switch gears for just a minute.

106
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,955
- Yeah, how can I help?
- I need you to not approve

107
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,479
my brachytherapy device.

108
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,828
- How can I not help?

109
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,090
- Exactly.
- Why would I do that?

110
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,787
- Because Castro
didn't approve it.

111
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,528
The request never should've
gotten up to you.

112
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:13,356
- I seem to remember having
very candid conversation

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,836
about me having your back.

114
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,446
- You can have my back,
but this just looks like

115
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,795
I went over Castro's head.

116
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,362
- Is it going to help
out patients?

117
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:20,450
- I mean, yes.
- Is it within budget?

118
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,712
- Yes--
- Will it make

119
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,105
our hospital better?
- Of course.

120
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,802
But in order to keep the peace

121
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,370
between Castro and myself,
I can't have you...

122
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:28,632
favoring me.

123
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,591
- I do favor you.

124
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,463
- All right, well,
keep that to yourself.

125
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,683
- Just tell Castro that
I'm favoring our patients.

126
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,727
- Max, no--
- And if she has

127
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,033
a problem with that,

128
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,426
just tell her
to come talk to me.

129
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,036
- Where are you going?

130
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,651
- Thank you for choosing
Bell Gardens Hospice.

131
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,436
- Excuse me, hi.
- Visiting's not for

132
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,786
another 30 minutes.
- No, I'm not visiting.

133
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,091
- Oh, okay.
Intake's down the hall.

134
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,660
- I'm not here
to drop off either.

135
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,836
I'm actually--excuse me--
here to pick up.

136
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,142
- I--I'm sorry, what?

137
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,013
- Uh, well, I'm sorry because

138
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,364
you've gotten some of New
Amsterdam's patients by mistake

139
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,540
and I'm here to take them back.

140
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,499
- W-Which patients?

141
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:15,157
- All of them.

142
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,165
- New Amsterdam has been
failing our patients

143
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,471
at the end of their lives.

144
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,515
We care for them right up until

145
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,864
their last days and then,

146
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,126
when curing them
is no longer an option,

147
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,780
we pass the buck.

148
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,521
We turn them loose on
overburdened systems--

149
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,697
hospice, nursing homes,
unprepared families.

150
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,960
This is not what End-of-Life
care should look like.

151
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,398
So we're gonna
change that today.

152
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,834
Welcome--excuse me--

153
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,011
to the New Amsterdam
Palliative Care Unit.

154
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,841
- In my hallway?

155
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,190
- Working on that.

156
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,192
Every doctor is gonna
get a patient

157
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,063
and they'll be with you
till the end.

158
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,935
- What about our
actual patients?

159
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,980
- Just rely on your residents
and your attendings for now.

160
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:58,635
I want your full attention
here today.

161
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,116
- But if they're palliative,
what medicine are we offering?

162
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,727
- No medicine.
This is about, uh, care, okay?

163
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,468
I want you to talk to them,

164
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,427
figure out what they need
and make sure they get it.

165
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,516
- What about cost?
Who is covering this? Are we?

166
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,995
- I don't know,
but I'm gonna figure that out.

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,519
This is for you.
Yup.

168
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:15,652
- So we--we can do anything?

169
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:18,612
- Anything. Just give them
a good death.

170
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,527
All right?

171
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,754
Peter.

172
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,454
Peter, hi.
Hi.

173
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,107
I'm Dr. Frome.

174
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,502
I'm, uh, Ignatius,
or Iggy.

175
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,808
Dr. Iggy.
Driggy.

176
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:43,767
Any combination
of that will do.

177
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,769
I'm here to take
care of you, okay?

178
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:50,513
- I'm Dr. Kapoor, and I'll
be taking care of you today.

179
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:53,777
I see you have had Scleroderma
for several years,

180
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,867
but two months ago it started
causing organ failure.

181
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,870
- Yes. I'll be dead
in a few days.

182
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,005
- Dr. Meredith?

183
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,528
- Zeke's fine.

184
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,095
- I'm Dr. Sharpe.

185
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,140
What can I do to make you
more comfortable?

186
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,969
- More comfortable?
I'm dying.

187
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,671
- Adele Eisenbaum?

188
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:21,196
Um, I'm Max and, uh, I'm here
to make you comfortable.

189
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,634
- I'd lower your expectations.

190
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:25,853
- Okay.

191
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,508
- I do have a wonderful idea.

192
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,292
We will give you
a living wake.

193
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,989
- A wake?

194
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,078
- To allow your family
and relatives

195
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:36,037
to gather and celebrate
your life

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,214
while you're still there
to celebrate it with them.

197
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,607
- Nope.

198
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,218
- "Nope"?

199
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:46,743
- I'll have a living wake
over my dead body.

200
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,661
- My mother has been
a patient at University

201
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,794
for over a decade.

202
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,273
I was gonna have my baby there.

203
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:58,059
And they just threw her out,
like, like--

204
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,104
You have to do something.

205
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,150
You have to save her.

206
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,066
- No, no, Mrs. Shipley,
I can't do that, all right?

207
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,284
No one can do that.

208
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,810
- Late stage leukemia

209
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,725
comes with a host
of physical ailments

210
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:16,643
that can make the transitioning
process...challenging.

211
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,080
- And where exactly
am I transitioning to,

212
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,692
would you say?

213
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,912
- Well,
I suppose that depends.

214
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:29,133
What do you believe in?

215
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,787
- Numbers.

216
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,224
- Oh, so your doctorate
is in mathematics?

217
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,966
- I was a professor
for 25 years.

218
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,925
- What drew you to math?

219
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,712
- The certainty.

220
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,714
But this...

221
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:49,893
what I'm facing now is...
incomprehensible.

222
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,939
It's unknowable.

223
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:55,856
- I guess death can't
be solved like an equation.

224
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,815
- And yet,
death is a certainty.

225
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,777
You really wanna help me?

226
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,779
Solve that.

227
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,916
- I...

228
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,266
- It's okay.
What--what is it?

229
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,964
- I...

230
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,750
I want to see my father.

231
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,230
- Your father?
Okay.

232
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,711
- Yeah.
- Okay, I can do that.

233
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,060
I can arrange that.

234
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,236
Is he in the city?

235
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,368
- Don't know.

236
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,849
Haven't spoken...

237
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:37,027
Haven't spoken...
in 12 years.

238
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,334
- Okay.

239
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:42,380
- There's no excuse
for what happened, all right?

240
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,644
But your mother's here now,
and we're gonna do our best

241
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,081
to make sure
she's comfortable, okay?

242
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,431
- You need to do more than make
sure she's comfortable.

243
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,172
You need to make sure
she's better.

244
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,695
- Mrs. Shipley--

245
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,089
- You're just as bad
as University.

246
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,786
You're just giving up on her.

247
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,788
What is this place for
if you can't save--

248
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,313
- Whoa, whoa, oh--

249
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,794
Uh, Bloom,
little help here, please.

250
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,666
- Regina?
- Her water broke.

251
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,015
- Is it too soon?

252
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,843
I'm only 34 weeks.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

253
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,453
You're in a safe window.

254
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,847
This is, uh, your preterm,
okay?

255
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,326
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

256
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,327
- I was actually hoping
I'd get to deliver

257
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,765
a baby today.

258
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,988
- Am I...
really going to see

259
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,338
my grandchild?

260
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,043
- Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma.

261
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,263
- Guess they were right
about the smoking.

262
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,701
They're giving me four
to six weeks.

263
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,964
- Mmm.
And what did you do before...

264
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:47,271
- Dying?
Worked for the city council

265
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,925
in Yonkers.

266
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,842
I'd field all the angry calls.

267
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,062
Your sidewalk's got a crack?

268
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:59,370
Old power lines are drooping
into your marigolds?

269
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,851
I was the soothing voice

270
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,723
on the other end of the line.
- Max!

271
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,507
I need help with
a very important donor...

272
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,248
- You're hired.
- For what?

273
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,858
- And you flood our halls

274
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:09,946
with patients
we've already discharged?

275
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,513
- Karen, I'm glad you're here.

276
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,993
I'd like you to meet my
new executive assistant,

277
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,517
Adele Eisenbaum.
Highly, highly skilled

278
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,215
and tons of experience.

279
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,478
- I'm happy to come aboard.

280
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,872
- Great. Now, come back
upstairs with me

281
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,787
while I've still got
Ozzie on the hook.

282
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,267
- You know what,
I would love to, but I, um...

283
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,836
- Um, oh, unfortunately,

284
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,884
Dr. Goodwin's schedule
is a little crammed.

285
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,408
Uh, he has to get
everyone settled

286
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:40,107
before people start
dying in the hallways.

287
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,240
I like those nails,
by the way.

288
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:47,810
But as soon as Dr. Goodwin
sorts through this mess

289
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,247
you're gonna hear from him.

290
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,423
- I like her.
I hope you stick around.

291
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,816
- I'm temporary.

292
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,296
- We'll see about that.

293
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,863
Now find a better place
for these patients.

294
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,299
- Yup, working on it, boss.

295
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,436
- Maybe with a new coat
of paint, hmm?

296
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,091
- Don't make me quit
before I die.

297
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,964
- Now, this could work.

298
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:14,184
Watch out, okay, good, okay,
one second--okay, we're going.

299
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,147
- No.
- Yeah, no.

300
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,888
Mm. Here we are.

301
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,980
This floor hasn't been used
in, uh, years.

302
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,157
Ooh, sorry, watch out for...
whatever that is.

303
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,855
Uh, I don't even know
what's in that room.

304
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,293
Uh, when equipment breaks
down or loses its function,

305
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,034
it ends up here.

306
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:43,866
We even started calling it
"The Graveyard."

307
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,955
- Oh, my God.

308
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,522
- I know.
It's perfect.

309
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,659
- Welcome to
"The Graveyard."

310
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,487
We're gonna change the name.

311
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,403
Uh, this will be the home
of our new palliative wing.

312
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,406
It's gonna be
a place to call your own.

313
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,365
You know, your own--
your own rooms.

314
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,149
Your own spaces.

315
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,195
So just check it out
and find a, uh, spot

316
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,110
that feels right for you,
wherever you like.

317
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,635
Wherever calls your name,
just...

318
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,333
So...what do you think?

319
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,338
- I think it looks like
a hospital.

320
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,079
- Not a ringing
endorsement, but--

321
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,602
- We didn't pull our punches

322
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,561
at the Yonkers City
Council meetings.

323
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:30,304
- All right, well, I'm just
looking for a comfortable place

324
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,609
for people to...

325
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,264
- Kick the bucket?

326
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,613
- Yeah.

327
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:39,008
- Nobody here
wants to die, Max.

328
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,619
When you know your time left

329
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,058
on this big blue ball
is short,

330
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,974
you look at things
a little differently.

331
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,152
- I can relate, actually.

332
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,372
- Well, then, look around.

333
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,419
We don't want a place to die.

334
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,290
We want a place to live.

335
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:04,294
And who in the hell wants
to live in a hospital?

336
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,475
- Oh, uh, Iggy--
- Hi.

337
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,390
- Hi.
Could we swap patients?

338
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,045
- Oh, no way, no.
I'm way too invested in my guy.

339
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,395
He's a black-sheep son
trying to reconnect

340
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,223
with his emotionally
unavailable father,

341
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,660
which in no way whatsoever
reminds me of my own family.

342
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,967
Why, what's yours?
- Mine asked me to solve

343
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,142
the meaning of the universe.

344
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:27,578
- Oof. Whoa.
- Right?

345
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,493
How exactly is one
supposed to do that?

346
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,191
- Well, you know,

347
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,670
psilocybin has actually
shown some real promise

348
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,672
in helping people with
existential crisis.

349
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,326
AKA dying.

350
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,980
- You want me to give him
hallucinogenic mushrooms?

351
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,460
- Well, if you get
"Right to Try" approval,

352
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,376
it's perfectly legal.
Unlike, say, heroin.

353
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,508
- Shut up.
- Okay.

354
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,554
- And thank you,
I will consider it.

355
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,295
- You're welcome.
- Iggy,

356
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,775
you must swap patients with me.

357
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,429
- What is happening
around here? No.

358
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,257
No tradesies.
- This Debra Keating

359
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,520
is an unreasonable woman.
I told her I wanted to give her

360
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,696
a beautiful wake.
You know what she said?

361
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,829
- No.
- That's right. "No."

362
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:04,354
- You know, I wanted to give
a living wake for my wife.

363
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:08,358
But Debra is refusing,
and I don't know why.

364
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,708
- Well, did you ask her?

365
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,362
- No.
- You know, a wise man

366
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,451
about your height once
told me that listening

367
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,018
is a very effective tool
in determining

368
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,542
why people think the things
that they think.

369
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,327
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
One second.

370
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,024
Where did you get this from?

371
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,634
- Oh, there's a veritable feast
right there.

372
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,767
But don't worry,
it's not as good as yours.

373
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,688
- Psilocybin is being used in
in End-of-Life study protocols

374
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,082
all over the country.
- And I do not feel comfortable

375
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,561
clearing it for use
in my department.

376
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,520
- "Right to Try" laws
allow wide latitude

377
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,218
in treating terminal patients.
If you just met Zeke--

378
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,090
- I'm not adding any more
fuel to this whole

379
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,395
"Heroin Den Helen" thing

380
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,310
by letting you
prescribe "shrooms."

381
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,573
- It's micro-dosing. and
it will be carefully monitored.

382
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,227
- It's not gonna happen.

383
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:54,361
But feel free to go over
my head and run to Max,

384
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:57,712
because that is how
this works, right?

385
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,463
- Forgive me, Debra.

386
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:13,423
You are in charge of how
the next few days should go,

387
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,905
and I am here just to listen.

388
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,602
- Thank you.

389
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,653
- Okay,

390
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:30,527
I'm listening,
but I'm not hearing anything.

391
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:33,791
- What is there to say?

392
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,793
- Oh--so much.

393
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,273
N-not just for you,

394
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,275
but for your friends
and relatives.

395
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,886
Oh, sorry, I'm just
here to listen. Sorry.

396
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,458
- I haven't seen anyone
since things got bad.

397
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,505
I just want to be alone.

398
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,681
I even gave away Beverly.

399
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,336
- Beverly?

400
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,208
- My cocker spaniel.

401
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:03,430
- So why would you
wish to do this alone?

402
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,304
- I don't want to
share this with anyone.

403
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,440
I've kept my feelings
to myself my whole life.

404
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:18,358
Why should my death
be any different?

405
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,452
It would just upset people
if they saw me like this.

406
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:30,326
- So you don't want
to have a living wake

407
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,331
because you're trying
to protect other people?

408
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,377
- Yes.

409
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,206
- I understand now, Debra.

410
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:43,557
I know exactly what you need.

411
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,908
A living wake.
- What?

412
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:50,520
No, I don't want it.
- I'm listening to your words,

413
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,435
and I'm hearing you
loud and clear.

414
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,568
- No, I said I don't want...

415
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,265
- Debra, you're going
to love it.

416
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,312
- ...a living wake.

417
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,234
- Thank you.

418
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,893
Peter.

419
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:19,288
Peter, your dad
is here to see you.

420
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,922
- Hi.

421
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,757
I--I hate you.

422
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,762
I've always hated you.

423
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,607
- There we go.
- Oh, what happened?

424
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,610
- Someone had a little slip
and fall up on L and D.

425
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,004
- I got a little excited.

426
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:27,008
Thought I could...
stand at Regina's bedside.

427
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,096
- Let me take a look.

428
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:31,360
Ooh, yeah,
that's a real humdinger.

429
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,014
Probably best if I put
in a couple stitches.

430
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,668
- I'm fine.
- Well, just to be safe.

431
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,540
- I wanna get back upstairs.

432
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,500
I don't wanna miss
my grandbaby.

433
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,979
- It's only gonna
take a minute.

434
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:46,419
- Dr. Bloom, I'm at
a time in my life where

435
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:49,596
every minute...matters.

436
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,425
- Okay, look, at least
let me thrown on some bandages

437
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,035
for the road, okay?

438
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,346
- I always dreamt

439
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,086
of being a grandmother...

440
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:09,398
Spoiling my grandkids
with love.

441
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:15,012
I really thought...
I would have more time.

442
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,671
- Marianne?

443
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,108
M-Marianne?
- W-Whoa, okay, okay.

444
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,023
Get her legs.

445
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,547
- Okay.

446
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,116
- No pulse.
- Cardiac arrest.

447
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,031
Grab the defibrillator.

448
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,729
What are you doing?

449
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:37,383
- She's DNR.

450
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:39,689
- You--you cannot be serious.
- Oh, no, no, no.

451
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,561
We gotta let her go.

452
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,606
- In two seconds I can
have her breathing again.

453
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,522
- Lauren, she made
her wishes clear.

454
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,655
- She wishes to see
her grandchild!

455
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,005
- But that was a minute ago
in a conversation.

456
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,050
The legal and binding
choice she made

457
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,922
was no shocks,
no medical intervention.

458
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,489
Look, it's here
in her file.

459
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,881
- Okay, but if she
was awake right now,

460
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,709
she would reverse that DNR,
and you know it.

461
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:02,103
- But she's not awake.
- That's because we're arguing

462
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,496
instead of trying
to resuscitate her!

463
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,540
- Lauren, if you
touch Marianne,

464
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,846
you're violating her rights.

465
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,630
You need to
let her go in peace.

466
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,153
Here, no, she's DNR.

467
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,902
Lauren!
What are you doing?

468
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,035
- Someone get the crash cart
in here now!

469
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:23,211
- Stop!

470
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,387
- I need MP.
Come on, Marianne.

471
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,581
- Enjoy the trip, Doc.

472
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,584
- If Dr. Sharpe thinks
this will help,

473
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:52,022
she's worse off than I am.

474
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,812
- This stays between us.

475
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,292
And thank you.
- For what?

476
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,860
I wasn't even here.

477
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:07,081
Oh, you gotta get me back
before Burning Man.

478
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,782
- Uh, hey, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

479
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,002
Um, it was recently
brought to my attention

480
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,960
that this feels
like a hospital.

481
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:20,616
So I'd like you to meet our new
therapists and social workers,

482
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,966
all of whom are fully trained
in palliative care.

483
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,708
I've also hired some
acupuncturists

484
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:28,494
and a yoga instructor,
massage therapist,

485
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,931
and last but not least,
I would like you to meet

486
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,715
Trinket and Cici!
- Aww.

487
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,543
- Hey, hi there!

488
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,197
- Uh, these guys are gonna
hang out with you

489
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,938
and have some fun,
so without further ado,

490
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,853
I'd like you to welcome
the new full-time staff

491
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,202
of "The Graveyard."

492
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,639
And we've really gotta
change that name.

493
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,859
- I am impressed.

494
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,643
- Not bad, right?

495
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:50,254
- But like we used to say
at the Yonkers City Council,

496
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,867
how the hell are we
paying for this?

497
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,564
- I'm working on it.

498
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,785
- So how did you like the lunch
I prepared for you?

499
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,830
- It was so good.
I loved it, thank you.

500
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:03,529
- And what was your
favorite part?

501
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,880
Mutton samosa?
- Yup, yes, definitely.

502
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,664
- They were vegetable samosas.

503
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,666
How could you give
away the food

504
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,234
that I just made for you?

505
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:14,888
- It's too much.

506
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:17,194
- Okay, I will pack
a smaller lunch.

507
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,979
- No,
that's not what I meant.

508
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,937
I mean,
I know I asked for help,

509
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,896
but you're smothering me.

510
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,637
- I was just trying
to help you.

511
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,986
- I know, and I'm sorry,

512
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,988
but I don't need
to be helped like that.

513
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,685
You're stressing me out.

514
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,948
- This is what family does.

515
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,342
I just--if this is gonna work,

517
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,605
I just need us to have
some boundaries.

518
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,827
- Boundaries?

519
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,568
What kind of boundaries?

520
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,918
- Just for starters,
you can't feed me five courses

521
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,702
at every meal.
I know that might be how

522
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,574
you do things, but it's
not how I want to do them.

523
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,880
I wanna eat what I wanna eat.

524
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,188
- Okay.

525
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,624
Well...

526
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,628
If this is what you feel.

527
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,764
I'll see you at home.

528
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,853
- Don't wait up.

529
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,898
Welcome to Pain De Vie.

530
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,820
- Oh...hey.

531
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,213
- Hey.

532
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,695
- How are you
holding up?

533
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,045
- Still can't get his words
out of my head.

534
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,743
Don't think I ever will.

535
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,049
- Yeah.

536
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,836
You know, I, um...

537
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:41,235
I've said those words
to my father.

538
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,197
I've hated my father.

539
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,027
I've hated him.

540
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,990
But I never stopped
loving him.

541
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,905
Ever.

542
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,345
And I care what he thinks
about me.

543
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:06,260
I really do.

544
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,088
Just like how Peter cared
what you thought about him.

545
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,090
- Okay, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here,

546
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,092
but I was never there for him.

547
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,703
- He asked for you.

548
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:21,188
That was his dying wish
was to see you.

549
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,494
And yes, it was ugly,

550
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,496
and it was rough.

551
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,676
But...I promise you,
it was not just hate.

552
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:35,028
- Well, doesn't matter now.
It's over.

553
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,246
- No, no, no.

554
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,771
But for Peter, it is, yes.

555
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:41,687
But not for you.

556
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,254
You get to finish
the conversation.

557
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,439
- I don't think
this is working.

558
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,444
- I've heard death

559
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:06,320
described as the introduction
of ink into water.

560
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:10,150
So it's not a vanishing,

561
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,980
it's an expansion.

562
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:19,072
- A poetic treatment
won't solve a concrete problem.

563
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:21,944
- I relate as a scientist,
I do.

564
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:25,774
But to me,

565
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:29,212
numbers aren't concrete
at all.

566
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:31,301
And neither is death.

567
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,917
- Make your case, doctor.

568
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,227
- What's the highest number?

569
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:47,970
Or the last digit in pi?

570
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:52,105
How many snowflakes
are in a blizzard?

571
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:55,108
When it comes
to the end of life,

572
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,284
maybe we need to leave
quantifiable behind

573
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:02,202
and rely instead on experience.

574
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,160
After all, no one can count
all the snowflakes

575
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,902
in a winter storm.

576
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:18,392
- Nothing...

577
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:22,352
is actually
very easy to count.

578
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,634
- She's stable.
Heart rate and rhythm normal.

579
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:47,247
Blood pressure steady.
Mentally intact.

580
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,082
Are you--
are you punishing me?

581
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,866
For saving her life?

582
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,520
- The ends don't
justify the means.

583
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:02,436
- Marianne is gonna get to see
her grandchild before she dies.

584
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,177
- Once you started to
resuscitate her,

585
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,353
when were you going to stop?
At three broken ribs?

586
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,571
At a chest tube?

587
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,138
What if you had revived
Marianne

588
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:12,054
only to learn that
she was brain dead?

589
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,664
- Yeah, well,
none of that happened.

590
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,362
- Yeah, but our job
was to give her a good death.

591
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,929
She had it and you just
took it away.

592
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,191
- I did what Max
would have wanted.

593
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,366
- Oh, you're gonna
pin it on Max?

594
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:21,107
- Not just Max.
You know,

595
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,935
Sharpe, Iggy, Kapoor--

596
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,588
all of them would've
done the exact same thing.

597
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,373
- Oh, you don't know that.
- Take a look around, Floyd.

598
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,505
Everyone here
bends the rules.

599
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,072
Everyone except you.

600
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,118
So you wanna find
someone to shame,

601
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,076
someone who doesn't
fit in here,

602
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,165
you're looking at
the wrong person.

603
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,694
- Uh, thank you all for coming
to Debra's living wake.

604
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,133
If you have things
you wish to say to her,

605
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:52,051
feelings you wish her to know,

606
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,314
now is the time.

607
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,102
Why--why don't you start
us off, Debra?

608
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:03,366
Um, tell everyone
what you're feeling.

609
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,024
- I can't do this.

610
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:12,071
- Yes, you can.
Just open up.

611
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:15,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
Debra Keating.

612
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,438
Beverly?

613
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,745
- Come here, girl.

614
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:38,314
Come here.
All right.

615
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:42,405
Most of you know my Beverly.

616
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,281
What you don't know

617
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:50,761
is that when
my health plummeted,

618
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,720
she was so worried about me

619
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:55,418
she wouldn't even
touch her food.

620
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:59,074
She became so sad
and lethargic.

621
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:04,732
So she really experienced
the illness with me.

622
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,343
So even though
it broke my heart,

623
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:10,520
I gave her to my sister, Anna.

624
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:13,262
My rock since
the day I was born.

625
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:19,747
And Frank,
the best brother-in-law.

626
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,750
I love you
and your whole family.

627
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,273
Is Ted here?

628
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:28,321
There you are.
Thank you for being here.

629
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:33,239
And, uh, Jeremy.

630
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:36,155
I--I never thought
I'd say this out loud...

631
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:40,072
- Debra--
- But I--I have loved you

632
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,639
ever since that
night at the ferry.

633
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,555
I didn't know how to say it.
- Stop, stop speaking.

634
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,602
Stop speaking, please.
This wake is over.

635
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,038
Please, thank you,
and good-bye.

636
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,692
Please, thank you,
bye-bye. Bye.

637
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,477
- What are you doing?
- You--you can't have a wake.

638
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:58,481
You're not dying, so...

639
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,048
- Tell me you kept
the receipts.

640
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,832
- Okay, before you
say anything else,

641
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:05,271
uh, you should know that,
uh, it looks expensive,

642
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,317
and that's because it is.
But it's the right thing to do,

643
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,493
and it's all paid for.

644
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,408
- And how, pray tell,
is that even possible?

645
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,367
- Because of you.

646
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,370
All your hard work with
the new donor, Ozzie Cobb.

647
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,633
$5 million donation, wow.

648
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:21,809
And all I need for this
is $1 million.

649
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:24,551
You, Karen Brantley,
are a genius.

650
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:27,075
- Ozzie Cobb hasn't given
a dime to this hospital.

651
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,251
- What's that now?
- He's a selfish tight-ass

652
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:33,386
who pledges millions every year
and never donates a damn thing.

653
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,257
I was hoping to get him
on the hook.

654
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,737
But he wriggled out again.

655
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,739
And if you just had shown up,

656
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,741
you might've been able to reel
him back in, but you didn't.

657
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,222
And now it's too late.

658
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:46,181
- Okay. If I'd known that--
- Save it, Max.

659
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,489
Because you just spent
$1 million we don't have.

660
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,578
- Um...
- Get everyone out of here

661
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,709
today.

662
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,245
- I'm not going to die?

663
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,682
- Nope.
You and Beverly both have

664
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,685
a bacterial disease
called Leptospirosis.

665
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:14,166
It presents the same
in humans and canines.

666
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:17,256
Uh, you must have gotten it
on one of your walks.

667
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,736
- But how did no one--
- The symptoms were masked

668
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,825
by your Scleroderma.
It was well hidden.

669
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,264
- Then how did you know?

670
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,831
- I listened to you.

671
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,355
With antibiotics,

672
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:34,403
both of you will make
a full recovery.

673
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,188
- Oh.

674
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,847
Once you start
with the emotions,

675
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,459
it's hard to stop,
isn't it?

676
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,421
Oh, my God.

677
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:55,468
I told all those people
how I feel.

678
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,689
Even Jeremy.

679
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,477
- I realize now that
a living wake

680
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,740
may not have been
what you needed.

681
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:10,439
I'm really sorry for
forcing you to have one.

682
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:14,356
- Don't you dare be sorry.

683
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,358
My wake...

684
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:24,366
It was the best day
of my life.

685
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,784
- Peter.

686
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,497
You are my baby boy.

687
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,808
I wish...

688
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:18,551
I wish I could've
shown you how much...

689
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,641
how much I love you.

690
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,737
But Papa's here now.

691
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,740
I'm here.

692
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:36,395
And I'm not leaving.

693
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,406
- Ozzie, I am so glad
I caught you.

694
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:48,929
You are one slippery fish.

695
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,322
Well, I told chairwoman
Bradley

696
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:51,801
I've see everything
I needed to see.

697
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,760
- Yeah, actually,
not everything.

698
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:56,023
- The floor is yours, Max.
- Okay, great, thank you.

699
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,548
And, uh, thank you all
for coming.

700
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,550
Tonight, I have the great
pleasure of introducing

701
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,030
our new palliative care unit,

702
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,467
where our patients will spend
their final days

703
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:08,253
being cared for
on their own terms.

704
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,776
It's a dream come true
for this hospital.

705
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,473
But it almost didn't happen.

706
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,606
Thanks to a very,
very charitable

707
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,912
last-minute donation,
we can now call

708
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,523
this one-of-a-kind unit

709
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,438
a permanent feature
here in New Amsterdam.

710
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,440
So now, when you think
of philanthropy,

711
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,832
you will forever think of

712
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,705
the "Ozzie Cobb
Palliative Care Wing."

713
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,924
Take a look at that!
Pretty good, right?

714
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:30,492
- Oh...thank you!

715
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,799
- Yes!

716
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,802
Look at this guy!

717
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,978
- I--I did n--I--

718
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,632
- I know,
I couldn't agree more.

719
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,329
I think what
you're trying to say

720
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,418
in front of everyone
gathered here today,

721
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,638
our patients--oh, look at
that--the news media,

722
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,944
the print, broadcast
and streaming outlets--

723
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:49,511
hi there--
is thank you.

724
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,817
Now let's get a few photos
of him

725
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,122
signing the check, shall we?

726
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,473
Let's really
capture this moment

727
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,650
of boundless philanthropy
for everyone to see, huh?

728
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,001
- You're on the hook now.

729
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,747
- Hey, all right!

730
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,359
- Smile, please.
- Yes!

731
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,362

- I don't know what Georgia
would've wanted.

760
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,866
And we were so busy
trying to save our marriage

761
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,998
and deal with my cancer...

762
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,478
I didn't even ask her.

763
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:17,572
The flowers.

764
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,488
I just feel like
I got the flowers wrong.

765
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,055
- They were beautiful.

766
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:24,710
- The funeral home, they--

767
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,756
they sent options, and,
you know, I--

768
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,933
I mean, I just let them
choose and then--

769
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,152
What if--what if--
- Max,

770
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:34,241
you've got to forgive
yourself.

771
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:42,292
- Maybe I thought if I can

772
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,818
prepare everyone else,
then...I could.

773
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,646
- And?

774
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,571
- What do you want

775
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,661
when the time comes?

776
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,271
- I--

777
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,533
You don't have to...

778
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,622
- Well, someone should know.

779
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,626
- Um...

780
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,281
Luna...

781
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:17,327
by my side,
singing to me.

782
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:22,071
Even if I can't hear it.

783
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,944
Just wanna feel
that she's there.

784
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,035
- I'll tell her.

785
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,912
What about you?

786
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,964
- How about we just throw
a big party and call it a day?

787
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,010
- What kind of party?
Are we talking, uh,

788
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,926
piñatas or clowns...

789
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,580
- I was thinking
more dancing.

790
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:55,714
- Dancing? Okay, so, like
tango or merengue?

791
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,325
See, you gotta be specific
so I get it right.

792
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,893
- Oh, so you're in charge?

793
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:04,723
- Someone should be.
