1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,571
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:08,225
- Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,445
as co-chair of oncology as well
as deputy medical director.

4
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:12,360
- We're adopting?
- I can explain.

5
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,492
- You could if you
were coming home tonight.

6
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,059
- These women
are our patients.

7
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,496
They need our help,
so we are going to Rikers.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,064
- Table three is now open.
Don't make me repeat myself.

9
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,631
- Thank you.
- Jackie Conner.

10
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,067
- Get off me!
- Four injured!

11
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,851
We need the medic.
- Get 'em to New Amsterdam.

12
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,157
- You're here from Rikers.

13
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,593
You overdosed
and it damaged your heart.

14
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,334
- This is because
I turned state's witness.

15
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,162
Someone's trying to kill me.

16
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,473
- Guard?

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,355
- Came as soon as I heard.

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,401
If Brantley thinks
that she can demote you--

19
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,446
- She can, Max.
And she did.

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,100
- No, no, no, no,
I'm gonna fix this.

21
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,232
All right, I'll call HCC.

22
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,624
I will make an appeal
to the board--

23
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:03,237
- The vote was unanimous.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,716
I'm lucky that I wasn't fired.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,544
- Fired? Do you think I would
let that happen to you?

26
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,416
If Brantley doesn't
reinstate you immediately,

27
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,634
then she can demote me, too.

28
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,549
- Oh, Max,
I don't need you to fix this.

29
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,898
I don't need you
to threaten people.

30
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,684
I just need some time to think.

31
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,338
- What is there to think about?

32
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,469
- What...

33
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:21,168
what am I still doing here?

34
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,386
- Okay, listen to me.
By the end of the week,

35
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,518
you're gonna have
everything back, okay?

36
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,563
Your department.
Deputy medical director.

37
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:26,869
In the meantime,
there's your patients,

38
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:30,307
your committees.
We still need you here, okay?

39
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:34,355
I... I need you here.

40
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,099
- And what about what I need?

41
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,712
'Cause I don't think I'm gonna
find it at New Amsterdam.

42
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:50,153
- So what are you...

43
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,460
you're gonna leave?

44
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,810
- I'm...

45
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm looking
for a reason to stay.

46
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,643
And right now,
I can't find one.

47
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,437
- Max.

48
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,612
What they did
to Helen is just--

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,179
- Yeah, I know.

50
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,354
- We were a team.

51
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,573
If Helen hadn't
brought you my way,

52
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,401
your cancer wouldn't be
in remission.

53
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,229
And all that money
she raised for my research,

54
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,361
she didn't deserve this.

55
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,494
Frankly, I don't know
how I can fill her shoes.

56
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,800
I can't replace
what she brings.

57
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,281
But do you think
you could help me reset?

58
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,282
Rally the troops?

59
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,197
- Of course.

60
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:37,461
- There's going to be a lot
of tough decisions to make.

61
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,811
I'm glad you have my back.

62
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:43,424
- So when you say
that you are moving to Idaho,

63
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,470
do you mean
after having the baby?

64
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:50,648
- I actually just gave
my two weeks' notice.

65
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,128
- So soon?

66
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,478
- Well, the pregnancy's really
doing a number on my OCD.

67
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:55,958
All my fears are heightened,

68
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,786
my compulsions are more vivid,

69
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,831
so I can't really
do this without help,

70
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,485
without my parents.

71
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,747
- Of course.

72
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,227
It's just that...

73
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,968
Idaho is so very far away.

74
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,492
- I know.

75
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,712
But I have to do
what's best for the baby.

76
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,453
- All surgical residents
to OR 6.

77
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:15,412
All surgical residents
to OR 6.

78
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,849
- Zach, Zach, I won't be mad.

79
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,243
I just...I feel like
I'm going crazy.

80
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,592
Just tell me
that you took my pill

81
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,247
to teach me a lesson
or to demonstrate--

82
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,683
- I didn't take your pill.

83
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:26,815
And the more you accuse me,

84
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,643
the more you sound
like a drug fiend.

85
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,254
- I'm in agony.
Please.

86
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:32,647
Please, just give me my meds.

87
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,779
- I can't do that.

88
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,738
- But I'm not gonna make it.

89
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,870
- You are gonna make it.

90
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,524
May be the worst day
of your life,

91
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,525
but you're gonna make it.

92
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,267
Fine.

93
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:48,576
Fine. Then I am gonna make this
the worst day of your life.

94
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,840
- Oh.

95
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,581
Yeah.

96
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:56,366
Hi. Hey.

97
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,759
I'm so glad you came.
Thank you.

98
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,589
- You texted 52 times,
so of course I came.

99
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:04,940
- Yeah, I just wanted
to explain myself.

100
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,898
- And I want to give you
the space to do that,

101
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,335
but I still feel--

102
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,727
- You're upset.
I know, I know.

103
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,425
I hear you.
Believe me.

104
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,643
I've had plenty
of time to think

105
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:15,080
on the new bed over here,

106
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:18,345
and the good news
is that this has all just been

107
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,521
one big misunderstanding.

108
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,871
- Iggy, you tried to adopt
another child

109
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,612
without discussing it with me.

110
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,570
That's not a misunderstanding.

111
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,921
- Martin, I just--hi.

112
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,534
- Dr. Frome,
sorry to interrupt.

113
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,753
- Yeah, now's not really
the best time, Dr. Park.

114
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,407
- Sorry, yes.
Sorry.

115
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:41,629
Um, I'm here
for my performance review.

116
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,545
- Right.
Um, yes, you are.

117
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:48,592
This will just take
about an hour, tops.

118
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,726
- Take all the time you need.
Ah, man.

119
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,470
- Excuse me.
Martin, hey, hey, hey.

120
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:59,429
Martin, Martin.
Hey, Martin, wait, wait, wait.

121
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,432
It's just that I have to give
Tabitha some bad news.

122
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,348
She can't assert herself,
and I don't think she's cut out

123
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,436
to be a therapist,
and I've been putting off

124
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,698
telling her
for as long as I can.

125
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,961
I can't put it off anymore.

126
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,617
Please.

127
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,012
- Good-bye, Ig.

128
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,976
- So if Evie takes a job
in San Francisco,

129
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,936
are you gonna have
a long distance marriage?

130
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,459
- That's not a thing, right?

131
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,461
Long-distance marriage
is an oxymoron.

132
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,811
- My friend met his fiancée
on Asian Charm,

133
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,639
and they still haven't even
met each other in person.

134
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,467
- Well,
with the right data plan,

135
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,774
I predict a lifetime
of happiness for them.

136
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,472
- I'm just saying distance
doesn't mean no connection.

137
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,387
Some of my
deepest conversations

138
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,389
have been over text.

139
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,477
- See,
that's why my generation

140
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,827
is better than your generation.

141
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,006
- Good.

142
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,926
Guard!

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,842
I need help here now!

144
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,020
- Is he--
- He's got a pulse.

145
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,674
- Where are your friends?
- I don't know.

146
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,763
They told me--they told me
to go to the bathroom.

147
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:16,201
Please,
I don't know anything else.

148
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,769
- His sidearm's missing.

149
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:22,904
- Code silver.
I repeat.

150
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,472
We have a code silver.

151
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,649
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

152
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,999
- Central, we're en route.

153
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,219
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

154
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,445
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

155
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,884
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

156
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,103
- Hey, what's going on?
What's a code silver?

157
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,496
- It's a combative person
with a weapon.

158
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,671
- All right, all right.
- Get back in my office.

159
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,629
Let's go.
- Move to the nearest room.

160
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,066
- Hey, wait.
In there.

161
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:01,551
- Code silver.
Move to the nearest room.

162
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,121
- That's not gonna work,
darling.

163
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,296
No one's coming or going.

164
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,037
- Dr. Hiiji said
if the pain got worse

165
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,692
to press the call button.

166
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:15,130
Push me over.

167
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,830
Where's the pain?

168
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,182
- Dr. Hiiji was monitoring
your appendix?

169
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:27,055
- Yeah.

170
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,579
- Well, it's about to rupture.

171
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,192
- This is a code silver.

172
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,891
- Max.

173
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,936
- It's okay.
They're with me.

174
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,637
- Dr. Goodwin, you ready?

175
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,208
- This is a code silver.

176
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,210
- Yeah.

177
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,737
Lock this door,
and do not let anyone in or out

178
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,782
under any circumstances
until I get back, okay?

179
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,481
- Please evacuate
the hallways.

180
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,975
Copy that.

181
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:25,156
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

182
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,552
- Ella.

183
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,640
Ella?

184
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,860
- This is a code silver.

185
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:37,560
Move to the nearest room.
Code silver.

186
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:41,085
Move to the nearest room
and wait for authorities.

187
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,568
This is a code silver.

188
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,659
- Okay, listen up.
We still have a job to do.

189
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,749
Everybody needs to maintain
their focus on the patient

190
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,272
and the operation at hand.

191
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,622
We may be on lockdown,

192
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,623
but it's nothing
we can't handle.

193
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,015
- High levels of catecholamine.

194
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,801
Cardiotoxicity indicated.

195
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,803
Likely a combination of--

196
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,643
- We have three Rikers
inmates on the loose.

197
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,166
Overtook a guard in the ED,
stole his gun.

198
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,167
- The guard, how is he?

199
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,255
- Stable.
- Good.

200
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,735
- We interrogated
the fourth inmate.

201
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,563
She said that killing the guard
wasn't their motive.

202
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,521
- Well, then what do they want?

203
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,784
- She didn't know
or wouldn't say.

204
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,525
Our culprits are
Dominique Ann Reed,

205
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,527
Suzan Parker,
Jackie Conner.

206
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,529
- Jackie Conner?
- You know her?

207
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,618
- No, I--we had a team
at Rikers today,

208
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,446
and she helped us.
Are you sure that she--

209
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,188
- Positive. We've got officers
on every exit and stairwell.

210
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,191
Shut down all the elevators.
Now we need to do a sweep.

211
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,714
- I'll come with you.
I need to triage

212
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,673
who's stable enough to stay
and who needs to be evacuated.

213
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,544
- Max,
where are we releasing people?

214
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,632
I need to get
my patient to Baptist.

215
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,634
She needs constant care.

216
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,375
- How about establish
a single egress point?

217
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,724
So we can clear
everyone properly,

218
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,552
but keep
the prisoners contained.

219
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,859
- Uh, basement.

220
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,383
Basement.

221
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,525
- Ella, come with me.

222
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,665
It's okay.
We are safe in here.

223
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,668
- I don't--I don't feel safe.

224
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,236
No. Sorry.

225
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,543
- Is there anything
I can do that might help?

226
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,328
- I, um--

227
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,418
I like to organize things
from largest to smallest.

228
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,462
- Okay.

229
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,681
- I know that sounds stupid,
but--

230
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,728
- No, no, it's not stupid.
It's not stupid.

231
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,818
Oh.

232
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:49,518
- Threes are better.

233
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,825
- Three?

234
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,783
- This is a code silver.

235
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,655
- Oh, I hate this so much.

236
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,265
These kids have enough trauma
in their lives

237
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:59,615
without alarms blaring and--
- They're safe.

238
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,313
There's nothing more
you can do for them.

239
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,619
And you said
you wanted to talk to me,

240
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,317
so talk.

241
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,624
- Martin, forgive me I can't
focus on us right now.

242
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,712
- No, now seems like

243
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,453
the perfect time
to focus on us,

244
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,629
considering we're gonna be
locked in a room together,

245
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,763
alone for the first time
in God knows how long.

246
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,727
- This is a code silver.

247
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,469
Please evacuate the hallways.

248
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,386
- Okay, right this way.

249
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,692
Let's line up over here,

250
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,215
and make sure
that you show your ID bands

251
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,478
on the way out, okay?

252
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,479
- How did this happen?

253
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,786
- Jackie from Rikers.

254
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,613
- What?
- Dr. Goodwin.

255
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:44,225
We need you over here.
- Yeah, okay.

256
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,792
I know this
isn't your responsibility,

257
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,228
and I can understand
why you'd want to just

258
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,403
check out of here
right about now,

259
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,579
but I can really,
really use your help.

260
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,580
- No, of course, go.

261
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,886
I'll keep things
moving down here.

262
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,631
I'm so sorry, Lenore.

263
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,372
Security won't let me
leave my office,

264
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,331
but Dr. Bloom
will take good care of you.

265
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,247
- Okay, I'm gonna need clamps,
retractors.

266
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,684
- Supply cabinet.

267
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,686
- Are you out of your mind?
Are you even a surgeon?

268
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,948
- I did my rotations.

269
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:15,212
Okay, I need that tray.

270
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,474
- If you put any weight
on that leg of yours,

271
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:17,519
the bone will snap.

272
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,520
- I am not
the patient right now.

273
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,826
- Yes, you are.
- Gloves?

274
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:23,481
- You're my patient.
You're my responsibility.

275
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:30,314
- You might as well
take a second pill.

276
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,402
You're sure as hell
gonna need it.

277
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,584
- I can't operate on narcotics.

278
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:40,890
Besides...

279
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,805
she's gonna need this
more than me.

280
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,807
Come on.

281
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,332
Okay.
Lenore, here.

282
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,682
Now swallow.

283
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,818
- Now give her a few more.

284
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,740
- Security asked me to clear
the oncology department.

285
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,874
- I'll come with you.

286
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,574
- Helen.

287
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,912
- Are you okay?
What happened?

288
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,348
- I got separated
from my group,

289
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,349
so I hid.

290
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,090
- Okay, we've got you.

291
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,310
- There you go.
Easy, easy.

292
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:58,359
We're gonna get you
out of here.

293
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,111
- I need a wider
field of vision, please.

294
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,330
- On it.

295
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,961
- How are you feeling?

296
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,005
- Just want to get out of here.

297
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,528
- How did you get injured?

298
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,879
- It was all so scary.

299
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,489
- Wait, wait, wait,
whoa, just lay down.

300
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,577
Just say down.

301
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,492
Just lay down, okay?

302
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,452
- She's clammy,
and her pulse is rapid.

303
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,368
- I need to examine
your injuries.

304
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,327
Do you mind?
- Mm-mm.

305
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,114
- Mm, sutures are broken.

306
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,942
She could go
into hypovolemic shock.

307
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,292
- I can keep pressure on it.

308
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,253
- Okay. Uh...

309
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,645
there's no signal.

310
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,951
I'm gonna grab
gauze and tape.

311
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,561
- Okay.

312
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,957
- I just want to go home.

313
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,964
- What happened
to your ID band?

314
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,967
- Thought I was leaving.
Didn't need it anymore.

315
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,160
- You know I never would've
gone through with it,

316
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,119
right, Martin?

317
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:48,164
Actually adopt
a child without telling you?

318
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,298
I was gathering information
so that we could discuss it.

319
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,169
- But we never did discuss it.

320
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,954
What, were you just hoping
I wouldn't notice

321
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,957
an extra kid
at the breakfast table?

322
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,220
- I think you're overreacting.

323
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,221
- Am I?

324
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,570
- Yes.

325
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:06,095
- All of our responsibilities,
our social life,

326
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,664
everything we do
is on your terms.

327
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,014
You obviously
don't care what I think.

328
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,581
- That is not true.

329
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:14,669
- Never mind.
You don't get it.

330
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,323
- What, Martin? What--

331
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,541
what don't I get?

332
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,156
- Dr. Frome?

333
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,635
- Yes?

334
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,723
- Um...

335
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,638
sorry, nothing.
Never mind.

336
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,031
- No, no, no.
What?

337
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,554
What is it?

338
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:35,472
- Okay, I think maybe
Martin is saying that sometimes

339
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:40,129
maybe you make him feel
like he's not enough for you.

340
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,654
Which is none of my business.
I'm so sorry.

341
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:44,655
Shouldn't have said anything.

342
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,049
- No, that's fine, Tabitha.

343
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,224
You're entitled
to your opinion.

344
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,531
I just happen to think
that you are way,

345
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,576
way off base.

346
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,452
- She's right.

347
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,027
- She's out.

348
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:13,510
If you're really
gonna do this...

349
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,773
now's the time.

350
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,303
I think I need to be standing.

351
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:26,393
- What, like an actual surgeon?

352
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:29,091
- What if you
were to hold me up?

353
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,486
It's the only thing
that might work.

354
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,401
- All right.
Here we go.

355
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,619
- Okay.

356
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,099
- Three, two, one.

357
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,104
- All right.
I got you.

358
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,584
I got you.

359
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,151
- Okay.

360
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:48,284
- Well,
this isn't awkward at all.

361
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,720
- If you drop me...

362
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,200
- You'll probably
be in that wheelchair

363
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,202
for the rest of your life.

364
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,648
- Okay, I got what we need.

365
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,649
- Max...
- Yeah?

366
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:06,650
- We need to talk.

367
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,522
- What?
- We need to talk.

368
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,570
- None of this was my idea.

369
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,094
I didn't touch that guard.

370
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,617
I've never hurt
anyone in my life.

371
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,141
Please.

372
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,838
I don't want my daughters
thinking I'm some...

373
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,277
- Okay, um, listen.
We're gonna help you.

374
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,236
But you have to tell us
where the other inmates are.

375
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,411
- If you fix me up,

376
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,109
they're gonna
send me back to Rikers.

377
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,110
- If we don't stop
the bleeding,

378
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,113
you won't be going anywhere.

379
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,421
- It all started when
Fran didn't die from the OD.

380
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,380
They had to figure out
another way.

381
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,512
So Jackie made us
all fight to get us over here.

382
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,774
- Who's Fran?

383
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,254
- I don't even know.

384
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:49,389
Some state's witness who
wanted to snitch on someone.

385
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,433
- That's Reynolds's patient.

386
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,695
- Max, we have to warn him.

387
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,088
- Are you--
- Yeah, no, go.

388
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,568
Hurry.

389
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:00,530
Dominique, this is gonna hurt.

390
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,143
- So when I am scared,

391
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,623
I say the alphabet backwards,
you know?

392
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:10,105
Zed, Y, X, W...

393
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,195
- Hello.
Hello, is anyone in there?

394
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,284
- Don't.

395
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,895
- Can you let me in?

396
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,723
- Protocol is not
to open any doors

397
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,204
until the danger
has been cleared.

398
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,685
- Please, let me in!
There's nowhere else to go!

399
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:25,686
- Vijay.

400
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,557
Don't open it.

401
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,430
- Let me in!

402
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,179
- Did you warn Reynolds?

403
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,528
- No.

404
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:46,663
- Can you walk?

405
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,578
- I don't know.
Why?

406
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,929
- Dr. Goodwin's got a plan.

407
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,454
- Getting you both out of here.

408
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,459
- Note the WBP request.

409
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,332
- Heart rate's a little fast.

410
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,900
Hang another bag
of normal saline.

411
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,294
- Grab a liter bag of normal
saline from the cabinet.

412
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:11,253
- Re-warming agents
in the line.

413
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,604
Oxygenator pressure normal.

414
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,346
One dose.

415
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,480
- Excuse me.

416
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,785
- What's your name?

417
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,446
Oh!

418
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,839
- Someone stop her.

419
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,754
- No, Duke, Duke, Duke!
Get back to the patient.

420
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:34,798
- Call security.
- All right, you heard him.

421
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,365
- We've got
several lacerations.

422
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,540
Get the fluids going wide open.

423
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:38,802
- Multiple stab wounds.

424
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:41,283
Adipose tissue
and obliques involved.

425
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,632
- Boss?
- No arterial spurt.

426
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,808
- You're bleeding.
- Capillary leak only.

427
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,855
Need a fresh suture kit.
Let's go.

428
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:56,080
- You really think that you
can sneak them out of here?

429
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:57,125
- It's the safest way.

430
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,300
- Safest for who?

431
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,128
- How much farther?
- Jackie.

432
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,086
- Don't act like you know me.

433
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,132
- Dominique needs help.
If you just let me take her--

434
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,874
- I don't care about her
or about you, okay?

435
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,397
- So after all the help
that you gave us in Rikers,

436
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,878
after everything,
you were just using us?

437
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,358
- Yeah,
that's show you survive.

438
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,316
Her gang uses me,
I use you,

439
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,361
everyone has a price,

440
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,319
and everything
is for sale, right?

441
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,103
We don't get
the luxury of caring.

442
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,717
Give her your phone.

443
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,284
Come on,
give her your phones right now.

444
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,198
Hand them over.

445
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,983
What do they say?

446
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,027
- Uh, both the same.

447
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,378
"Attack in OR 7.
Patient critical.

448
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:35,903
Request 6 units
of AB plus ASAP."

449
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,165
- That means Suzan
didn't get it done.

450
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,254
Fran's still alive.

451
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,734
We have to go back in.

452
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,083
- Jackie, I can't do this.

453
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,867
- Look, we don't have a choice.
Where's OR 7?

454
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:44,912
- Jackie,
think about this, all right?

455
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,392
The hospital is on lockdown.

456
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,002
That means there will be cops,
guards everywhere.

457
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,220
They will recognize you.

458
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,918
Now, I am willing
to get you out of here,

459
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,746
but there is no way
that I am taking you back

460
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:55,183
to my hospital--
- Take me to OR 7.

461
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,228
Right now.

462
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,754
- I can take you there.

463
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:04,235
I know a way to get you past
the cops and into the OR, but--

464
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,717
but first, I'm gonna need you
to put the gun down.

465
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,071
- Okay.
Start walking.

466
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,859
Come on.

467
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,080
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

468
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,130
- Love, when I look at us,
I don't think that you're...

469
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,959
not enough
or anything like that.

470
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,396
I don't know how to explain it.

471
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,965
- Can you think of an instance
where you felt like that?

472
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,447
Barney.

473
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,405
- The dinosaur?

474
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,277
- No, it was a goat
that we rescued.

475
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:49,455
- And guess where
Barney the goat lived.

476
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:52,849
- He lived in the house
for--for a minute.

477
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:55,504
- And the weird thing
is that...

478
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,811
it was kinda great.

479
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:03,207
He was strangely well mannered,
a great companion for the kids.

480
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:06,863
Iggy adorably dressed him up
as a dog for Halloween.

481
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,212
- Mm.

482
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,344
- Made all his meals,

483
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,128
even found him
this cute little goat bed.

484
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,129
- In the spirit
of full disclosure,

485
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:13,479
it wasn't really a goat bed

486
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:17,483
because they don't
actually make those.

487
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:21,138
- Yeah, but as I watched Iggy
take care of this animal,

488
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,837
I realized...

489
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,143
I'm jealous.

490
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,928
Of a goat.

491
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,495
And I'm not even a jealous guy.

492
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:32,106
It's just,
he looked so happy.

493
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,368
He always does.

494
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,457
When he's helping,
volunteering,

495
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,285
and that is so beautiful.

496
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,982
But I wonder,

497
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,029
do I ever make my husband
look like that?

498
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,423
Am I even capable?

499
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,034
- Martin.

500
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,210
Of course you are.

501
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,299
I...

502
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,998
helping people is just
fundamentally part of who I am.

503
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,131
- And, um, Dr. Frome,

504
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,916
how do you think
that you help Martin?

505
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:05,008
- I, um...

506
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,620
I love him.

507
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,013
With all my heart.

508
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:12,276
- Well, that's...

509
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,365
what I asked...

510
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,585
did you help Martin
tell the kids

511
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,980
that they couldn't keep
the goat as a pet?

512
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,330
- Martin's at home
with the kids, so...

513
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:23,636
- And Martin
had to tell a lawyer

514
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,290
that he can't
take in a needy child.

515
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,990
Do you think
that was maybe painful for him?

516
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,295
- Yeah.

517
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:35,212
- How often do your efforts
to mend hearts

518
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:39,956
wind up with Martin
having to break them?

519
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,958
Martin has asked you
to change your behavior,

520
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,613
and you love him, right?

521
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:50,097
So, I mean, maybe it's not
that you won't stop,

522
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,360
and more that you can't.

523
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,456
Why can't you stop,
Dr. Frome?

524
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,203
- Stop moving.

525
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,161
- Trying to retract
the far edge

526
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,077
to make sure
the omentum is clear of pus.

527
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,514
- In English.

528
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,645
- I can't bend forward.

529
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,952
I need you to move
to the other side.

530
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,910
- But your leg--
- Forget about my leg.

531
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,390
I won't die,
but if you don't do this,

532
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:25,524
then Lenore will.

533
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,221
- You ask me
to monitor your medication,

534
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,657
and then you accuse me
of stealing it.

535
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,137
You ask me to hold you up,

536
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,095
and then a minute later
to drop you.

537
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,575
Do you even care
about getting better?

538
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,622
- Yes, I want to get better
so I can help.

539
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:39,407
Otherwise, what's the point?

540
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,453
Who am I getting better for?

541
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,154
- All right.

542
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,157
I'm gonna set you down.

543
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,028
- Okay.

544
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,395
I think I got it.

545
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,963
I got it.

546
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:18,402
Now we just need
to close her up.

547
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,103
- That's her!
- She has a weapon!

548
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,147
- Freeze!

549
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,279
- Drop the weapon!

550
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,239
- Shot fired, shots fired.
Inmate down.

551
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:31,328
- Ella, we are safe.
The door is locked.

552
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,634
- No, I...

553
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,245
I usually--I usually
feel movement, but I don't.

554
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,117
I put too much
stress on the baby.

555
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,335
What if...

556
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,381
what if I...

557
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:43,384
I can't feel the baby, Vijay.

558
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,082
- All clear.

559
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:53,481
- O2 sat's 98.
Pressure 130/88.

560
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,397
Dopamine at 7.

561
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,485
Flushes are ready.

562
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:00,357
- Dr. Reynolds,
can I help you?

563
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,492
Boss, you okay?
You want me to take over?

564
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,147
- Can I get a sponge count?

565
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,714
We're not hitting
our hemodynamic targets.

566
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,672
- L-sac's steady.

567
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,152
- More irrigation, please.

568
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,676
- BP's dropping.

569
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,374
- There's a pumper
in here somewhere.

570
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,681
- Now we're at 6.

571
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:24,381
- Are you okay?

572
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,177
Retract the lung.

573
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:41,181
There.
There it is.

574
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,748
- Femoral map
is the most accurate.

575
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:49,711
- Pushing 4 milligrams
of fentanyl.

576
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,191
- BP's stabilizing.

577
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,758
- Eluting stent is in place.

578
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,195
Sternal wires
and plates are ready.

579
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:58,198
- Sternum set on the tray.

580
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,200
- Helen, please don't do this.

581
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,723
- Do you trust me?
- It's not about trust.

582
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,159
- It is all about trust.

583
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,119
If we don't have that,
then I truly don't belong here.

584
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,477
- Who's there?
- Helen Sharpe, oncology.

585
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,827
We were helping escort
patients to the evac route,

586
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,350
but she's too critical
to make it.

587
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,136
We need to get her
to the OR at once.

588
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:29,882
This is Dr. Goodwin,

589
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,493
the hospital's
medical director.

590
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,591
- It's all right.
You need to let us through.

591
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,772
- Go ahead.

592
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,395
- How do you feel
when you help someone?

593
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:08,181
- Um...

594
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,052
like I'm here for a reason.

595
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:13,099
- So how do you feel
when you don't?

596
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,363
Everyone in the department
heard about the time

597
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,887
that you gave your shoes
to a homeless man.

598
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:23,674
Well, Imagine that
you just walked by him.

599
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,808
How would you have felt?

600
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,332
- Like a bad person.

601
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,857
And I would've been.
He needed shoes.

602
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,294
That's what you do.

603
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,818
- Well,
a lot of people walked by him.

604
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,428
Are they all bad people?

605
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:40,735
- No.
Not at all.

606
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,737
- So why are you?

607
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:49,091
Can you try and list three
good things about yourself

608
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,789
that have nothing
to do with helping?

609
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,747
Three things that would
be great about yourself

610
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,184
if you never adopt another kid,

611
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:58,231
or rescue another goat.

612
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,022
Okay, how about one thing?

613
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,252
Dr. Frome...

614
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:23,299
what do you think would happen
if you stopped helping people?

615
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:29,044
- They'd see...

616
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,005
- Iggy...

617
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,441
what would they see?

618
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,842
- They would see...

619
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:47,280
what a complete loser I am.

620
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:50,065
Just...

621
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:55,854
corny, nerdy, fat,
worthless, nothing.

622
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,203
Baby--
- No, I--Martin,

623
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:01,250
I know it's not healthy,
and I...

624
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,298
I have this voice in my head,

625
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:08,170
and it's a really loud one.

626
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:14,176
And it's saying...

627
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,224
that one of these days,
you're gonna realize...

628
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,315
That you can do
so much better than me.

629
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:32,194
My ability to help people...

630
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,197
that's all I have.
That's the...

631
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:39,201
that's the only thing
I even like about myself.

632
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:46,382
Without that,
I just can't think of a reason

633
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:49,037
why you would keep me around.

634
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,083
I can't.

635
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,783
- Dr. Frome, I'm gonna ask
Martin to do something now,

636
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,133
and it would great if you
could just sit and listen.

637
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,178
Is that okay?

638
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,789
- Yeah, okay.

639
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:05,097
- Martin,
will you tell your husband

640
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,188
three things that you think
are good about him?

641
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,411
- You're kind.

642
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:19,198
You are a wonderful father.

643
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,939
And you are beautiful.

644
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,421
You're hilarious.
You're patient.

645
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,945
You're smart.

646
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,512
You make friends
everywhere you go

647
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:33,299
'cause they see what I see.

648
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:36,389
You shine.

649
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,304
You're amazing.

650
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,308
You're the love of my life.

651
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,266
And my life is so much better

652
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,007
than I ever
thought it was gonna be

653
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:50,055
because of you, Iggy.

654
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,973
- I love you.

655
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,933
I love you.

656
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,545
If I could've stayed calm,

657
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,112
this wouldn't have happened.

658
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,549
If I were normal,
I could've been a mother.

659
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,987
- You will still be a mother.

660
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,553
A good mother,
a wonderful mother.

661
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,902
- How?

662
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,643
- Because your baby is okay.

663
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,906
- You don't know that.

664
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,299
- Okay.

665
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:20,607
I will listen
to your baby's heartbeats,

666
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,262
and that will tell you.

667
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,046
- Okay.
Do you hear anything?

668
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,267
- You need to slow down
your breathing.

669
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,314
- I can't, I can't.

670
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,490
- You said your OCD
makes you imagine

671
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,667
the worst possible
circumstances.

672
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,235
What if you imagine the best?

673
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,066
Hm? Close your eyes and try.

674
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,590
- Okay.

675
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,027
- What do you see?

676
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,594
- My baby.

677
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:54,119
My healthy baby.

678
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:56,164
- Where are you?

679
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,601
- In New York.

680
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,040
In a cozy nursery.
In a cozy apartment.

681
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,694
It doesn't have to be fancy.
I'm not picky.

682
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:10,526
- You can be picky.
It's your best life.

683
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,053
- Okay, so then
I have a job that I love,

684
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,446
even if I don't know
what that is.

685
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,493
And I can support my family.

686
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,977
And everything's okay.

687
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,068
- I have something
for you to hear.

688
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,005
- Are we getting close?

689
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,399
- Yeah, the OR
is just through these doors.

690
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,488
- Good, okay.

691
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:02,448
- Do you trust me?
- With my life.

692
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,449
- Gun!
- She's got a gun!

693
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,146
- Drop your weapon!

694
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,584
- Drop your gun!

695
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,064
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

696
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,979
- Hands up!

697
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:15,025
- Hands behind you.

698
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,985
- David 1-5,
we've got one in custody.

699
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,335
- Got any more weapons?

700
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:23,033
Let's go.

701
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:35,002
- All right.
- Yeah.

702
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,264
- All right, folks,
it's all over.

703
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,439
Come on in.
let's go.

704
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,311
Come on.

705
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,356
It's all over.
That's right.

706
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:46,448

of a more substantive diagnosis
per the DSM-5.

It's not about what I want.

793
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:16,125
