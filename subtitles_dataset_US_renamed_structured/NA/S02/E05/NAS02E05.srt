1
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:06,093
Hey.

2
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:11,576
Yeah?
Can we get a laugh?

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,579
Come on, Luna.

4
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:17,800
How about a giggle?

5
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:21,151
No? Nothing?

6
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:25,155
- Maybe try your dance moves.

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,158
- You wanna see some moves?

8
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,681
Okay.

9
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,815
Okay, yeah.
- ♪ Oh, whoo!

10
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,165
♪ Say it now!

11
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,080
- ♪ Get up off of that thing

12
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,690
♪ And dance
until you feel better ♪

13
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:41,171
- Oh, yeah.
- ♪ Get up off of that thing

14
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,651
♪ And dance until you,
sing it now! ♪

15
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:45,088
♪ Get up off of that thing

16
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,829
Spin move.

17
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,483
Nothing.

18
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,791
Yeah? Is this--

19
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,576
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,664
That was bad.
I know.

21
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,666
I deserve that.
I deserve that.

22
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,798
- You know she'll laugh
when she's ready.

23
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:02,627
Aww, baby.

24
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,455
You know,
Mommy used to dance--

25
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,241
yeah, not better than Daddy.

26
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,156
She used to float on the air
like this.

27
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,202
She was luminous.

28
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,204
- Stop.

29
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,163
- You were.

30
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:27,739
She was.

31
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:34,181
And this is for you.

32
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,878
- Thanks.
- No.

33
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,619
I'm not just
giving you a dollar.

34
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:41,188
This is also to ensure
doctor-patient confidentiality.

35
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,364
- Okay, but you know my rates

36
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,974
are considerably higher
than that, right?

37
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,715
- Remember I told you that
I am going to be a grandfather?

38
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:47,846
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,500
- I was not supposed
to tell you that.

40
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:51,415
- Why, because it's
the first trimester?

41
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,461
- No, because Ella
may not keep it.

42
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,245
- Uh, what--what?

43
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,204
Okay.

44
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,728
How do you feel about that?

45
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,208
Like--

46
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,426
- Helpless?
- Yes.

47
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,602
- Yeah.
- And I don't like it.

48
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,604
I'm going to talk to her.
- What? No.

49
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,520
No, no, no, no, you can't--
you can't talk to her.

50
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,175
Ella's about to make
a profoundly personal decision,

51
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,350
one that is only hers to make.

52
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:14,830
- Yeah, but--
- Ah-ah, no "buts."

53
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:17,441
No meddling, no prying.

54
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,790
You can't even ask.

55
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,618
- So,

56
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,185
what can I do?

57
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,449
- Whatever you need to do
to not talk to her about it,

58
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,322
you should do that.

59
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,588
- There you are.

60
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,677
- Sorry I didn't call you back.

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,635
It's been a crazy morning.

62
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,897
- Seems like
all your mornings are crazy.

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,205
- How Memorial thought
that they can restructure

64
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,687
their entire legal department
in just two months is...

65
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,559
- Hey, well, in two days,
you get to walk away from it

66
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,301
and I get to have you
back home in my arms

67
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,650
while we plan
our wedding together.

68
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:55,305
- Can't wait.

69
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,307
- Well, sounds like you can.

70
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,396
- No.
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,964
I just really want to leave
the team in good shape,

72
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,661
and we're pretty far from that.

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,448
You've got this.

74
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,234
Babe, I--I gotta go.

75
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,845
- Love you.

76
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,761
- Don't look so worried, Paz.

77
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,285
You're just here
for your routine scan

78
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:21,201
to check on the progress
of your tumor.

79
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,376
Did your sister tell you

80
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,855
how promising
her last PET scan was?

81
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,902
- That's not why she's upset.

82
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,861
Sorry, but you should tell her.
- Paz?

83
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,777
- As you know...

84
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:36,216
when uterine cancer
threw a wrench

85
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,609
into my IVF plan, I mean,

86
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,482
Jasmine stepped up
to be my surrogate.

87
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,702
And she did months of testing
and hormone injections...

88
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,661
- I was going to be implanted
next week.

89
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,272
- But our insurance company
suddenly changed the rule.

90
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,492
Now they won't cover surrogacy
of any kind.

91
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,364
- That's insane.
When did they change the rules?

92
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,844
Three weeks ago, Max.

93
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,368
They basically stopped
covering surrogacy overnight.

94
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,370
- Even though both sisters
are with the same company.

95
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,329
- Barcroft,
who will cover Jasmine

96
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,373
if she wants to have a baby

97
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,070
and Paz if she could
have a baby,

98
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,768
but they won't cover Jasmine if
she wants to have Paz's baby.

99
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,553
I mean, it's not as if Paz's
embryo inside Jasmine's womb

100
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,076
is gonna cost them
any more money.

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,383
- Right, but having no baby
saves them a lot of money.

102
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,298
- Adoption agencies
aren't exactly queuing up

103
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,345
to give kids to women
with cancer, so what now?

104
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,998
I mean, Paz waits three years

105
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,739
to see if her uterus
is still "hospitable"

106
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,001
after all the radiation?

107
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,742
That's her only shot
of becoming a mother?

108
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,919
- Helen, if Barcroft
changed the rule overnight,

109
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:31,401
then let's get them
to change it right back.

110
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,579
- Dr. Ligon isn't back yet?

111
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,668
- Not only is he
still on vacation,

112
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,627
he is also the kind of person
who turns his phone off

113
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,193
while on vacation.

114
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,804
Who does that to an addict?
- Use someone else already.

115
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,719
I heard great things
about Dr. Parsons.

116
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,939
- Seven-year-old
accidental choking victim.

117
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,376
Got caught in window blinds.

118
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,682
Heart rate 118.
BP 110 over 78.

119
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,859
18 respirations per minute.
Setting 98% on nasal cannula.

120
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,034
- Okay, let's get him
to trauma one.

121
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:59,603
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

122
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:00,909
- That's our son.
- Yeah, you can see him

123
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,432
once the doctors get him
stabilized, okay?

124
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,086
But let me show you
where the waiting room...

125
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,609
- It's gonna be okay.

126
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,742
- Hey, hey, come with me.

127
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:11,876
- Sweetie, come on.

128
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,709
- Look straight ahead.

129
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,581
That's it, Calvin.

130
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,104
Good job.

131
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,116
Can you tell me what kind
of blinds you got caught in?

132
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,944
- I don't know.

133
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,390
Let's get Iggy and
Child Services down here now.

134
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,132
- What do you think?
- Let's just hope I'm wrong.

135
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,444
- I was, uh, cooking breakfast.

136
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,969
Calvin was in his room playing,
and it was quiet.

137
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,667
It's never quiet,
so I went to check in on him

138
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,845
and I saw a cord, uh,

139
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,412
wrapped around his little neck.

140
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,415
And I tried to rip it off,

141
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,721
but it was all knotted up,

142
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,854
so I started screaming
for Alana.

143
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:18,987
- I turned the house
upside down

144
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,510
trying to find scissors.

145
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:24,384
By the time I got them,
Calvin was turning blue.

146
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,691
He was thrashing,
so Ethan had to hold him still.

147
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:31,086
You know, I--I was
scared I was gonna cut him.

148
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:34,916
But I got them off
and we called 911.

149
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,833
- Now, if the police were
to come to your home--

150
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,009
- The police?
- Yeah, the police.

151
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,140
If they were to come
to your home, they would see

152
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,794
a piece of cord
lying on the floor

153
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,188
where your wife cut it, right?

154
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:49,713
- You know,
I think I threw it away.

155
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,888
- You threw it away?

156
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,587
- Yes, after we got him loose.

157
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,153
- But the rest of the cord

158
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,069
would still be dangling there,
severed.

159
00:06:58,113 --> 00:06:59,723
That's what the police
would see.

160
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,727
- And--and they would also see

161
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,163
the scissors
lying on the floor.

162
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,730
And the drawers that
Alana looked through,

163
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,428
they would all be open.

164
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,907
And the breakfast
that you were cooking

165
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,040
would still be...

166
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,216
on the stove.

167
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,784
- Th-there were no scissors.

168
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,613
Um, there was no cord.

169
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,486
It was, uh...

170
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,099
Just me.

171
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,753
But I swear,
it'll never happen again.

172
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,103
Please don't--
please don't take him away.

173
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:36,891
- So what are you saying,
that I'm lying?

174
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:40,460
- The marks on Calvin's neck
aren't abrasions.

175
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,592
They're bruises.

176
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:45,465
A cord didn't do it.
Hands did.

177
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,516
It was me.

178
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,866
He was having a tantrum.

179
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,520
I just snapped.

180
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,958
I didn't know I was choking him.
I just wanted him to stop.

181
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,091
- Ethan, I don't think
that your son

182
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:06,921
was choked by a man.

183
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,532
The wounds on his neck
were far too small.

184
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,187
- May I see your hands?

185
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,019
- A person who chokes someone

186
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:21,065
often has defensive wounds
on their hands

187
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,807
from the fingernails
of the person they're choking.

188
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,069
You don't.

189
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,036
- What happened
to your brother, Juliet?

190
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,998
- I wanted his phone,

191
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,261
so I took it.

192
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,484
- Thank you for choosing
Barcroft insurance.

193
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,616
This is Jonathan, how can I
be of service to you today?

194
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:50,834
- Uh, Jonathan, hi.

195
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,533
This is, uh, Dr. Max Goodwin,

196
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:56,187
uh, calling about
a recent policy change.

197
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,886
No, no, I don't need billing.
Operator.

198
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,410
- I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

199
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:02,803
- Operator!

200
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,545
- This is regarding
account number 42118?

201
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,068
- No, it's regarding Paz Aquino.

202
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,461
She's not a number.
She's a person.

203
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,594
I know this is
the wrong department, Frank,

204
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,509
but it seems to be
the only department

205
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,903
populated by people.

206
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,165
- Our call center's
in Bangalore.

207
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,558
- Bangalore, wow.

208
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,690
Uh, is there any way
you could connect me

209
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,084
to someone a little closer
to this side of the Earth?

210
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,869
- Good afternoon.
- Mm, is it?

211
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,524
you don't happen to be located

212
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,527
anywhere in the
Western Hemisphere, do you?

213
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,747
- I'm in Kuala Lumpur.
- Kuala Lumpur.

214
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,139
Um, forgive my ignorance.

215
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,012
Is that closer to New York City
than Bangalore?

216
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:40,101
- Please hold.
Let me check on that.

217
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,625
Happy to.

218
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,630
- How do you think Calvin felt
when you hurt him?

219
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,941
- Well, you know,
if I had to take a guess--

220
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:56,683
which I don't,
but I'm going to--

221
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:00,687
I would say that
he was probably afraid.

222
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,210
- I don't know.

223
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,952
- Hey, I am going
to say a sentence,

224
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,954
and then you tell me
if it describes you.

225
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,520
Can we do that?

226
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:09,696
Okay, cool.

227
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:14,526
"I think that
most other people are stupid."

228
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,224
- I don't think that.

229
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,008
- All right,
what about this one.

230
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,184
"I manipulate people
to get what I want."

231
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,969
- No.

232
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,843
- Juliet, come on.

233
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,497
It's okay.
It's just me and you in here.

234
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,759
Right?

235
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,674
I've seen tons of kids
come through here.

236
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:36,287
It's obvious to me that
you are, like, mega smart.

237
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,550
I'll bet you're the best
at manipulating people.

238
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:42,293
- I'm really good at it.

239
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,686
- Why?

240
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,601
Why do you think
you're so good at it?

241
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,692
- It's--it's kind of like
when I draw.

242
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,999
- You mean manipulating people
makes you feel in control?

243
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,870
- No.

244
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,916
I mean, it's just really easy.

245
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,619
- Mackenzie Adams?
- Yeah, hi.

246
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
- Hi.
- This is my husband, John.

247
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,883
Hi.

248
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,145
- I'm Dr. Reynolds,
cardiothoracic surgery.

249
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,191
- Cardio?

250
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,019
- Uh, we came here because

251
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,674
my wife, uh,
lost control of her bladder.

252
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:15,979
- I'm sure it's just a UTI.

253
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,546
- Well, no.

254
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,982
The urologist said that all of
your tests came back negative,

255
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,680
so cardio's the next step
in the workup.

256
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,985
- Well, my heart is fine.

257
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,857
- Well, heart issues
can affect bladder control,

258
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,728
so we'll just do an EKG to
measure your heart's activity.

259
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,296
- We're not even from New York.
We're just visiting.

260
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,735
- It's a simple test,
Mrs. Adams.

261
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,171
- Colonel Adams.

262
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,304
She's an astronaut.
- Oh.

263
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,959
- I'm scheduled to fly out
on Expedition 64

264
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,264
to the
International Space Station

265
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,223
in 58 weeks.

266
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,747
I've been working toward this
my entire life.

267
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,707
This is my first space mission,

268
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,274
so nothing can be wrong
with my heart.

269
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,072
Uh, what are you doing?

270
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,769
- Mm.

271
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,858
- Earth to Vijay.

272
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,774
- I am meditating.

273
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:14,603
- Okay.
Why?

274
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,040
- To control
the chaos in my mind.

275
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,173
Because I cannot
talk to someone

276
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:22,829
I desperately want to talk to.

277
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,395
- Well, that sounds
completely pointless,

278
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,788
but you know what?

279
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:28,095
I am desperate,
so I'm gonna give it a go.

280
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,662
Come on, help me up here.

281
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,801
- Okay, now fold your legs.
Sorry.

282
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:41,761
Close your eyes and breathe.

283
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,724
- I'm sorry, do you have
to breathe so loud?

284
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,291
- Mm!

285
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,126
- Hello, this is Aneel.

286
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,085
- Aneel Jay who works
in the East 34th offices

287
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,260
of Barcroft Insurance?

288
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,696
- Uh, yes.

289
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,785
- Who works
in the appeals department

290
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:06,829
on the seventh floor?

291
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,352
- Can I help you
with something?

292
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,180
- Yeah, uh, could you remind me
of your office number?

293
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,227
- 728.
What is this regarding?

294
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,098
Hold on.
Yeah?

295
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,361
- Hey, it's regarding the
extremely impersonal practice

296
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,146
of trying to help someone
over the phone.

297
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,843
I just think nothing
really gets done

298
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,149
until you sit down with someone
face to face.

299
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,715
You know what I mean?

300
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,282
- I was just leaving for lunch.
- Were you?

301
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,849
I know a great place.

302
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,112
The honey yogurt's really good
if you want to try it.

303
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,028
- Look, it was
an abrupt change, I know,

304
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,856
but last year,
Barcroft hemorrhaged

305
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,859
an unprecedented $80 million
in surrogacy coverage.

306
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:40,080
- Sure, but how many babies did
you help bring into the world?

307
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,211
- We don't track
that kind of data.

308
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,909
- Mm.

309
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,215
That's why I brought you here.

310
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,261
Your company gives you data.

311
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,176
You get case numbers
instead of stories.

312
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:53,397
You get account numbers
instead of people.

313
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,012
- What is this?

314
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,058
- This is account number 42118.

315
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,844
- Her name is Paz Aquino.

316
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,760
- Excuse me.

317
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,723
- Hey, Aneel?

318
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,377
- And people say
insurance companies are cruel?

319
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,467
- I'm just trying to show you--
- Human suffering?

320
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,903
Thanks,

321
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,384
but I hear heartbreaking
stories every day.

322
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,777
Along with the carpal tunnel
and the crappy paycheck,

323
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:27,214
it comes with the job.

324
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,911
- Then why don't you help me
do something about it?

325
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:30,739
- I may have a title
that sounds effectual,

326
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:33,394
but I have absolutely no power.

327
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:36,223
I can't help you do anything.

328
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,798
- "I think that tears
are a sign of weakness."

329
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,322
- Agree.

330
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:51,803
- "I think that other people's
feelings are not important."

331
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:52,979
- Agree.

332
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,071
- "I think about
hurting my family."

333
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,768
- Agree.

334
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,773
- Just your brother?

335
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,818
Who else?

336
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,082
- My mom and dad.

337
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,561
- Why do you want to hurt them?

338
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,957
- Because I can.

339
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,055
- You know, I mean, it's early,

340
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,537
and one session
is a small sample, but, uh,

341
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,453
Juliet does present
as callous-unemotional.

342
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,109
- You're saying
she's a psychopath.

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
- She's been to dozens
of doctors.

344
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,032
We've heard schizophrenia,
ADHD, RAD.

345
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,730
No one's ever said "psychopath."

346
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,862
- Callous-unemotional.

347
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,473
It's, um--it's not a diagnosis

348
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,170
that doctors really
like to give because,

349
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,433
historically speaking,

350
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,827
there is no cure.

351
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,134
- Then what do we do?
- Well...

352
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,701
- She'll go into
an inpatient facility

353
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,748
run by
the corrections department.

354
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,707
- Jail?
She's 11.

355
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,233
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
There is one other possibility.

356
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:17,759
Um, punishment bounces off
of callous-unemotional kids

357
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,022
because they can't feel shame,

358
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,807
but there has been some very
promising behavioral therapy

359
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,984
based on a reward system.

360
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,942
I'm sure you've noticed
Juliet's reward drive

361
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,248
is extremely high.

362
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,120
That's why she takes
whatever she wants.

363
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:35,255
So if I can demonstrate
some progress with Juliet,

364
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,039
we can admit her here.

365
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,302
She could be an inpatient
at New Amsterdam.

366
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:43,089
- Dr. Frome?
- Yeah.

367
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:46,266
- Have you ever had success
with a child like Juliet?

368
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,143
- No.

369
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,200
- You okay?

370
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,420
- Sex.

371
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:14,381
I just replaced pills with sex.

372
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,948
I would say that
I make the worst decisions,

373
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,167
but you know what?

374
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,908
I'm not even sure
that I make decisions.

375
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,214
I just do things.

376
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,433
- Why is that bad?

377
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,262
If all of your instincts
tell you to do something,

378
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,785
why shouldn't you do that?

379
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,049
My instincts told me

380
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,922
to bang my physical therapist,
and it is not going well.

381
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,142
I thought I was
distracting myself

382
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:39,101
from the pain,
but you know, actually,

383
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,931
I think I was distracting
myself from being sober.

384
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,456
You know what?
Enough is enough.

385
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,286
God, it is time
to face reality--

386
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,289
to stop avoiding
and start making decisions

387
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,248
that are actually good for me,

388
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,120
like go to an NA meeting.

389
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:02,298
- You just got
all of that from meditating?

390
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,126
- Yeah.

391
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,954
That is how it works, right?

392
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,964
Yeah?

393
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,444
No.

394
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,360
- Not here to harass you.
I'm just here to apologize.

395
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:23,145
- You are?
- Yes.

396
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,322
And to find out
what office your boss is in.

397
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,629
- You can't be serious.
- Face to face.

398
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,500
It's gotta be worth something.

399
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,894
- Tenth floor, 1021.
- 1021?

400
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,548
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

401
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,334
So at New Amsterdam,
we run into

402
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,250
arcane policy inconsistencies
all the time.

403
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,513
For example, Frances--
may I call you Frances?

404
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,472
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Okay, sure.

405
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:49,389
For example, there is
a very expensive spinal surgery

406
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,173
that is covered
by your base policy,

407
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,916
yet there is another procedure
that is less expensive

408
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:58,180
and less invasive that is not.

409
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,400
And that means that
Barcroft is, in turn,

410
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:03,533
shelling out more money
than it has to.

411
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,188
My patient, Paz Aquino--
- Account number?

412
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,191
- It's 42118.

413
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,065
- Her claim was denied

414
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,372
because Barcroft
no longer covers surrogacy.

415
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,374
- So I've heard,
but Barcroft will cover

416
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,071
a uterus transplant for her,

417
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,379
which is a procedure
that will cost ten times more.

418
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,207
So, uh,
I guess what I'm saying is,

419
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,645
if Barcroft doesn't want to
reverse its policy on surrogacy,

420
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,257
then I am gonna have
to advise all of my patients

421
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,216
to consider
uterine transplants instead.

422
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,262
And how do you think that's
gonna affect your bottom line?

423
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,698
- That's a good point.

424
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,962
Maybe we should stop covering
uterine transplants

425
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,398
starting now.

426
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,533
Hm.

427
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:49,231
- No, it is not covered--
- Hi, so sorry.

428
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,538
Can you tell me who her boss is?

429
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,977
- You have a condition called
supraventricular tachycardia.

430
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,284
It's an atypically fast
heartbeat that develops when

431
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,243
the heart's normal electrical
impulses are disrupted,

432
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,550
and the frequency
of the palpitations

433
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,116
forced your kidneys
into overdrive,

434
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,466
which overwhelmed your bladder.

435
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,945
- How do we fix it?

436
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,991
- Well, I can do
a catheter ablation.

437
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,297
It'll destroy the source
of the problem.

438
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,428
It's non-surgical.

439
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,603
You won't even have
to be put under.

440
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,388
- NASA has run
hundreds of tests on me.

441
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,128
How did they miss this?

442
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,130
- It might be the first time
it happened.

443
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:20,610
- Will it happen again?

444
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,264
- It's hard to tell.
It might.

445
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,439
- It won't.

446
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,702
We came here last-minute
for family.

447
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:28,575
I just need to get back
to Houston, back to training.

448
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,054
- Mack.

449
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,274
- NASA said I'm fine,
so I'm fine.

450
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,148
- Um, Mackenzie,

451
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:41,152
the attack you had today
probably lasted a few seconds,

452
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:44,199
but a serious one
could last a few minutes,

453
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,288
maybe even hours.

454
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,768
And instead of losing control
of your bladder,

455
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:50,336
you could lose consciousness.

456
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,555
If that happens
while you're in space,

457
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,210
your whole mission
could be compromised.

458
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,473
You could risk the lives
of your crew.

459
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,519
- I would never do that.

460
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,651
- Then don't walk out of here.

461
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,396
- If I do this procedure,
will I still be cleared to fly?

462
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,789
- If it's successful,

463
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,313
this will take care
of the problem permanently.

464
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,706
After a period of observation,

465
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,360
I don't see a reason why
you'd be grounded.

466
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,755
- You got this.

467
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,761
- Paz, I have your scan results

468
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,633
from this morning.

469
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,418
Your tumor has stopped
responding to the chemo.

470
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,075
To prevent it from spreading,

471
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,295
you'll need to have
a full hysterectomy.

472
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,517
Once we remove the cancer
from your body,

473
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:45,608
you will enter remission faster
and you will survive.

474
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,393
- But...

475
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:53,573
Then there--there's no way....

476
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,618
I'm never gonna have a baby.

477
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,142
- Hey, look at me.

478
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,709
We will find a way.

479
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,370
Sorry.

480
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:11,373
I know that there are more
important things than--

481
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,334
but I always dreamed
of having a child.

482
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,248
Yeah, I know that sounds
old-fashioned and--

483
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,815
- No, no, no.

484
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,340
No, it doesn't.

485
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,385
It sounds human.

486
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,177
- Okay, let's play a game.

487
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,484
I will set a task,

488
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:38,748
and if you complete it,
you win.

489
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,489
- What do I win?

490
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,665
- I am gonna give you

491
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,407
Iggy Bucks.

492
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,149
- Those look lame.
- Well, I'm not done.

493
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:51,500
Iggy Bucks are how you get
to the real prize.

494
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:55,548
50 of these earns one hour

495
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,246
with this bad boy.

496
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,900
All right?

497
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:02,903
It just so happens that
this first task can earn you

498
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:06,515
all 50 Iggy Bucks in one go.

499
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,648
- What's the task?

500
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:10,432
- You apologize to your brother.

501
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,825
- No.

502
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,435
- Why not?

503
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,742
- He deserved it.

504
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,657
- Juliet, I know that
you don't feel sorry,

505
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,443
and I know that you may
never feel sorry,

506
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,533
but hurting Calvin
was a big deal.

507
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,666
And a big deal
means a big apology,

508
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:30,800
but it also means
a big reward.

509
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,151
You in?

510
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:38,460
- If a big apology
means a big reward...

511
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:41,158
what about a small apology?

512
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,465
- Yeah, sure, okay.

513
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,641
We'll start small.

514
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:48,470
One small apology,
10 Iggy Bucks.

515
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,388
- What's that?

516
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,870
- Oh, um, that's something
that one of my kids made me.

517
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,310
- It's ugly.
Is your kid stupid?

518
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,837
I'm--I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

519
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,753
Small apology.
10 bucks.

520
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:15,584
- Oh, okay.
Um, that is not--wow.

521
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:18,500
I--I didn't, um--
- Okay, golly gee.

522
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,328
Wow, hoop-dee-doo.

523
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:24,506
- Is that supposed to be me?

524
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,943
- I'm so sorry.

525
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,728
20 bucks.

526
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:32,296
- All right, I didn't say
that I was playing.

527
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,516
- You never said
you weren't, Fat Face.

528
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,518
Were you fat as a kid?

529
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,607
Did other kids make fun of you
because you were fat?

530
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,392
I'm so sorry.
30 bucks.

531
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,525
- Okay, Juliet, why don't we
go over the rules of the game--

532
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,396
- You sweat.
You're sweaty.

533
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,833
You have sweat stains
under your arms.

534
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,269
That's gross.
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,488
40 bucks.

536
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,402
- Okay, I'm not playing.

537
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:52,795
I--

538
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:03,023
Dr. Frome,

539
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,764
I'm really sorry.

540
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:10,552
50 bucks.
I win.

541
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,347
- Okay, take it easy, man.
I'm just trying to help out.

542
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,045
Aneel? Aneel?
- Come on.

543
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,568
- Hey, this is my friend Aneel.
He's gonna explain everything.

544
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:27,787
Could you explain to them that
we're just trying...

545
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,266
- Come on.
- To help people?

546
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,354
That we're trying
to do the right thing?

547
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,400
Aneel?

548
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:33,706
- Ella?

549
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,799
I have been trying to fight
my instinct the whole day

550
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,715
and I have finally decided
to come to you.

551
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,720
For a cup of coffee.

552
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:50,505
- Coffee.

553
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,986
- I do not want to discuss
your personal matters,

554
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,989
but I...

555
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,513
I do want...

556
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,690
Yes, I do want cream and sugar.

557
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,387
Okay.

558
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,389
- I do not want to pry, meddle,

559
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,915
or counsel you in any way.

560
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,570
So from now on,
for my cup of coffee,

561
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,398
I will go
to the other coffee shop

562
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:19,490
so no unintentional or
misconstrued advice slips out.

563
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:22,232
But for now...

564
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:25,279
I do want a croissant.

565
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,412
No.

566
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,936
Chocolate one, please.

567
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,864
- Dr. Bloom.

568
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,561
Dr. Ligon is back tomorrow

569
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,997
and can see you
at the usual time.

570
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,260
- No, actually, I would like
to book an appointment

571
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,393
with Dr. Parsons
for tomorrow morning.

572
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,917
- Mm, Dr. Parsons'
all booked up tomorrow morning,

573
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,571
but Dr. Ligon is free.

574
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,051
- What about tomorrow afternoon?

575
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:02,446
- Dr. Ligon
has an opening at noon.

576
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,318
- Parsons.

577
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:08,757
- I'll squeeze you right in.

578
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,933
- Thank you.

579
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:16,896
- I see the aberrant pathway.

580
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,028
Hmm.

581
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,727
Well, there's a second pathway.

582
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,685
- What does that mean?

583
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,687
- All right, if do more
than one ablation,

584
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,907
it could weaken your heart

585
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,387
and increase the chance
of recurrence.

586
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,478
- I'm sorry, Mackenzie.
You need surgery.

587
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,003
- That will ground me.

588
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:40,484
- Well, so will a fragile heart.

589
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:47,013
When I was little,
I used to sneak out of the house

590
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,711
when everyone was asleep.

591
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:53,672
I would lie in the yard
and feel the dark all around me,

592
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:58,589
and I would look up
at the stars and I knew...

593
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,940
that someday,
I would be up there with them.

594
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,902
I really
thought I would get there.

595
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,387
All right, I don't like it,

596
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,520
but I can do two ablations.

597
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,872
It will destroy
all the damage, but...

598
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,787
after the procedure,
you have to let me

599
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,919
put your heart through
a stress test.

600
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:26,443
- Is that dangerous?

601
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,359
- Well, if the ablations
are insufficient,

602
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,840
it could push Mackenzie
into cardiac arrest.

603
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,846
You could die.
- I won't.

604
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,023
I won't.

605
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,599
- So, Mackenzie's resting.

606
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,775
We'll do the stress test
in the morning.

607
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,038
Thank you.

608
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,783
- Can I ask you something?

609
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:04,873
- How can I be
married to someone

610
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,747
who loves space
more than she loves me?

611
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,098
- Well, I wasn't gonna
put it like that.

612
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,969
- I love Mackenzie

613
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:17,494
the way she loves the stars.

614
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:21,542
She loves me more
than anything on Earth.

615
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:24,066
Can't ask for more than that.

616
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,807
- Could ask her to stay.

617
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,505
- Uh, you think
John Glenn's wife

618
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,072
ever asked him to stay?

619
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,509
- I wouldn't blame her
if she had.

620
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:38,167
You know what
the Kármán line is?

621
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,867
It's the boundary
where Earth ends

622
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,608
and space begins.

623
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,176
Loving Mack means

624
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,876
helping her cross that line,

625
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,793
even if she's leaving me
on the other side of it.

626
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,203
- I really thought
that face to face...

627
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,816
How could they say no?

628
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,739
- But it's so unfair.

629
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,132
- Yeah.

630
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:33,614
- I mean, even without
the financial issues,

631
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,008
IVF is--

632
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,837
it's so fraught.

633
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,711
It's just so filled with hope
and with...

634
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:46,540
despair, and--

635
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,803
and blame.

636
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,939
- Helen?

637
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:56,767
Did you...

638
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:03,035
- After the accident,

639
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,299
everything just seemed so....

640
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,866
fragile.

641
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,829
I don't really know
what I was waiting for.

642
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,961
It's what I've always wanted,

643
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:20,139
so I just went
and I made it happen.

644
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,793
And the minute that I did it,

645
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:26,885
I knew that I'd made a mistake.

646
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,714
Because I want to be a mum,

647
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,979
but I realized that
I don't want to do it alone.

648
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,987
And luckily, it didn't take.

649
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:48,254
- We can't let Paz lose.

650
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,695
- Juliet, grab a seat.

651
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:58,829
So, you were really
very good at my game.

652
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,353
- Your game was easy.

653
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:03,356
- Yeah, you kicked my butt good.

654
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,271
But I'm not so sure

655
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,969
if you're ready
for the harder version.

656
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,058
Expert level.

657
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:12,191
- I'm great at games.
- You are.

658
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,976
Yeah, you're great at games
because you like winning,

659
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,283
but also because

660
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:20,286
you like making
other people lose.

661
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,244
You made me lose emotionally.

662
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,768
You made Calvin lose physically.

663
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:28,903
Whenever you win,
someone else has to lose.

664
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,731
- That's how winning works.

665
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:33,777
- Yes, but not in expert level.

666
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,258
In expert level,
you have to win

667
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:39,348
without the other person
ever knowing that they lost.

668
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:43,874
You make somebody angry,
you upset them, that's it.

669
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,702
Game over.

670
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:48,270
You lose.

671
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,707
- What do I get if I win?

672
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,234
- Calvin's phone.

673
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,979
- So...

674
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,633
when do we start?

675
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,244
- Right now.

676
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,164
- All right, Mackenzie,

677
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:14,949
I'm going to inject your IV
with enough adrenaline

678
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,734
to simulate
the stress of launch

679
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:20,041
and reentry, all right?

680
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,697
Now, it's going to be
extremely intense, all right?

681
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,177
It's gonna feel like
your heart's pounding

682
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,962
right out of your chest,
but the first sign of trouble,

683
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,313
I'm gonna stop the test
and intervene.

684
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,141
Okay.

685
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,802
- Now, the target
is 195 beats per minute.

686
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,806
If you can achieve that
without any cardiac event,

687
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,982
you should be clear to fly.

688
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,248
Ready when you are.

689
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,006
Faster.

690
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,312
Breathe.

691
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:44,082
Mackenzie? Mackenzie?

692
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,086
- Come on back.

693
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,010
- Congratulations.
You passed.

694
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:01,708
You did it.

695
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,971
You did it.

696
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,929
- We did it?

697
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,939
Oh...

698
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,162
- Hey, sweetie.

699
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,512
- Hey, Dad.

700
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,993
Hey, Cal.

701
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,430
Hey.

702
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:31,825
- I'm sorry I hurt you

703
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:35,176
for a stupid phone.

704
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,094
I really didn't mean to...

705
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,140
and I'm...

706
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,404
really sorry.

707
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,928
- Okay.

708
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,280
- Can I--can I play
with your phone?

709
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,413
- I'm not done.

710
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,328
- But I apologized.

711
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,859
Here.
Trade.

712
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:07,208
- No.
- I want it.

713
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,949
I apologized.
- Juliet--

714
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,255
- I think we're done here.
- I want it!

715
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,257
I want it!
I want it! I want it!

716
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,347
Shh.

717
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:24,356
I don't know why
I get so angry,

718
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,009
and I wish I did,
because everyone thinks

719
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,229
I don't care about anyone,
but I do!

720
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,970
I care about you.

721
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:32,538
And I want your phone because
when we play the same games,

722
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,845
that's the only way
I know how to be close to you.

723
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:41,851
- I thought you hated me.

724
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,550
- I hate that I'm...

725
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:46,987
different from you.

726
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,393
Thank you.

727
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,405
- You call that progress?
That was terrifying.

728
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:15,842
She manipulated them.
- Okay, yeah.

729
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,496
I mean, I'll give you
that it wasn't exactly

730
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,280
a Hallmark moment, but come on.

731
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,456
We all operate on
a reward system of some kind.

732
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,110
You know, you do good in school,
you get good grades,

733
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,372
your parents buy you a car.

734
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,461
You hold down a job
and you get money.

735
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:29,029
We'll spend the next few years
shifting Juliet's prizes

736
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,205
from phones to real-world things
and then who knows?

737
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,468
If she can learn to always
play on expert level,

738
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:35,644
maybe she'll win the big prize--
a normal life.

739
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,559
- But...

740
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:40,083
there will always be something
missing with her.

741
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,911
- Yes, empathy.

742
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:46,264
She'll never have it,
so we have to have it for her.

743
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,399
- Thank you for choosing
Marcos Insurance.

744
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:52,661
This is Melissa.

745
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,010
How can I be of service
to you today?

746
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:56,317
- Hi, Melissa,
I'm just calling to see

747
00:37:56,361 --> 00:38:00,147
if your company provides
coverage for surrogacy.

748
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,366
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.

749
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,063
Unfortunately,
Marcos Insurance

750
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:04,499
does not cover surrogacy
of any--

751
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:11,289
- I wanted to be a doctor.

752
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,075
- You did?

753
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:17,425
- I did a year of med school,

754
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,514
but I couldn't cut it,

755
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:23,083
and I've spent
the last ten years

756
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,215
kind of numb

757
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,348
because instead
of helping people,

758
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,394
I ended up doing
the exact opposite.

759
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,964
Until today.

760
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,363
- Trustee exemption?

761
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,625
- Anyone on
the board of trustees

762
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,279
can override a policy claim

763
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,629
without changing
the policy itself.

764
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,675
- Then you found a trustee

765
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,330
and got them to make
an exception for 42118?

766
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,070
- No.

767
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:57,335
I got them to make an exception
for Paz Aquino.

768
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,467
She and her sister
can proceed with IVF.

769
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,602
- Aneel?
- No.

770
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,431
- Yeah.
- Okay.

771
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,041
- How did you pull this off?

772
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:11,174
- I talked to someone
at the top, face to face.

773
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,743
- Yes.

774
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,615
Thank you.

775
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:25,145

776

There's still a ton to do,

784
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,488
before landing
in New York, but--

785
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,707

I would like to talk to you.

798
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,365
- Ella.

799
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,247
- Whatever you decide...

800
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:11,381
We will always be family.

801
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,829
- Oh, Max.

802
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:27,441
Join me to celebrate
Paz and Jasmine.

803
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,877
- Yeah, well, I would love to,

804
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,836
but we actually, uh,
already ordered bottle service.

805
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,533
So, think we're good.

806
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,143
Oh.

807
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:37,799
Luna...

808
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:40,498
Was that your first laugh?

809
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,674
Oh, my God.
We gotta show Mommy that laugh.

810
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:48,897
I didn't mean to--

811
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:51,596
- No, of course.
- Think things come out, uh--

812
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,380
- I know.

813
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:56,644
- We have a, uh,
picture of Georgia

814
00:41:56,688 --> 00:42:01,301
that we talk to sometimes.

815
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:04,347
- You don't have to explain.

816
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:11,441
- That was her
saying good night.

817
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:13,313
Okay.
