1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,832
- Hi, there.
It's me, Ryan Eggold.

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:09,270
I play Dr. Max Goodwin
on "New Amsterdam."

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,489
We are very proud to bring you
our season two finale.

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,100
It's a good one.

5
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,492
But first, I want to take
a moment

6
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,494
to thank all the healthcare
professionals

7
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:19,323
who right now are working
their buns off

8
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,238
to keep everyone safe.

9
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:24,198
You guys are our inspiration
for every story

10
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,373
we tell every episode we make,

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,070
and now you are everyone's
inspiration,

12
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:30,465
so thank you, and keep up
the heroic work

13
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:31,596
that you are doing.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,511
We all dearly appreciate it.

15
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:37,298
It's because of that admiration
and a sense of caution

16
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,344
that we decided not to air
tonight's

17
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,172
originally scheduled episode,

18
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,479
which was titled "Pandemic."

19
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,133
It hit a little too close
to home,

20
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:48,091
and we didn't want to make
entertainment

21
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,527
out of a story that's
a little too scary,

22
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,182
a little too real
at the moment.

23
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,401
But we're gonna show you
that episode later

24
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,576
once some time has passed.

25
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,360
But the good news is

26
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,101
that we're gonna show you
a little teaser

27
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,190
from that episode

28
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,845
because it introduces

29
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,412
one of our newest characters

30
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,414
played by the incomparable

31
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,851
Mr. Daniel Dae Kim,

32
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,202
who I would like to hand it to
right now.

33
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,421
- Thanks, Ryan.

34
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,379
And aloha, everybody.

35
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,903
Ryan is absolutely right.

36
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,296
The storyline you're about
to see

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,125
introduces my character,
Dr. Cassian Shin.

38
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,561
Now what we've done is pulled
together

39
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,128
all of Cassian's scenes

40
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,477
to give you a sense of his
character

41
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,218
and how he's gonna change
more than a few things

42
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:29,567
around the hospital.

43
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,874
As you guys may know,
this storyline

44
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,441
turned out to be very personal
to me

45
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,618
because I ended up contracted
COVID-19,

46
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,228
the disease caused by
coronavirus,

47
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,275
while I was in New York
shooting this very episode.

48
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,928
Now, thankfully, I was
fortunate enough

49
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,627
to have experienced
a full recovery.

50
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,585
But too many others have not.

51
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,674
So on behalf of the entire
casting crew,

52
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,329
we'd like to dedicate
this season finale

53
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,462
to those still fighting
the illness.

54
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,290
We're rooting for you.

55
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,901
- How can I help?

56
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,337
- We're down two
trauma surgeons.

57
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,166
I had to call in our new hire
a week early.

58
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,603
- You sure that they're
ready for this?

59
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,301
- No.

60
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,216
That's why I need you
to help him through it.

61
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,179
- Dr. Shim?
- Hang on.

62
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,964
Yes.

63
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,184
- Hi, I'm Dr. Helen Sharpe,
Deputy Medical Director.

64
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,533
We really appreciate you
starting early.

65
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,492
- Yeah, Max said almost
half your staff was down.

66
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,320
- And our patient load
has almost tripled.

67
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,930
- Any recent traumas?
- Thankfully, no.

68
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,627
But I need to get you
to the ED straightaway.

69
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,238
- Which way is the men's
locker room?

70
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,282
- Uh, it's back that way.

71
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,979
There's a bathroom
just along here.

72
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,504
- I need a hot shower.
- And we do need you in ED.

73
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,680
- Yeah, but I need
that shower more.

74
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:49,212
The hospital's in the middle
of a crisis.

75
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,649
- I know--the dispenser
was out of body wash.

76
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,216
- This is your new pager.

77
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,652
As you can see,
it's being paged,

78
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,393
so maybe it's time to wrap up
this beauty routine

79
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,482
and join me in the ED.

80
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,310
- How about I put on
some pants first?

81
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:04,793
- This is Casey,
our head nurse.

82
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,534
Casey, this is Dr. Shin,
our new trauma surgeon.

83
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,275
- Oh, thank God.
Follow me.

84
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,406
I got a kid who appears
to have swallowed

85
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,842
some rare earth magnets.

86
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,541
- Ah, that's a surefire way
to get attention, huh?

87
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,412
Hi, I'm Dr. Shin.

88
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,589
Casey, do you know the risks

89
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,374
when adjusting multiple
magnets?

90
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,290
- Uh, if the magnets
were to connect internally,

91
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,682
they could twist
the intestines,

92
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,249
force hemorrhages,

93
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,729
intussusception.

94
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:31,341
- Even a strangulated bowel.
- They can also do this.

95
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,518
Cool, right?

96
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,694
But you only swallowed
one magnet, didn't you?

97
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,000
- Mm.

98
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,350
- So that should pass
in a few hours.

99
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,352
Turns out you don't need me.

100
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,267
- Uh, in case you haven't
noticed,

101
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,617
we have a full ED of patients
who need your help.

102
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,705
Where do you think
you're going?

103
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,316
- I always show up
when I'm paged,

104
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,753
but I only stay
when I'm needed.

105
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,326
- Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.

106
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,805
Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.

107
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,504
- Should I go
for the energy drink

108
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:04,722
or the protein bar?

109
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,463
- Why would you need energy?

110
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,378
You seem intent on doing
virtually nothing.

111
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,599
- So you vote protein bar.

112
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,078
- I know that trauma surgeons

113
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,080
like to play the aloof
cowboy, but that's not--

114
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,604
- That's not how
you do things here.

115
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,432
- No, yes, it's not.
- I know.

116
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,607
Don't you think I researched
this place

117
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,825
before I took the job?

118
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,088
- Then you should also know
Max's motto.

119
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:26,353
- "How can I help?"
Yeah, that's catchy.

120
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,703
- It's words that we live by.
Everybody chips in.

121
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,271
Everybody helps.
- Right now I am helping.

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,362
By eating a protein bar.

123
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,103
Hm. Duty calls.

124
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,453
Well, maybe.

125
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,634
So what you got?

126
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,636
- Lucas Jarvis.
Nail gun mishap.

127
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,333
- It slipped.

128
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,769
- Well, Mr. Jarvis,
you're very lucky.

129
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,336
- This is lucky?

130
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,772
- Well, the fact that your new
nail appendage

131
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,644
missed the bone in every one
of your fingers is.

132
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,559
You know what?

133
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,125
- Don't you dare.

134
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,736
- I'm thinking Dr...
- Turan.

135
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,085
- Dr. Turan here gets
to practice

136
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,129
her nail extraction skills.

137
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,653
- Now, a little numbing agent

138
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,350
and some gentle retrograde
pressure,

139
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:08,438
and that sucker should
come right out.

140
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,744
- Dr. Shin--
- You got this?

141
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,354
- Yeah.

142
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,790
- Dr. Shin!
- Mm?

143
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,139
- Where are you going?

144
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:15,837
- Nap time.

145
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,538
I don't want to hear it.
My friend is sick,

146
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,757
another is gone,
this hospital is slammed,

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,541
and I'm gonna need you
to be a team player

148
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,716
for once,
do you understand?

149
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,848
- I'm always a team player.

150
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,458
Kit Brower, 25.

151
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:29,677
Multiple lacs
from a large explosion

152
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,765
at his home.

153
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,680
- What exploded?
What's that smell?

154
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,116
- I make beer.

155
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,857
My fermenting vat--

156
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,511
- Book an OR right now.

157
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,123
Grab a side.

158
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,430
Nurse, I need two units
of O-neg on a bear-hugger.

159
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,432
- Hold on, the entire wing
is contaminated.

160
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,478
No more surgeries until we can
disinfect every OR.

161
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,784
Hey, welcome to New Amsterdam.

162
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:52,134
- Oh, yeah.
Great place.

163
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,744
But look, he needs surgery
right now.

164
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,487
How about an ICU?
- Attendant's in quarantine.

165
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,489
- I got a place in mind.
We got to turn around.

166
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,534
Thanks.

167
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:06,931
- You guys need something here?

168
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,455
- Yeah, we're commandeering
your rig.

169
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:09,804
Help me get him in.
- Wait, where are we going?

170
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,458
- Nowhere--we're doing
the surgery right here.

171
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,503
Grab an OR tray and any
supplies you need.

172
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,203
You in?

173
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,476
This is trouble.

174
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,868
When the glass tank exploded,

175
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,522
it blew apart
the housing cabinet,

176
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,960
pieces of which are all over
Kip's abdomen.

177
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,701
- If wood doesn't show up
on an X-ray.

178
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,487
how are we gonna find
all the splinters?

179
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,532
- BP's dropping.

180
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,534
- Turn off all the lights
and cover all the windows.

181
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,451
Now, flip that switch
to your right.

182
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:53,674
Certain types of hardwood
turn fluorescent in blacklight.

183
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:54,805
This ambulance has a UV light

184
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,503
to keep infection
under control.

185
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:57,721
Are you just gonna sit there?

186
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,768
Everybody chips in,
everybody helps, right?

187
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,730
Ready to drive now?

188
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,864
- You know, when I saw
the shards of wood,

189
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,692
I honestly didn't think
he was gonna make it.

190
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,565
- What are you saying?

191
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,958
- I'm saying...

192
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,223
Just what I said.

193
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,833
- Oh, okay.

194
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,488
'Cause, you know, that kinda
sounded like a compliment.

195
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,273
- Would you like a gold star
on your report card?

196
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,927
No.

197
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,276
But if you're gonna
compliment me,

198
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,800
it should sound
like a compliment.

199
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,845
- It was implied.

200
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,239
Despite the fact that you took
a job in a public hospital

201
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,675
and then refused to help.

202
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,549
I didn't take the job
to help out everyone.

203
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,987
I took the job
to save trauma victims.

204
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,250
If a patient who needs
a trauma surgeon rolls up,

205
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,557
I need to be
at the top of my game.

206
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,559
And that may require
a shower or a nap

207
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,517
or a protein bar,

208
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,824
but whatever it takes,
I'm gonna do it,

209
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,043
because I need to be ready.

210
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,742
Self-care saves lives.

211
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,702
Might not be the New Amsterdam
way, but...

212
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,877
it's my way.

213
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,490
What?

214
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,930
- Nothing, um...

215
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,802
that makes perfect sense.

216
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,717
- But?

217
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,721
- But I save lives
every day too.

218
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,070
And without naps.

219
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,314
- It was totally packed.
I mean, every seat was taken,

220
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,751
but I desperately wanted
the aisle.

221
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:56,710
- So I swapped with her

222
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,755
and endured the horrific middle
seat like a proper gentleman.

223
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,019
- And the rest as they say
is history.

224
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,067
So how 'bout you?
How'd you two meet?

225
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,942
- Uh, that is a very
funny story actually,

226
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,076
because I work for the, uh,
Yankees.

227
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,862
- Don't be modest, babe.

228
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,995
He's the general manager.

229
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,911
And I, believe it or not--
I worked for the Mets.

230
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,042
- The Mets.

231
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,087
And she's
their general manager.

232
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,871
- Wait.
Seriously?

233
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:28,916
- Yeah, I know.
It's kind of hard to believe,

234
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,657
but it's--
- We met at

235
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,049
a General Managers Convention.
- That's--yeah--

236
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,355
- Wait, I didn't even know
those were a thing.

237
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:34,791
- Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.

238
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:35,923
We don't call it inside
baseball for nothing.

239
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,664
- You're funny.
- Dad! Mom!

240
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,056
Come look at this!

241
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,058
Coming, honey.

242
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:42,843
- It was so nice to meet you.
- You too.

243
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,410
- You guys are like
the perfect family.

244
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,891
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

245
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:49,153
- See ya.
- Bye.

246
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,116
- Hey.
What are you doing?

247
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,421
Mmm.

248
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,917
- Oh.

249
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,703
Hey, buddy.
You okay?

250
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,444
Hey, buddy.
Wanna get up?

251
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,924
Oh, you got it?

252
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,450
- Liam.
- Hi.

253
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,887
- I'm--I'm so sorry about that.

254
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,410
- How'd you get so far
ahead of me, buddy?

255
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,977
- No, no.
That's okay.

256
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,761
Um, I don't mean to pry,

257
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,415
but does your son often
have difficulty standing?

258
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,416
- Uh...
- He's always been

259
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,200
a bit clumsy, but...

260
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,246
Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Yeah, why?

261
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,424
- Only asking
because I'm a doctor.

262
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,078
Do you have a pediatrician?

263
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,080
- Not at the moment.

264
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,777
- Um, um, we just moved here,

265
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,910
and with everything we're--
we're still--

266
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,129
- Does...
- Liam.

267
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:55,959
- Liam, does he have, um,
difficulty going upstairs,

268
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,875
or does he get tired easily?

269
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,879
- Why, is...

270
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:04,489
Something wrong with him?

271
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,883
- How about this?
Come to New Amsterdam with me,

272
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,756
let me run a few tests
just to be sure.

273
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,457
Lead the way.
- Okay.

274
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,459
Mm, come here, buddy.

275
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,118
- Wha--
- Oh!

276
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,902
Mom.

277
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,164
- Darling, you can't just go
barreling into people

278
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,818
like that.

279
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,472
You're gonna break my arm
or something.

280
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,082
- Okay, okay, look, I love all
the time we've spent together,

281
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,475
I do, but...
- Aw, me too, sweetheart.

282
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,129
- You cannot just show up
here every--

283
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,957
whenever you wanna
see me, okay?

284
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,481
We need boundaries.

285
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,745
- I know.
I agree, and I understand.

286
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,269
But I'm not here to see you.
- Hmm?

287
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,057
- I hope you have
a fabulous day.

288
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,276
- Okay.

289
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,196
- Casey, hi.
Shh.

290
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,025
Okay, okay.

291
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:05,507
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

292
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,774
- Has my mother
been harassing you?

293
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,558
- I don't know your mother.

294
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,866
- I just saw you two
out in the hall.

295
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,957
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
Uh, we just met.

296
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,742
- You were hugging.

297
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,961
- Were we?
- Yeah.

298
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,920
- Incoming!

299
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,793
Construction scaffolding
collapsed near 46th and Lex.

300
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,534
There's five more
after this one.

301
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:36,016
- Okay, let's, uh, get them
to Bay 23 and um, page Ortho.

302
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,539
Okay, we got multiple burns.

303
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:38,975
Let's start a line.
I'm'na be right back.

304
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,891
There's so much blood.

305
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,806
- Okay, you just need
some stitches, okay?

306
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,199
Let's get her to Bay 29.

307
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,897
Hang two liters normal saline
wide open.

308
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,247
You see anything
that interests you today?

309
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,120
- Mmm,
nope.

310
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,862
- Always a pleasure, Dr. Shin.

311
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,299
Kay, keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

312
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,910
- Do you know what this is?

313
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,999
- If I say yes,
will you not tell me?

314
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,827
- No,
it's the needlessly complicated

315
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,263
and brain-numbingly
detailed application

316
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,004
for the state hospital
accreditation review.

317
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,614
- Hmm, don't you have
another year until that's due?

318
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,268
- Yes, we do,

319
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,140
but if I wait that long
it's never gonna get done,

320
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,272
so if we just knock this out
today, it'll be off our plates.

321
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,013
- I think--
I think you mean your plate.

322
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,276
- Uh, our plate.
Like, shared plate.

323
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,930
Like tapas, you know?
Two hours.

324
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,105
Tops.
- Fine.

325
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,846
- Great.
- See you after work.

326
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,981
- Plasma exchange
is still considered

327
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:30,853
to be one of the most effective
first-line therapies

328
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,942
for autoimmune encephalitis.

329
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,162
- They didn't have hazelnut,
honey.

330
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,990
Of course they didn't.

331
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,253
- Mmm.
- Your husband is all set.

332
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,037
The process will take
several hours,

333
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,170
but I will check on you
in a bit.

334
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,911
- At least I brought a book.

335
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,957
- Hang on.
Dr. Kapoor.

336
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,180
What's going on with you?

337
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,964
- What's going on?

338
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,924
- You look different
from our last visit.

339
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,186
Do I?

340
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,230
- Don't be modest.

341
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,406
- Well, I can't imagine...

342
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,234
- Whatever you're doing...

343
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,324
It's working for you.

344
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,285
Mmm.

345
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,943
- Congratulations,

346
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,988
you are officially halfway
through your chemotherapy.

347
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,077
- Does my ovarian cancer
know that?

348
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,079
- How have you been doing
at home?

349
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,386
- Humble.
Can't eat.

350
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,085
Can't get outta bed.
Can't even shower by myself.

351
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,132
If not for Oliver,
I don't know what I'd do.

352
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,003
- "In sickness and in health."

353
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,092
- Guess you should've read
the fine print.

354
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,447
What?
What is it?

355
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,363
- Lena has necrotizing
fasciitis on her calf...

356
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,104
- From the cancer?

357
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,672
- No, it started as a small cut
that got infected.

358
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,282
We need to get her
to the ED straight away.

359
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,197
- I can't believe
I missed a cut.

360
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,112
I guess I just never look
at the back of her legs.

361
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,374
- It's okay.
These things happen.

362
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,251
- Dr. Ignatius Frome

363
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:07,341
is offered as administrator
to the appellant's

364
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,996
ERPOmandated
psychological evaluation.

365
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,301
Mr. Phillips, do you accept?

366
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,307
- We do.

367
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,961
- State of New York?

368
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,268
- Good by us, Your Honor.
- So ordered.

369
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,009
We'll reconvene once
Mr. Phillip's evaluation

370
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,140
is complete.

371
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,925
We're adjourned.

372
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,716
- Brendan, hi.
Dr. Frome.

373
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,718
- I can't believe
this is happening.

374
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,285
- Well, why don't we take
a little walk up to my office,

375
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:39,939
and we'll have a chat, okay?

376
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:45,031
- How do the cops have any
right to take away my gun?

377
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,728
I'm trained, and I'm licensed--

378
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,035
- Well, yeah, the issue is not
if you're licensed.

379
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,732
The Red Flag Law
was put in place

380
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,255
to determine if you are an
immediate danger to yourself

381
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,996
or to others.
That's it.

382
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,263
- I can't believe Ellie
did this to me.

383
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,266
- Yeah, divorce makes people
see the worst in each other,

384
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,920
for sure,

385
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,009
but that is why it's important
to have an impartial evaluator

386
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,316
in the process.
You ready?

387
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,409
Any idea why your wife
would say you're so dangerous?

388
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,324
- Yeah.

389
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,239
'Cause I almost killed her.

390
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,469
- Your feet make good drums.

391
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,212
- Hey.

392
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,345
- Hey, we'll be right back.

393
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,223
- We sequenced your son's genes

394
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:51,010
and were able to determine the
cause of the mobility issues.

395
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,362
- It's bad, isn't it?

396
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:01,194
- Your son has
what's known as DMD,

397
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,326
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

398
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,373
It is a rapidly progressive
degenerative disease

399
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,550
that affects
around 1 in 5,000 boys.

400
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:13,293
- But he's gonna be okay,
right?

401
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,170
- There's no easy way
to say this.

402
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,173
There is no cure right now.

403
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:29,135
As he ages he will experience
continual muscle loss.

404
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,529
He'll be confined
to a wheelchair by his teens.

405
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:37,839
And by his twenties,
he will likely succumb to it.

406
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,279
- I don't--

407
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:46,282
how did he...

408
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,589
- It's inherited.

409
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,287
It's a mutation
of the dystrophin gene

410
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:54,421
on the X chromosome passed down
from mother to son.

411
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:06,215
- I did this?
- No.

412
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,608
There's nothing
you could've done.

413
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,353
- This can't be happening.

414
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:16,356
My baby boy.

415
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,228
Oh, my...

416
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,582
- Thank you, Oliver.
- Anything to help.

417
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:29,412
- Okay, you two
just hang tight.

418
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,242
I need to perform
a debridement

419
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,896
on Lena Luzan in Bay 28.

420
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,290
- Local anesthesia or a top--
- Little help here!

421
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,294
- What happened?
- No clue.

422
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,643
His heart rate
just fell off a cliff.

423
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:46,168
No warning.
- The same thing over here!

424
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,566
- Bradycardia!
Need a crash cart, STAT!

425
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,263
- Two more crashing over here!

426
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,357
- What the hell is happening?

427
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:04,404
- It's everyone who came in
from the scaffolding accident.

428
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,803
- At least everyone is stable.
- What was that all about?

429
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,893
- And he emerges
from the break room.

430
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,417
To what do we owe this honor?

431
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,159
We got a incoming trauma
actually worth your time?

432
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,813
We'll see.

433
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,728
Hey.

434
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,034
- Hey.

435
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,992
Incoming!

436
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,951
30-year-old male in MVA.

437
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,780
1965 antique roadster
versus a concrete divider.

438
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:33,911
- What is that?

439
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,174
- What's left
of the steering column.

440
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,872
- Now we're talking.
Right this way.

441
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,184
- "Hey."

442
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,969
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

443
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,843
- Maybe her hand just, like,
grazed your leg accidentally.

444
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:56,020
- This woman definitely
cupped my buttocks.

445
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,198
- That's a sentence
I hoped never to hear out loud.

446
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,938
- Why is it so hard
for you to believe

447
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,767
that this woman
is actually attracted to me?

448
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,987
- Because at Walter's
last session,

449
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,208
they kept going on and on about
renewing their wedding vows.

450
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,254
- Yes.
I guess timing is suspect.

451
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,038
- All I'm saying is,

452
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,215
is it possible
this is all in your head?

453
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,790
- Robin.

454
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,923
- Uh, my husband's ready
for his next round.

455
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:32,056
The question is, are you?

456
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,931
- There's a dozen
active clinical trials

457
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,759
studying potential treatments
for Duchennes.

458
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:41,936
Our job will be finding one
that works for Liam.

459
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,503
- Oh, we're not picky,
Dr. Goodwin.

460
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,069
- I know, but they are.

461
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:47,855
Each trial has a rigid set
of inclusion criteria

462
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:51,902
and only accepts patients
that meet them all.

463
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,948
They don't make it easy.

464
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,298
I say we start
with the East Coast,

465
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,300
and uh,
look at gene therapy trials.

466
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,954
See what we can find.

467
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,087
- I have to go
to the bathroom.

468
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:06,874
- Okay, kiddo.
Can you walk it?

469
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,006
Okay.

470
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,052
I gotcha.
Up, up.

471
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,016
- I was sound asleep.

472
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,323
Around 1:00 a.m.,
I hear this noise.

473
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,064
Someone's in the house.

474
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,022
I grab my Glock,
and I head downstairs.

475
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,285
- Was it loaded?

476
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,027
- Someone was breaking in.

477
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,203
- Where do you keep your gun?

478
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,989
- I was protecting my home.

479
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,034
Last time I checked,
it was my right.

480
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,559
I don't have a record.
Not even a misdemeanor.

481
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,125
- Okay, so,

482
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,127
you were heading downstairs
with your loaded gun.

483
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,608
What happens next?

484
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,567
- I see someone in the dark.

485
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,874
I raise my gun,
I tell them to hit the floor,

486
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,136
and then I realize it's Ellie.

487
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,834
- But you did aim your gun
at her.

488
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,187
- I mean, yeah.

489
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,321
But I lowered it the second
I knew it was her.

490
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,061
- Ellie claims
that she was just there

491
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,193
to pick up some of her stuff.

492
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,847
Had she officially moved out?

493
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,068
- No, she'd just been staying
at her sister's.

494
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:14,376
- Brendan, how would you say
you're handling this divorce?

495
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,596
- That has nothing to do
with anything.

496
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,076
- Well, except it does because
I'm trying to get a better idea

497
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,644
of your mental state--
- Do you own a gun?

498
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,603
Do you own a gun?

499
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:27,084
- That's not--
this is not about me.

500
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,130
- Are you sure about that?

501
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,046
Tell me.

502
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,396
Are you in favor of open carry?

503
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,093
What about
the Second Amendment?

504
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,399
- Brendan--

505
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,096
- I'm the one whose house
got broken into.

506
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,925
I'm the one whose rights
are being stripped away,

507
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,928
and you sit there,
and you claim to be impartial,

508
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,974
but from over here,

509
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,890
it sure as hell seems your just
another bleeding heart liberal

510
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,894
who made up his mind the second
he heard the word "gun."

511
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,640
- Well, that's very good news.

512
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,990
Maybe we should cut it down
to twice a week.

513
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,644
- Sorry to interrupt.
Dr. Cholokian?

514
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,428
- Yeah, you found him.
- Great.

515
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:07,429
- You know,
I was just reading up

516
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,300
on your clinical collaboration

517
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,390
with Children's
in Sacramento and I--

518
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,087
- Let me stop you right there.
- Really?

519
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,132
I haven't even gotten to
the glowing praise part yet.

520
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,048
- You've heard about
my DMD clinical trial

521
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:21,182
because you have a patient
you want to enroll.

522
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:24,141
- Well, uh, guilty as charged.

523
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,274
- Has your patient already
submitted a pre-application

524
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,058
to the Biomedical Research
Application Portal?

525
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:31,279
- My patient just got
the diagnosis this morning.

526
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:34,021
- I'll take that as a no.

527
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:36,415
- Uh...

528
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,939
yeah, I was just thinking that,
uh--

529
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:42,072
- What, you could
sweet-talk me?

530
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:45,075
You don't think I want to help
as many children as I can?

531
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,686
I do.

532
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,949
But my trial has over two dozen
exclusion criteria

533
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,298
for a reason.

534
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,039
We have limited resources
to work with.

535
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,041
- I know, I read your criteria.
Trust me.

536
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,173
Liam Cafferty is a perfect fit.

537
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,001
- There is no perfect fit.

538
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,960
- Except for Liam.

539
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,962
He's six and a half,
he loves building with blocks,

540
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,311
and right now,

541
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,705
he doesn't qualify for
any other gene therapy trial

542
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:09,099
in the country, so
this could be his only shot...

543
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,188
- You know why we only accept

544
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,494
patients through
the online portal?

545
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,192
So we can remove
the advantage of privilege.

546
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:18,065
Like you cornering me in my lab

547
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,720
to make a personal plea
for one patient.

548
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:24,114
I'm sorry, Dr.--
- Goodwin.

549
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:28,162
Medical director
at, uh, New Amsterdam,

550
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,077
where you dump
a lot of your patients

551
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,732
to keep
your infection rates low.

552
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,169
So tell me again
about privilege.

553
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,260
- Two conditions.

554
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,741
I need a psyche eval of
the boy by the end of the day

555
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,482
along with a completed
pre-application form.

556
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,744
- Done.

557
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,441
He'll need to pass

558
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,486
his physical fitness
requirements.

559
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,009
- Got it.

560
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,358
Thank you.

561
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,016
- Casey?

562
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,539
- Zoll pads are working
for now.

563
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,498
As if being crushed by falling
scaffolding wasn't enough.

564
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,195
- Whatever they were
all exposed to,

565
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,675
it's not messing around.

566
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,459
- The sputum samples should
be back in a few hours.

567
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,201
- Okay, well, uh, until then,
you, uh,

568
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,769
care to tell me why
you and my mother were hugging?

569
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,032
Lauren, I already told you...

570
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,381
- Ooh, God, here we go.

571
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,514
This is Jake Holstein
all over again...

572
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,168
- I feel like you want me to
ask who Jake Holstein is.

573
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,170
- No, I don't need you to ask.

574
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:23,086
Jake Holstein
was this super cool senior

575
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,132
who liked me
when I was a freshman.

576
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,786
But every time he would try
to hang out with me,

577
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,352
he would get dragged into these

578
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,354
long, flirty conversations
with my mother,

579
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,487
because Jeanie always has to be
the focus

580
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,141
of every guy in the room.

581
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,230
I need a code team here!

582
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:37,448
Lena.

583
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,450
Lena!

584
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,150
Her heart rate just crashed
out of nowhere.

585
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:44,630
- Is she going to be okay?

586
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,458
- We're working on it, sir.
Please give us some room.

587
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:50,157
- Sudden drop in heart rate,
normal O2 saturation.

588
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,593
Same symptoms as
the construction site.

589
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,160
- But Lena came from me.

590
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,379
She was never near
the accident.

591
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,425
- So whatever's happening
to our patients,

592
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,383
we're the ones
doing it to them.

593
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,350
- Uh, you okay?
- What?

594
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:11,613
Hi.
Um...

595
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:14,050
I might be making premature
judgments from a place of bias.

596
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:17,619
- That's great, because I need
you to blindly sign this.

597
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,621
- Whatever happened to,
"how can I help"?

598
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:20,883
- No, don't have time for that.
This is a psyche eval

599
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,232
for a patient
you're never gonna meet.

600
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,669
- Max, I'm--I'm actually
struggling with something

601
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:24,931
really big right now,

602
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,149
I don't think cutting corners
is the best--

603
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:27,803
- His name is Liam Cafferty.

604
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,936
He is a 6-year-old boy
with Duchennes.

605
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,633
Right now he is struggling

606
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,070
to get into the only
clinical trial in this country

607
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,117
that could possibly
extend his life.

608
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,079
You're the best, buddy.
- Um...

609
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,820
Thanks.

610
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,172
- Iggy, Iggy.
- Hi.

611
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,000
- I need your advice.

612
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,698
- No, actually, BJ, I'm going
through something big.

613
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,829
I need you to maybe--

614
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,004
- I am being
sexually propositioned

615
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,963
by a patient's wife.

616
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:00,793
- My God, everyone has
such good comebacks today.

617
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,446
All right, okay, all right,
I'll bite.

618
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,666
Are you sure
that she's hitting on you?

619
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,189
- Why is it so difficult
for anyone to believe it?

620
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,669
- Mm, mmm...

621
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,018
- That woman rubbed
my shoulders,

622
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,107
she whispered into my ear,
and she cupped my bottom.

623
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,805
Please tell me what to do.
Please.

624
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:14,110
- Oh, okay.

625
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:15,938
Well, actually,
that does sound a lot

626
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:18,724
like "erotic transference."

627
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,073
- Okay, let me explain.
I'll explain it.

628
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,205
If someone is in
a heightened emotional state,

629
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,990
oftentimes they will redirect
their emotions

630
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,426
to their therapist
or their doctor, okay?

631
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,862
- Hmm.

632
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,908
- She's vulnerable,
she's grateful,

633
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,431
she's probably isn't even fully
aware that she's doing it,

634
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,128
so just talk to her.

635
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,130
Let her know you want to keep
the relationship professional,

636
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:36,219
and the bottom cupping
should subside.

637
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,743
- Thank you.
Thank you.

638
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,702
All right.

639
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,936
- Maybe you want
to stretch your legs,

640
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,154
get a breath of fresh air?

641
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,852
You've been sitting vigil
all day.

642
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:03,072
- Yeah, I'm fine right here.

643
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:08,121
- Can I ask, do you have anyone
helping out at home?

644
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,863
- Just me.
And that is fine.

645
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,778
I don't mind.

646
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,910
- It must be so overwhelming.

647
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:18,261
- Lena's always been the one
to take care of me,

648
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,743
so when she got sick, I knew
it was my turn to step up.

649
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,745
And I wanted to.

650
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:26,139
I wanted to take care of her.

651
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:30,491
Cooking, bathing,
whatever she needs...

652
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,537
I handle it.

653
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,844
- Oliver,

654
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:38,934
when was the last time
you took time for yourself?

655
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,547
- I'm okay, Dr. Sharpe.

656
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,854
Really, I'm fine.

657
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,162
Right now, my focus is my wife.

658
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,775
She's all that matters.

659
00:28:56,865 --> 00:29:00,521
- Okay, Brendan.
Sorry about that.

660
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,007
- I own a gun.

661
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,882
A Cricket .22.
It was a gift from my old man.

662
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,799
Yeah, I was, um,

663
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,323
I was eight
when he gave it to me.

664
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,065
And I was so excited because

665
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,067
that gun meant that I could
finally go hunting

666
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,069
with him and my brother.

667
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,071
- So you have a kid's gun?

668
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:30,899
- Well, growing up
in Wisconsin,

669
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:32,858
believe me,
I had more than just the one.

670
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,860
A bolt action
deer hunting rifle.

671
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,122
A Remington.

672
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:39,255
Eventually, I got myself
a .270 Winchester...

673
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,909
- Accurate weapon.

674
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:42,563
- Especially with
the iron sight.

675
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:45,044
I never thought twice
about my dad's gun collection.

676
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,829
And I could tell you firsthand,
I know the patience

677
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,613
and the discipline you learn
when you're hunting.

678
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,267
And I'll never forget looking
over at my old man

679
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,008
and knowing that he believed

680
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:54,096
he was teaching me
and my brothers something.

681
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,273
Knowing that he was proud.

682
00:29:57,317 --> 00:30:00,363
Also knowing that might be the
closest I'd ever feel to him.

683
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,150
Guns are no longer
a part of my life,

684
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:07,196
but I still have that
Cricket .22 disassembled,

685
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,895
under lock and key.

686
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,853
- I get that.

687
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,334
- Yes, Brendan, I am a bleeding
heart liberal New York doctor.

688
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,207
- That's true.

689
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:21,123
But I also have no problem
with the Second Amendment.

690
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:25,127
I have absolutely no problem
with responsible gun ownership,

691
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:28,087
which is why I need you to
start answering my questions.

692
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,219
You think you deserve
that Glock?

693
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,221
Let me help you get it back.

694
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,011
- Okay, we now have 14 patients

695
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,969
who have crashed
without warning.

696
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,015
This spreadsheet lists
every single medication

697
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,147
they have received.
- Find the common link.

698
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,322
- They've all got
normal saline.

699
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,150
- Well, apart from these two.

700
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,282
- What about Ativan?

701
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,979
- No, Lena didn't get that.

702
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,894
Oh, wait.
They all had bandages?

703
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,114
- And alcohol swabs,
but how would that make sense?

704
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,637
- My patient's crashing.

705
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,681
I need an Epi drip
in here stat.

706
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:03,252
Let's get the drip started
at 2 micrograms a minute.

707
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,167
- Copy that.
- Wild guess.

708
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,995
His heart rate just plummeted
out of nowhere?

709
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,344
- Yeah, faster than a drunk
on a mountain bike.

710
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,172
- What drugs did you give him?

711
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,044
- Uh, a shot of morphine
through an autoinjector line.

712
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,089
- All our other patients
were administered morphine

713
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,961
using the same injector system.

714
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,267
- That's gotta be our link.
- You think an overdose?

715
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,182
- It doesn't make any sense.

716
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,358
These injector syringes come
prefilled at two milliliters.

717
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,056
There's no way that two
milliliters of morphine

718
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,361
cause this kind of reaction.

719
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:28,974
- Unless what's inside
isn't morphine.

720
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,982
- Liam's labs are all
within normal range.

721
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,984
He meets the age
and weight criteria.

722
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,030
All that's left is
a TTSTAND unassisted.

723
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,685
- Hey, Liam.
Do you like games?

724
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:47,427
Come check this out.
This is a game we can play.

725
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,299
You can lay on your back
on this mat like me.

726
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,735
Right?

727
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,215
Yeah.
All the way...

728
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,000
Perfect.

729
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,697
And then when we say "go,"
you're gonna roll over

730
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,221
and then you're gonna stand up
as fast as you can.

731
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,397
Can you do that for us?

732
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,009
- Yeah.
- Cool.

733
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,749
All right, buddy,
you stay there.

734
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,447
We'll get us to--wait, wait.
Not yet, not yet.

735
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,276
You stay there, and we're
gonna watch right here, okay?

736
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,713
- He needs to come to a full
standing position unassisted

737
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,063
in under ten seconds
to qualify.

738
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,282
- Ten seconds?

739
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,979
- Well,
I know it sounds extreme,

740
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,415
but it's a marker
for muscle damage.

741
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,200
If he can't meet that time,

742
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,028
we won't benefit
from the trial.

743
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:28,424
You got this, son.

744
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:32,080
All you gotta do is get up.

745
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:35,170
- And begin.

746
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,406
Yay!

747
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,147
Great job, buddy.

748
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,062
That was great.

749
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,153
- I'm sorry.

750
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,330
- So...

751
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,505
that's it?

752
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:10,118
- The exclusion criteria
is clear.

753
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,293
- No, no, no.
Hang on.

754
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,034
He's--he's just warming up.

755
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,082
All right, let's--
let's give him another try.

756
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,779
Okay, come on.
Come down here, buddy.

757
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:20,215
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

758
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,564
That was great.

759
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:24,263
Okay, great, but uh...

760
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:25,786
even faster this time.

761
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,137
Okay, can you--
can you do it faster?

762
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,486
- I think so.

763
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,098
That-a-boy.

764
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,490
I know you can.

765
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,840
All right, let me put you back
on your back.

766
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:40,409
And, uh, nice and fast.

767
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,020
Okay?

768
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,849
Okay.

769
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,460
He's ready.

770
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:49,592
- And begin.

771
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,337
- Come on, honey.
You can do this.

772
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,437
You got this, son.

773
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:24,410
- I did it.
- Yes, yes, yes, sweetie.

774
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,457
Yes, sweetie.

775
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,161
- I'm very sorry.

776
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:54,353
- I may have found something.

777
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,746
It's in Seattle,
which I know is not ideal,

778
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,400
but it's something.

779
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:03,101
It's a Tier Two trial
that has shown mild success

780
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,754
in slowing down
the degeneration.

781
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:05,842
- "Mild success"?

782
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,192
- I know.
It's not...

783
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:13,372
It could buy you
a little more time as a family.

784
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,678
- Can Liam even get in?

785
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:18,899
- He's in if you want it.

786
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,683
- Yeah, of course we want it.

787
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,120
We slow it down now,

788
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,383
and then we keep our eyes open
for better studies,

789
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,733
for more promising trials
coming down the line,

790
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,126
and then if there's ever
a big breakthrough--

791
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:33,000
- Well, it doesn't exactly work
like that.

792
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,915
What do you mean?

793
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,397
These trials use
a deactivated cold virus

794
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,921
to deliver the new gene.

795
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:44,403
So once Liam's exposed, his
body will develop antibodies.

796
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,882
- Meaning?

797
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,797
- Meaning that
if we ever tried again,

798
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,059
regardless of the trial,

799
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,889
his body would just
destroy the gene.

800
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,458
- So we only get one shot
at this?

801
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,200
- Unfortunately.

802
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,811
- That--that's ridiculous.

803
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,118
There must be something else
that we can do.

804
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,816
- I wish there were.

805
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,688
- We'll do the trial.

806
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,040
- We have to talk about this.
- What is there to talk about?

807
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,781
- You heard what he said.

808
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:17,175
Best case is mild success
at slowing it down.

809
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,785
- It is better
than doing nothing.

810
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,917
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

811
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:24,138
- What--what if next year
they develop a cure,

812
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:29,491
and we have blown our one shot
with this--this half measure?

813
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,840
- He's sick.

814
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,063
He's dying.

815
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,980
How can we do nothing?

816
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:54,124
- Um, yeah,
divorce can be life-altering.

817
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:56,953
That idea of the future you had
in your mind, it's gone.

818
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,999
How does that make you feel?

819
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,872
- It hurts.
I loved her.

820
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,134
- I bet it's hard to hear

821
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,788
that she thinks
you're capable of violence.

822
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,487
- She doesn't.
Ellie's just being dramatic.

823
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,489
She wants to take everything
from me.

824
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,752
- Well, who wanted the divorce?

825
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:16,234
- She says that we,
"grew apart,"

826
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,758
which is just code for,
"she felt like it,"

827
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,150
as far as I'm concerned.

828
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:21,978
And now the courts
are bending over backwards

829
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,850
to make sure
she's not taken advantage of.

830
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:26,113
God forbid someone should care
about my rights.

831
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,899
- 'Cause she broke into
your house, right?

832
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,814
- That's right.

833
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:33,338
- And I bet over
these last few months,

834
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,253
you've really felt like you've
lost control over your life.

835
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,993
- To say the least.

836
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,561
- The night she broke in--
you heard the noise, right?

837
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,259
You grabbed your gun.

838
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,043
Did you feel afraid?
- Hell no.

839
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,132
- What did you feel?
- In charge.

840
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:47,265
- What else?

841
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,527
- I felt like a man again.

842
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,268
- So you went towards
the sound,

843
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,095
gun in hand,
down the stairs.

844
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,228
What did you wanna do?
- I wanted to handle things.

845
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,056
I wanted to protect
what was mine.

846
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,580
- You aimed the gun, you
realized it's not the burglar,

847
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,278
it's your wife.
- Yeah.

848
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,280
- What'd you do then?

849
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,805
- Nothing.

850
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:08,286
- You lowered the gun.
- No.

851
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,554
I just kept it there.

852
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:19,209
Just trained on her,
just for a second or two.

853
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,043
You should've seen
the look on her face.

854
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:35,095
- Did you ever think about
pulling the trigger?

855
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,621
- No.

856
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,971
Of course not.

857
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,283
I just wanted to scare her.

858
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:54,332
I wanted her to feel
like I felt for once...

859
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,336
Powerless.

860
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,083
- Mrs. Kent,
thank you for coming.

861
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,998
We have something
quite important to discuss.

862
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,000
- Hmm, that sounds enticing.

863
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,089
- You can leave the door open.
I--

864
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,308
Okay.

865
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,223
Where should we do this
discussing then?

866
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,398
The sofa.

867
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,182
- No, no, no sofa.

868
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,184
I believe what's happening here

869
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:24,623
is that you are mistaking
your feelings of concern

870
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,364
over your husband's diagnosis
with my own.

871
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,235
- Mmm.

872
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:30,193
- I mean, you are transferring
your erotic nature to me--

873
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,369
wait, no, no--

874
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,022
- Ooh, what are you trying
to say, Vijay?

875
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,372
- I am not great with words.

876
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,896
- Oh, we don't have to speak.
- Mm-hmm.

877
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,901
Your eyes.

878
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,032
- Go on.

879
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,905
- Oh, Lord.
Come with me.

880
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,255
Hurry up.
- Ooh!

881
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:52,041
- Robin Kent's MRI results.

882
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,348
- She has a meningioma?

883
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,350
- The tumor is pressing up
against her pleasure center.

884
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,918
It's what has been causing
her heightened libido

885
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:00,398
and lowered inhibitions.

886
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,443
- She needs surgery right away.
I can schedule it.

887
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,010
- Thank you.

888
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,272
We must make sure
she's healthy enough

889
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,230
to renew her wedding vows.

890
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,276
- How'd you figure it out?

891
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:12,105
- I saw an uneven dilation
in her pupils.

892
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,280
- You two had to be
pretty close

893
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,064
to notice something like that.

894
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,300
- How can I help?

895
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,302
- I don't think you can.

896
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,350
Jeremy and I just see things
differently.

897
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:44,703
He wants to wait for a trial
that can cure him,

898
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,488
even though a trial like that
doesn't exist.

899
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:51,100
- What do you want?

900
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,281
- I...

901
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:01,981
passed this disease
onto my son.

902
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,245
It came from me.

903
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:11,120
And I just feel like
I have to do something.

904
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,035
Anything.

905
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,044
- Liam is, um...

906
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,176
he's smart.

907
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:27,354
He's funny.

908
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,748
He's kind.
Ridiculously adorable.

909
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,101
- And he's strong.

910
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,193
That's what you passed on,

911
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:42,500
if you ask me.

912
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,806
And you have time

913
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,373
to pass down even more,

914
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,115
regardless of what you
and Jeremy choose.

915
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:53,423
All we can do...

916
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,514
As parents, really.

917
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,299
I mean...

918
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:02,258
just try to pass down
the best of ourselves.

919
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:07,525
To our kids.

920
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,528
In the limited time
that we have.

921
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,405
- Okay, Casey's at the lab with
some of the prefilled syringes.

922
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,233
We'll see what they find out.

923
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:22,148
- Well, if we can't figure out
what we're giving him,

924
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,150
this man's gonna die
right here on the table.

925
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,281
- Mass spectrometry
test results

926
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:26,369
are gonna take
at least an hour.

927
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,546
- You have a better idea?

928
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,809
- I'm not sure it's better.

929
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:34,856
- Lauren!

930
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,122
- What is it?
- It's morphine.

931
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,342
- But it can't be.
Because then that means...

932
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,344
- This isn't why
our patients are crashing.

933
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,476
Heart rate's bottoming out.

934
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,566
- Start with these.
- No.

935
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,871
This steering column's
made of metal.

936
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,394
- If the pads fire

937
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:52,570
then the charge will arc
through his chest.

938
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,136
- Well,
that limits our options.

939
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,225
- I'm cracking open his chest.

940
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,184
I need a scalpel
and a sonic bone saw.

941
00:42:58,227 --> 00:42:59,577
- I'll get him prepped.

942
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,628
- I'm starting
the mid sternal thoracotomy.

943
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:09,195
- Wait!

944
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:11,110
- Wh-what are you doing?

945
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,241
- What is that?

946
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,418
- It's Narcan.

947
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:21,337
Heart rate's rising.

948
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,469
- Saturation's up.

949
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:24,558
- It's working.

950
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,299
- How did you know?

951
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:27,866
- This.

952
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,563
That's more than two mls
of morphine.

953
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,434
I'll wager
it's three times that.

954
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,132
- So it wasn't the wrong meds.

955
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:35,264
- No, these prefilled syringes
were designed

956
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:36,875
so we wouldn't have to think
about measurements

957
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:38,180
in the heat of a crisis.

958
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,529
- And these ones came to us
overfilled.

959
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:41,314
- Which we would've never have
found out in time

960
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:42,663
if you hadn't
have popped one open.

961
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:44,447
- We can't be the only hospital
that uses these.

962
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,927
- I'll sound the alarm.

963
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:47,189
We have a Class Two Recall
on our hands.

964
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,981
-Dr. Frome, you completed
your psychological evaluation

965
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:58,200
of Brendan Phillips
for the ERPO proceedings?

966
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:01,682
- I have, your Honor.
- What did you find?

967
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,466
- Uh, Brendan Philips,

968
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,121
he exhibits signs
of repressed anger.

969
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,775
Um, his impulse control
leaves--

970
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:08,994
- Objection.

971
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:10,691
- Already ahead of you,
counselor.

972
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,780
Dr. Frome, this is
out of your jurisdiction.

973
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,739
The Red Flag Law asks
two simple questions:

974
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:18,003
is Brendan Phillips an
immediate threat to himself?

975
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,965
- No.

976
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:26,707
- Is Mr. Phillips
a threat to others?

977
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,448
- I would say that

978
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,058
he intentionally traumatized
his wife emotionally--

979
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:31,756
- This isn't a therapy session,
Dr. Frome.

980
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,192
- Mm-hmm.

981
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:36,195
- Is Mr. Phillips
an immediate threat to others?

982
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:38,763
Yes or no?

983
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:41,461
Is he likely to go out
and shoot someone?

984
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:46,031
- No.

985
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:48,120
- Thank you.

986
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:50,122
The ERPO is hereby revoked.

987
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:52,864
Mr. Phillips, your gun is to be
restored to you by the state,

988
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:54,866
immediately.

989
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:04,179
- I knew it.

990
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,096
I knew this wouldn't
do anything.

991
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:15,756
- Yes, these laws
are far from perfect,

992
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,497
but they're the best
that we have for right now.

993
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,891
- Well, Brendan won't be
the only one armed.

994
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:23,111
I just bought myself a gun.

995
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,513
- Your heart rate
is back to normal,

996
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,950
and your fasciitis is healing.

997
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,778
I could discharge you today.

998
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:40,825
But I've been wondering
if that is the best option.

999
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:42,783
- What do you mean?

1000
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:45,090
- Have you heard
of Respite Care?

1001
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:47,092
- No.
What is that?

1002
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,224
- It's like
a temporary nursing home

1003
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:52,271
where Lena could receive
full-time care.

1004
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:57,842
- I--I missed one cut.

1005
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,800
I know.

1006
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,236
But that doesn't mean

1007
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,195
we have to ship my wife off
to a nursing home.

1008
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:05,066
- Respite Care
and Palliative Care

1009
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,939
are not just
for terminal patients.

1010
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,810
We have a unit right here
at New Amsterdam.

1011
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:13,031
Lena could stay for a month,
even two.

1012
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:17,296
You could visit every day, and
it could give you both a break.

1013
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:21,561
- I can do this, Dr. Sharpe.

1014
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:23,345
- I know you can.

1015
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:26,000
But caregiver burnout
can be just as serious

1016
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,262
as Lena's cancer.

1017
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,830
Not just for her
but for you.

1018
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:33,399
Respite Care exists
so that you can recharge...

1019
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:37,316
And Lena doesn't feel
like a burden.

1020
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:46,368
- You--you feel like a burden?

1021
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:52,897
- Ollie, are you not
taking care of yourself?

1022
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,031
- I--I'm trying, love.

1023
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,952
- It's not a respite
from each other.

1024
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:09,174
Because if you cannot
look after yourself,

1025
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:11,263
then you can't look after Lena.

1026
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:24,102
- Okay.

1027
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:26,191
Okay.

1028
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:36,201
- Hey.

1029
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:40,074
We've discussed our options.

1030
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:41,946
- And?

1031
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,209
- And, uh,

1032
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,994
we decided we'd rather

1033
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:49,344
spend this time together.

1034
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:51,694
As a family.

1035
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:54,915
- And hold out hope that a
better trial might come along.

1036
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:59,224
- There's, uh,
no guarantee that it will.

1037
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:02,401
- There's never a guarantee.

1038
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,318
So...

1039
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:10,278
Better not waste
the time you have, right?

1040
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:14,369
- Well, I'm always here.

1041
00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:16,110
- Thank you.

1042
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,218
- Tough case.

1043
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:41,135
- As a woman who has
lived a full life,

1044
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,050
who's, uh,

1045
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:45,313
who is vital and--
and attractive,

1046
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:48,186
you will understand
how I had a certain itch.

1047
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:50,275
People stop seeing you
as a full person

1048
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,234
with wants,
and desires, and passions.

she said, "I miss mass,"
