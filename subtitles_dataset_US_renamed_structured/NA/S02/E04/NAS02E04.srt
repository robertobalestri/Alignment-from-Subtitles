12
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:01,583
- Yeah, boy.

13
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,193
I gotta open up the shop.

14
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,108
- Kenny,
you're leaving us one short.

15
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,805
- Like y'all ain't gonna
be at the shop later,

16
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,198
begging to fit you in
for a lineup, right?

17
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,288
- Hey, stroller guy,
you want to run?

18
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,333
- Me?

19
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:15,379
Oh, sorry.
Baby.

20
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,380
- I'll watch your baby.

21
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,382
- Uh...

22
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:20,297
No, no, that's okay.
I don't want to...

23
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,385
- I babysit all the time.

24
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,257
You got no reason not to play.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,563
- Uh...

26
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,565
really?

27
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,397
- Go, go. Trap, trap, trap,

- Go, go, go, go!

29
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:35,834

00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,533

- Did I mention I have cancer?

35
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,283
- Hey, stroller guy,
I hope you pass

36
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,589
some serious math skills
onto this baby.

37
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,246
- ♪ What a life, what a goal,

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,299

00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,185
- Shot!

45
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,449
- We'll get that back.

00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,671
- Sorry, guys,
I got to...duty calls.

47
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,629
- Aww.
- Fun's over.

48
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:34,893
- You might not be able
to shoot, stroller guy,

49
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,460
but look at Marquis.

50
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,636
You definitely had him
running up and down the court.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,203
- It was fun.

52
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,204
- Yeah, man,
good playing with you, man.

53
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,249
- You, too.

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,425
Hey, thanks.

55
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,211
- First time
playing basketball?

56
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,560
- No way.

57
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,433
Two years YMCA rec league.
Basically pro.

58
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,654
Daddy's got mad skills,
right?

59
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,222
Don't listen to them.
- Dad, are you okay?

60
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,531
Dad!
- Rod, grab the stroller.

61
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,489
- Marquis!

62
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,577
- Give me some space.

63
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,192
Call 9-1-1.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,719
- 32-year-old man found down.

65
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,677
No pulse, no respirations.

66
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,331
Cardiac resuscitation
started immediately.

67
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,724
- Get the defibrillator ready.

68
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,421
- He was sweating profusely
as he boxed me out

69
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,944
in our pickup game.
- Your pickup game?

70
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,511
- Why does no on believe
I can play?

71
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,991
- Is he gonna be okay?

72
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,340
- Yeah, just come with me.

73
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:31,689
- Nuh-uh.
I'm going in with him.

74
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,213
- I need you to stay here.

75
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,389
- Just tell me plain.
Is my dad gonna be okay?

76
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,521
- You watched over my daughter,

77
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,524
and we're gonna
watch over your dad.

78
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,743
Okay?

79
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:48,706
- First, I divide the pleura
to isolate the diaphragm.

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,535
Then, with forceps
applying gentle traction,

81
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,016
I plicate the paralyzed area
using a series of U-sutures.

82
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,322
- Where are those anchored?

83
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,324
- Costal arch of the sixth rib.

84
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,629
I also dug deep and found

85
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:01,284
a completely
endoscopic approach.

86
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,547
- No partial thoracotomy?

87
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,549
Since when?
That's not how I trained.

88
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,290
- You got some reading to do.

89
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,598
- Damn, Duke,
you're putting me on the ropes.

90
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,995
- I'm just, I'm so mad
at myself right now.

91
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,606
- So much
for telling you my news.

92
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,348
- We have four children
under 10 already.

93
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,566
But, no,
I have to suggest to Martin

94
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,568
that we adopt another one.
Why?

95
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,571
What am I doing?
Why do I always do this?

96
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,617
But it's like if you see
a squirrel in the park

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,575
and it's injured, or, like,
a pigeon with a bum wing

98
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:32,576
or whatever,
do you not try to rescue it?

99
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,012
- No.

100
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,449
- You don't?
I do.

101
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,278
That's, like, my go-to.
I just can't help myself.

102
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,367
But Martin, you know,
you should've seen the look

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,586
on his face this morning,
Vijay, it was like...

104
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,414
I don't know.
What's a word that means angry

105
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,329
but also profoundly
exasperated?

106
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,591
- English is not my first
language, but--

107
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,333
- I see these kids
in the refugee camps,

108
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,465
and I see the looks
on their faces,

109
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,336
and it's a no-brainer for me.

110
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,774
We have money, we have space,
we--Martin--ugh, Martin.

111
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,341
No, Martin's right.
Martin's right.

112
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,343
Martin is always right.

113
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,649
We have a full family as is,

114
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:02,650
and there are tons
of other ways to help.

115
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,434
Thank you.

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,044
Thank you for talking
me through this, Vijay.

117
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,569
I appreciate it.
Now hit me with the good news.

118
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,744
What's going on?

119
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,746
- We are having a baby.

120
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,792
- What?

121
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,099
Are you seeing someone?

122
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,580
- Not me, but Ella,
she's carrying my grandchild.

123
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,799
Can you believe it?

124
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:22,800
- No, not even a little bit.

125
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,541
- At first, it was all bad,

126
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:27,457
but what choice do I have
but to take it as a blessing?

127
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,720
I can't stop smiling.

128
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,640
Are you okay?

129
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,512
- We're having a baby.

130
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,427
We're having a baby!

131
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,438
- Maybe you're not
stretching it enough.

132
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,396
- You know what?
I never thought of that.

133
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,833
- Really?
- No, not really.

134
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,488
I am doing all
of the recommended stretches

135
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,664
and exercises,
and you know what?

136
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,405
Sometimes things just hurt.

137
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,842
- On a scale of one to ten,
how's your pain level?

138
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:05,887
- A hard one.

139
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,105
- Sounds more like...

140
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,542
- Oh, you got me.

141
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,109
Yeah, my pain level
is jazz hands.

142
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,850
You know what?
even if you are right,

143
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:15,853
and I am in otherworldly pain,

144
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,508
I've got physical therapy
right after work.

145
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,510
- That's in nine hours.
Why don't you see if Ligon

146
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,120
can squeeze you in
for a quick session?

147
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,426
Just so you can
get through the day.

148
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,514
Hm?

149
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,444
- What's wrong?

150
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,185
- This time,
I should be on top.

151
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,538
- I, of course, say that
from a therapeutic standpoint.

152
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,412
- Ms. Richards.

153
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,717
Welcome to New Amsterdam.

154
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,719
- Thrilled to be here.

155
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:58,505
- Yeah, so I understand
that you were previously

156
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,724
at Mount Zion under Dr. Castro.

157
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,205
- Yes.
I'm embarrassed to ask you,

158
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:06,730
but would mind?

159
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:10,168
Could you just write,
"Warm regards, Molly?"

160
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,866
- Of course.

161
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,955
- It's an old co-worker.

162
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:17,915
We recently
lost a mutual friend.

163
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,787
I can't grip the--ow.

164
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,832
- It's not a problem.
There you go.

165
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,443
- Thank you, dear.

166
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,749
- I'm Dr. Sharpe.
I run the oncology--

167
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:30,450
Dr. Castro and I
head the department.

168
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,714
- I'm glad to see women
are running things here, too.

169
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:37,587
I was a partner
at Goldman and Fitch.

170
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,198
- Investment banking
Impressive.

171
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,765
I have a number
of patients in that field.

172
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,767
Almost all are men.

173
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:48,250
- We gals, as they called us,
were about one in ten.

174
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,861
It was great fun,
before I was sidelined

175
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,559
by this stupid disease.

176
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,691
- I can see
you're in a lot of pain.

177
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,780
- Dr. Castro warned me
this latest

178
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:01,002
experimental agent
might be rough.

179
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,961
- How many have you tried?

180
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,920
- I don't know.
Seven.

181
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,621
- How you feeling?

182
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,536
I was gonna make
a Floyd Mayweather reference,

183
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,972
but I don't think
sports is your thing.

184
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,670
- He was a boxer.

185
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,759
- Oh, was he?
Thank you for that.

186
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,979
Uh, Marquis, you have a heart
that's been working overtime.

187
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,807
Do you know
you have hypertension?

188
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:24,808
- Of course
my blood pressure's up.

189
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,549
I'm in the damn hospital.

190
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,246
You get me outside,
it's a different story.

191
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,683
- Well,
it's high blood pressure

192
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:30,684
that brought you in here.

193
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,989
- That's impossible.

194
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,991
I exercise every day.
I eat healthy.

195
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,863
- Your condition's been
developing for some time.

196
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:38,039
When's the last time you that
had a checkup or a physical?

197
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,736
- Not since I've been alive.

198
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,652
- Why go to the doctor
when you're healthy?

199
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,785
- Best time to go to the doctor
is before you get sick.

200
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,526
Blood sugar checks,
cancer screenings--

201
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,702
- And the added benefit
of missing work?

202
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,009
- How many guys I met today

203
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,794
have the same policy
on doctors?

204
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,057
- All of them.

205
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,286
- Hi, there.

206
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,766
- Stroller guy.

207
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,856
- Yeah.
Also known as Dr. Max Goodwin.

208
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,031
- Dr. G.

209
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,293
- That's cooler.
Let's go with that.

210
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,904
- Kenny.

211
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:17,905
Thanks for helping
my boy Quis out.

212
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,906
- Sure.

213
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,603
- How's he doing?

214
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,301
- It's tough to say,
but just glad I was there.

215
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,303
- Marquis is one
of my best customers.

216
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,044
How about I give you
a trim free of charge?

217
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,742
- You know what?
I actually...

218
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,048
I have a free service for you.

219
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,659
- What kind of service?

220
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:35,836
- What do you think
about Kenny's Kuts

221
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,099
having its own
in-house physician?

222
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,889
- So you want to set up
in my shop?

223
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,499
- Uh, yeah.

224
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:48,631
I want to give consultations
to your customers,

225
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,328
free of charge.

226
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,287
- Yeah, but, like, here?
Like, inside the shop?

227
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,331
- Right here.

228
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,637
- Look, Doc, the only cutting

229
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,640
that goes on inside
this clinic is hair.

230
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,468
- Look, Marquis
is your customer, right?

231
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,645
He just had a cardiac emergency
due to unchecked hypertension.

232
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,430
But what if he had a doctor
checking his blood pressure

233
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,868
every so often, say,
every time he gets a haircut?

234
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,173
- I feel you,
but what makes you think

235
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,566
all of my customers need help?

236
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,134
- Three in four African
American men develop

237
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,875
high blood pressure
by the age of 55,

238
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:20,315
and are twice as likely
to die from cardiac disease.

239
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,665
- I don't know, man.
Not buying it.

240
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,276
- Look, it's not gonna
cost you a thing, all right?

241
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,669
Once a week,
I'll spend an hour in the back,

242
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,410
and if anybody wants

243
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,325
to get their blood pressure
checked, I'm here.

244
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,457
And if it's high,
I give them a pill.

245
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,198
- What you think, man?

246
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,504
- I don't know.

247
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:39,160
White guy in the back,
handing out pills?

248
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,683
That doesn't look too good.

249
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,382
- What's in it for you?

250
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,515
- I won't have to watch
another 14-year-old girl

251
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,299
think her dad just died.

252
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:49,692
- ♪ By standing on the wall

253
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,389
♪ Get your back
up off the wall ♪

254
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,174
♪ 'Cause I heard
all the people saying ♪

255
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,393
- Okay.

256
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,917
Mrs. Martone?

257
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,527
- Tessa.

258
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,920
And this is Xander.

259
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,225
- Hey, Xander.

260
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,705
My name is Dr. Bloom,

261
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,576
and this here is Casey.

262
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,709
Do you mind if I take
a look at your head?

263
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,672
Ooh. Okay, that is what
us doctors call a doozy,

264
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,675
but it's nothing
a few stitches can't fix.

265
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,590
So how'd this happen?

266
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,723
- He was doing his homework

267
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,725
when he started
to get frustrated.

268
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,945
Next thing I knew...

269
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,947
he was standing and banging
his head against the wall.

270
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,650
- Can we get
Dr. Frome down here?

271
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,573
- So here's the damaged area
of your heart.

272
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,575
Now there are two options.

273
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,751
We can tuck an internal
defibrillator just under skin

274
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:49,970
to shock the heart back
into normal rhythm

275
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,536
when it goes out of control,

276
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,496
or we can perform surgery
and take out the part

277
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,584
of your heart
that's causing the problem.

278
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,412
- I was fine this morning.

279
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,283
Now you want to cut into me?

280
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,458
Look, I'm a single father

281
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,504
with a daughter
to take care of.

282
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,725
Who's gonna take care of me
after open-heart surgery?

283
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,248
I won't be a burden to her.

284
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,598
- Wait, wait,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

285
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,343
Might be another option.

286
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,649
So you will wear this
all the time.

287
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,434
- Even in the shower?

288
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,784
- While you're sleeping,
eating, exercising, everything.

289
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,438
Now your monitor's gonna
transmit your heart rhythm

290
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,613
back here to the hospital.

291
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,745
If there's any more
troubling rhythms,

292
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,311
the hospital
will know about it,

293
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,399
and we'll be able
to coordinate a response

294
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,661
to the GPS in the device.

295
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,402
- Marquis,
glad you're feeling better.

296
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:32,882
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah, just so you know,

297
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,362
you can get full health care
from me at Kenny's Kuts.

298
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,624
- Wait, what?

299
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,712
- Yeah, I got a chair
in the back.

300
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,670
I'll see you there.

301
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:41,325
- Why would...

302
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,809
- Valentina,
I've just met Molly Richards.

303
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,419
- Dry as a martini, isn't she?

304
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,639
- She's suffering.

305
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,380
- She's been through a lot,

306
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,034
but she's a trooper.

307
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,819
- She mentioned how she's
on her seventh drug regimen.

308
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,647
- She's gone through all kinds
of medications

309
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,388
that haven't even
hit the market yet,

310
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,606
even phase one trials.

311
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:03,826
- So the drugs
you're giving her

312
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,828
are only to see if people
can tolerate them?

313
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,047
- That sounds like a judgment.

314
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,526
- If she's suffering this badly

315
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,093
and you don't even
know if they work--

316
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,487
- Molly's been breaking
barriers her entire life,

317
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,750
so even now,
with incurable cancer,

318
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,579
she gains satisfaction
from pioneering new treatments.

319
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,059
Gives her meaning
to her struggle.

320
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:23,063
- Mm. And it advances
your career.

321
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,542
- Excuse me?

322
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,936
- Are these treatments
helping her, or you?

323
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,636
- Helen...

324
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,551
she's my patient.

325
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,081
- Hello. Hi.

326
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,605
Hi, Xander.
My name is Dr. Frome.

327
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:47,522
I heard that you did a real
number on your noggin there.

328
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,089
Ouch.

329
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,787
You think you can talk
to me about why you did it?

330
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,359
- It's okay, sweetie.
Dr. Frome is here to help.

331
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,751
- Absolutely.

332
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,844
- I don't know.

333
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:10,806
- No?
That's okay.

334
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,677
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

335
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,730
- I don't know.
I just...

336
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,776
I just got mad,
and then I was, like...

337
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,911
Hurting myself.

338
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,609
- Well, that must've
been scary.

339
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,568
Have you gotten mad
like that before?

340
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,790
- I've been frustrated before,
like, with school.

341
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:39,879
- Yeah.

342
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,793
- My mom.

343
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,668
But never this bad.

344
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,583
- That's okay.

345
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,891
It's okay, Xander.

346
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,159
- It's like...

347
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,726
I'm mad all the time.

348
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,641
And I can't control it anymore.

349
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,776
- I bet that's hard.

350
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,437
- Xander, has your hand
been shaking like that

351
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,960
since you hurt your head?

352
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,701
- It's been like that
for a while.

353
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,625
- You two take it easy here.
I'll be back in a bit, okay?

354
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,627
All right.

355
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,547
Xander Martone
has neurological damage.

356
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,765
- From his head injury?

357
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,943
- No, worse.
From before the head injury.

358
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,727
- Okay, I'll run some tests,
and I'll page Kapoor.

359
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,815
- Okay.

360
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,602
- Code.

361
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:52,908
- V-fib,
outpatient heart monitor,

362
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,518
Marquis Cannon.
- Damnit.

363
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,694
Okay.

364
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,696
Let me through.
Make room.

365
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,612
- He just stopped and fell.

366
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,028
- Hey, Kenny,
- Hm.

367
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,204
- What's up with Nurse Jackie
down there?

368
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,032
- That's Dr. G,
here on his lunch break.

369
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,078
- So, what, you line me up,
and then Doogie Howser

370
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,428
down there amputates
my leg or something?

371
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,039
What, take out my appendix?
- You know what, man?

372
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,433
I think barbers
actually used to do surgeries.

373
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,087
- He's here for folks like
you who ain't been to a doctor

374
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,740
in a month of Sundays.

375
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,699
- Man, do I look like
I need to go to the doctor?

376
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,222
Hey, maybe I do.

377
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,268
I mean, these pythons
is a little sick, you know?

378
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,272
- What about that time
you busted your elbow

379
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,316
falling off your bike?

380
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,752
- Man, I wrapped it myself.

381
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,276
Let's check it out.
My elbow fine.

382
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,278
- Yo, anybody who's seen
your jumpshot

383
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,149
knows that's not true.

384
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,978
- Okay, okay, okay,
you got jokes.

385
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,284
Man, shut up, man.

386
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,068
It ain't like
you ever been to the doctor.

387
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,288
- Don't trust 'em.
Never have, never will.

388
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,725
- Look, guys,
I know it's a little unusual,

389
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,249
but I'm just...
I'm just trying to help.

390
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,208
- Doc, man,
do yourself a favor,

391
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,731
and go find you
some real sick patients,

392
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,254
like at a retirement home, huh?

393
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,737
- Actually, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

394
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,173
- Doc,
you ain't getting it, man.

395
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,132
Ain't none of us sick.

396
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,133
- Um...

397
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,048
it's just that...

398
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,181
untreated malignant
hypertension can kill you,

399
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,443
and as African American men,

400
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,489
you're twice
as likely to have it.

401
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,360
And, Damian, I mean,
how do you know you don't have

402
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,145
a small hole
in your heart right now?

403
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,494
You know, I mean,
you could be sitting here,

404
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,148
chatting with your friends
one minute,

405
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,758
and then the next,
you've thrown a clot,

406
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,803
and you're having a stroke,
you know?

407
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,284
Or, you, you could have
untreated type 2 diabetes,

408
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,548
in which case, I really would
have to amputate that foot.

409
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,770
- Aren't y'all supposed to have
bedside manner, or something?

410
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,772
- Yeah, I know--I didn't
mean to kill the vibe in there.

411
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:59,382
I just got carried away,
and I--

412
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,471
- My customers don't come here
to be threatened or shamed.

413
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,082
Okay,
especially by some stranger.

414
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,387
- I get it.
It won't happen again.

415
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,650
- Yeah, no kidding,
'cause you're not coming back.

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,176
- Fired in the first hour.
That's a new record.

417
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:21,361
- Okay, so something's
not working in my heart.

418
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,102
That's clear.

419
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,147
What' this thing
about the pacemaker?

420
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,366
That's the one
that doesn't involve you

421
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,324
cracking open my chest, right?

422
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,283
- Right,
but to be perfectly honest,

423
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,588
that option won't be curative.

424
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,156
- I want the pacemaker.

425
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,071
I don't want surgery.
- Weak.

426
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,073
There's a doctor telling you
to your face

427
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,379
there's a good
option and a weak option,

428
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,337
and you're going
for the weak option,

429
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,556
'cause he just said
the pacemaker is like

430
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,601
the midrange jumper
of medicine.

431
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,255
So do me a favor, Dad.

432
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,170
Finish at the rim,
or jack up a three.

433
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,085
Go for the cure or go home,
'cause I don't even want you

434
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
in my house
if you're not gonna play right.

435
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,139
- Looks like
I'm getting the surgery.

436
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,234
- Okay, let's start him
on Phenytoin.

437
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,584
850mg IV loading dose.

438
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,629
- Excuse me,
have you seen Dr. Bloom?

439
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,372
- Oh, you are not serious.

440
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,373
- Oh, there you are.

441
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,158
- Yes.

442
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,595
Here I am on the floor
I am supposed to be on.

443
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,596
Come with me.

444
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,868
Okay.
I know what's going on here.

445
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,261
- You do?

446
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:38,220
- Yes, I came to see you
twice yesterday.

447
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,352
I was desperate and hurting

448
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,396
and I was having
a good-hair day,

449
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,876
and you thought maybe this

450
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,269
would turn into
the kind of arrangement

451
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,444
where you could just
pop down here

452
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,141
any time
you had an itch to scratch

453
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,447
and I would service you
in between patients.

454
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,839
- That's not--

455
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:51,320
- But this...hey, this is not
about sex for me.

456
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,887
This is about
managing my pain,

457
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,456
and I come to you,
not the other way around.

458
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,289
- I need your help.

459
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,247
- How can I help?

460
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,206
- That's very good.
Um...

461
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,470
my first day at the barber shop
was not exactly a success.

462
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,906
I got fired.

463
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,908
- Yep.
Saw that coming a mile away.

464
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,345
- Did you?
Thanks for saying something.

465
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,913
I was thinking maybe
you could give it a shot.

466
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,523
- What makes you think
I can do any better?

467
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,266
- Well, it's just,
you know, I think my particular

468
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,313
complexion puts me at a slight
disadvantage, shall we say,

469
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:31,404
that maybe you won't encounter
for various reasons.

470
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,666
- It's 'cause I'm black.

471
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,276
- It's because
you're black, yeah.

472
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,930
- Right, and you want me
to bail you out

473
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,237
with a group of people
who don't trust you.

474
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,368
- If you wouldn't mind.

475
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,675
- Except the problem isn't you.

476
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:44,199
I mean, well, it's always just
a little bit of you, but...

477
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,375
it's things like the Tuskegee
Syphilis Experiment.

478
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:48,986
Henrietta Lacks, experimental
surgeries on slaves.

479
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,597
Those kind of things
are the things that cause

480
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,512
black people to take pause

481
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,645
whenever a doctor like yourself
comes around asking to help.

482
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,648
- Yeah.

483
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,694
What are you telling me,
not to help?

484
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,695
- I'm telling you
that it doesn't matter

485
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,349
who you send in there.

486
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,481
They're not a part
of their community,

487
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,700
they're gonna be
met with a block.

488
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:07,788
- Right.

489
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,530
Right.

490
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:11,966
- Max, I know that face.

491
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,315
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

492
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,360
- Thank you.

493
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,726
- Dr. Sharpe.

494
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,425
- Bearing gifts.

495
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,340
- If you're really
the head of the department,

496
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,387
surely you have people
to do that for you.

497
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,736
- Co-head.

498
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,565
And I like seeing patients.

499
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,568
Make sure they're being
taken care of properly.

500
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,439
- Control freak, huh?

501
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,399
Me, too.

502
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,579
- Molly...

503
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,320
do you mind
if I call you Molly?

504
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,060
- No.

505
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:06,368
- How did you lose your friend?
From the letter.

506
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,327
- Stupid accident.

507
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,679
I confess.
Part of me envies her.

508
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:18,380
Life, fine.

509
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,600
Death, at this point...

510
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,384
fine, too.

511
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,780
- It's the middle ground,
waiting for death,

512
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,825
that's...

513
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,436
humiliating.

514
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,834
- So why are you continuing
with the treatments?

515
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:43,057
- Dr. Castro said my tumor
is a good one for study.

516
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,756
Some genetic variant makes
it deliciously interesting.

517
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,629
- So you like being
part of the process.

518
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,370
You find it satisfying.

519
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,373
- I used to.

520
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,510
- Molly.

521
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,516
Has Dr. Castro ever
talked to you about hospice?

522
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,127
- Hospice?

523
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:13,348
The trial...

524
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,395
someone else is still
pulling the strings.

525
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:26,970
I miss being in control,
especially now.

526
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:29,712
At the end.

527
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:39,896
- Your son's CT is clear.
That's the good news.

528
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,160
But his blood work revealed...

529
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,902
extremely high levels
of lead toxicity.

530
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,601
- Lead?

531
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,429
What does that mean?

532
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,865
- Well, this level
of exposure affected

533
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,475
every one of Xander's organs.

534
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,564
It's the reason
for the impulse control,

535
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,436
the violent emotional swings,
also the hand tremors.

536
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,480
All of it.

537
00:23:58,524 --> 00:23:59,481
- But we caught it early.

538
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:00,700
We'll get him started

539
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:01,875
with the chelation
therapy right away.

540
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:02,876
- Absolutely.

541
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,573
- How was he exposed?

542
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,619
- Most likely in your home.

543
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,708
- But I have notified the city
to come out and test your home.

544
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,625
Unfortunately, full disclosure,
they are a little backed up.

545
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,018
It could be a few months.

546
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,717
- So I'm supposed to go
back home and just

547
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,892
hope that it's safe?

548
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,676
- No.

549
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,199
For Xander's sake,
you can't take him

550
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,201
back until it's cleared.

551
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,905
- Where am I supposed to go?

552
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,950
I don't have anywhere else.

553
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,520
- Perhaps we could help.

554
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,193
No lead.

555
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,455
Has your turned red anywhere?

556
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,761
- Nope.

557
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:04,590
So we will have to test
Xander's school

558
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,766
and all of the parks
that he likes to play in.

559
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:07,984
And by we,
obviously I mean the city

560
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,987
whose job this actually is.

561
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,643
- Yeah, you good right there.

562
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:19,213
- Let me see
one of those swabs.

563
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,520
- Uh, okay.

564
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:28,004
- Look. Lead.

565
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,791
- What are you,
some sort of lead magician?

566
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,488
How did you know that?

567
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,577
- That overpass
has been repainted.

568
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,579
They would've had to scrape
off all the older

569
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,276
layers of the lead paint.

570
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,539
- Oh, yeah.

571
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,587
So if Xander's house
had exposure to lead,

572
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,241
then so will
all of his neighbors.

573
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,635
- And their neighbors.

574
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,639
- The city poisoned
this whole neighborhood.

575
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,608
- Still got time for that cut?

576
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:07,653
- Hey, yo, doc,
I thought I made

577
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,915
myself clear this morning.

578
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,699
- Yeah, no, you were.
It's just a cut.

579
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,614
- Nah, man.

580
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,442
I had to spend the rest
of the day taking shots

581
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,922
from everybody 'cause of you.

582
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,795
- Sorry. I tend to have
that effect on people.

583
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,885
- You know how hard I worked
to gain those people's trust?

584
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,409
Hm? Make them feel safe?

585
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:29,152
Everybody who comes to my shop
has something to worry about.

586
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,851
Their jobs, their family...

587
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,722
and, yeah, their health
probably should be

588
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,204
on that list, but people have
a hard enough time as it is.

589
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,815
- What if there's a way
to keep them safe...

590
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,035
and healthy?

591
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,647
- You didn't come here
for a cut, did you?

592
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:48,955
- Not really, no, 'cause
I really that your customers

593
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:52,698
don't need some doctor from
the hospital down the street.

594
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,874
They need someone
they trust and respect,

595
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,440
someone they know has
their best interest at heart.

596
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:57,441
They need you.

597
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,747
- They already got me.

598
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,010
- Well, I'm thinking bigger,
Kenny.

599
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,446
I'm thinking
you could be the one

600
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,926
keeping your community healthy.

601
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,845
- So, what,
you want to make me a doctor?

602
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:17,113
- Look, how about you give me
that free cut...

603
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:19,202
and we can talk?

604
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,861
If I don't like your plan,
I'm charging full price.

605
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:26,949
- Deal.

606
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,041
- The defect is sub-aortal.

607
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,219
- Blood pressure.

608
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,787
- Maintain monitoring.

609
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,789
All right, suction.

610
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,749
Duke, what do you see?

611
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:46,926
- The left ventricle's dilated.

612
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,275
- That's right.

613
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,016
The heart wall's much thinner
than I expected.

614
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,148
I'm gonna have to go
slow and careful.

615
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,020
Tell the scheduling nurse
we'll need more than two hours.

616
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,282
How long will you need?

617
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:58,024
- Uh...six hours or more,
and page Max.

618
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,242
All right,
let's go ahead and start

619
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,244
the endoventricular
circular plasty.

620
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,246
- You sure about that?

621
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,772
Why not do
the McCarthy technique?

622
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:15,824
- We'll do exactly as I said.

623
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:16,912
Is that clear?

624
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,264
Suction.

625
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,962
- Thank you for coming down,
Mr. Laettner.

626
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,833
- Oh, Nathan.
Nathan's fine.

627
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,095
- Good, good, good, you know,
it's not every day we have

628
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,575
the Deputy Comptroller

629
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:30,099
of the City of New York
in our midst, so.

630
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,275
- We wish to speak with you
about the lead contamination

631
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,016
in the local neighborhood.

632
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,845
- Yes, you see, Nathan,
the Cross Bronx Expressway

633
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,064
was built before 1972.

634
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,587
I don't know
if you're aware of that.

635
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,241
And this is the part
that's just bananas to me.

636
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:44,287
Back then, the city
only used lead-based paints.

637
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,941
- The city is fully aware
of that fact, Dr. Frome.

638
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,290
- Oh, are they?

639
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,858
- Yeah, my office is actively
engaged in replacing

640
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:52,948
all lead-based paints on public
works with safer alternatives.

641
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,950
- Yeah, for which the city
is eternally grateful,

642
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,257
but if your workers
had done so properly,

643
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,956
we wouldn't be here treating
them.

644
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,871
- Yeah.

645
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,960
You see, Nathan,
when the city workers

646
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,309
were sandblasting
the lead-based paint

647
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,007
off that overpass,

648
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,793
they must not
have sealed the blast zones.

649
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,622
Toxic airborne particles
managed to pollute

650
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,102
the entire neighborhood,

651
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:18,582
every yard
over a six-block stretch.

652
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,976
- So it appears your office
has a huge cleanup job

653
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,849
on your hands,
and a temporary housing crisis.

654
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,241
- You're probably
gonna expect to cough up

655
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,982
a pretty hefty settlement
on this one.

656
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,204
- That lead could've come
from anywhere.

657
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,860
Occupational exposure, food,
structures in the neighborhood,

658
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,209
they were all
built before 1972.

659
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,037
The city is not responsible
for this mess.

660
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:42,824
And you have no proof
that says otherwise.

661
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,225
- He's seizing.

662
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,358
- Push 2mg of ativan.

663
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,450
Bloom?

664
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,368
- I'm fine.
Get back to the patient.

665
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,196
- Just lean on me.
- No, I said I'm fine.

666
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,197
- Damnit, Lauren,
just lean on me.

667
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,243
- I am fine.

668
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,208
- Lap pad.

669
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:27,216
- Tissue strength is lower than
expected.

670
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,391
- How is he?

671
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:30,263
- He's fading, Max.

672
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,221
I'm gonna be honest.
So am I.

673
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,049
- Well, you want me to call
Flores so you can take a break?

674
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:36,660
- If I can get
a stitch to hold, I'd be done.

675
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,966
- Per the standardized
calculations.

676
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,012
- The sutures
just keep pulling through.

677
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,144
I can't the walls
of his heart together.

678
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,017
- How can I help?
Say the word.

679
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,195
You can prepare his daughter.

680
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,980
In case.

681
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,939
- We'll leave nurses scrubbed
in.

682
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:03,687
- You wanted to see me?

683
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,951
- Yes.
Thank you, Jules.

684
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:15,134
Molly, are you depressed?

685
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,962
- Depressed?

686
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,267
No.

687
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,967
I'm a lot of things,
but that's not one of them.

688
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,016
- Do you still find meaning
in your life?

689
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,019
- No.

690
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,372
- And how would you describe
the quality of your life?

691
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,336
- Lacking...

692
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:44,424
quality.

693
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,515
Why are you asking me this?

694
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:05,271
- These are extremely
powerful painkillers.

695
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,362
They're very good
at what they do.

696
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,064
But if you take
too many of them,

697
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,285
your breathing will slow...

698
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,287
and you will die.

699
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm gonna leave the room now.

700
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,170
If they're gone when I return,

701
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:37,216
there will be
no questions asked.

702
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,531
This is your choice.

703
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,491
No one else's.

704
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,147
You're in control.

705
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,968
- Harmony, your...

706
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,970
your dad needs
a little more help,

707
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,059
and...

708
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,105
it might be more
than we can give.

709
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,805
Is there someone
I can call for you?

710
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,114
- No one but me and my dad.

711
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:55,424
- Okay, well, I know that
waiting can be scary so...

712
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:58,079
if you need someone to talk to,
I'm here.

713
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,167
- I'm fine.

714
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,042
- Okay, well...

715
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,175
I'm just gonna sit here, too.

716
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,048
If that's okay.

717
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,937
- I want to know exactly what
you said to Molly Richards.

718
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,157
- Why? Has something happened?

719
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,028
- She checked out
of the hospital

720
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,685
after 16 months of working
tirelessly on her behalf.

721
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,861
- Where did she go?

722
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:43,037
- What did you say
to my patient?

723
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,040
- Okay, first of all,
Valentina,

724
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,042
she's not your patient.

725
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,913
She is our patient.

726
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:52,046
There are no sides
in this department.

727
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,874
But yes, I did speak with her.

728
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,180
- Of course, you did.

729
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:57,051
- And I told her
that I thought you were doing

730
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,792
an extraordinary job,

731
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:01,011
but if her pain
had become too great,

732
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,796
I knew that you
would understand if she chose

733
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,190
not to continue treatment,
because has a physician,

734
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,192
there is no way
that you would put a drug trial

735
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:11,848
or scientific discovery ahead
of the needs of your patient.

736
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:15,243
And I am certain
that she appreciated that.

737
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:22,250
- Next time one
of our patients has an issue,

738
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:25,210
I promise be equally
supportive of you.

739
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,483
- This is my last album.

740
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,746
- Oh, man, is that you?

741
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,095
Look at you,
you little tough guy.

742
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,270
- We're, like, four.

743
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:43,924
- Well, I don't care
how old you are.

744
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,143
Serving that attitude.

745
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,928
- Anything outside your house?

746
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,495
- Halloween, obviously.

747
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,193
- I love the wings.

748
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,282
Oh, my God.

749
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:56,937
I don't even know
what's happening here.

750
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,287
- They just grow up so fast.

751
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,550
- I been through
so many albums.

752
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:04,031
My battery's dying.

753
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,554
I don't think
I'm gonna find anything.

754
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,252
- May I?

755
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,169
I think you just did.

756
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,172
Dr. Kapoor?

757
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:19,089
- This looks like proof to me.

758
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,970
- Oh, hey, Andy.

759
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:30,971
Where's Ligon?

760
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,191
- Dr. Ligon's on vacation.

761
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,888
- Are you serious?

762
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:38,239
- I thought he went down
to the ED to tell you.

763
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,545
Would you like
to see Dr. Parsons?

764
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,850
She's also a miracle worker.

765
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,243
- No.

766
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,288
Thank you.

767
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,166
- Ella.

768
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,343
Ella.

769
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:01,349
I can't stop thinking
about the big news.

770
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,091
- Vijay--
- Don't Vijay me.

771
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,353
We are a family now.

772
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,313
- You haven't told anyone,
have you?

773
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,012
- Of course not.

774
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,450
- Okay.
Um...

775
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,889

- This is my OR.

801
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,262
Everything I do here
is for a reason.

802
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,177
It works for me.

803
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,354
Now out there on the floor is
a loving, peaceful democracy,

804
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,051
but in there,
it's full-blown dictatorship.

805
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,444
You got it?

806
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,011
- Understood.
- I didn't say you can go.

807
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,152
Run down
the McCarthy technique.

808
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:35,155
Top to bottom.

809
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,026
- Yes, sir.

810
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,202
You start by opening
the LV apex

811
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,466
at least 1.5cm
from the LAD.

812
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:43,337
Then,
using a purse string suture,

813
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,122
you pull together the damaged
left ventricular wall.

814
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,734
- Hi.
- We need to talk right now.

815
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:51,084
- I see you heard about
our plan to sue the city

816
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,346
over lead contamination.

817
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,391
- What? No.

818
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,392
What?

819
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,219
- Oh, then, never mind.

820
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,438
- I'm here because I heard
about your little plan

821
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,048
with the barber.

822
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,093
- Oh, yeah.
Pretty cool, right?

823
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,182
- No, no, not cool.
- Not cool?

824
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,227
No, I'm just training
a barber at Kenny's Kuts

825
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,100
to check his customer's
blood pressure.

826
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,102
- That's it?
- Yeah.

827
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:11,757
Mostly.
Here me out.

828
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,323
Kenny sees people once a week

829
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,413
in a relaxed
and trusted environment.

830
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,371
You couldn't ask for a better
monitoring situation,

831
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,201
and if anyone exceeds
140/90 for over four weeks...

832
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:24,030
- The barber
is diagnosing hypertension

833
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:26,249
and dispensing
prescription meds?

834
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,512
- With my oversight.

835
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:28,513
- What oversight?
You're not there.

836
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,123
You're here.

837
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,081
- Kenny has a detailed
checklist to follow.

838
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,302
- So do Legos, but no one's
life depends on them.

839
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,260
I mean,
what if mistakes are made?

840
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:40,394
- There's a built-in system
of checks and balances

841
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,309
that I'll be carefully
supervising,

842
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,571
and, sure, there's some risk,

843
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,486
but Kenny and the others
will be saving lives.

844
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,401
Just imagine--
- Wait, wait, stop.

845
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,229
What others?
You said others?

846
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,144
- Yeah. So far I've enlisted
seven barber shops,

847
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,538
and I'm trying for more.

848
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,236
- Max, what you're doing
is decentralizing

849
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,412
and de-professionalizing
healthcare.

850
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,848
- Exactly.

851
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,415
There's no reason
that healthcare

852
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,286
has to be delivered
in a hospital.

853
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,158
In fact, patients are best
served in an environment

854
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,551
where they're made comfortable

855
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:09,075
by trusted members
of their own community.

856
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:12,557
Hospitals have to go
meet patients where they live,

857
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,297
not the other way around.

858
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,561
- So in your idealized world,

859
00:41:16,604 --> 00:41:19,346
there are zero patients
at New Amsterdam?

860
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,434
- Ideally.

861
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,306
Yeah.
