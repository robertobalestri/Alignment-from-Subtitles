1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,441
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:07,355
- You should know
that I have always

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:08,530
found you to be insufferable.

4
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,619
- And I've seen
80-year-old stroke victims

5
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,317
improve their range of motion
faster than you.

6
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,667
- The board's calling a vote
to terminate Fulton's contract.

7
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:17,495
- It's done.
I'm out.

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,889
- Max. There was a brain bleed.

9
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:22,587
Georgia's in surgery
with Hartman.

10
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:58,884
- Let's keep dreaming.

11
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:02,149
- I'd love to.

12
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,238
- You could call in sick.

13
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,241
We could stay in bed all day.

14
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,678
- I remember those days.

15
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,680
- We were so bad.

16
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,294
- It was so good.

17
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:21,124
- I thought we'd have
more of those days.

18
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:24,171
I thought we'd have
so much time.

19
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:26,086
- I would've done
everything different.

20
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,481
If I knew.

21
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,961
- Start now.

22
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,963
Stay here with me.

23
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:48,412
- I gotta go to work.

24
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,631
- Maybe I'll come with you.

25
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,115
It gets so lonely.

26
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,508
- ♪ All your love is

27
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:01,817
♪ All your love is blind

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,603
♪ I'll sleep until
the day you're mine ♪

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,477
- Excuse me.
Helen, hey.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,741
I happened to get you
a cappuccino dry.

31
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,395
- Thanks. Another $3
knocked off your debt.

32
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,961
- How much do I have left?

33
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,529
- For the insanely expensive
non-refundable cleaning service

34
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,792
that I graciously sent
to your home and you rejected?

35
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,665
- That's the one.
- About 112 cappuccinos more.

36
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,971
- Well, what if I make it
a double or a triple?

37
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,147
I'm sorry, okay.

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,192
It was such
a thoughtful gesture.

39
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,193
- Yes, it was.
- I appreciate it.

40
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,455
I'm very sorry,

41
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:32,848
and will you please
accept my apology?

42
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,371
- Oh, God.

43
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,459
Accepted.
- Good.

44
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,808
- Are you ever gonna tell me

45
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:40,856
why you threw my wildly
generous gift to the curb?

46
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,292
- Oh, uh...

47
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:46,296
I just don't want strangers
in my house right now.

48
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,124
- ♪ All your love is

49
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,171
♪ All your love is blind

50
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,043
- She's tachy.

51
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,523
70/30, 130.

52
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,177
- Ms. Trombley,
we've been expecting you.

53
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,308
- I'm scared, Mama.

54
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,180
- I know.
It's okay, baby.

55
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,617
- Septal Q waves
in the lateral leads.

56
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,794
- On my count.
One, two, three.

57
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,362
- Kayla, I'm Dr. Reynolds.
I'm gonna take care of you.

58
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,717
We gotta get her
into surgery.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,154
- But now?
What kind of surgery?

60
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,938
- Mrs. Trombley,
Kayla's got an overgrowth

61
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,462
of muscle tissue in her heart,

62
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,507
and we need to fix this now,
or her heart could stop again.

63
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:24,595
It's often genetic,

64
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,988
so we should
get you checked, too.

65
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,817
- If you need to contact
anyone, family, her father--

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,427
- No, he's passed on.

67
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:33,038
- Okay, she's all set.

68
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,257
- She's all I have.

69
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,390
- We've got her.

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,829
- She's in good hands.

71
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,832
- That's my baby.

72
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,531
- Stay strong, okay?
You need to stay strong.

73
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,533
- It has been my honor
to assist you

74
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:52,232
in managing
your physical issues, Nathan.

75
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,277
But for your emotional needs,

76
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,018
I can think of no one better
than Dr. Iggy Frome.

77
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,280
- Hi, there.
How you doing?

78
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,238
You must be Nate.
- Sir.

79
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,022
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

80
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,197
So Dr. Kapoor tells me

81
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,548
you would like to join
our merry band.

82
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,942
- Well, he thinks
it might be a good idea.

83
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,814
- Nathan has done
two tours in Afghanistan.

84
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,555
I believe your PTSD
support group

85
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,557
can be the perfect
medicine for him now.

86
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,994
- I agree.
So when did you get back?

87
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,518
- A year ago July.

88
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,259
- You know, a lot of our folks
were in Afghanistan.

89
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,608
Iraq, as well.

90
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,610
We have a colonel in there
who began his service

91
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,828
in the first Gulf War.

92
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,916
We have a captain
from the second--

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,528
- Sir,
I'm not really clear why...

94
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,486
I mean, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here, but--

95
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,922
- You're not alone here,
Nathan.

96
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,621
- No, not by a long shot.
We're all about support.

97
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,579
It's just a safe space
for you to share your truth

98
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,146
with folks who lead with love.

99
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,756
- You call yourself a Marine?

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,367
Everything,
everything you're saying,

101
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,498
complete betrayal
of leadership.

102
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,674
- My leadership betrayed me.

103
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,198
All I ever wanted was to be
a Marine like my dad.

104
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,809
I was a true believer,

105
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,115
but we were betrayed in Iraq,
sir!

106
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,334
The purpose of our mission--

107
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,684
- It wasn't your job
to question the purpose.

108
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,208
It was your job
to accomplish the mission.

109
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:59,429
The only reason, only reason
I came to this crap show

110
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,952
is 'cause my wife insisted,

111
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,607
but I don't have to stand here
and listen to this

112
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,174
sad sack
Monday morning quarterback.

113
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,308
- Okay, Quinn,
take a breath.

114
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,788
Take a deep one.
Okay?

115
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,137
We've talked about this,
haven't we?

116
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,443
- Yeah.
- Yes.

117
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,358
Amalia has a different
experience than you.

118
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,968
That's it.

119
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,143
But you two fought
for the same country.

120
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:19,971
That is what binds you.

121
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,192
That is such a load of crap.

122
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,065
- Is it?

123
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,507
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

124
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,074
- Oh.

125
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,946
You don't know our experience.
You don't know.

126
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:53,353
You don't know the pain
of losing a part of you...

127
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:57,008
while so many
of your friends never...

128
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,585
No, there's no words.

129
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,596
- Actually, there are.

130
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,732
And to give us those words...

131
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,256
we are gonna try something new,

132
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:31,391
and yet something
that is thousands of years old.

133
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,091
We're gonna put on a play.

134
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,098
- Elizabeth, sorry to keep you.

135
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,709
- No problem.
I was just running laps.

136
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,407
- Meet Dr. Juan Questa.

137
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,321
Juan, meet Elizabeth Archer,

138
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,585
my long-time patient
and office Olympian.

139
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,631
Hello, Elizabeth.

140
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,547
- Never a great sign
when a new doctor shows up.

141
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,722
- Today is an exception.

142
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,681
Juan isn't an oncologist.

143
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,465
He's an orthopedic surgeon.

144
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,988
- The back pain
you're experiencing

145
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,251
is from where your osteosarcoma
was removed.

146
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,427
- But this isn't a recurrence.

147
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,732
We've examined your PET scan,

148
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,168
and you are cancer-free.

149
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,566
Wow.

150
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,960
That's great.

151
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,875
So...

152
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,616
why two doctors?

153
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,925
- Now when the tumor
was taken out,

154
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,754
a metal plate
was installed for stability.

155
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,408
Unfortunately, it's moved.

156
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,931
That's what's causing
your discomfort.

157
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,717
- Fixing it
will require another surgery.

158
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,503
But you are in great hands
with Dr. Questa.

159
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,989
- Is this my fault?

160
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,773
- Not at all.

161
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,601
- Did I move in some way
that I shouldn't have?

162
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,124
I do a lot of stretching.

163
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,952
- No, it's been 10 years.

164
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,955
Over time, the body shifts,
and hardware can shift with it.

165
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,959
- But if I'd gone
to the doctor sooner,

166
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,831
I might never have needed
the plate at all,

167
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,311
and maybe the tumor
wouldn't have grown so big.

168
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,052
- Liz...

169
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:12,056
nothing that's happened
is your fault.

170
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,536
We've talked about this.

171
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:19,760
- And why ask why,
and, man, it's hard to stop.

172
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,767
Okay.

173
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:32,120
Let's do some surgery.

174
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:38,039
- Ordering six units
of FFP to augment hemostasis.

175
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,693
- Plate removed.

176
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,956
- Diagrammatic
exclusion normal.

177
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,175
- Where is the scar tissue?

178
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,525
- Excuse me?

179
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,352
- Look.

180
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,531
- Trish, number four should be
right on the tray.

181
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,883
- Page Max.

182
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,538
- This is the site
of her previous surgery.

183
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,365
- Not a lot of damage.
- Exactly.

184
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,890
If a sizeable tumor had been
removed from this area,

185
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,109
a large chunk of spinal cord
would've been taken with it.

186
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,459
You'd see a ton
of irregular scar tissue.

187
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,939
Instead,
there's just one clean cut.

188
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,813
- Cancer didn't put her
in a wheelchair, Max.

189
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,250
It looks like her surgeon did.

190
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,864
- She must've had
multiple scans since then.

191
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:22,605
Surely, someone would've seen--
- No, not with the plate.

192
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,694
The plate made it impossible
to give her an MRI

193
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,566
and created too much
artifact on a CT scan

194
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,697
to see the area clearly.

195
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,872
- But there was
a structural reason

196
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,787
for the plate
to be there, right?

197
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:36,706
- None that I can see.

198
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,188
- So we did this.

199
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,278
A New Amsterdam doctor
cut her spinal cord.

200
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,542
- And put a plate
inside her to cover it up.

201
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,989
- She did have cancer.
That was real.

202
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,121
- Yeah, but that's not
what put her in the chair.

203
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,557
We did,
and she deserves to know that.

204
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,645
- She will.

205
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,386
We are absolutely
gonna tell her.

206
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,387
- Now.
- Max,

207
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,606
we need to see the op report.

208
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,216
We need to speak
with the original surgeon.

209
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,348
- There's no reason that
we can't tell her right now.

210
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,523
- We don't have all the facts.

211
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,655
And if we're wrong
about any of this,

212
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,832
if we give her
more misinformation...

213
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:16,877
let's take the day.

214
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,226
24 hours to get at the truth,

215
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:21,185
and then we will talk
to her together.

216
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,669
- All right.

217
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:31,065
Septal wall muscular overgrowth
isolated and resected.

218
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:33,589
Ready for pathological
confirmation.

219
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,809
Heart should be repaired now,
Dr. Duke.

220
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,114
It's closing time.

221
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,072
- 5-0 Prolene on a stick?

222
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,290
- That's right.

223
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,989
- Got an IV
of normal saline going.

224
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,208
- Floyd,
this is not cardiomyopathy.

225
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,297
- But Makayla's heart
was hypertrophied.

226
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,430
- Absolutely,
and you were right to operate,

227
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,693
but it's because
of an infiltration

228
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,348
of abnormal blood cells.

229
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,611
I'm afraid this girl
has leukemia.

230
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,794
- Leukemia.

231
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,363
- Fortunately,
we caught it early.

232
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,453
But she will need
a bone marrow transplant.

233
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,847
- And I can't help her?

234
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,153
- Well,
your blood type isn't a match.

235
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,633
AB positive is pretty rare.

236
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,462
I did put Makayla
on the marrow donor registry,

237
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,985
but I gotta be honest with you.

238
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,508
It could take months.

239
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,470
- So you need a blood relative?

240
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,777
- If we can find someone
that is a match,

241
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,996
the odds will be
much stronger than waiting.

242
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,754
- You know, I've never been
the type of woman

243
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:54,931
to beg a man
to be in his child's life.

244
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,329
Makayla's father is alive.

245
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:08,205
She doesn't know,
and I don't want her to.

246
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,427
If you need me to call him...

247
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,733
I'll find the strength.

248
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:17,737
- Or I can do it.

249
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,653
I mean, yeah,
if it...

250
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:22,654
if it helps.

251
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,531
Okay.

252
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,055
- This is a play by Sophocles.

253
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,840
- Phillock...tatas?

254
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,146
- No. Close.

255
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,539
"Philoctetes."

256
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,280
It was written
during the Peloponnesian War,

257
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,673
and it focuses heavily
on themes of disability,

258
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,719
loyalty, and forgiveness
all within the military.

259
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,808
It is considered
an ethical tragedy.

260
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,897
It was aimed to incite
a certain sense of duty

261
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,073
within the Greeks
during a time of war.

262
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,858
- Is it in English?

263
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,990
- As a matter of fact,
we are using one of my favorite

264
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,905
translations of all time.

265
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,039
Mine. Hold your applause.

266
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:02,346
Amalia, you will be playing
the role of Neoptolemus.

267
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,521
- Neo...what?

268
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:04,435
- That's good.
I like that.

269
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,741
We'll shorten it to Neo.

270
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,874
Neo was a once-dutiful soldier

271
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,050
who has a disagreement
with a ranking officer

272
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:13,662
and decides to finally
stand up and say something.

273
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,316
Colonel,
you will be playing Odysseus,

274
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,752
our commander.

275
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,842
But for ease of use,
why don't we call you Otis?

276
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,627
Otis wants to march
his warriors onto victory,

277
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,760
but he is confronted
with the fallout of a choice

278
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,762
he's made to abandon
one of his best soldiers

279
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,285
after he's been badly injured.

280
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,157
- Never abandoned anyone.

281
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,201
- I didn't say you did.

282
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,464
Now, finally...

283
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,553
Nathan, you will be playing
our title role

284
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,034
of Philoctetes.

285
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,732
Okay, and your character,
after being badly injured,

286
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,606
is ejected from the military
and left on an island alone.

287
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,304
The rest of you
will be my Greek chorus.

288
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,089
- Hey!

289
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,699
- I can't sing.

290
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:54,007
- Oh, I highly doubt that,
but you won't have to.

291
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,312
- How is this therapy?

292
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,574
- That's a good question.

293
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,794
As Nathan wisely stated,

294
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,798
he does not have the words
to communicate how you feel.

295
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,803
This play can give them to you.

296
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,502
Okay?
One last thing.

297
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,808
Curtain goes up at four.

298
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,941
- Wait, we're doing this
in front of people?

299
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,856
- Yes.

300
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,292
- At the tone,
please record your message.

301
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,469
- Mr. Bell,
this is Dr. Reynolds

302
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,514
from New Amsterdam Hospital.

303
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,386
I'm sorry to report
that your daughter

304
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,823
has been diagnosed
with leukemia.

305
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,912
Now she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

306
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:33,742
and we are calling relatives
to see if we can find a match.

307
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,136
I know that you are estranged
from your daughter

308
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,354
and have been for a while,

309
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,356
but...

310
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,576
she needs you right now.

311
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,231
You could save her life.

312
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,146
Be a hero.

313
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,278
Just by showing up...

314
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,279
which is something--

315
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,632
I wish my father had done.

316
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,161
- Pre-op labs, pathology.

317
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,990
- Surgical report.
Dr. was Gerald Tollman.

318
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,861
You know him?

319
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,951
- Nope. He left in 2011.
That was before my time.

320
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,823
- "During procedure,
I discovered a tumor

321
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,825
"strangling the patient's
spinal cord.

322
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,785
"It was impossible to remove
without transecting the spine.

323
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:20,093
Plate was necessary
to maintain stability."

324
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,095
- That's a complete lie.

325
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,052
Based on what Questa said.

326
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,271
Based on what we saw.

327
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,881
- Do you know
who else was in the room?

328
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,363
- Yes. We have Maxine West,
anesthesia.

329
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:30,625
Joe McGrain, scrub nurse.

330
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,844
Easha Bashar,
circulating nurse.

331
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,022
- What?

332
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,894
Intern was...

333
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,548
Clint Hartman.

334
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,203
- Max, Max--please,
whatever you're gonna do--

335
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,595
- He deserves.

336
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,774
- So I said watch it.

337
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,776
Jets tickets
are what you get your doctor

338
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,996
when you don't like him.
- Give us the room, please.

339
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,698
- Max.

340
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,924
- What is it?

341
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,977
- You lied.

342
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,678
Max.

343
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,375
I've told you again and again

344
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,029
that there was nothing
that I could do.

345
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,900
Georgia--
- I'm not here...

346
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,033
to talk about her.

347
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,384
- Okay, then, what?

348
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,735
- Elizabeth Archer.
Gerald Tollman.

349
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,870
You stood there while he put
her in a wheelchair for life.

350
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,089
Deny it?

351
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,399
- I can't.

352
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,665
Dr. Tollman
was the department chair.

353
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,624
It was my third surgery.

354
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:58,756
He made a mistake.

355
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,976
- A mistake?

356
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,066
And you kept his secret.

357
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:10,029
- He kept insisting
that I forget...

358
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,770
what I'd seen.

359
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,250
That's what doctors do.

360
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,774
That's how we take care
of each other.

361
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,995
I tried to believe him.
Wanted to believe him.

362
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,522
But I knew I'd never
be able to live with myself,

363
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,960
and so, unlike everybody else
in that room,

364
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,353
I reported him.

365
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,054
- You reported him?

366
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,098
- The next day.

367
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,795
- There's no record of that.

368
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,059
- I am not surprised.

369
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,104
- Sorry.

370
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,150
You reported a doctor

371
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,195
who covered up
a botched surgery,

372
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,503
and there is no record
of an investigation?

373
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,244
Who the hell
did you report him to?

374
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,160
- The dean of medicine.

375
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,597
Peter Fulton.

376
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,817
I told him everything.

377
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,167
Nothing happened.

378
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,215
- Oh, whoa, whoa, Otis.

379
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,217
I want you coming
from stage left, remember?

380
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,175
- Why do we
have to move at all?

381
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,741
- "Suit the action to the word,

382
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,134
and the word to the action."

383
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,657
It's "Hamlet."

384
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,355
Anybody?

385
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,140
Never mind.

386
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,315
From the same spot.
Go ahead.

387
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,969
- Up ahead, my lord.

388
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,320
Yonder is the cave
we doth seek.

389
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,148
Do you I really
have to say "doth?"

390
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,671
- Yes, you "doth."

391
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,764
Just, uh...

392
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,853
carry on, guys.
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

393
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,073
I'm coming.

394
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,338
- What do you think
you're doing?

395
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,818
- Theater.
- A Greek tragedy?

396
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,036
"Philoctetes?"

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,342
- Yeah.
I think it'll be healing.

398
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:47,996
- I think it's madness.

399
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,084
- Why?

400
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,521
- Iggy,
Nathan cannot play a soldier

401
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,089
injured in the war
and cast off by the army.

402
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,047
- Why not?
- Because he is a soldier

403
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:58,093
injured in the war
cast off by the army.

404
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,704
- He was not cast off.
He lost his leg.

405
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,054
- But you cannot make him
relive that experience.

406
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,274
It's too painful.

407
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,232
What about some other play?

408
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,842
Something lighter?

409
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,496
- Such as?

410
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,237
- "Mamma Mia."

411
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,412
- That's a musical.

412
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:15,197
- Okay.
"Mricchakatika."

413
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,199
I'm not familiar.

414
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,462
- It's a Sanskrit play
written in 4th century B.C.

415
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,639
by Bhasa.
It's a comedy, a joyful romp.

416
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,206
- Okay, I'm not interested.
I want to stick with Sophocles.

417
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,816
- I think it's a big mistake.

418
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,209
- Why do you care so much?

419
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,385
I picked "Philoctetes"
for a reason.

420
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,431
The text gives words
to these soldiers'

421
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,433
deepest and most vulnerable
thoughts and feelings.

422
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,043
That is why I chose it,

423
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,740
because that's what
they need right now, all right?

424
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,568
Did Nathan say that he
doesn't want to do this?

425
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,091
- No.

426
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,092
But he's my patient.

427
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,704
- Yeah, but he's my patient,
too.

428
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:45,793
- Oh.

429
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,236
- I understand
it took quite a while

430
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,411
for you to get back
on your feet

431
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,978
after your first surgery.

432
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,589
- Yes, but that's because
I wasn't taking pain meds.

433
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,289
- Yes, I spoke with your former
physical therapist, Dr. Ligon.

434
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,552
- He's the worst, right?

435
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,640
- Uh...

436
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,207
I don't really
know him that well.

437
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,210
- Well, you don't want to.

438
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:16,432
- Well, he agreed that you were
ready for a second procedure.

439
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,434
- Really?
So I'm cleared?

440
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,741
- Yes, but before we schedule,

441
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:24,527
we need to discuss
your post-op care.

442
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,486
You may have opted out
of the meds before--

443
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,314
- No, you know what?
I really don't need them.

444
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,532
Trust me.
I've actually been working on

445
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:30,664
some mental exercises--

446
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:31,708
- No.

447
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,842
- No?

448
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,975
- Dr. Bloom, I respect
your commitment to sobriety,

449
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,630
but won't be able to psych
your way through this.

450
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,850
- But I've done it before.
I mean, it was tough--

451
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,418
- This recovery
will be far more painful.

452
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,202
And certainly more important.

453
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,161
If drawn out, your mobility
could be permanently impaired.

454
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,119
There's no way
you can get through this

455
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,773
without painkillers.

456
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,298
So the question isn't whether
you will be taking medication,

457
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,170
but if you can find a way
to take it responsibly.

458
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:08,267
- He's been waiting for you.

459
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,616
- Can I help you?

460
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,531
- Yeah, are you Dr. Reynolds?

461
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:12,575
- Yes.

462
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,185
- Um...

463
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,710
I'm Makayla's dad.

464
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,105
- We'll need to keep
the incision dry

465
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,324
for at least 48 hours.

466
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,021
- Yeah, of course.
- And when she wakes up--

467
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,980
- I'm awake.

468
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,898
How'd it go?

469
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,511
Is the plate fixed?

470
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,993
- It was removed.

471
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,259
- I don't understand.

472
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,871
- Dr. Questa took it out.

473
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,918
- But if it's out,
how will I sit up?

474
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,141
- Well, as it turns out,
you may not actually need it.

475
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,840
- This doesn't make sense.

476
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,538
I can't sit in my chair
without the plate.

477
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:06,063
I have to be able to sit,
because if I can't do that,

478
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,543
I can't do anything.

479
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,765
- We'll have answers soon,
Elizabeth, I promise, but...

480
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:16,378
but for now, that's all
I'm at liberty to say.

481
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:34,918
- Ah.

482
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,619
Right.

483
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,536
Come on in.

484
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,327
- Uh, forgive the mess.

485
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,374
Had I known that
this was inquisition day,

486
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,418
I'd have tidied.

487
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,247
- A woman's in a wheelchair.

488
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,337
- And you think
that I put her there.

489
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,820
The man you should talk to
is Dr. Gerald Tollman.

490
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,038
- This isn't about
a rogue doctor.

491
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,257
This was a cover-up.

492
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,563
You put the integrity
of this hospital--

493
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,695
- The word I'm thinking about
isn't integrity,

494
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,784
it's litigation.

495
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,657
Cases like this
get hospitals shuttered.

496
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,919
So as I only have a few minutes

497
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,225
before I have to address
our board,

498
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,184
let me get ahead
of the 5,000 lawyers

499
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:26,013
who'll be coming for your scalp
by asking one question.

500
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,884
What the hell
were you thinking?

501
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:38,155
Are you smiling, Peter?

502
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,374
- I'm sorry.

503
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,768
I was trying
to dredge up my ashamed face,

504
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:44,466
but it just wouldn't come.

505
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,904
- Maybe you'd like to visit
Elizabeth's recovery room.

506
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,299
- Okay.

507
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,302
I'll put aside my pique
at your moralizing

508
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:57,392
and just focus
on New Amsterdam.

509
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,265
You're worried about lawsuits.

510
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,920
So if I had gone
after Tollman's license,

511
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:07,533
not only would he have sued,
he'd have won.

512
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,100
- Clint Hartman
was ready to testify.

513
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:12,494
- And who do you think
a jury would've believed, hmm?

514
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,975
Gerald Tollman,
chair of neurosurgery

515
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,325
with a list of accolades
longer than your arm,

516
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:20,459
or his 28-year-old
intern Clint?

517
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,113
- So your answer
was to do nothing?

518
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:25,507
- Oh, no, my answer was
pulling him from rotation

519
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,335
and getting him the hell
out of the hospital

520
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,381
and making sure that
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

521
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,605
No lawsuits.
No headlines.

522
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,955
The only trace is the grief
for Elizabeth Archer,

523
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,654
which by the way, I share.

524
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,352
And the knowledge that
because of my choices,

525
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,702
New Amsterdam
has a neurosurgery department

526
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,182
for you two to screw up.

527
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,445
- You should've gone
to the board.

528
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,843
- Dilettantes?
Billionaires?

529
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:58,322
- They were your employers.

530
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,542
- And not a doctor
among the bunch.

531
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:04,415
Do you know any of these
doctors, Madame Brantley?

532
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,547
Do you?

533
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,157
The doctors who,
if all this came out,

534
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,595
would've lost their jobs,
their professions?

535
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,510
I protected them.

536
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,644
I take care of my own,
and that is my legacy.

537
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,298
And man, I am proud of it.

538
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:21,215
- Your legacy is a profound
error in judgment,

539
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:24,305
which I can relate to
as I made one myself

540
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,568
when I didn't
fire your ass sooner.

541
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,230
- Ah.

542
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,014
The wrong end
of the Goodwin high horse.

543
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,929
Oh, how I missed it.

544
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,412
- I looked up to you.

545
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,677
- I know.

546
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,160
As a leader...

547
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:57,425
The only question
worth asking...

548
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,385
Is if the cost
of protecting New Amsterdam

549
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:05,085
is your conscience,
will your pay?

550
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,262
And if the answer is no...

551
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,395
You're not the leader
you think you are.

552
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,747
- St. Francis in Philadelphia,

553
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,270
Rose Hill in Portland,

554
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,098
County Children's in Chicago,

555
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,534
all hospitals
Tollman has worked at

556
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,796
since he crippled
Elizabeth Archer.

557
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,971
It makes you wonder

558
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,626
why he moves around so much,
doesn't it?

559
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,500
Makes you wonder, how many more
Elizabeth Archers are there?

560
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,765
- We do what we have to
to survive.

561
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,984
- You do.

562
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,423
I'm gonna make sure that man
never lifts another scalpel.

563
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,511
- Max.

564
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,953
Leaders makes choices
that keep them up at night.

565
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,956
If you're sleeping well...

566
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,958
you're not doing your job.

567
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,099
- Never really done anything
like this before.

568
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,058
- It's actually
a fairly simple procedure.

569
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:06,886
We'll give you
regional anesthesia.

570
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,452
That way,
you won't feel the needle.

571
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,066
- Is that her?

572
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,688
She got so big.

573
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,435
- I think we should
keep it moving.

574
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:45,402
- She was just a tiny little
thing the last time I saw her.

575
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,711
- How long has it been?

576
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,106
- I don't know.

577
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,849
11...

578
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,807
12 years.
12 years.

579
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:02,724
- You...

580
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,856
you still think about her?

581
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,988
I mean, even though...

582
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,686
- Your old man around?

583
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,602
- No.

584
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,261
- Maybe sometimes
that's not a bad thing.

585
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,747
- Hey.

586
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:26,966
- Hey.

587
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,750
- So, uh...

588
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:31,448
I got approved
for my second surgery.

589
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,757
- Gosh, that's...

590
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,889
that's great, isn't it?

591
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,804
- Yeah, yeah, it's great.

592
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:42,329
But Dr. Handler says that
I need to take pain meds.

593
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,287
It's my only chance
of a full recovery.

594
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,031
Being in the ED means
being quick on my feet.

595
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:50,380
I can't...

596
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:53,296
I can't risk my mobility.

597
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,343
But if I try to do this
without meds...

598
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:58,432
I don't know.
If...

599
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,913
if the pain is as extreme
as Handler says it is,

600
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,132
then...

601
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:06,788
Then I might relapse.

602
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,751
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know

603
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,795
because, you know,
my pee tests and everything--

604
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,101
- Lauren, we can modify

605
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,798
your workplace
monitoring agreement

606
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,539
to allow for prescribed meds.

607
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,456
But more importantly,
right now,

608
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,371
I think you need someone
who you can trust

609
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:27,678
and who can dole out
your medication responsibly...

610
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,158
and only when needed.

611
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,247
- You're right.
I'll call my mother.

612
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,731
- I would like
to be that person.

613
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,343
- Trust me.
You wouldn't.

614
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:44,304
- Your friend.

615
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,490
- We're doing it out here
in front of all the visitors?

616
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,144
- Um, yeah,
not just in front of visitors.

617
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,146
I invited staff, too.

618
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,844
Yes. Breaking out the uniform.
Nice.

619
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,759
- My wife brought it for me.

620
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,328
- Um, okay,
players, please.

621
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,285
Come into the round.

622
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,983
So...

623
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,462
when you are not up here

624
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,681
standing,
delivering your lines,

625
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,335
I'd like you seated
on the bench.

626
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,510
But most importantly,

627
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,599
remember that
you need to stay open,

628
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:22,429
present, and let Sophocles
be your voice, okay?

629
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,126
Where's Nate?

630
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,215
- Over there.

631
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,695
- Oh.

632
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,002
Okay, why don't you guys
play in the space, okay?

633
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,699
Feel it out.

634
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,744
Nate. Hey, we're about
to get started.

635
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,704
- I can't do this, Dr. Frome.

636
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:39,054
- Sure you can.
You just gotta read.

637
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,969
- No, I tried.
I can't.

638
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:43,711
It's too much.

639
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,193
- Well, we can't do this
without you, buddy.

640
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,412
- I know, I know.

641
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,676
But the play is me.

642
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,330
- Yeah.

643
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:59,596
- It's my experience.
It's my words.

644
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,687
I don't think I can say them.

645
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,472
- I...

646
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,430
I could say them for you.

647
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:09,606
- Vijay? What are you...

648
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:14,263
- If you will have me...

649
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:19,878
I will assume Nathan's role.

650
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,446
In his honor.

651
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:28,103
- That's--that's a real nice
offer, Vijay,

652
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:31,193
but this is
kind of for the soldiers.

653
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,326
You know what I mean?

654
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:37,808
Vijay--oh, okay.
Hang on.

655
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,767
- My friends.

656
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:44,206
I am Vijay Kapoor.

657
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,514
I was
in the 4th Indian infantry.

658
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,692
With your permission...

659
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,303
I would like to join
your company.

660
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,970
Why are you
telling me this now?

661
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:11,059
- Because I've seen you
question yourself

662
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:13,105
so many times.

663
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,976
And blame yourself.

664
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,501
Now you know that
none of this was your fault.

665
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:21,722
- It was ours.

666
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,595
- So everything
that happened to me was a lie.

667
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,816
- The tumor was real, but...

668
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,037
you didn't need to end up
in a wheelchair because of it.

669
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,131
- Every six months
when I come to see you,

670
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:42,656
you'd check on me, do a scan,
tell me I was doing better.

671
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:44,701
- And there's no way
that she could've seen this

672
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,007
without removing the plate.

673
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,751
- So you want a gold star for
finally telling me the truth?

674
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,406
- No.

675
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:54,494
No, we want--

676
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,322
- I don't care what you want.

677
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,671
Here's what's gonna happen.

678
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,368
- Elizabeth--
- No.

679
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,893
I'm gonna get
the most blood-thirsty

680
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,244
malpractice attorney
I can find,

681
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,551
and I'm gonna sue this hospital
back to the Stone Age.

682
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,869
- Where's Mr. Bell?

683
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:22,913
- Finished his donation
and left.

684
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,619
- Hey, Dr. Reynolds.

685
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,491
Thanks for fixing my heart.

686
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,058
- Anytime.

687
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:40,192
- Was it hard
to find a donor?

688
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,715
- You know,
sometimes it is,

689
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:46,024
but today,
we got lucky.

690
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,112
- Can I meet them?

691
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,159
- They want to remain
anonymous.

692
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,161
You know,
some people

693
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,424
just figure that
they're better at a distance.

694
00:33:58,427 --> 00:33:59,776
- I'll be right back.
Okay, babe?

695
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,039
- Okay.
- Right back.

696
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,132
- So getting the marrow
is the first step.

697
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,872
Now we have to use it,
all right?

698
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,352
To do that,

699
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:13,399
I'm going to have to wipe out
her system with chemo,

700
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:16,402
and then rebuild it
with her father's stem cells.

701
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,579
- Long road.

702
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:21,407
- But she's got great odds.

703
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:26,934
- Thank you for making
that call to her dad.

704
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,067
- You were right about him.

705
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,549
I guess I just wish
that he cared more.

706
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,247
You know?

707
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,944
That he'd hang around,

708
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:40,034
you know,
and just do the right thing.

709
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,081
- Well, he did.

710
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:45,257
He showed up.

711
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,826
We can all be grateful
for that, right?

712
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,871
- Hm.

713
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,063
- Aww.

714
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,238
I knew you'd come limping--

715
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,763
- Hose it down,
and listen up.

716
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,330
After my surgery,

717
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,592
I'm gonna have to take
pain pills.

718
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,594
And because
I don't trust myself,

719
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,292
I need someone else
to be in charge of them,

720
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,511
someone who
is gonna give me hell

721
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,600
if I ask for more
than I'm prescribed.

722
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,733
Someone who understands
that for addicts,

723
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,256
pain is safer than pleasure.

724
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,172
Someone who has a high
threshold for verbal abuse,

725
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,695
is unaffected
by human suffering,

726
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,001
and who might sadistically

727
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,177
enjoy controlling
my daily will to live.

728
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,353
What I don't need is a friend.

729
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,139
Am I crazy,
or are you my guy?

730
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,317
- Both, it seems.

731
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,754
- Good, so--
- Stop talking, Lauren.

732
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,059
Let me be clear.

733
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,193
I've been down the road
you're on several times,

734
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,195
so I know all the tricks,
all the excuses,

735
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,503
and all the lies.

736
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,158
You're not gonna
get away with anything.

737
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,209
- As the world's
most pathologically

738
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,776
honorable doctor,

739
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:12,605
I assume you've already told
Elizabeth Archer the truth.

740
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,346
- You assume correctly.

741
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,348
- Probably smart.
Too many people know.

742
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,351
It's bound to get out.
Better to get ahead of it.

743
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,487
- It's a big number.

744
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,186
- Big enough
to convince her to settle?

745
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,623
- Probably,
but I hope she doesn't.

746
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,059
- You want her to sue us?

747
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:33,582
- You and Fulton fought
like you're on opposite sides,

748
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,670
but you're not.

749
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,151
You're both advocating
for a cover-up.

750
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,371
The only difference
is you're writing a check.

751
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,069
- Better than gaslighting
the woman.

752
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,766
- But not as good
as going public.

753
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,551
I'm writing a new policy.

754
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:46,943
Total transparency.

755
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,249
I want to tell the world
about Tollman,

756
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,816
and let the chips fall
where they may.

757
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,732
It's the only way to prevent
another Tollman from happening.

758
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,516
- Well, he'll sue us, too.

759
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,823
- So let him.

760
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,520
- You're not thinking
this through, Max.

761
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,696
If we broadcast
every subpar doctor

762
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,263
and corner-cutting nurse
to the world,

763
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,960
our image will be in tatters.

764
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:06,485
We'll be the hospital
where you go to get killed.

765
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:09,531
- No, we'll be the hospital
that holds doctors accountable.

766
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,925
And we'll be the hospital
that sides with their patients

767
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:13,056
no matter the price.

768
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,233
I know it's not
a perfect solution,

769
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,930
and I know
there will be consequences,

770
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,280
but...

771
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,326
this is the only way.

772
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,288
- I hope so.

773
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,598
Our careers
will be riding on it.

774
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,303
- Soldier, do you dare defy me?

775
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,436
Do you not see
my hand upon my sword?

776
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,439
- I fear it not, sir.

777
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:50,093
Long have I marched
under your standard,

778
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,530
but today...

779
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:54,750
you turned your back
on one of our own.

780
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,710
Thus,
you turned your back on us all.

781
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,932
- My actions must consider
the many, soldier,

782
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:04,847
even at the expense of the few.

783
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,159
I stand by my choice,

784
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,988
for it is my charge
and duty to do so.

785
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,296
- Then I shall obey
your command no longer.

786
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,299
And for your soul,
I will pray.

787
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:27,261
- ♪ And never our strength

788
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,785
♪ Shall falter

789
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:41,797
- I had grown accustomed
to my station here.

790
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:47,150
Enduring it
as if lost in a dream.

791
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:49,327
- Your medical records.

792
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,373
- But today,
my eyes have been opened.

793
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,635
Today, I awake.

794
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,290
Too long
have I suffered adversity.

795
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:01,774
Pain from the actions of those
entrusted with protecting me.

796
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:06,518
Forging on,
my past shall not define me,

797
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:09,608
even as I stand
afeard a resurgence

798
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:15,701
of my true vulnerabilities.

799
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,185
The time has come
at last to abandon this isle.

800
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,275
To depart,
never to return.

801
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:33,371
Fare thee well,
O home.

802
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:37,592
Wait for my return no longer.

803
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,942
Onward I must proceed

804
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:43,337
with strength
in each footfall...

805
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:50,126
Evermore haunted
with the memories...

806
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,392
of the man I used to be.

807
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:01,094
For my old home...

808
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:04,532
is now behind me.

809
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:09,668
Faith is my new home.

810
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:46,095
- Guys, my players, everybody.

811
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,053
What a performance.

812
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:48,141
Wow.

813
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,453
I never knew.

814
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,196
- This wasn't something
I wish to speak about.

815
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,197
Until now.

816
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,373
- Come here.

817
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:13,427
- Who's there?

818
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,516
I'll be right back.

819
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,049
What are you guys doing here?

820
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,398
- It was her idea.

821
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,792
- I know that you said
you don't want strangers

822
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:35,188
in your house,
but we're not strangers.

823
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,972
And I am fairly certain

824
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,366
that you have a sink
full of dirty dishes.

825
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:43,152
- Just FYI,
I don't do windows.

826
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,632
- Lauren, you can barely stand.

827
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:47,983
- True, but I'm good
at giving orders.

828
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,815
- It's okay to let people in.
