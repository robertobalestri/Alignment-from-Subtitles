1
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:07,137
- Previously on
"New Amsterdam."

2
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,051
This may be one
of the last things I do.

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,313
- Max!

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:10,662
I am your doctor, Max.

5
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,186
I'm taking you off the chemo
and radiation.

6
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,274
I'm gonna find you
a different regimen

7
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:14,927
and I'm gonna save your life.

8
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,974
Could you, um, message this
to Dr. Valentina Castro?

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,410
- Max's DNA?

10
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,064
- I was actually here
to talk to Max

11
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,545
about extending my leave.
- For how long?

12
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:25,155
- Like, forever.

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,070
- You know I got you, right?

14
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,030
- The placenta previa
ruptured.

15
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,379
I was about to call 911.

16
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:34,382
- Max, the baby won't survive
another one.

17
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,861
- So we have to get her out.

18
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,778
- Luna.

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,917
Your turn.

20
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,574
- It's always my turn.

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,594
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,161
Come here.

23
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,555
I know, I know, I know.

24
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,689
Yeah.

25
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,910
Hi.
Good morning, Luna.

26
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,912
How you doing?
How you doing?

27
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,263
How are you feeling?

28
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,310
- Oh, not myself just yet.

29
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:19,269
- It's okay, 'cause
I'm all over baby duty today.

30
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,228
Oh, she wants her mama.

31
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:27,451
- Hi.
Hi, Luna.

32
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:32,456
♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,460
♪ There's something that
I just got to say ♪

34
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:40,334
- ♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

35
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:44,381
♪ I didn't mean
to run you away ♪

36
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:45,730
- Okay, Luna.
Hit it.

37
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:49,734
- ♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

38
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,780
- Hey, Max.
- How can we help?

39
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,825
- What's the key factor
in how much pain meds

40
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:56,045
we prescribe to patients?
- How much pain they're in.

41
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,177
Is this a trick question?
- Yes.

42
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,308
- I thought it seemed too easy.

43
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,266
- Well, the key factor
isn't pain.

44
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,571
It's race.
- Ah.

45
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,877
- When white
and black patients present

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,313
with identical levels of pain,

47
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,488
doctors tend to prescribe
the white patients

48
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:05,924
high grade opioids.

49
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,230
- And what do
the black patients get?

50
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,536
- A lecture on how
to tough it out

51
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,102
and a handful of Tylenol.

52
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,061
Wow, so everybody loses.
- Exactly.

53
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,236
That's why I want
New Amsterdam's

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,368
patient bill of rights
to guarantee

55
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,630
that each patient's pain

56
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:18,198
is treated equitably
and responsibly.

57
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,199
- Luna, if you think that's
a good idea,

58
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,156
go ahead and be super cute.

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,810
You're good.

60
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,295
- Who's that little Muppet?
Look at me!

61
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:30,514
Oh, let's see if I can touch
your nose with my nose!

62
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,907
Oh!
- Yeah.

63
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,387
Uh, how--how can I help?
Can you repeat it?

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,823
- Yes.
Sorry, Capitan.

65
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,694
Here's the sitch.
All right, come with me.

66
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,305
So, I'll give you one guess
what all those kids

67
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,045
in there have in common.

68
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,699
- They all just heard you do
15 verses of "Baby Shark"?

69
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,613
- Walked right into that one.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,224
- No, they are all transgender

71
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,529
and they have all been
denied medical care

72
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,270
thanks to these so-called
"conscience laws"

73
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,924
allowing hospitals
to just freely discriminate.

74
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,795
- Hospitals are denying them
transition care?

75
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,102
- No, hospitals are denying
them any care whatsoever.

76
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,887
So I'm proposing that
New Amsterdam starts a fund

77
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,021
to help shoulder the cost.
- A lot of art on these walls.

78
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,589
- Yes, Max, art therapy is
a big part of what we do here,

79
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,807
but I'm gonna need you
to focus up, okay?

80
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,983
- What if we create
an art show annually,

81
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,246
auction your patients' work,

82
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,551
and use that money to,
you know,

83
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,641
build the fund
you're talking about?

84
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,383
- Who's the best
medical director ever?

85
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,211
Who's the best medical
director ever?

86
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,734
Your daddy!

87
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:20,434
- 30% of doctors are over 63.
- Yeah, just one second.

88
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,131
Marsha, we had a bit
of grunting

89
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,394
after a morning diaper
and there is an extra bottle

90
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:25,656
in there in case she has
a sudden growth spurt.

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,745
Okay, I love you, baby.

92
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,921
You have a good day.
- See you in five minutes.

93
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,446
- Probably.
Uh, so doctors that are old.

94
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,099
What's the, uh, problem?

95
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,276
- Uh, we will soon face
an epidemic when they retire.

96
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,886
- Vijay, you're not trying
to tell me something, are you?

97
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,583
Are you hanging up your spurs?
- Certainly not.

98
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,324
It's not about me.
- Oh, well, then--

99
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:42,760
But you are over 60, right?

100
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,284
- Legally, I don't have
to answer that.

101
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,676
- Vijay, you look great.

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,374
I'm just saying
that if doctors

103
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,940
retire later
than most Americans,

104
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,638
then the problem is not
that they're leaving.

105
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,988
It's that they're sticking
around past their prime.

106
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,859
- What?
No, no.

107
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:57,906
You're twisting my words.
With age comes wisdom.

108
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,082
- Yeah, and declining
mental acuity.

109
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,693
Look, I--what we should do
is create new programs

110
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,217
for senior physicians
like mentorships, you know?

111
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,741
And--and lower patient loads.

112
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:07,959
In fact,
that's a really good idea.

113
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,440
Would you look into that?

114
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,312
- Senior physicians?

115
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,705
- The result speak
for themselves.

116
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,099
- I'm rarely at
a loss for words,

117
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,797
but, uh, wow.

118
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,756
- "Wow" works.

119
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,758
I want all my patients
to say wow.

120
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,934
Wow is my preferred reaction.

121
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,457
And I think they will.

122
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,850
With precision-targeted
therapy--

123
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:32,332
I mean,
you are the proof.

124
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,858
- Thank you, Dr. Castro,
for, um,

125
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:37,902
saving my life.

126
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,862
Thanks isn't really enough,
is it?

127
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,820
- It is for me.

128
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,606
Look at this.

129
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,172
By targeting your
defective DNA

130
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,827
and not carpet bombing
your entire body with chemo,

131
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,830
your tumor
is finally shrinking.

132
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,355
All three of your blood lines
are in their normal range.

133
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,445
- And I actually gained
a pound or five

134
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,837
but who's counting?

135
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:02,231
- I mean,
six more months like this

136
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,406
and you'll be cured.

137
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,062
Sorry.

138
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,892
Cured?

139
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:17,681
- Max, I know you've missed
Dr. Sharpe.

140
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,597
If she were here,
she would say the same thing.

141
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,470
You beat the odds.
You won the cancer lottery.

142
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,737
- Sorry, I gotta--I gotta run.

143
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,044
But, um, thank you,
Dr. Castro.

144
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,048
Thank you.

145
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,837
- Max.

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,447
Max.

147
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,972
Max.

148
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,895
- Where--where--
where's Georgia?

149
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,289
- Fractured left femur
and possible concussion.

150
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,943
- Give me Bloom's vitals.

151
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,249
- Alright, 110,
BP 150 over 95.

152
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,469
O2 stats at 100%.
- Georgia?

153
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,427
- Max.
- Huh?

154
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,602
- Max.
Hey, Max.

155
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:09,559
- What?
- You need to give me Luna.

156
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,734
- No.
- Yes.

157
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:11,779
She needs to be examined.
- No.

158
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,171
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

159
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,608
No, no, no.
- It's okay, it's okay.

160
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:15,565
- Why? Why?
- Just give me her.

161
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,697
It's okay.
I'll take her.

162
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,176
She'll be fine,
I promise you.

163
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,308
It's okay.
- Luna?

164
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,483
- It's okay.
It's okay.

165
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,658
Max.

166
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,574
Max.

167
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,923
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

168
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,273
Thank God.

169
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:31,712
It's not fair.

170
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:32,626
Where's Luna?
- She's fine.

171
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,062
- They're examining her.

172
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,411
They'll bring her back
in just a few.

173
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,674
- Max, your head.
- I'm good.

174
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:41,286
- I want a CT on both of them.

175
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,289
- Is everybody else okay?

176
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,470
- No, where's Sharpe?

177
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,297
Where's Sharpe?

178
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,128
Where's Sharpe?

179
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,831
- Max, take a look at this.

180
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,485
- Another case came in.
Alma Pearson.

181
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,964
She's a type 1 diabetic.

182
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,618
This morning she suffered
full-blown ketoacidosis.

183
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,577
It's her third one this year.
- Hey, Alma.

184
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,795
I'm Dr. Goodwin.

185
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,189
You wanna tell me
what happened?

186
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,630
- She's been rationing
her insulin again.

187
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,850
This time she could have died.

188
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:26,201
- Alma, I'm gonna help you,
but you have to talk to me.

189
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,032
- What's there to say?

190
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:35,123
When I was first diagnosed,
insulin cost $21 a vial.

191
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,255
Now it's $250.

192
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,041
I'm a substitute teacher
and I can't afford it.

193
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,874
I can't afford to live.

194
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,137
How can you help with that?

195
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,837
- Alma's the eighth diabetic
to come in this week.

196
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,535
One guy was trying
to make insulin on his own

197
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,320
in his garage.
- Hmm.

198
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,236
Who supplies our insulin?
- Uh, Pacentia.

199
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,890
- Pacentia.

200
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,022
Yeah, okay, Alma,
we're--we're on this.

201
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,807
Um, Kenmari,
I'm gonna go ahead

202
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,591
and green light your plan.
- Uh, what's my plan?

203
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:09,679
- Your plan to terminate
our contract

204
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,594
with Pacentia Pharmaceuticals.

205
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:12,726
- That's not my plan.
- No?

206
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,205
Maybe it was mine.

207
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,859
- Okay, Max,
how are we gonna buy insulin?

208
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:16,904
- We're not gonna
buy insulin anymore.

209
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,427
We're gonna make our own.

210
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,041
- Hey, baby.

211
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,826
- Good morning,
beautiful black woman.

212
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,176
- Oh, yeah,
6:00 a.m. with pillow creases

213
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:29,525
on my face?

214
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,700
- Especially with
pillow creases.

215
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,223
- Oy, keep talking like that,

216
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,616
I might just have
to marry you.

217
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,313
- Oh, that's gonna happen.

218
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,880
But right now I just need you
back from San Francisco.

219
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,055
I can't take it anymore.

220
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,362
- I know.
I know.

221
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,624
Two more weeks and counting.

222
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,886
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,105
- How much time do you have?

224
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,064
- Three minutes.

225
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,283
- You better make
the most of it.

226
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,240
- Mm-hmm.
Yes, please.

227
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,981
Thank you.

228
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:53,680
- Dr. Reynolds, we could use
your help in the ED.

229
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:54,724
- I'll be right there.

230
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,076
- Are you sure that
you have some time?

231
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,645
- I'm--I'm positive, all right?
We got 2 1/2 minutes.

232
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,908
- Dr. Reynolds?
- What, Nottingham?

233
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,431
- One of the interns
on our rotation

234
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,868
is always showing up late.

235
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:08,956
And when he is here,
I can't find him.

236
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,175
- Cut him.
- Seriously?

237
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,612
- Yeah, I don't got time
for dead weight

238
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,700
or interruptions.

239
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:17,138
- Okay, great.
Oh, hi, Evie.

240
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,269
What are you guys--

241
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,235
- Hey, love.

242
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,845
Just calling to check
on Raffi and Saleem.

243
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:29,803
Are they, uh--are they
at least trading off

244
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,195
with the barfing now?

245
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,937
- No, they're still
in perfect sync,

246
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:37,114
like two violently ill
figure skaters.

247
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,464
Now Sameera says she's sick.

248
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,944
- No, no, no, no.

249
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:41,815
She's faking to stay home
with the boys.

250
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,251
Don't believe that hype.

251
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,992
- Uh, I told her
to get ready for school

252
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:48,038
but the big headline
is head lice on Harper.

253
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,779
- Again?
Are you kidding me?

254
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,476
That kid's head is like
a cot at Rikers.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,218
I was having trouble
finding someone

256
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,742
to take care of the boys.
Now with Harper,

257
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,222
I'm gonna have
to cancel my patients.

258
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,486
- Ah, I'm so sorry, Martin.
I-I wish I could be there.

259
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,227
- Yeah, just promise
you'll be home by 7:00

260
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,665
to put everyone to bed
so I can start drinking.

261
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,015
Daddy?

262
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:10,495
- Sameera is not faking.
I-I gotta go.

263
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,715
Oh.

264
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,122
- Hey.

265
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,341
- Interesting.
Tweety Bird?

266
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,474
I always thought of you
as a Yosemite Sam kind of guy.

267
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,476
- Well, that's probably because
of my outlaw vibe.

268
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,175
And I am not seeing
any bathroom breaks on here.

269
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,786
- The residents are all taking
their board exam today

270
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,309
so we're severely understaffed.

271
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,006
I have everyone covering
three different wards.

272
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,052
It's an impossible day.
- No, no, no.

273
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,749
Nothing is impossible, Gladys,

274
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,359
as long as you get me out
of here by 6:00 p.m.

275
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,710
Oh, also can you, um--
can you find me some shoes?

276
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,407
- Shoes, yep.
Got it.

277
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,064
- I see the Mandarin lessons
are paying off.

278
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,719
- They started us with swear
words to get us engaged.

279
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,677
- Typical case?
- Impossible.

280
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,592
I've been working with
this woman for two years.

281
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,855
The worst rheumatoid arthritis
I have ever seen.

282
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,335
No--
- I can take a look.

283
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,032
- Uh, no offense,
Dr. Kapoor,

284
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,730
but she needs
something innovative.

285
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,035
Something I'm not seeing.

286
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,558
- You think as
a senior physician

287
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:14,908
I can't be innovative?

288
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,308
Hello.
- Ah, the hand off.

289
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,397
I was wondering when
you'd give up on me.

290
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,399
- Ms. Klestadt, it's not--
- It's okay.

291
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,749
I'm used to it.

292
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,404
So, what brilliant cure
do you have?

293
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,755
- I don't.
But I will.

294
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,757
By the end of the day.

295
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,628
- Dr. Kapoor, I've been working
with Ms. Klestadt for two years

296
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,977
and this is my specialty.

297
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,806
- I will help your
rheumatoid arthritis today

298
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,416
or I will retire.

299
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,901
- Uh, yeah,
all this stuff can come out.

300
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,860
Gotta make way for the new lab.

301
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,821
Chairwoman Brantley,
were you riding in the freezer?

302
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,431
- Asphyxiation
in a sub-zero box

303
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:03,217
would be preferable
to the earful I just received

304
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,436
from the CEO of
Pacentia Pharmaceuticals.

305
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,134
You terminated
our insulin contract?

306
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,526
- I did.

307
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,180
It's this funny thing
where I prefer not to buy

308
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,096
medication from extortionists.

309
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,620
- I and the rest of the country
share your indignation

310
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,971
but you can't just make
homebrew insulin.

311
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,450
It's not kombucha.

312
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,365
- This lab used to grow
thousands of cultures,

313
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,106
process hundreds
of specimens a day.

314
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,195
It's all perfectly safe.
- And that's for--

315
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,718
- Millions of E. coli cultures,

316
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,329
which is way less scary
than it sounds.

317
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,635
- What scares me are lawyers.
Insulin is patented.

318
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,856
- And yet my body is
making it right now for free.

319
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,902
The patent is on
how you make it,

320
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,295
so big pharma keeps changing
how they make it

321
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,950
every couple years
so they can file more patents,

322
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,213
thus keeping competition down
and prices up.

323
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,954
- We both know you can't make
enough insulin

324
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,738
for all of New York,

325
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:50,003
so cut the kabuki and tell me
what you really want.

326
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,874
- A seat at the table.

327
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,137
A sit-down with the CEO
of Pacentia

328
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:56,183
to negotiate prices down.

329
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:59,316
- A stunt like this doesn't
justify dragging New Amsterdam

330
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,493
into a billion dollar lawsuit
with big pharma,

331
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,582
the FDA,
and Department of Justice.

332
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,976
Now tell these people
to stop what they're doing

333
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,978
or so help me,
I will fire them all.

334
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,588
- You're bluffing.

335
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,982
- Try me.

336
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,899
- Okay, sorry, guys.
Change of plans.

337
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,032
Just set that down.

338
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,599
But you know what?
This isn't over.

339
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,558
- Sure it is.

340
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,043
- Kapoor, have you seen Sharpe?

341
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,567
- No, maybe she's here.
- She's not in the ED.

342
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,699
- Then where is she?
- I'll help find her.

343
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,359
- Call the morgue, have them
come collect the body.

344
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:45,449
- It's one of ours.
Died on impact.

345
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,513
- Sorry.

346
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,087
- I like your necklace.

347
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,873
I like your necklace.

348
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,788
- It belonged to a friend.

349
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:24,140
- Sorry if I intrude--
- No, it's--it's okay.

350
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:27,100
It was an accident.

351
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,666
We lost two of our own.

352
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:44,291
- Three, two, one.

353
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,206
Whoo!

354
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,381
Take a breath.
We did it.

355
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,904
We're done!

356
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,514
I know the dark
is scary, right?

357
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,168
I know,
but guess what?

358
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,216
Fear is a totally healthy
emotion that everyone feels.

359
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,218
- Even you?
- Even me.

360
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,697
Oh, yeah.
Especially me.

361
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,047
I'm scared of so many things.

362
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,005
I got a laundry list
of things I'm afraid of.

363
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,922
I got--I got sharks,
jellyfish, clowns.

364
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,446
In fact, whenever
I'm afraid of anything,

365
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,187
I have a little trick
that I use

366
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,972
to help me get past it.
You guys wanna know what it is?

367
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,757
Okay, visual aid.

368
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,802
Here we go.

369
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,979
Bridge Ignatius
in full effect.

370
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,589
Okay, cool.

371
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,808
Now, what I want you to do
is I want you to imagine

372
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,549
all of your fears floating
beneath me

373
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,116
right under
Bridge Ignatius here,

374
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,553
and then I want you
to imagine climbing over them.

375
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,468
Do you understand?

376
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,035
Can you see that?

377
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,906
Oh, okay.
Uh, yeah.

378
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,126
I said--okay,
I said "imagine," guys.

379
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,562
Imagine, but all right.

380
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,911
This might be a toll bridge.

381
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,435
I may have to charge you, guys.

382
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,437
All right, if this
is working for everybody,

383
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,438
I guess that's cool.

384
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,223
- No time for personal calls.

385
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,485
- No, no, no, just calling
Martin and the kids.

386
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,052
Gotta check in.

387
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,401
- You're already four minutes
late to group therapy.

388
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,623
- I used to go bike riding
with my girls.

389
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,712
I taught them,

390
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,844
running next to them
as they wobbled,

391
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,107
catching them before they fell.

392
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,543
- After the blood tests,

393
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,023
you will be bike riding
in no time.

394
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,416
- Well, the girls
are into rock climbing now.

395
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,419
But still.

396
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,596
- I'd love to be that kind
of mom again

397
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,251
before they don't
need me anymore.

398
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,210
You will.

399
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,343
- Nope.
- What?

400
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,519
That's not possible.
Check it again.

401
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,087
- It's a computer,
not an oven.

402
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,267
- But all of
Ms. Klestadt's symptoms

403
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,529
could be celiac disease

404
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,488
and not rheumatoid arthritis
at all.

405
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:38,666
- Well, her blood
and my computer disagree.

406
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:42,148
- Still wanna gamble your
whole medical career on me?

407
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:45,977
- With my experience,
it's not a gamble.

408
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:53,115
- Got a five O prolene stitch?

409
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,422
Can you get that for me?

410
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,859
- It's Evie.

411
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,817
- Is there a loving way
to ignore a call?

412
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,819
No?

413
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,474
- Excuse me,
Dr. Reynolds?

414
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,868
- Who is that?

415
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,304
Who are you?

416
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,655
- Michael Duke.
I'm an intern.

417
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,831
- What are you doing here,
Michael Duke?

418
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,747
- Dr. Nottingham dropped me
from the cardiac rotation and--

419
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,314
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

420
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,011
Dr. Nottingham dropped you
at my suggestion.

421
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,756
- Then I'm talking
to the right man,

422
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,976
'cause you made a mistake,
Dr. Reynolds.

423
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,892
- Practicing medicine
is a privilege, Michael Duke.

424
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,676
It's not something you show up
for when you feel like it

425
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,938
or have people come
to find you

426
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,114
while your head's
in the clouds.

427
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,507
- Well, you don't
know me like that.

428
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:41,163
I mean, you--
you don't know me at all.

429
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,339
'Cause if you did,
you'd know that I consistently

430
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,515
score in the top five
of my class.

431
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,474
That every professor
acknowledges

432
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,128
I've got the hands
for surgery.

433
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,478
And when Nottingham has
to find me,

434
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,957
every time it's with
a book in my hand

435
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,916
because it's easier
to study in quiet here

436
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,744
than in my own neighborhood.

437
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,615
And I'm not--I'm not telling
you all this as an excuse.

438
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,182
I'm just giving you facts.

439
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,490
Like the fact I'm
the best intern up in here.

440
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,580
So good these hands will be
coming for your job one day.

441
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,200
- Clamp.

442
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,944
- These are some of the
hundreds of prescriptions

443
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,860
that New Amsterdam has written
for insulin just this week.

444
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,471
If these same patients
were in Canada,

445
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:31,344
these same meds would cost
about a fifth as much.

446
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,172
Sadly, hospitals are barred

447
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,825
from importing drugs
from Canada,

448
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,958
but individuals are not.

449
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,134
So, despite all appearances,

450
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,136
New Amsterdam is not going
to Canada

451
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,052
to buy enormous loads
of insulin for the hospital.

452
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,489
We are, however,
going to Canada

453
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,012
to buy enormous loads
of insulin

454
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,232
for thousands of individuals,

455
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,103
and we're gonna keep going
back and forth

456
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,584
until Pacentia understands
that increasing

457
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,761
their profit margin is not
worth the 30 million lives

458
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,328
they are putting at risk,

459
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:03,027
one of whom is my patient,
Alma Pearson.

460
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,117
Thank you.
Thanks.

461
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,467
- They're going to arrest you.

462
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,772
- Probably, but they say

463
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,209
there's no bad publicity,
right?

464
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,254
- And they would be wrong.
- Would they?

465
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,082
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.

466
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,605
- The second those truck
reach the border,

467
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,259
you're gonna have
an international incident

468
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,435
on your hand
and a slate of pharma companies

469
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,089
ready to riot.

470
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:22,308
- Maybe then they'll give me
a seat at the table.

471
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:25,224
- That takes favors
and finesse and time,

472
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,965
but you keep throwing tantrums
like a kid with a sugar high.

473
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,184
- That's because my patient,
Alma Pearson,

474
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,751
doesn't have time.

475
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,100
I want a seat at the table
or I'm gonna throw

476
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,276
another tantrum tomorrow.
- Give me a week!

477
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,322
- You got ten hours till
that truck reaches Toronto.

478
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,455
God.

479
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,646
- Wheelchair to Admitting.
Wheelchair to Admitting.

480
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,908
- I just came from the airport.

481
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,562
Sorry it's been so long.

482
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,608
Everyone's just so interested
in your treatment.

483
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,218
That's the great news.

484
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,828
How are you?

485
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,221
- I'm sure Dr. Castro's been
keeping you in the loop.

486
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,875
- She has.
I'm thrilled.

487
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,006
Though I'm surprised
to learn that we're suddenly

488
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,356
in the insulin business.

489
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,661
- I don't know if
we can call it a business.

490
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,620
We're giving it away
for free.

491
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,839
- Max.

492
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,016
How are things at home?

493
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,496
- Good, yeah.
Luna's amazing.

494
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,890
She's, uh, sleeping through
the night now.

495
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,284
Twelve weeks,
so it's great.

496
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,898
- If you ever need to talk,
I'm here.

497
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,161
- Welcome back.

498
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,737
- Do you know your name?

499
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,739
- They've already done
all the questions, Vijay!

500
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,131
Just pop the damn thing
back in, please!

501
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,266
Do it!

502
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,791
Ah, better.

503
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,750
- Hey, where have you been?
We didn't know where you were.

504
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,360
- I was thrown.
There was--

505
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,536
- Page the code team.
We're losing her.

506
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,364
- Who?
- It's Bloom.

507
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,551
- No, no, no, Mark.
This is everyone's win.

508
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:20,164
Without your research, I--
Thank you.

509
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,644
- Charge nurse to Admitting.

510
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,777
- I appreciate that.
- Charge nurse to Admitting.

511
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,779
- Okay, talk soon.

512
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,998
So many wins today.

513
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,565
But I bet you get
those days a lot.

514
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,306
- Few and far between,
to be honest.

515
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,396
- Oh, and, uh, a wheel
was broken on your chair.

516
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,790
I had that fixed.
Hope you don't mind.

517
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,182
- Not at all.

518
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:41,708
I, um--I saw Max.

519
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,190
What you've done
for him is extraordinary.

520
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,062
- Isn't it?

521
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,759
One look at him
and you can't deny

522
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,239
this is the future of oncology.

523
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,329
- That's why I've been
out raising money

524
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,418
using your research.
- Oh.

525
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,639
So maybe you shouldn't
have fired me.

526
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,032
Pot shot, sorry.

527
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,165
Couldn't resist.

528
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,428
- I made a mistake, Valentina.

529
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,911
But now I'd like you
to come back.

530
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,826
- Back?

531
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,219
- To New Amsterdam full-time.

532
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:20,747
- You damaged my career
when you let me go.

533
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,445
No, I don't need an apology.

534
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,143
It's just that's why
I can't work for you again.

535
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,625
- Okay.

536
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,064
- But maybe we could find
a different arrangement.

537
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,675
- Such as?

538
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,417
- You could make me co-chair
of your department.

539
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,334
Valentina, even with
your success rate,

540
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:46,033
the financial risk would--
- Half your department.

541
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,469
Or you can find someone else

542
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,384
to administer precision
target therapy.

543
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,430
Max's precision target therapy.

544
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,826
- You're using Max
as a bargaining chip?

545
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,396
- I don't want
to derail Max's progress.

546
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
I just can't make my work
vulnerable to you again.

547
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,711
- Done.

548
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,633
- Empty out the contents
of your purse.

549
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:24,158
- Excuse me?
- Right here.

550
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,249
- Neurologists
are like detectives.

551
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,120
They just need
to know where to look.

552
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,732
- A lot of stuff.
- Here you are.

553
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,211
Here.

554
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,042
What is this?
- Lavender oil.

555
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:40,522
- Mm-hmm.
For?

556
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,698
- Stress relief.
- Does it work?

557
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:45,571
- Do I look relieved of stress?
- Okay.

558
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:50,097
And, uh--hmm.

559
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,881
And what is this?

560
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,274
- Uh, for joint pain.

561
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:56,451
One of those alternative
medicine things.

562
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,542
- This is why none of
your medications are working.

563
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:01,935
Come with me.

564
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,241
I love alternative medicine.
Believe me.

565
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,069
But a lot of
these alternative remedies,

566
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:09,072
especially the ones from China,
they contain heavy metals.

567
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,684
And when heavy metals get
absorbed in your blood stream,

568
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:15,252
they can block the effect
of your medication.

569
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,168
- Nope, no heavy metals.

570
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,953
- What?

571
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:30,790
- Okay, it's called
psychotherapeutic reparenting.

572
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,620
- Ricky, since you rolled
your eyes with such finesse,

573
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,012
I'm assuming you'd like
to go first.

574
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,448
Come on, it'll be good.

575
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,841
It'll--it'll give you
a chance to, uh,

576
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,539
you know, feel free
to express your feelings

577
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,541
towards your mother
without fear of abandonment.

578
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,849
Ricky.

579
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:53,769
Ricky, do you have something
you want to say to me?

580
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,905
Yeah, you look like a dude.

581
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,344
- Okay.
Okay.

582
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:06,347
Ignore them.

583
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,609
Just say something
honest to me.

584
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,002
Open up.

585
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,917
That's what this is for.

586
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:21,623
- Okay, "Mama."

587
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,452
When I was a kid,
I wish you looked at me,

588
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,759
seen how messed up I was.

589
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,938
- Why?

590
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,336
- 'Cause all
the bad stuff I did,

591
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,687
I was just trying
to get you to notice me.

592
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,605
To see me,
the real me.

593
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:53,002
I kept thinking,
"Why didn't you?"

594
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,483
Why couldn't you see me?

595
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,967
Now I think you did see me.

596
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,321
You just didn't care.

597
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,977
So I stopped seeing myself.

598
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,205
You turned me into a ghost,
Mama.

599
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,739
Crap, Dr. Frome,
I didn't mean

600
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,871
to get weird, man.
- No, you did not get weird.

601
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:37,960
You did not--
you didn't get weird.

602
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,440
I got weird.

603
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,398
You got open and honest
and awesome.

604
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,096
That was the point of all this,

605
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,185
and the only reason I'm crying
is because I'm proud of you.

606
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,752
- Um, should I keep going?

607
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,492
'Cause you look
pretty messed up.

608
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,368
- No, no, no.
Keep going, Ricky.

609
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,239
You're doing great.

610
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,465
- I'm sorry; I know
I shouldn't have hijacked

611
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,597
your surgery like that.
- No, you shouldn't have.

612
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,861
- I've been busting my ass
for five years.

613
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,340
- Just stop.

614
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,520
When I was an intern
on my cardiac rotation,

615
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,392
my attending never bothered
to learn my name.

616
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:21,525
But if I messed up in rounds
or I was late once,

617
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,658
I would have been dropped,
no questions asked.

618
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,007
All right,
nobody helped me.

619
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,879
No one cared that I
sometimes had to choose

620
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:30,534
between books and heat.
I had to just figure it out.

621
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,928
I had to figure out how
to be great on my own.

622
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,234
And you know what?

623
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,539
I almost left medicine
because of it.

624
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:41,067
So...I'm gonna keep
my eye on you.

625
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,812
- Wait, I'm back in?
- No, no, no.

626
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,378
Don't think that I'm gonna be
easy on you, either.

627
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:49,945
It's gonna be quite
the opposite, all right?

628
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,339
I'm gonna push you
and challenge you

629
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:55,342
and expect nothing less
than greatness.

630
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,736
And if you rise
to the challenge, maybe,

631
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,783
just maybe you'll be good
enough to come for me.

632
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,480
- Yes, sir.

633
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,440
And thank you, sir.

634
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:21,803
- You get your seat
at the table?

635
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,196
- No.

636
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,546
Placentia wouldn't budge.

637
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,940
- And the drugs from Canada?

638
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,246
- Customs wouldn't let
medication loads that size

639
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,944
past the border.

640
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,429
- Guess I was crazy to think
we could beat them.

641
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,518
- Yeah.

642
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,390
It was crazy.

643
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,696
But, while we didn't win,

644
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,177
we didn't lose either.

645
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:53,487
Placentia wasn't so thrilled
about the negative PR,

646
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,056
so, if I stop
embarrassing them,

647
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,623
they've agreed to offer you
some insulin.

648
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,670
- How much?

649
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:06,021
- Six vials a month.

650
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:09,068
- But that's--
- A lifetime supply.

651
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:15,248
- Oh, my God.

652
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:22,777
Oh, my...

653
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,780
What about everyone else?

654
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,087
Everyone else
who can't afford it...

655
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,616
- Only you're my patient.

656
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,444
And doctors fight
for their patients,

657
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,186
so today I fought for you.

658
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:47,236
Tomorrow...

659
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,717
It's another story.

660
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:58,117
- Max...

661
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
Max.

662
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,642
One day you're gonna have to
start talking to me again.

663
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,470
- Yeah, not today.

664
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,824
- Sinus rhythm.
- Still no pulse.

665
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,479
- Her heart's
not pumping any blood.

666
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,265
Her neck veins are distended.

667
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,702
- Cardiac tamponade?
- 18 gauge cardiac needle.

668
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,574
20cc syringe, now.

669
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:12,104
- Told you I got you.

670
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,020
Thank you.

671
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,286
- The ED is all yours now,
doctor.

672
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:29,599
- Ah, welcome back.

673
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:32,559
- Come on, everyone wants some.
Get in here, get in there.

674
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,221
- Got a weak and dizzy in 2,
an ortho consult in 11,

675
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,440
and then there's--
- What happened to my posters?

676
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:48,227
- Oh, yeah, Candelario didn't
think they were professional.

677
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,881
- I like my posters.

678
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:53,841
- We missed you.

679
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:56,235
- You still hurting?

680
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,977
- Don't ask stupid questions.

681
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,284
- You taking anything?
- No, I am not taking anything.

682
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,504
- Not even aspirin?

683
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,506
- As long as I keep moving
and stay busy,

684
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,857
it'll keep my mind
off the pain.

685
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,033
Put 'em back up.

686
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:15,036
- Could be lupus.

687
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,430
Or perhaps
you're a fast metabolizer.

688
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:19,954
- Dr. Kapoor, maybe it's time
for me to go home.

689
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,305
No, no.

690
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,221
Usually I take more time
with my patients.

691
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,269
Maybe that's
why I'm off my game.

692
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:34,142
- I didn't really expect you
to help me in one day.

693
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,231
- But I didn't help you at all.

694
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:39,060
- You came up with
three possible diagnoses

695
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,366
in less than eight hours.

696
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,585
- Were any of them correct?

697
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:52,552
Lately I've been missing India
quite a lot.

698
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:56,077
Strangers smiling at you
for no reasons,

699
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,906
the festivals, the fragrances,

700
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:02,344
all the colors.

701
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:06,609
If I did retire,
I could go home.

702
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,443
- Here.

703
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,010
- Ugh, I hate flossing.

704
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,534
- Flossing is essential
for healthy teeth and gums.

705
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,275
- You sound
just like my dentist.

706
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:21,624
I stopped seeing her

707
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,105
because she wouldn't stop with
the lectures.

708
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,241
- What?
What?

709
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,595
- Oh, yeah.

710
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,946
Yeah, that is definitely
an abscessed molar.

711
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,470
- Hmm.
- Why is that good news?

712
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,124
- Because this is the reason

713
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,778
none of your medications
are working.

714
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,563
The abscess in the tooth
created bacteria.

715
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,783
- The bacteria
entered your bloodstream,

716
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,698
which caused your RA symptoms
to escalate.

717
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,352
- And all those medications
you took

718
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:55,354
went to fight
the bacteria infection,

719
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,312
not rheumatoid arthritis.

720
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,140
- Wait, wait.

721
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:03,188
All these years,
all the doctors...

722
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,624
All the medicine?

723
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,278
- It was a tooth.

724
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,758
Remove it,
you will feel better.

725
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:10,238
- Better?
- Yes.

726
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,761
And you may even be able to go

727
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,937
do rock climbing
with your daughters.

728
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,336
- If you retire,

729
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,078
I'll drag you back
from India myself.

730
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,300
- Okay, who'd I miss?

731
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:31,607
- Uh...
No one.

732
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,566
Covered everybody in here.

733
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,830
Twice.
And you played dentist.

734
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:39,006
- Guess I'll go get a coffee.
- That's a good idea.

735
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,182
Oh, and, uh, when you get back?

736
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:45,230
I'ma hit you with
some dance therapy.

737
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:46,579
