- A-chugga-chugga-chugga-
chugga-chugga-chugga-

2
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:08,443
chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:10,575
Choo-choo!

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,664
Carrots are awesome.
Daddy love carrots.

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,623
All right, forget carrots.
Carrots are lame.

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,495
The pear patrol.
♪ Do, do, do, do, do

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,541
♪ Do, do, do

8
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,543
You don't like the pear patrol?

9
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:24,154
The banana boat, going for
a ride across the waves,

10
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:27,505
coming in flying...
it's yummy, it's yummy.

11
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,681
Please, please, please,
eat the banana boat.

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,769
It's not happening.
It's not happening.

13
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,598
We got the beets.

14
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,383
Yeah, we're gonna
drop the beets.

15
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,428
We're gonna drop the beets
right--

16
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:39,387
right in there.
No?

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,736
Oh, oh, okay.
You wanna take it?

18
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,607
Look at you.
You gonna feed yourself?

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,715
Oh--

20
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,200
- Morning.
- Morning.

21
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,250
So you know Evie's taken a job
in San Francisco.

22
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,730
- I do.
- Yeah, and, um,

23
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:21,864
seeing as we're, uh,
gonna get married soon--

24
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:24,084
- Mm-hmm.
You're leaving.

25
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:30,220
Um, I really didn't have
a choice here, Max.

27
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,787
I'll help you fill
the position, of course.

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,876
You know,
sort through resumes.

29
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,096
- Not necessary.
Congrats.

30
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,491
- Tonight's the big night
isn't it--dinner with mom?

31
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,276
- Oh, God, thank you
for the reminder.

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,625
- You know why
she reached out to you?

33
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,235
- Well, because she is sober
this week

34
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,281
and wants to make amends
for the thousandth time.

35
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,326
I'm only going
because I like the restaurant.

36
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,590
Holland.

37
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,810
- I know, I know.

38
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,333
- I was really hoping

39
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,466
I wouldn't see you
back here again.

40
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,250
- Yeah.

41
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,427
Now I have to send you home.

42
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:08,171
I just misjudged the dose.
I'm not gonna OD again.

43
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,434
- Can someone help us?
- On it.

44
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,436
- I'm already taking less
than I was before,

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,657
and I have a whole new plan.
- Okay, we talked about this.

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,748
Addiction is not something
that you can tackle alone.

47
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,446
You need support.

48
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,579
Trust me.

49
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:27,930
I know the dance all too well.

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,631
Please.

51
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,159
Lauren?

52
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:47,341
- Valentina?
Do you have a minute to chat?

53
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,343
- Sure, I'm just late
for a meeting.

54
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,649
- I saw Fatima Abassi
yesterday.

55
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,217
Her eyes were glazed.
She mumbling to herself.

56
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,524
I'm just curious if any other
patients in your trial

57
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,830
had these symptoms.
- What are you suggesting?

58
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,659
- Nothing.
I'm just concerned.

59
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,879
When she was receiving
traditional chemotherapy--

60
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,315
- She's no longer
your patient.

61
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,665
- Understood.
But I care about her--

62
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,581
- Under the guise of concern
you're implying that

63
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,496
I'm withholding my drug's side
effects to protect my trial.

64
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,281
Right?

65
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:16,631
Stay in your lane.
I have a department to run.

66
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,769
- Altered mental state.
Diaphoresis.

67
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,858
I must say
your husband's symptoms

68
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:27,990
are rather confounding,

69
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,731
but they are not from stroke
or dementia.

70
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,993
- Our tests have ruled out

71
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,256
liver failure, diabetes,
and drug ingestion.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,346
- He's never taken a drug
in his life.

73
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,523
- What about alcohol?
- Joe doesn't drink.

74
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,829
- Are you certain?

75
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,658
Sweating, delirium--
could be alcohol withdrawal.

76
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,616
- Yes.
I'm certain.

77
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,923
I've lived with the man
over 40 years.

78
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,752
- Okay,
based on Joe's symptoms,

79
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,363
I'd like to start him
on high-dose benzos.

80
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,845
And when he recovers, perhaps
we will all know him better.

81
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,502
- A sip?
- No thanks.

82
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,895
I just added something
like that to my mulch pile.

83
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,333
- Okay, well, you have no idea
what you're missing.

84
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,291
- That's supposed to cure
your sugar cravings?

85
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,901
- Yup, no more junk food
for me, Gladys.

86
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,686
My body deserves better.
I deserve better.

87
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,078
- Dr. Frome.
- Who's gonna tell that

88
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,471
to the pastry landfill
in your desk?

89
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,865
- You know, I'm sending in
a hazmat crew today

90
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,040
if you must know.
- Mmm.

91
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,781
Well, the cleanup
will have to wait.

92
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,086
There's a cute couple
eager to see you.

93
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,566
Dr. Steiner's referral.

94
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,873
- Yes, the refreshing break
that is couples counseling.

95
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,091
See?

96
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,442
Healthy choices
are being rewarded Gladys.

97
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,574
Take heed.

98
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,447
Chris and Jenny, right?

99
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,318
- Uh, yeah.

100
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,972
Thanks for fitting us in.

101
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:39,366
Dr. Steiner told us you were
one of his favorite students.

102
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,933
- One of?

103
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:44,414
Well, if that isn't a blow.
Jeez.

104
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,678
And you two are both from
Long Island, as well, right?

105
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,333
- Yeah, we both grew up there.
- Okeydoke.

106
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,335
So what are we doing here
today?

107
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,339
- Uh, Jenny and I have been
together for nine years,

108
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,428
and we'd been planning on
getting married

109
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,082
at the end of the month,

110
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,432
but we've been having
some problems.

111
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:06,001
- It happens.
- We're fighting, all the time.

112
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,612
We haven't had sex
in over a month.

113
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,092
We're not even living together
right now.

114
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,616
Jenny moved in with a friend.
- I'm sorry--is this--

115
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,966
is this seriously
what you're opening with?

116
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,359
- Well, Jenny,

117
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,709
what do you think
he should be opening with?

118
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,757
- We, um, we got a--

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,672
an early wedding present
from my uncle.

120
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,152
It was a--a DNA kit.

121
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:30,765
One of those things that tells
you how French you are,

122
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,984
if you're related to George
Washington--you know.

123
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,465
Um...
- Did you guys send it in?

124
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,861
- We did.

125
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,472
- And?

126
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,995
- Well, we're not French.

127
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,521
- We're brother and sister.

128
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,874
- How can I help?
- Are you aware that your ED

129
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,572
just discharged another patient
who overdosed on opiates?

130
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:56,704
- No, but I'm not surprised.

131
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,923
We're up to about
ten a day now.

132
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,838
- Do you know how
much the opioid epidemic

133
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,493
cost this country last year?
- $500 billion.

134
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,539
- 700 billion.

135
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,150
We've seen a massive increase
in patient overdoses,

136
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,195
most of whom are
simply treated and released,

137
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,154
only to return days later
if they're lucky.

138
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,851
- And most of these
folks are uninsured,

139
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,853
so we're operating at a loss.
Is that your issue?

140
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,420
- It certainly is one of them.

141
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,509
- Well, Karen, I assure you
that we spend a lot of time

142
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,685
talking to our patients about
the dangers of opioids,

143
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,079
but when you have massive
pharmaceutical companies

144
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,689
delivering a very different
message--

145
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,995
- I know what
they're delivering.

146
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,518
- Then what have I done wrong?
- Nothing.

147
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,824
Which is precisely the problem.

148
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,521
- I thought you wanted me
to do nothing.

149
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,783
- Not today.

150
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,525
Today I want you to turn
this epidemic around.

151
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,918
All the crazy ideas,

152
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,703
all the impulsive, rash
tantrums you want to throw--

153
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,705
throw them, break the law,
I don't care.

154
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,752
You'll have my full,
unwavering support.

155
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,233
- Is this, um--
Are there--are there cameras?

156
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,844
- Max.

157
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,020
I want to see
how much damage you can do.

158
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,677
- Challenge accepted.

159
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:04,032
- This is one dose, one pill,
of the opiate oxycodone.

160
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,164
The pharmacy asked me
for a prescription,

161
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,340
and seeing as how I was only
looking for a visual aid,

162
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,212
I didn't have one.

163
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,215
So I had to drag our chairwoman
here to the dispensary

164
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,435
where we each
had to sign wavers

165
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:18,220
affirming our
educational intent.

166
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,441
But if I sold you this pill,
or even just gave it to you,

167
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,312
it's a loss of medical license
for me

168
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:26,184
and actual jail time for her.

169
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:28,970
1%.

170
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,059
That's how many doctors at New
Amsterdam are in this room.

171
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:35,019
Yet, you prescribe 79%
of the opioids here.

172
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,369
And given that we are hooking
patients by the thousands

173
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,416
on drugs that are a molecule
away from black tar heroin,

174
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,071
can anyone tell me why you all
shouldn't be arrested?

175
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,468
- You know they have
a legitimate use.

176
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,078
- Not at the levels
you're prescribing them.

177
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,471
- None of us
prescribe them lightly.

178
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,255
Standards of care suggest
they're the best choice

179
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,952
for our patients.
- Not true.

180
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,259
The SOC says they're
the most efficient choice,

181
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,521
and if you're looking
to drop a few pounds

182
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,741
amputation
is pretty efficient too.

183
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,351
- Our patients want them,
Max.

184
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,092
They ask for them
by brand name.

185
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,572
- They also do that
with cigarettes.

186
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,444
- And our funding is tied to
patient satisfaction scores.

187
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,012
- Well, it's kind of hard
to be satisfied if you're dead.

188
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,753
- Max.
- Nope, this changes now.

189
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,319
All right?
Since you all prescribe

190
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,365
79% of our opioids,

191
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:20,717
I'm giving you one year
to prescribe 79% less,

192
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,634
and anyone who does not meet
that mark will be fired.

193
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,555
Thank you for coming.

194
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,476
You may get some calls.

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,391
- This is war, Max.

196
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,220
And your solution
is to berate our staff?

197
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:48,310
- Yeah--and threaten.
- Hell, I could've done that.

198
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,487
I want a macro solution.
I want the full Max.

199
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,751
But that down there--
very disappointing.

200
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,451
- What's wrong?
- No pulse.

201
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,497
- V-fib.
All clear.

202
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,370
- Still not there.
- Going again.

203
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,198
All clear.

204
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,594
- He's back.
- Thank God.

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,339
- Vijay.
- ST segment elevations.

206
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,297
- Active ischemia.
I'll page Reynolds.

207
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,566
- I'm afraid
I owe you an apology.

208
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,786
Your husband is not going
through alcohol withdrawal.

209
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,050
He had a heart attack.
- Before he got here?

210
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,312
- No, just now.

211
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,227
Which speaks to
an underlying condition.

212
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,186
- Meaning?

213
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,144
- We have
a far greater problem.

214
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,802
- Approaching the right
coronary artery.

215
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,370
You see that narrowing?
- Proximal section?

216
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,068
- Yes, that blockage
is causing his ischemia.

217
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,504
So I'm just gonna put
a stent in there,

218
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:55,464
open up the artery,
and he should be good to go.

219
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:56,900
- What's that?

220
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,686
In the left anterior.
It also looks like a narrowing.

221
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:03,080
- That's weird.
That wasn't there a second ago.

222
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,736
Okay, Lana,
placing a second stent.

223
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,784
- Floyd, another area's
constricting in the circumflex.

224
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,524
- The hell is going on?

225
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,527
Every time I open up an artery,
another one closes.

226
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,530
- And if you stop?

227
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,794
- He'll die.

228
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:25,494
- So, you're situation,
to put it mildly,

229
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,105
is a little more complicated
than most.

230
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,630
You are half-siblings.

231
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,286
All right, what about, um,

232
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,592
let's start with
a little context.

233
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,768
How did you two meet?

234
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:42,337
- It was the second day
of freshmen year at NYU.

235
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,600
I was in a philosophy class.

236
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,906
Which I almost
immediately realized

237
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,690
was the worst decision
I'd ever made...

238
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,651
Until Jenny walked in.

239
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:56,394
She was 20 minutes late, and
when the professor apologized

240
00:10:56,438 --> 00:11:00,398
for having such an early class,
she just said, "No problem."

241
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,448
Then she sat down next to me.

242
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,711
- How long before you two
went out?

243
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:12,149
- We got coffee
after class.

244
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:15,849
But immediately I knew
we were meant to be together.

245
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,460
Even before we both learned
we were from Port Jeff.

246
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,592
- Port Jefferson,
that's a population of--

247
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:23,247
- 8,000.
Pretty small.

248
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,379
- Especially
if both your mothers

249
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,815
used anonymous sperm donors.

250
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,512
- Right.

251
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,603
Have you told your parents?
- No.

252
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,258
No, we haven't told anyone.
We're not going to tell anyone.

253
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:37,218
- Well, they are expecting us
to get married in 16 days.

254
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,220
- Right.

255
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,787
Well, let me ask you this.

256
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,399
What are you both hoping
to get out of this session?

257
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,270
- You know, processing this.

258
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,490
Finding our way back
to each other.

259
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:52,407
- God, Chris, there's
no finding our way back.

260
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,757
We are--we're related.

261
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:01,329
- Well, Chris, why do you
think this can be fixed?

262
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,637
Because the day I met Jenny
was the best day of my life...

263
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,859
And every day since
has been better.

264
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,602
Look, I know that this
is insane, okay?

265
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,169
Believe me.

266
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,736
And I can understand why you
can't see a way through it,

267
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,565
but I can't imagine
not going back to how we were.

268
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,611
Not coming home to you--

269
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,965
If you think it's impossible,

270
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,575
and you can look me in the eye
and tell me right now

271
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,794
that you don't love me
anymore,

272
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,753
then I will call off
the wedding.

273
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,936
- You know I love you...

274
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,679
But love just isn't enough.

275
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,727
It isn't enough, is it?

276
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:58,429
- Hi, so, uh, I'm here
to end the opioid epidemic.

277
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,736
- Okay.

278
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,651
- So half the ODs occur

279
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,871
within three months of a visit
to the emergency room,

280
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,568
but if we prescribe suboxone--

281
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,788
- We could manage the symptoms
of opioid withdrawal

282
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,833
without the risk of fatality.
- Exactly.

283
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,009
- We'll need a Treatment Act
Waiver by the DEA,

284
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,316
and even then, each licensed
doctor's only allowed

285
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,622
to treat 30 patients at a time.
- So who's all licensed?

286
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,015
- You're looking at her.
- Really?

287
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,757
Well, that has to change.
Today.

288
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,106
- To get everyone licensed,

289
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,455
they'll need to go on
an all-day training course.

290
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,414
- Sure, okay, grab all
the doctors, attendings,

291
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,937
and residents and have them
take that test,

292
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,852
and nobody comes back
until they pass.

293
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,593
- That would mean
shutting down ED.

294
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,421
- Yeah, so shut it down.

295
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:34,944
- No, Max.
- Yes.

296
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,903
- You want me to call the
department of public health,

297
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,600
re-route all ambulances,

298
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:39,862
suspend our Level I
Trauma status,

299
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,864
and potentially move
a multitude of patients

300
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,387
who are already being treated?

301
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:44,867
- That's a great plan.
- Max!

302
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,913
That's unheard of.
It would make the news!

303
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,872
And Brantley--
- Will love it! Go!

304
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,879
- A secret rendezvous
on the pier?

305
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,316
Are we catching up or
practicing our spy craft?

306
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,709
- Audra.

307
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,886
I'm sorry for all
the cloak and dagger,

308
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,542
but I have a dilemma,
and I'm afraid it is a secret.

309
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,674
- What's up?
- Um...

310
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,897
- It involves the NIH trial
that Castro's running

311
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,246
out of New Amsterdam.

312
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,858
- What's your dilemma?
- I'm not entirely sure.

313
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,816
Not yet.

314
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,558
- Are you concerned there's
been a protocol deviation?

315
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,951
Because that could jeopardize

316
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,344
all NIH funding
at your hospital.

317
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,738
We're talking hundreds
of millions of dollars.

318
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:32,828
- Which is why I needed to
speak with you off the record

319
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,656
without your NIH hat on.

320
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,093
I don't have a lot of details.

321
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:40,836
I'm simply trying to help one
of my patients that's involved.

322
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,926
Have you heard of any
significant side effects

323
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,102
from Castro's trial?

324
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,148
- She hasn't reported anything,

325
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,845
but she's supposed to document

326
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,629
any adverse reactions
immediately.

327
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,458
Is your patient on
the protocol or the placebo?

328
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,504
- I don't know.
- Well, you have to find out.

329
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,071
It's the only way to verify.

330
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:01,944
- But that would mean
violating the double-blind.

331
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,772
- You can Castro directly.

332
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,645
Yeah, that would be,
um--awkward.

333
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,734
- Then go around her
if you have to.

334
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:12,868
You need to know
if the patient

335
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,696
is on the placebo
or the drug.

336
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,393
And if it's the drug--

337
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,395
- We have a bigger
conversation.

338
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,445
- Uh, not sure if you've heard,

339
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,448
but both NPR and New York One
are buzzing about us.

340
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,058
- Because you shuttered the ED?
- That's right.

341
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,887
Both lead stories, both focused
on the opioid epidemic.

342
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,020
You know, we're gonna have
more licensed suboxone doctors

343
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,022
in this hospital than any other
hospital in the country.

344
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,849
- Wonderful.
You want a cookie?

345
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:38,938
- What?

346
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,417
- I didn't ask you
to raise awareness,

347
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,766
I asked you
to solve the problem.

348
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,943
But instead
you're handing out detox drugs

349
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,118
while millions of people

350
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,467
outside the hospital
are suffering.

351
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,598
- I don't work outside
the hospital.

352
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,035
- Yes, you do.
When you want to.

353
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,906
Blood pressure testing
in barber shops?

354
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,126
Chasing down insurance agents
in their offices?

355
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,172
Come on, Max!
It's me you're talking to.

356
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,917
People are dying.

357
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,053
Do better.

358
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,281
- Casey, Casey.
Get him situated in Urology.

359
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,979
Don't let them pawn him off.

360
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,939
- Incoming!

361
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,115
- Carolyn Werner, 20,
fell in Times Square.

362
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,551
Looks like
a radial/ulna fracture.

363
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,162
BP 120 over--
- Okay, let me stop you

364
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,947
right there--she is stable with
an isolated injury to the arm?

365
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,209
- Yeah.
- Turn her around

366
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,950
and take her to Baptist.
- Are you serious?

367
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,952
- Uh, we thought dispatch
was mistaken.

368
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,694
- No.
We are closed.

369
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,567
- What the hell am I supposed
to do with all these?

370
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,743
I don't know, Dr. Skein.

371
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,573
They are patients admitted to
your care, so...tend to them?

372
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,227
- 20 people?

373
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,360
You've clogged every bed in my
department with this--this--

374
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,622
uh, whatever you're doing.

375
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,450
- We are trying to solve
the opioid crisis.

376
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,408
A crisis you helped cause.

377
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,976
- I'm a dermatologist.

378
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:07,417
- I will admit that your
situation is difficult.

379
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,507
Um, but is not my job to judge

380
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,249
whether your relationship
is right or wrong.

381
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,034
What is very apparent to me

382
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,645
is the love between you two
is very real.

383
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,736
And if you want,
worth fighting for.

384
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,437
There is one
inconvertible truth.

385
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,571
Biological children
can never be an option.

386
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:33,095
- You think kids are what
we're worried about?

387
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,097
I can't even look at him.

388
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,099
- Because this new information

389
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,275
has changed the way
you see him?

390
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,191
Well, good news there.

391
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,106
Relationships
can survive change.

392
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,456
In fact, almost all of them
have to.

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,024
- This isn't like he's suddenly
gained 20 pounds.

394
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:53,681
- No, um--
Look, I get it.

395
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:57,032
But life goes on,
and you adjust.

396
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,296
Relationships adjust too,
or they end.

397
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,823
If change is insurmountable
in the heart, then that's it,

398
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,173
show's over.

399
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:10,045
But that is not
the case with you two.

400
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,351
Is it?

401
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,049
So the real question becomes:

402
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,182
can we change
what's in your heads?

403
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,229
- How?

404
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,495
- Jenny, will you sit
on the couch with Chris?

405
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,391
- Good.

406
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,437
Jenny, will you take
Chris's hand?

407
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,579
Jenny.

408
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,843
- I can't.

409
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,453
I can't.
I can't.

410
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,239
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,898
- Floyd.

412
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,378
His test level shows

413
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,337
extremely high levels
of creatinine kinase.

414
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,426
It's already damaged
his kidneys.

415
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,167
- That means his muscles
are breaking down.

416
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,517
- Vasospasm, delirium,
muscle breakdown--

417
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,433
decompression sickness.

418
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,739
- The bends?

419
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,221
- Joe has never gone
scuba diving in his life.

420
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,571
I tried to get him to go
on our honeymoon,

421
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,094
but he's afraid
of the water.

422
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,749
- That may be true, but
I'm certain of this diagnosis.

423
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,535
- You were certain before,
but you were wrong.

424
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:51,146
Joe doesn't drink,
and he's not a water guy.

425
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,716
Even on vacation, he is a good,
decent, no nonsense,

426
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,501
stay-in-the-room-and-watch-golf
guy.

427
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,242
- But with
the symptoms exhibiting,

428
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,766
if we do not put him in
hyperbaric chamber right away,

429
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,769
I'm afraid he will be
a dead guy.

430
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,597
- Who knows him better,
Dr. Kapoor?

431
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,469
His wife of 40 years or you?

432
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,566
- Hi, I'm looking
for Dr. Castro.

433
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,264
- She'll be back
in about 15 minutes.

434
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,918
- Perfect.

435
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,436
- Satisfied?

436
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,789
I've tried to be
the bigger person here.

437
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,051
- Valentina--

438
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:11,922
- If you focused a bit more
on the patient

439
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,403
instead of trying to nail me
to the wall,

440
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,537
you might have noticed that
Fatima has aggressive arthritis

441
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,929
in her left wrist.

442
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:21,323
It was caused by
an enterobacter infection

443
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,760
which then relisted
as a thiamine deficiency.

444
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,762
That's what led
to her delirium.

445
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:30,245
Not my drug.

446
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,333
You're welcome.

447
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:41,343
- Dr. Morris, I apologize that
your hospital is overflowing,

448
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,693
but I will see you very soon,
okay?

449
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,478
Uh, Max Goodwin.

450
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,524
Dr. Farnum, yes,
I, um, did close the ED

451
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,831
and I look forward
to explaining why shortly.

452
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,354
Max Goodwin.
- Hi.

453
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,573
- Alice.

454
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,965
- I'm sorry to bother you
at work.

455
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,271
Did you get my text?

456
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,012
- Yeah, no--I did,
I've been, um--

457
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,362
- I know you're busy,
but are you free tonight?

458
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,537
- Tonight?

459
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,800
Uh.
Tonight, tonight?

460
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:07,021
- I got this gig,
and I can't find a sitter.

461
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,328
I hate asking.
I feel terrible.

462
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,981
- Oh, right.
No, of course.

463
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,418
Yes, I can.
Yes.

464
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,421
I thought--great.
Yeah, Luna's gonna love that.

465
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,379
- Thank you so much.
- Sure, sure.

466
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:18,946
Happy to help.
- See you tonight.

467
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,401
Everybody told me
that it would be impossible

468
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,403
to get the city's top
medical directors

469
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,927
together in one room,
but then I reminded them

470
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,453
how much medical directors
enjoy a free lunch.

471
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,501
Yeah, so, um...

472
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,635
earlier today, I put
New Amsterdam on diversion.

473
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,767
I know that closing our ED

474
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:01,031
caused problems
for many of you.

475
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,772
To those of you
who are still annoyed,

476
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:06,907
I just want to say
it's about to get worse.

477
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,434
This is how much money New
Amsterdam spends on opioids

478
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,568
every year, and every hospital
network in the city

479
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,787
is spending the same.
Just the 15 of us,

480
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,789
sitting here in this room

481
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,923
are spending $1 billion a year

482
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,795
on a product that we know
is killing people.

483
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,669
We're hospitals.
Killing people should be

484
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:33,020
pretty high on the list
of things we try not to do.

485
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,936
- Opioids work
incredibly well.

486
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,459
- That's right, Florence.
They do work.

487
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,593
But they also worked in 1996,
and back then they worked

488
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,117
without causing an
international addiction crisis.

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
That was before the Nylers

490
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:47,121
started launching
propaganda campaigns

491
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,037
and buying off hospitals--
- Including yours.

492
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
- That's right.
Including mine.

493
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,478
Raise your hand if your
hospital has a Nyler Wing.

494
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:59,002
I'm not saying
that New Amsterdam

495
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,482
is better than anyone else.

496
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:04,660
I am saying it's time
to return to ethical behavior.

497
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:08,577
So instead of giving the Nylers

498
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,492
another billion dollars
this year,

499
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:14,931
I'd like to propose
a new number.

500
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,847
I'm ready to cancel New
Amsterdam's opioid contract

501
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,632
right now,

502
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,678
and I want you all
to do the same.

503
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:26,900
We have to hit them hard,
we have to hit them together,

504
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,642
and what we need is unity.

505
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,471
- Unity
is an anti-trust violation.

506
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,908
- There is blood

507
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,867
on all of our hands.

508
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,043
I think it's time
to wash it off.

509
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,656
So who's with me?

510
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,623
Florence?
- Pass.

511
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,756
- We could change things.
Dr. Farnum!

512
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,501
John.

513
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:18,038
- Yes, well, can you--
can you expedite it?

514
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,387
Yeah, I mean is there a fee
that I can pay for a faster--

515
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,477
Mm-hmm.

516
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,913
Okay, well call me back.

517
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,088
Yep.
Thank you.

518
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,569
Our pacemaker supplier
can't make shipment.

519
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,484
No big deal,
they're just people's hearts.

520
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,138
Stents are being held up too.

521
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,619
- Not to pile on,
but several of my chemo drugs

522
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,056
won't be coming in tomorrow.
Or ever.

523
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:38,667
- It's the Nylers.
They're retaliating

524
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,104
because I ripped up
their opioid contract.

525
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,324
- Their companies make more
than just opioids, Max.

526
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,065
Most of my drugs
are under their patent.

527
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,675
No one besides Nyler
can make them.

528
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,982
Look, I love that we're finally
taking a stand against them,

529
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:51,419
but this could jeopardize
the lives of our patients.

530
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,117
- Can someone please tell me

531
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:58,034
why my supplier just killed
my order for acne cream?

532
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,649
- His wife said he's afraid
of the water.

533
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,389
- I know.

534
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,304
- What if he has an endocrine
disorder or something?

535
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:10,656
I mean, isn't your whole thing
about listening to the patient?

536
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,658
- I am listening.

537
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,485
To Joe.

538
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,140
Despite everything
his wife believes,

539
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:21,014
his body's saying
decompression sickness.

540
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,762
- You better hope you're right.

541
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,155
- Jenny, this is your DNA,

542
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,636
and Christopher,
this is your DNA.

543
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,596
- They're the same.
- Not quite.

544
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,337
There's a .1% variant
between the two of you,

545
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,079
but yes,
they are 98.5% identical.

546
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:46,256
- What more do we need?

547
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,346
- But this is my DNA.

548
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,481
Also 98.5% identical
to both of yours.

549
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,702
Because that
is the genetic similarity

550
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:59,748
between any two human beings.

551
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:03,578
Scientifically speaking,
we are all very much the same.

552
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,016
- Jenny...

553
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:12,631
- What?
I should carry a DNA chart

554
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,371
to the market
to explain to everybody

555
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,678
why it's okay
I'm married to my brother?

556
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,159
- Why do you feel the need
to explain anything to anyone?

557
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,640
- Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but there's just--

558
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,945
there's nothing
that you're gonna say

559
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,556
that's gonna make me forget
who Chris really is.

560
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,820
- Okay.

561
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,039
Okay, fair enough.

562
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,698
Is there anything
that you could say?

563
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:44,532
You were planning on
being married in 16 days.

564
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,403
You must've written your vows.

565
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,682
Okay.
Good.

566
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,430
Chris.

567
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,217
"As I sit here in our
half-painted living room

568
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,525
"that you promised to finish,
listening to the, um,

569
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,397
"Spin Doctors Album
that we bought for $1.00

570
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,182
"at a yard sale because
the lady who sold it to us

571
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,575
had no idea who they were..."

572
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,710
"I can't believe
how happy I am

573
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,537
or how lucky I am..."

574
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,327
"I never thought
I would find somebody--

575
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,114
"Somebody who laughs
at all my stupid duck jokes.

576
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:48,465
"Or likes my grandma's
baked spaghetti.

577
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,772
Or picks up all of our
bath towels all the time."

578
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:57,561
"So of course I said yes
when you asked me to marry you.

579
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,741
"Nobody's ever
loved me like you,

580
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,786
and I've never wanted
to be with anybody..."

581
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,793
- Okay.
Good.

582
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,752
Jenny.

583
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,191
Can you see that Chris?

584
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,722
- The Chris you wrote
those vows for.

585
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,339
- That is the only Chris
there is.

586
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:39,778
And if you ever forget that,

587
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,388
all you need to do is go back
to those vows.

588
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,868
Just like every other couple.

589
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,863
- Feeling pretty whooped,
huh?

590
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,520
- The Nylers took you good.

591
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:29,305
- That they did.

592
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,265
Do you have their new contract?

593
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,749
You know,
I don't know what's worse.

594
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:40,403
People addicted to their drugs,

595
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,536
or the system addicted
to their money.

596
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,285
- Celeste.

597
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:55,505
My little sister.
- Hmm.

598
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,685
- She had this stupid surgery,
gum grafts of all things,

599
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:05,385
but it hurt a lot,
so they gave her Oxy.

600
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,914
She's gone now.

601
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,352
Two years.

602
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,445
- May I?

603
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,782
- Hey, we're closed.

604
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:57,654
- I know, just taking an OD
down to the morgue.

605
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,970
- Oh, no.

606
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,493
- You knew her?

607
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,448
- It's a funny thing, you know,

608
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:57,976
when you don't know anything.
I mean, I knew I was with you.

609
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,500
I just couldn't get
the words out.

610
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:03,024
- It's okay, honey.

611
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,984
I'm just grateful
that you're all right.

612
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:10,075
- Now, your wife said you'd
never been scuba diving before,

613
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,293
but...

614
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,121
- Since our
anniversary's coming up,

615
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,255
I wanted to surprise you
by taking a few lessons.

616
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,300
You wanted to go
on our honeymoon,

617
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,867
but I was too scared.

618
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,477
I wanted to show you
I could do it.

619
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,002
But you're not a water guy.

620
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,961
Which is why I knew
it would be a surprise.

621
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,095
- I didn't think
you could ever surprise me.

622
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,187
- But you did.

623
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,022
- So adorable.
- Mmm.

624
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,501
Aren't they?
- Mmm.

Mmm.

00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,132
- Oh.

629
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:57,138
I wasn't sure
if you were gonna come.

630
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,055
I mean, not that I blame you.

631
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,973
I'm sober now.
- I don't wanna hear it, Mom.

632
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,281
You wanna know
my earliest memory?

633
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:13,415
Was Dad's friend
calling you an alcoholic.

634
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:18,507
But Dad said no you weren't.
No, you were a drunk.

635
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:22,207
After that, I did everything
I could to slow you down.

636
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,688
The first time I got wasted,
I was seven.

You licked the glass,

00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,369
By shutting you out,

690
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,806
this company put patients'
lives at risk,

691
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,331
and that's not business,
it's a shakedown.

692
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,898
A shakedown that could happen
to any of us.

693
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:58,205
- So what do you propose?

694
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,294
- Unity.

695
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:54,304
- This should counter
the infection, Fatima.

696
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:55,871
Alleviate all your symptoms.

697
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:58,526
- Thank you for figuring out
what was wrong.

698
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,267
- Mmm.

699
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,009
It wasn't me.
Dr. Castro made the diagnosis.

700
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,405
You're very fortunate
to be in her trial.

701
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:08,884
Hmm.

702
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:11,757
Okay.

703
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,506
Lauren, call me
as soon as you can.

704
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,508
I was wrong about
the side effects

705
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,945
Castro's drug might be causing,
but I was right about her.

706
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,513
She altered her patients'
numbers before treatment

707
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,471
so their tumors
would look worse

708
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,386
so her drug will appear to be
performing better

709
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,345
than it actually is!
Castro altered her trial.

710
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,442
- Hey.
- Hi.

711
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:47,357
Wow, you look serious.

712
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,490
- Yikes.

713
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,318
That's not exactly
what I was going for.

714
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,756
- No, no, I meant--
I just meant you look great.

715
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:58,456
Uh, come on in.

716
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,590
Hey, how'd it go?

717
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:04,810
- Really well, yeah.
- Good.

718
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:07,377
- Thanks for asking.
- Hey, yeah, sure.

719
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:09,771
- How're the babies?
- They're exhausting.

720
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:12,034
Adorable.
- Sleeping?

721
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:15,124
- Yes, sleeping.
She, uh,

722
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:16,909
jammed on this bad boy
quite a bit.

723
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,869
She loves this.
- Yeah.

724
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,442
- You--you have a...
- Oh.

725
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,748
- A sweet potato?
- Oh.

726
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,098
I think yam actually.

727
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,969
- It's a good look for you.

728
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,537
- Yeah, it's kind of
becoming my go to.

729
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,539
- There's more.

730
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:41,107
Here.

731
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,505
- Thanks.
