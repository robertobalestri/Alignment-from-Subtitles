1
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:19,280
- How is Jacob today?
- Same as yesterday.

2
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,108
- Ava.

3
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,831
How is Jacob today?

4
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,270
- That's why I've been looking
for you.

5
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:24,334
Well, if it isn't
my daily lifesaver.

6
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,510
- Ah--oh, don't forget
that tomorrow

7
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,338
the daycare is closed
until 10:00.

8
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,513
- It is?

9
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,255
Uh, how am I--
what am I gonna do?

10
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,430
- Doesn't Luna
have a babysitter?

11
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,780
- Uh, you're looking at him.

12
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,521
Friends?

13
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,870
Yeah, you're looking at him.

14
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,829
- Sorry, Dr. Goodwin,
but tomorrow's

15
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,787
the "Breastfeeding Class
for New Moms."

16
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,615
- Right--whose idea was that?

17
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,530
- Yours.
- Yeah, it was mine.

18
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,576
I knew that.
Bye.

19
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,849
- Hello?
- Um, hi, this is, uh,

20
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,677
Max Goodwin,
not sure if you remember me.

21
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,896
We met in the waiting room
at New Amsterdam.

22
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,072
- Mm.
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

23
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:10,859
- Oh, uh, okay.
Sorry, nevermind.

24
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,861
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

25
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,732
How could I forget the doctor
who snuck me in

26
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:15,907
to my kid's surgery?

27
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,083
- Yeah.
Yeah, right.

28
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,563
Um--

29
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,783
so, the reason I'm calling
is that

30
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,960
it appears Luna has an opening
in her very busy schedule

31
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,397
tomorrow morning
and was wondering

32
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:31,662
if Bobbi would like to play
some competitive racquetball.

33
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,751
- Oh, wow.
Yeah, Bobbi would love that.

34
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,536
She's been working
on her backhand.

35
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,102
- Good, okay, great.

36
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,974
'Cause Luna has been
practicing her topspin, so--

37
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,672
- Actually, we have
this routine.

38
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,326
We've been spending
our mornings

39
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,372
in Madison Square Park
across from the dog run.

40
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,069
Around 8:00 a.m.?

41
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:50,333
- Uh, yeah--no, 8:00 a.m. is,
uh, perfect.

42
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:53,380
I will see you there--
we will see you there.

43
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,643
- Okay.

44
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,734
- Yeah.

45
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:00,996
- It's not as though
I haven't tried to tell him.

46
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,780
- It's not that hard.

47
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,782
You just say, "Max, Amy and I
are moving to San Francisco."

48
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,436
Boom.
Done.

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,090
Unless you were dragging
your size 12's for a reason.

50
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,700
- Woman...

51
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,572
you are way off base.

52
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,356
Am I?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,750
- Maybe you just prefer
subway rats and dirty slush

54
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,492
over wine country and winters
that feel like spring.

55
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,624
- Ah.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,409
- Oh, here we go.

57
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,802
About to show you how bad I
wanna go right here, right now.

58
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:25,977
- All right,
show me what you got.

59
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,152
- All right, look.
Yo, Max.

60
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,893
Can I talk to you for a second?

61
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,373
- Yeah, actually, you're just
the man I wanted to see.

62
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,809
Uh, can you cover
for me tomorrow

63
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,158
at the, uh,
"Pharmacy Formulary Meeting"?

64
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,421
- Look before we get into
all that--

65
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,813
- I know it's boring,

66
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,641
but I've been struggling
with this whole

67
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,427
single parenting thing,
and, um, I have an opportunity

68
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,690
to give Luna a playdate
with this other little girl,

69
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,735
and I just feel like
I need some time to, you know,

70
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,476
be a dad

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,524
and try to give her everything
Georgia would've wanted.

72
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,830
- Max, I--
- He'll cover for you.

73
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,006
He will cover for you.
- Really?

74
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,878
- You kidding?
Go be a dad.

75
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,401
- Yeah?
Thank you.

76
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,663
- Mm-hmm.
- Amazing. I owe you, buddy.

77
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,578
Big time.
Thank you.

78
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:06,670
- Yeah, okay,
that was harder than it looked.

79
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:07,845
- You're weak.

80
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,937
- Morning.

81
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,678
Yikes.
Hey.

82
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,680
Sounds like Ashley's trying
to break her own record, huh?

83
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,987
- Nonstop screaming for
three days takes dedication.

84
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,510
- Right.

85
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,469
- I think she's determined
to make a point.

86
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,601
A thank you
from Nelson's family.

87
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,168
Isn't that so nice?
- Aw, yeah.

88
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:30,520
That is lovely.
And out you go.

89
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,566
Okay.

90
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,829
- If you'd read the card,
you'd know they were for

91
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,439
the whole department.

92
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,049
- I'm only making healthy
choices now.

93
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,705
For Martin, for my kids.
Healthy choices, Gladys.

94
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:42,880
Healthy choices!

95
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,580
- Okay, do you know what?
Just stop.

96
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,496
Rodney, look at me.
This is an emergency room.

97
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,889
Every time you guys update
the system this happens,

98
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,195
and it's unacceptable.

99
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,240
I need to be able to update
patient files.

100
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,894
I need to be able to check
lab results.

101
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,201
I need computers that recognize
the letter "H".

102
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,985
- I fixed the "H" thing.

103
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,857
- Rodney.
- Just give me another minute.

104
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,902
- I put Louise Galena
in Bay 28.

105
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,557
She definitely has cellulitis
and a severe fungal infection.

106
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,080
- Okay, we're gonna need
a Hematology consult.

107
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,734
Let's page Sharpe.

108
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,475
- Oh, uh, I wouldn't.
It's all connected.

109
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,781
Just to be safe.

110
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,260
- Go and find Sharpe in person

111
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,741
and drag her down here
yourself, and you--yeah.

112
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,003
- Almost got it!

113
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,179
- Thank you.

114
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,833
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

115
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,531
It's very exciting.

116
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,576
It is a Phase Two trial
of a vascular endothelial

117
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,491
growth factor receptor
antagonist.

118
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:29,710
- How many patients
do you anticipate enrolling?

119
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,059
- Funding covers up to 40.

120
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,235
- And are there any
demographic parameters?

121
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,803
- Yes, I am looking for men
and women age 40 to 65

122
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,587
with naive tumors.

123
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,111
Do any of you have patients
fitting that criteria?

124
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,591
Fabulous.
Forward me their files,

125
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,767
and we will get started
on this bad boy.

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,988
- Okay, now we have
a lot to cover

127
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,731
so let's start on page one.
Using objective market and...

128
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,082
- Louise, hi.
I'm Dr. Sharpe.

129
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,518
- Hi.

130
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,780
- May I take a look
at your arm?

131
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,739
- Mm-hmm.
- Now that's pretty.

132
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,958
Is it a daisy?
- Daylily.

133
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,525
I like to grow them.

134
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,833
- There's fabric around
the infection sites.

135
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,748
Do you know what it is?

136
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,837
Pantyhose.

137
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,535
Sometimes I try
to hide my extra skin

138
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,103
by wrapping them up.

139
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:19,150
When I wear the right blouse,
people don't stare so much.

140
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:21,152
- They make compression
sleeves for that

141
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:24,199
that won't abrade your skin.
- I can't afford those.

142
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:27,158
I tried to leave it looser
this time.

143
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,987
- So this has happened before?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,295
- Okay, we're going to get you
started on some anti-fungals.

145
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,079
Have you feeling better
straight away.

146
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,821
- Know what would actually
make me feel better?

147
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:42,130
Taking my garden shears and
slicing these things clean off.

148
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,225
- We're gonna do
everything that we can.

149
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,793
Lauren.

150
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,708
Louise Galena just mentioned
self-harm.

151
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,188
- Minister Reid.

152
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,843
Brand new T-shirts, I see?
Very bright.

153
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,628
- Helps if people know
why we're here, Max.

154
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,238
- Yeah, didn't realize it was
our turn again so soon.

155
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,240
- You can always check our
website to see our route.

156
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,068
- Good to know.
- What do you say?

157
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,070
Have a little interfaith
prayer with us today?

158
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,854
We could use your help.
- I think I'll, uh,

159
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,682
stick to helping people
the old fashioned way.

160
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,336
- I think prayer's been around
longer than medicine,

161
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,294
my friend.

162
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,905
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

163
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,602
- You want me to clear
these folks out of here?

164
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,212
- Aw, no, it's fine, Joe.
They're not hurting anybody.

165
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,954
- You got that right.
I heard after they showed up,

166
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,783
some guy who was in a coma
14 years woke up.

167
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,180
- I knew this day would come.

168
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:35,096
After all these years,
his eyes are finally open.

169
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,185
And he's looking at me!

170
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:42,059
He's squeezing my hand.
I can feel him!

171
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,714
- Those are reflexive actions
of his brainstem.

172
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,717
- I have been coming
here for 14 years,

173
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,371
sitting by his side,

174
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,895
waiting for him to look at me.

175
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,593
And he is.

176
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,123
People have been known
to wake up from comas, yes,

177
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,299
but that's not Jacob.

178
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,128
He remains in a persistent
vegetative state.

179
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:11,393
He's not in there, Annie.
- How can you say that?

180
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,917
I mean, how can you know?

181
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,050
Truly?

182
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,140
- This is the miracle
I've been waiting for.

183
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,837
My husband's back.

184
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:26,843
And now you have to make him
whole again.

185
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:33,633
- Oh, keep the change.
Thank you.

186
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,243
Hello.

187
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,593
So I see your prayer buddies
have returned.

188
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,682
- It does feel like they're
here more often, doesn't it?

189
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:40,857
Why?
What's that smile?

190
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:41,902
- What this thing?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,338
- It's nothing.

192
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,731
They irk you,
and I find it funny.

193
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,602
- No, I think it's great
they wanna help the sick,

194
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,473
I just don't know how they're
gonna do that from the lobby.

195
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,650
- Although, I gotta say,
right after they showed up

196
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,608
my patient Ashley

197
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,479
who's been screaming at the
top of her lungs for three days

198
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,264
miraculously stopped.
- You don't seriously think

199
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,440
it's from the praying, do you?
- I don't ask questions.

200
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,311
I just enjoy the silence.

201
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,836
Which has allowed me, actually,
to jot down a bunch of ideas

202
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,707
for our Pharmacy Formulary
meeting tomorrow.

203
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,709
they're some winners.

204
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,319
- Well, you'll be sharing them
with Reynolds

205
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:11,235
because I have a, um,
playdate.

206
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,541
- You have a playdate?

207
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,369
- Luna and her new friend
have a playdate.

208
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,676
Her mother and I will just
be there for supervision.

209
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,460
You know, make sure
nobody falls off a--

210
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,636
- Yes, Max Goodwin, I fully
support this next step for you.

211
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,768
This is good.
- Not a step, not a step.

212
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,813
Not stepping, just a playdate.

213
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,641
- Yeah, but it's got the word
"date" baked right into it.

214
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,295
- I know,
but play is the first word,

215
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,949
so I don't think it's a date.
- Semantics.

216
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,733
- I don't think it's a date.
- It's a date, it's a date.

217
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,517
- I think it's just playing.
- Boy, you do not stay

218
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,345
in one place for long, do you?
- Could've just paged me.

219
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,696
- It's not really an option.
We just admitted a 13-year-old

220
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,436
who's presenting with symptoms
of a heart attack.

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,525
He checks all the CDC boxes,
and you wanted to know if--

222
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:41,962
- When New Amsterdam
got our first case.

223
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,398
- Yeah, and Reynolds
is with him right now.

224
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,182
- Okay, thanks.

225
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,576
- Jackson has extensive damage
to both of his lungs.

226
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,230
I'm going to have to perform

227
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,666
what is called
a "Bronchial-Alveolar Lavage"

228
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,363
to determine the extent
of his injuries.

229
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,322
- So it's not a heart attack?

230
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,325
- No, CDC is calling it
"EVALI."

231
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,848
- I've never heard of that.

232
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,589
- That's because the disease
is only a few months old.

233
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:03,766
It stands for E-cigarette
or Vaping Lung Injury.

234
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,594
- Vaping?

235
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,684
- He's an honor student.
He's in all AP courses.

236
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,860
Have you seen him smoking?
- No, never.

237
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,689
- Well, kids have become really
good at hiding these things

238
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,649
sometimes in, uh, plain sight.
It's an epidemic.

239
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,434
- Jack?

240
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,393
- Will he be all right?

241
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,659
- This is an unknown world,
Mrs. Lowe.

242
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,924
- Even now, your son is one
of only hundreds of cases.

243
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,231
But we are gonna do everything
that we can.

244
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:40,847
- Um, hi, Alice, this message
is for Bobbi, actually.

245
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,500
Unfortunately,

246
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,415
Luna had something
very important come up,

247
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,550
and she can no longer make it
to the playdate tomorrow, so--

248
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:51,422
uh, sorry for the short notice,
I'm just--um, sorry.

249
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,512
- Looks like you could use some
positive vibes aimed your way.

250
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,777
- I have no problem
with you guys being here,

251
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,474
but I also have
a 13-year-old patient

252
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:00,954
with a disease that has
no known cure.

253
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,694
So if you and your group
really wanted to help out,

254
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,435
you could try donating
blood or volunteering.

255
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,002
- Max, these people
are donating.

256
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,569
- You know what I mean.

257
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,876
- But I don't think you know
what I mean, hmm?

258
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,880
I love science, medicine.
I believe in them,

259
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:17,971
but they can't explain what I
appreciate most in this world.

260
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,365
Love, music, heroism.

261
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:26,588
So we throw our anchor past
the senses into a deeper truth.

262
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:27,937
The intangible.

263
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,592
- Yeah, well, I guess when
lives are at stake,

264
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,333
I'm just more interested
in the tangible.

265
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,292
- Hey, Dr. G, did you hear?
- Hear what?

266
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,903
- They just told me
I was in remission.

267
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,557
What are the odds, huh?

268
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,041
- Big Mike, that's amazing.
- Give me some.

269
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,525
You mind if I sit in?
- No, man, please.

270
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,702
This is ridiculous.

271
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:54,921
- Unbelievable.

272
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,367
- Okay, okay, listen up.

273
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,021
I mean, we have already
cut screens

274
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,500
from patient interactions.

275
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,893
We don't need computers.

276
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,940
All we need is our wits

277
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,986
and some paper.

278
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,901
All right, come on.

279
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,077
Let's do this.

280
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,079
- Since I can't email
prescriptions to the pharmacy,

281
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,081
how are discharged patients
gonna get their meds?

282
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,650
- You'll write them down.
Maybe here on this pad.

283
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,478
And what shall we call
this amazing invention?

284
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,958
This pad on which
we write prescriptions?

285
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,571
- Um, he's got abdominal pain.

286
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,051
- And?

287
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,009
- Usually the computer tells me
what comes next

288
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,881
after I type in the symptom.

289
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,492
- Are you seriously telling me
that one of my residents

290
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,102
doesn't know what to do
about a tummy ache?

291
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,023
Okay, this is ridiculous.

292
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,677
How is there not
a single working pen

293
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,940
in this entire building?
- Here, try this one.

294
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,681
- Incoming!

295
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,900
- All right,
now we're in business.

296
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,684
Watch and learn.

297
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:03,859
All right, fellas,
what do we got?

298
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,513
- 53-year-old male

299
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,949
complaining of crushing
substernal chest pain.

300
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,777
- Okay, what's your name, sir?

301
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,521
- Ikaika Namakaokealohahaunele.

302
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,873
- With an "A" or an "E"?

303
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,876
- Ever since I was a kid,
I was big.

304
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,012
By the time I was 20,
I was about 375 pounds.

305
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,014
I could barely walk.

306
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,407
- That must've been
frustrating.

307
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,541
- People'd say I wasn't trying
hard enough to lose the weight.

308
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,717
That it was my fault
I was so fat.

309
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,414
- That's--

310
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,547
obesity is not
a willpower issue.

311
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,983
It's not.
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:45,553
I've, um, you know--
I've been there.

313
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:46,771
- So you know.

314
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:52,516
Then one of my doctors told me
obesity was a disease.

315
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,431
- Yeah.
- And like any other disease,

316
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,172
it could be treated.
- Yeah, that's correct.

317
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,696
- Well, I was ready to try
damn near anything.

318
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,743
So I started taking
this medication,

319
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,007
and I started losing weight,
and I felt healthier.

320
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:11,448
I really did, but they never
told me about these skin flaps.

321
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,015
Wasn't like I loved
my body before,

322
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,930
but at least
it was my body.

323
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,108
This makes me feel like
I'm wearing an extra coat.

324
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:23,678
People stare at me more now
than they did when I was fat.

325
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,163
- Louise, do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

326
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,473
- Hey, there are--
there are surgeries.

327
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,692
You know that right?

328
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,259
Where they remove
the excess skin--

329
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:42,131
- It's all I think about,
but it costs a fortune,

330
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:47,093
and my insurance won't pay
for it, so this is my life now.

331
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,617
- No, no, that is not the case.
I'm not giving up on you.

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,837
Okay?
Don't you either.

333
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,104
- Helen, hey.
- Hi.

334
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,627
Did any of your patients

335
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,107
get into Dr. Castro's
Stage Two trial?

336
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,804
- Only one.
- Hm.

337
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,067
Not a single one
of my eligible patients got in.

338
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,548
- None?
- None of Dr. Shoji's either.

339
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,593
Now if Dr. Castro's gotten
government funding

340
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,248
for 40 patients,
where are they coming from?

341
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,562
- I flew all the way
from Chicago for this?

342
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,129
- Sam, come on.
- Sorry, it's just--

343
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,219
- Your father's still in there
trying to talk to us.

344
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,830
Trying to communicate with us.
- But he's not.

345
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,312
I mean, why can't you see that?
He's gone.

346
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:37,012
- Mom, we know how badly you
want Dad to still be here.

347
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:42,104
We miss him too, but these
are just involuntary movements.

348
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,671
- I mean, at this point

349
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:44,846
we're all doing involuntary
movements.

350
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,021
- You haven't been here.

351
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,676
Neither of you
have been here enough

352
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,243
to see that these
are different.

353
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,029
- Are these different?

354
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:56,858
- No.

355
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:02,037
- Does our father show
any signs of--what is it?

356
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,257
Higher brain function?

357
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,563
- No.

358
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,130
- And you told us 14 years ago

359
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,871
that it takes more
than a beating heart

360
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:13,831
to declare someone alive,
so is my father alive?

361
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,312
- He has no cerebral
cortical function,

362
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,793
so I would have to say no.

363
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,144
- You listen to him, Mom?
Please?

364
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,843
He told us this 14 years ago.
He just said it again.

365
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,193
How much longer do
we have to be stuck

366
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:30,065
at this never-ending wake?

367
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,071
- Sam's right, Mom.

368
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,726
- It looked so real.

369
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:44,079
- We all want it to be real;
it just isn't.

370
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:53,219
- What would happen
if we were to, uh...

371
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,790
...To let him go?

372
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:04,055
- If we were to remove
his, uh, feeding tube,

373
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,319
his body would be deprived
of nutrients,

374
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,366
and within a few days
his organs would start to fail,

375
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,936
but I assure you
that he would not experience

376
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,764
any pain or suffering.

377
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,608
- ...90.

378
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,176
- 50 mils normal saline
at 24 degrees standing by.

379
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,700
- Initial BAL results show
lipid laden macrophages

380
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,528
consistent with
hot chemical burns.

381
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:44,226
Basically the same
as chemical warfare.

382
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,576
Any ideas?
- Not off the top of my head.

383
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,578
So let's see what
the CDC recommends.

384
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,232
- When's the last time
you had to look up

385
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,842
a treatment guideline?

386
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,193
- I don't know.
Not since I was an intern.

387
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,585
All right, the, uh, CDC

388
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,761
recommends this week,
let's see here--

389
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,894
"vent settings with low tidal
volumes and high P.E.E.P."

390
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,591
- That's temporizing, at best.

391
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,593
- Well, we're all
flying blind here.

392
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:06,727
Let me try to locate a, uh,
PCSK9 modulator.

393
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,816
A dose or two might knock down
some of the inflammation.

394
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:13,342
- Based on what evidence?
- Like I said, flying blind.

395
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,783
- He could hear us.

396
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,830
He knew what
we were talking about.

397
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,312
He was begging for us to stop--
- Mom, please.

398
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,793
- Annie, that was an expulsion
of air over his vocal cords.

399
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,622
Just a reflex,
like his eye movements.

400
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:38,193
- I can't believe I almost made
the biggest mistake of my life.

401
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,630
- Dr. Kapoor,

402
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,807
how long could he live if
she kept the feeding tube in?

403
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,462
- Conservative guess?

404
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,985
Another 20 years.

405
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,557
- I can't do this
another 20 years.

406
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,821
I can't.

407
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,867
Goodbye, Mom.
- You're leaving?

408
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,695
I don't--
I don't know what else to do.

409
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,479
- He's my husband!

410
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,701
- He was.
He was your husband.

411
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,485
And he was my father.

412
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,922
I swear it's like you both died
that day.

413
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,315
- Sam, your mother has--

414
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,447
- She's tethered herself
to this bed.

415
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,839
Never leaving the borough.

416
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,363
Never getting to know
her grandchildren.

417
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:18,973
14 years wasted and for what?

418
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:22,281
- I'm not removing
his feeding tube.

419
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:28,591
- Yeah.
Well...

420
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,949
- Well, despite the chest pains
and labored breathing,

421
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,516
your EKG came back normal.

422
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,996
So maybe there's
an environmental cause?

423
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,608
What do you do for a living?

424
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,741
- I work the L Train expansion.

425
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,395
- Oh, so we're both
in the Dark Ages.

426
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,354
- You wear a mask
in the tunnels?

427
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,877
- Nah, I don't like
the smell of my own breath.

428
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,924
- You exercise?
- Only if you count smoking.

429
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,752
- All right,
deep breath for me.

430
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,583
- All right, this could be
pulmonary edema.

431
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,367
We're gonna get you on lasix,

432
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,716
and then back to making
questionable health choices

433
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,761
in no time.

434
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,589
- Hey, doc, just remember,

435
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,895
if I drop dead, the L Train's
only gonna take longer.

436
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,636
- Duly noted.

437
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,470
Where's his chart?
- Whose chart?

438
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,559
- Who's got Ikaika's chart?

439
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,996
- Sorry, I was putting
notes on it.

440
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,739
- Is that a coffee stain?
- ...while getting coffee.

441
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,438
- Okay, new rule, people.

442
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:36,398
The charts don't come with you.
You come to the charts, okay?

443
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,313
Give me that.

444
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,012
- Valentina!

445
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,537
I've, uh,
I've been meaning to ask,

446
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,756
how's enrollment going
on your trial?

447
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,018
- Great.
Thanks.

448
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,803
- You filled all 40 slots?

449
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,631
- I'm only enrolling 15.

450
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,981
- Isn't it our goal to help
as many people as we can?

451
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:56,462
- My goal is not to help
40 people right now,

452
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,334
but to help millions later when
we bring a new drug to market.

453
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,423
- I just see people
who are suffering now,

454
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,599
and you can help them.
That's why I brought you here.

455
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:07,473
- Helen, you did not
bring me here.

456
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,475
And I don't appreciate
your tone.

457
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,738
In fact, now that I'm chair,

458
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,567
I don't even have to have
this conversation.

459
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,445
- No.

460
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,492
- Was not the answer
I was hoping to hear.

461
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,581
- We don't cover
brachioplasties.

462
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:29,930
They're cosmetic.

463
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,454
- No.
No, no, no.

464
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,630
This, uh, this is not cosmetic.

465
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:37,416
I mean, yes,
technically it is cosmetic.

466
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,156
You busted me,
but, uh, Louise--

467
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,550
her skin leaves her
with a whole host

468
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,423
of very real psychological
and physical problems.

469
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,425
- Sorry.
Her claim is rejected.

470
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:50,124
- Hardball.
I heard about you.

471
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,822
I can play that game.
May I?

472
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:56,130
Why don't I reword
Louise's diagnosis?

473
00:23:56,173 --> 00:24:02,049
"Louise Galena has
Body Dysmorphic Disorder."

474
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:06,401
And that one is in the DSM.

475
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,620
So what do you say?

476
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,057
You wanna try this dance
one more time?

477
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,494
- Mental illness is not
justifiable reason

478
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,017
for cosmetic surgery.

479
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,499
If it were, they'd have to
cover every sad person

480
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,893
who thought a face lift
could cure their depression.

481
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:23,679
Brachioplasties are coded in
the system as cosmetic,

482
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,116
and there are no enhancements
or modifiers

483
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,857
that will ever change that.

484
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,164
- But this is--this is a life
or death situation, Larkin.

485
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,688
It is.
Louise is depressed.

486
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,908
She's angry.
She's struggling.

487
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,824
She came to us for help,
and we only cured her halfway.

488
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,740
We left he with rolls
of loose skin that chafe

489
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:42,959
and give her
necrotic infections.

490
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,744
And you're telling me
with all your knowhow,

491
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,659
there's nothing
we can do for her?

492
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,097
- We can cover meds
for the rashes.

493
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,147
- Dr. Kapoor.
Something's wrong with Jacob.

494
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,719
I only had my eyes closed
for a moment.

495
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,939
And when I woke
he was like this.

496
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,723
You have to do something.
You have to bring him back.

497
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,769
- Annie, there is nothing
I can do.

498
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:13,729
- Surely there's something--
he was improving!

499
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,035
- He wasn't.

500
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,472
Whether his eyes
are closed or open,

501
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,692
whether he's squeezing
your hand or sleeping,

502
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:23,086
Jacob is not here.
He never was.

503
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,569
- He's all I have left.

504
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,663
- Uh, got the modulator.
Almost to you.

505
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,578
- Jackson popped a lung.

506
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,058
- The ventilator was supposed
to keep him stabilized!

507
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,582
- He was stable,
and then he just crashed.

508
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,236
I can't figure out
what the hell changed.

509
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,678
- Hey, uh, what happened
to the prayer group?

510
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,680
- They left, like,
five minutes ago.

511
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,999
- Oh, there you are.

512
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,261
- I'm on my way out.
Can it wait?

513
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:08,567
- It's about Castro's
clinical trial.

514
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,220
I have some concerns.
- So I've heard.

515
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:11,439
- What do you mean?

516
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,049
- Uh, Castro already
came to me.

517
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,355
Apparently she has
some concerns with you.

518
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,270
She has concerns with me?

519
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,141
- Well, that you're having
trouble accepting your new role

520
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,100
in the department, and that
you're overstepping her trial.

521
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:22,102
- That's--all I did
was point out

522
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,495
that she's leaving
25 patient slots unfilled.

523
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,628
That's 25 patients we could
be helping, but we're not.

524
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,587
- Well, I hear you,
and I agree.

525
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,328
- I should jolly well hope so.
- But NIH is funding the trial.

526
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,766
They're paying us, and Castro
is in the driver's seat.

527
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:37,465
- Okay, so we just stand by and
watch her cherry-pick patients?

528
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,075
- No, we stand by

529
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,381
and let Castro run the trial
the way she wants

530
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:43,166
because those are the rules.

531
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,646
- I'm certainly glad to know

532
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,430
that we're all about
following rules these days.

533
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,345
Helen, that's not what--

534
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,620
- May I?

535
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,589
Your mother loves you
very much.

536
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,636
- She barely knows me.
Or my kids.

537
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,465
- She gave up everything
after Dad's accident.

538
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,212
My wife died
several years ago...

539
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,609
And I would have done
anything to bring her back.

540
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,221
I cannot imagine
if she was still breathing

541
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:40,702
in front of my very eyes.

542
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:44,358
As a neurologist,
I know your father is dead.

543
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,318
His soul is gone.

544
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:51,278
But even I would find it
difficult to say good-bye.

545
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:55,325
Your mother sees that...

546
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,287
And she's trapped between
life and death.

547
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,683
She wants to move on.

548
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,468
She wants to let go.

549
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,513
- So why can't she?

550
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,476
- Because she has
pushed you both away.

551
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:19,785
If she lets your father go,

552
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,743
once and for all,

553
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,615
she believes she will be
truly alone.

554
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,197
- We've reached a crossroads,
Rodney.

555
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,851
- Look, closing in.
No, like, for real this time.

556
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,766
- How close are we talking?
- Four keystrokes.

557
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,290
Just gotta pop in my ADMIN
password, and we're home.

558
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,814
Oh.

559
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,685
- Oh, you are so lucky

560
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,513
you're in an emergency room
right now, Rodney.

561
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,342
- Hey, help!
I need help!

562
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,779
- What is it?
- I can't see.

563
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,607
It's my right eye.
I can't see anything!

564
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,522
- Okay, okay, okay.

565
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,829
Uh, we're gonna need a CT
with contrast, and let's page--

566
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,353
no, no,
run and find ophthalmology.

567
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,312
- Mr. and Mrs. Lowe?

568
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,186
So...

569
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,492
your son's lungs
have failed,

570
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:19,322
and we had to put Jackson
on heart-lung bypass.

571
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:22,369
Will he be okay?

572
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:24,327
- Will he get...

573
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,852
- We just don't know enough
about the disease yet

574
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,375
to make any kind of prediction.

575
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,724
- Vaping's been around
for years.

576
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,291
How can you guys
still not know?

577
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,901
- The products
are always changing.

578
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:36,513
And they're not being tested;
they're not being regulated.

579
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,341
I mean, we're still learning

580
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:41,344
what the chemicals are doing
to his body and to his lungs.

581
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,479
I'm sorry,
I wish I had better news.

582
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,655
- What are you saying?

583
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,832
- I'm gonna do everything
in my power to help your boy,

584
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:54,705
but you need to be
prepared for...

585
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,273
- No.

586
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,842
- It's--
- No!

587
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,374
- Hey, uh, Mr. Reid.

588
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:13,550
Uh, I checked the website.
You're right, very thorough.

589
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,509
- Max, what are you doing here?

590
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,945
- Um, do you remember
the teenager

591
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,687
that I was telling you about?
He's, uh--

592
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,646
let's say his situation has
exceeded the limits

593
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,999
of, uh, modern medicine,
and he's just a kid.

594
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,696
Uh, he made an honest mistake,

595
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:32,874
and, uh, he's running out
of time, so I thought...

596
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:37,836
I thought maybe you guys
could--

597
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,576
- Pray for him?

598
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:43,842
- Put him in your minds,
or whatever it is that you--

599
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:48,759
Um, his name is Jackson Lowe,

600
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,414
and he could really use--
- A miracle.

601
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,765
- If you have one to spare.

602
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:59,292
- Max.
Doesn't work that way.

603
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,295
- Then why do you do it?

604
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,732
I mean, why else do you come in
my hospital?

605
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:05,907
Why do you come here?

606
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,909
- You know what miracles are?

607
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,780
They're the word
for the shoreline

608
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,740
between what we understand
and what we can't.

609
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,960
- Then what is praying

610
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:18,528
if not asking for some higher
power to do something helpful,

611
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,921
something useful?

612
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,837
- When we do it right,
prayer changes us.

613
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,752
Not the other way around.

614
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:27,755
Whether we're praying for
forgiveness, or gratitude,

615
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:30,018
or guidance,
we're not looking out, Max.

616
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,672
We're looking in.

617
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,805
And if you can find that
shoreline within yourself,

618
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,765
I mean really find it,

619
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:41,812
that's when you got a shot
at one of your miracles.

620
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:02,007
- Hey.
Hi.

621
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,445
- Sorry, I'm--

622
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:08,491
I usually save
my violent outbursts

623
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:09,971
for somewhere
a little more private.

624
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:11,799
- Hey, believe me,
there are way worse things

625
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,540
you can do alone
in a stairwell.

626
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,456
- All I was trying to do
was help more people,

627
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,632
and I'm the one who gets
clobbered for it?

628
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,982
- You get clobbered--
I'm sorry, by who?

629
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,810
Oh--

630
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,595
By the relentlessly unfair and
stupid system we all live in.

631
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,468
Ah, that.

632
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,687
- Yes, I'm very familiar
with its work.

633
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,995
Do you, um--do you remember
the patient you referred to me?

634
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,824
- Yeah, Louise Galena.
- Galena, yeah.

635
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:39,087
- So despite substantial

636
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,741
physical and emotional
suffering,

637
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,569
insurance,
in their infinite wisdom,

638
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:45,485
has decided not to cover
her skin removal surgery.

639
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,748
They're calling it cosmetic.

640
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,793
Cosmetic--
it's just, like--

641
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,840
If you had
a breast cancer patient

642
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,929
who needed a mastectomy,
insurance would cover that

643
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,670
plus the reconstructive surgery
after it, yes?

644
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,498
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!

645
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,717
Because with cancer, insurance
pays to finish the job.

646
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,111
But Louise has been
just abandoned

647
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,765
halfway through a treatment

648
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,593
because even though obesity
is a disease,

649
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,029
it still isn't treated
like one.

650
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,728
- Then let's give her cancer.

651
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,600
- What?

652
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:40,453
Hello?

653
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,630
Up there?

654
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:49,157
I'm not really into this whole
praying thing, but, uh...

655
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,944
My parents did a lot of it
when my sister was sick, and...

656
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,167
Didn't do a lot of good,

657
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:02,518
but...

658
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:07,175
I could really use
a miracle down here.

659
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,264
And I know that's
not how it works.

660
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,005
Believe me.

661
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:15,401
But of all the...

662
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,185
chaos in the world,

663
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,406
all the unfathomable,
unspeakable things

664
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,190
that happen to people...

665
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,935
Can't one of them be good?

666
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:32,026
I don't have anything to, um,

667
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,944
bargain with,
or offer except maybe this...

668
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,209
Empty part of me that...

669
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:44,430
I'm willing to fill up
with something.

670
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,129
New.

671
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,265
Yeah, anyways.

672
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,138
Jackson could really use
your help.

673
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:01,099
We're in OR 7
if you need specifics.

674
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:10,325
There you go.
Hang in there.

675
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,548
- What are we missing?

676
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,506
- Who has Ikaika's chart?

677
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,987
- Something useful to add?
- No.

678
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,120
But he had some dizziness when
I took him to the bathroom.

679
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,599
- Whew, how about his pee,
right?

680
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,384
- What?
- It stank.

681
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,342
How'd you not notice that?
- Glass houses, my friend.

682
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,257
- Psh, no, my pee smells great.

683
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,651
- No, I mean you didn't notice
how swollen his neck was?

684
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:34,480
I read your notes.
You skipped right by it.

685
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,482
- How would you even
fit that in the notes?

686
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:39,137
- It isn't a computer.
You can write on the side.

687
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,356
- He's an elephant.

688
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,360
Let's get Ikaika on dialysis.
It's nephrotic syndrome.

689
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,710
- I think I speak for
a few of us here when I ask,

690
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:49,495
how is he an elephant?

691
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,627
- Well, a bunch of blind people
touching an elephant

692
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:54,021
when asked, will all say
it's something different.

693
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,588
The person at the trunk
will say it's a snake,

694
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,677
the person at the leg
will say it's a tree.

695
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,722
Only by combining
all of these observations

696
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,289
do we see it's an elephant.

697
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,291
Numb feet, swollen neck,
foul-smelling urine.

698
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:04,771
It's nephrotic syndrome.
- Huh.

699
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,688
- You had better get
the L Train done on time, okay?

700
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,734
Okay, Dr. Bloom.

701
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,388
That's it.
Just gotta reboot the system

702
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,694
and this whole place
will be back online.

703
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:23,746
- You know what?
Take your time.

704
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,447
- Oh, yeah,
that definitely looks like

705
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,277
a dysplastic nevi to me.
And there's one.

706
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,714
Yup, yup,
that one's gonna work.

707
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,411
- Ooh, that dot
looks super cancery.

708
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,283
- Maybe leave this bit
to the oncologist.

709
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,414
- Right.

710
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,329
- Is this really gonna work?

711
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,071
- Louise, patients
with more than 100 moles

712
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,682
are at far greater risk
of developing severe melanoma.

713
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,381
At this point, let's just say
I've lost count.

714
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:52,210
So I'm going to suggest
we skip the biopsy entirely

715
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,646
and have all
of the skin removed.

716
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,517
Just to be safe.

717
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,780
- And there's definitely
an insurance code for that.

718
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,349
- Does that mean...?

719
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,221
- Your procedure
will be covered fully?

720
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,352
Yeah.

721
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:09,139
I don't know what to say!

722
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,793
Thank you!

723
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,752
Ooh, thank you so much!

724
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,239
- Annie?

725
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,418
Tell her.
It's okay.

726
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,292
- We want you to be
a part of our life.

727
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,599
Your life.

728
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,255
- We just want our mom back.

729
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:34,312
- There are times when even
we find ourselves surprised.

730
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,226
- How did this happen?

731
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,793
- Could be the experimental
agent we used

732
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,491
to reduce the inflammation.

733
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:43,886
It could be his own body
fighting back the damage.

734
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,367
The CDC is still searching
for treatments,

735
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,935
and there are kids Jackson's
age who haven't been so lucky.

736
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,939
We may never know what helped
your son turn the corner today,

737
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:56,464
but sometimes
you just take the win.

738
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:58,423
Right, Max?

739
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,556
- Amen to that.

740
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,649
Uh, hey.
- Hey.

741
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,564
- Uh, sorry about earlier.
- It's fine.

742
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,436
- No, it's not,
so I made up for it.

743
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,351
- Well, I seem to have missed
the making up for it part.

744
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,483
- Yeah, well, I got a call
from our Insurance Liaison

745
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:17,659
about a patient who had 107
perfectly spaced,

746
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:19,879
atypical moles
spanning both arms,

747
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,707
requiring
reconstructive surgery.

748
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,883
She thought that sounded
a little suspect.

749
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,451
- Did you approve it?

750
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:28,801
- Sure did.

751
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:31,630
Told her today
was full of miracles.

752
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,940
- I hear you're
taking the morning off.

753
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,248
- No, I canceled my thing.
- What thing?

754
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,729
- I accidentally accepted
a date with a woman,

755
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,034
and I am--

756
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,514
not ready for that.

757
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:47,907
- Someone asked you on a date?

758
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,430
- Yeah, well,
she called it a playdate.

759
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:50,692
It was for the baby.
She's a mom.

760
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:51,954
- Oh.

761
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,695
Where was this supposed
to take place?

762
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:54,827
- Park.

763
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,437
- What time?
- 8:00 a.m.

764
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,352
- Well, that doesn't really
sound like a date.

765
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,876
- To be fair, she didn't
explicitly say it's not a date.

766
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,661
- Then why did you think
it was a date?

767
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:06,491
- Because I have no idea
what I'm doing.

768
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:13,628
Max, doesn't Luna deserve
to have a new friend?

769
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:17,632
