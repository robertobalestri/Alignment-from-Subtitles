1
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,306
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

2
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,178
I thought you left.

3
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:51,486
- Not until you want me to.

4
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,800
- Okay, we got
Sameera's tofu bacon,

5
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:05,500
Harper's regular bacon,
and Raffi's turkey bacon.

6
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,458
- Hey, if I pick up Harper
and Sameera from karate,

7
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,547
will you grab Raffi from D&D?

8
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,593
- Yes, that just leaves
Saleem's piano at 4:00.

9
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,161
- No more piano.
I told you!

10
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,727
- Well, it would save money,

11
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,121
but, um, shouldn't we be
teaching them to stick it out?

12
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:20,732
I will grab the troops.

13
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,691
- Okay.
Thanks, babe.

14
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,128
Hello?
- Dr. Frome? It's Roz.

15
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,347
- All right, Raffi,
grab your homework.

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,131
- Roz, hey.
Hi.

17
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,351
- Great news.
I have a baby for you.

18
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,527
- What?
You--you have, like, a real--

19
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,573
uh, uh, now?

20
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,575
- You and Martin have 24 hours
to report

21
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,664
to Brownsville, Texas to start
the custody paperwork.

22
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,623
- That's--that's not
a lot of hours, Roz.

23
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,320
Uh, I, um...

24
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,540
- Breakfast now because
we're leaving in two minutes!

25
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,671
- You know what?

26
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,238
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

27
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,675
- So what do you think
about piano lessons?

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,549
- Oh, you know, um,
I support whatever you decide.

29
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,551
- Hey, come on.

30
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,205
We decide this stuff together.

31
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,903
- Right.

32
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,861
- Righty.

33
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,346
- Wait.

34
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,176
- Hey!
- Let's go.

35
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,267
- You've got a dump and run
in the bay.

36
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,231
- Pupil response is sluggish.

37
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,450
- Another OD?
- It's never-ending.

38
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,242
- She's one of ours.

39
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,243
Shayna Davis.

40
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,461
Shayna?

41
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,202
Shayna,
you're at New Amsterdam.

42
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,899
- Oh, it hurts. Oh, God.
- Okay, where does it hurt?

43
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,814
- It hurts everywhere.
Please, just make it stop.

44
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,425
- I'm gonna need you
to be more specific.

45
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,167
- Ask Dr. Sharpe.
She knows.

46
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:50,648
- We need more money, Helen.

47
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,650
My clinical trial's coming up--
- You mean our trial.

48
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,565
Yes, you know what I mean.

49
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,350
But the startup costs are--
- I hear you.

50
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,873
We're not selling
the proton beam laser.

51
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,223
- Cutting edge and cheap
don't exactly mingle.

52
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,659
$40 million can go a long way--

53
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,574
- We're the only hospital
in the tristate area

54
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,228
offering proton beam therapy.

55
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,708
Where are all those patients
gonna get treatment?

56
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,405
- All six of them?

57
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,278
We are trying to change
cancer treatment for millions.

58
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,757
- We're not there yet.
- We could be.

59
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,237
With that kind of money,

60
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,499
we can make
the proton beam laser obsolete

61
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,848
in a couple of years.

62
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,459
- That is the issue.
It's not obsolete now.

63
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,853
- I really think
you should recon--

64
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,649
- Shayna?

65
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,346
Look at me.

66
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,524
Heroin?

67
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,439
- It's the only thing
that works.

68
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,701
The pain is just--

69
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,399
- What about the Percocet
I prescribed?

70
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,227
- It--it barely made a dent.

71
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,707
After my last round
of chemo, I--

72
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,362
I could barely get through
the day unless I tripled up.

73
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,279
- When did you run out?

74
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,934
- Two weeks before
my next refill.

75
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,458
I--I tried to find some
on the street, but...

76
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,765
Heroin was cheaper.

77
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,813
I guess this is--
this is my life now--

78
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,816
getting high with a bunch
of junkies at the Dalton.

79
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,905
- Pain management is a part
of cancer treatment.

80
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,603
There is no shame in that.
Do you hear me?

81
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,996
I can make you comfortable
while we treat your tumor.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,564
- Can I have something now?
It just--it hurts so much.

83
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,305
- We have to wait for
your tox screen to come back

84
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,655
to make sure that the heroin
wasn't laced with anything.

85
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,396
- I'm not gonna make it.
I'm...

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,355
- Yes, you will.

87
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:31,358
I'm gonna make sure of it.

88
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,884
- Has Tawan had any significant
changes in his diet recently?

89
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,364
- No.

90
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:38,887
- And he's current
on all his vaccinations?

91
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,802
- Yeah.
Absolutely.

92
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,934
- And he's had
no dramatic weight loss?

93
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,023
- No, he's never had
any health issues until now.

94
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,938
- It's like everything
changed overnight.

95
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,592
- Yeah.
His grades dropped off,

96
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,551
his teacher said he can't
concentrate on anything

97
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:51,943
for very long.

98
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,989
- And the shivers.

99
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,600
- The shivers?
- Yeah, he, uh,

100
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,776
he started having these
weird muscle twitches.

101
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,952
- We're gonna figure out
what's wrong, okay?

102
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:04,347
- Well, what could
be causing this?

103
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,610
- Well, I think
we should order an MRI

104
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:07,959
and get some blood tests--

105
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,571
- You must have
a theory or guess.

106
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,010
- Um, well, it sounds like

107
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:19,101
it could be an early onset
of MS.

108
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,408
- MS?

109
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,888
- We'll know more once
the tests come back.

110
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,111
- Your leg is late
for a very important date.

111
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,852
You were supposed to be
in pre-op 30 minutes ago.

112
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,070
- Okay, how do you know?

113
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,420
- Uh, because you didn't answer

114
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,682
any of your pre-op texts
or calls,

115
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,379
so then they harassed me.

116
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,120
- Okay, well, I have
a cardio pulling up any second,

117
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,774
so I'm gonna have
to reschedule my surgery.

118
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,558
- Nope, I'm here.
I can hold down the fort.

119
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:44,431
- No offense, but actually--
- No buts, just legs--

120
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,998
that leg, up to surgery.

121
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:51,873
- Gabriela Alvarez, 34,
28 weeks pregnant.

122
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,832
150/85, 130, diaphoretic.

123
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,356
Decreased respiration
bilaterally

124
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,574
with increased effort.

125
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,490
- Doctor, doctor,
please save my baby.

126
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,016
- Okay, let's get her
to Trauma 1.

127
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,367
Where's Reynolds?
- He's on his way.

128
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,846
- Max?

129
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,414
Max.

130
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,676
Max.
- What?

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,938
- Maybe you let us
handle this one.

132
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,378
- What do we got?

133
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,770
- Right heart strain.

134
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,990
Signs of tissue damage
in the left lung.

135
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,122
- Dr. Duke,
what does that indicate?

136
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,863
- Pulmonary embolism?

137
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,430
- Ms. Alvarez?
I'm Dr. Reynolds.

138
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,910
You have a clot in your lung.

139
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,520
That's why you're having
trouble breathing.

140
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,522
- What about my baby?

141
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,959
- Dr. Goodwin?
Dr. Reynolds?

142
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,701
- Why isn't anyone
helping my baby?

143
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,877
- Ms. Alvarez...
- Prep me some lidocaine.

144
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,879
is priority.

145
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,884
- The fetus died en route.
- Gabriela, turn towards me.

146
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,495
- How?

147
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,758
- The left ventricle
was hyper plastic,

148
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,978
and there was stenosis
in the aortic valve.

149
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:57,460
Fetus wasn't viable.

150
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:00,028
- We're not losing
Gabriela too.

151
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,595
- You're gonna feel
a slight pinch

152
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,205
and then some burning.

153
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,815
- I'll need a central line kit.

154
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,513
And prep an infusion of TPA.

155
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,471
- The lidocaine is in.

156
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,907
- Starting central line.

157
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,692
Pay attention, Duke.

158
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,698
- About 250 CC there.

159
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:19,177
- Central line is in.

160
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,441
in 20.

161
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,446
- TPA is in.

162
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,099
- O2 sats at 88% and rising.

163
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,623
- Is my baby okay?

164
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,454
- Gabriela.

165
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,847
- Mm?

166
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,242
- What I'm about to say is...

167
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,766
is gonna be impossible to hear.

168
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,224
- I'm not--I'm not sure
I understand it.

169
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,618
I do something wrong?
- No.

170
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:12,448
No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

171
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,278
It's just that--
bad genetic luck.

172
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,106
The baby's heart never
developed properly.

173
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,630
and there is nothing
that anyone could've done

174
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,371
to save her.

175
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,550
Stillbirths happen--

176
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,292
more than anyone
ever wants to acknowledge.

177
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:35,123
- What do you mean stillbirth?
She wasn't...

178
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,519
- Gabi,

179
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:43,131
we have to induce labor

180
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,220
to get the baby out.

181
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:51,008
- No.

182
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,054
No!

183
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,664
You mean I have to go
through all of that

184
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,361
with no baby at the end?

185
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,580
- It's the safest way.

186
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,978
- I'm sorry.

187
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,370
Is there anyone
that you'd like me to call?

188
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,459
Family, friend, partner?

189
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:10,027
- No.
There's no one else.

190
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:13,378
It was just gonna
be the two of us.

191
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:17,295
Just me and S...

192
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,515
- It's okay.

193
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,170
It's okay to say her name

194
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,259
if you want to.

195
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,743
- Sofie.

196
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,623
Will you stay with me?

197
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,112
- Are you following me?

198
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,809
- Well, maybe.

199
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,506
- Don't you have
lives to save

200
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,160
or some surgery to perform?

201
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,075
- I'm escorting you to yours.

202
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,034
- Why?
- I don't know.

203
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,557
Thought maybe
you could use a friend.

204
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,603
- Mm, thank you.

205
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,214
But actually, I have my mother.

206
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:07,563
- Jeanie knows about
your surgery?

207
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,260
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,610
- She doesn't even know
when your birthday is.

209
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,308
- Well, she knows the month.
That's progress.

210
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,833
It's one of my 12 steps
to make amends with her.

211
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,356
I don't know.

212
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,620
She cared enough
to show up, so...

213
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,236
Hi, uh, have you seen a woman
who looks like me,

214
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,586
only immediately makes
you feel bad about yourself?

215
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,762
- No.
- You expecting someone?

216
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,158
- Lauren...
- I am a big girl, okay?

217
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,639
I don't need balloons
or a stuffed elephant

218
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,815
or my mommy to send me off
to surgery.

219
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,338
- You sure?
'Cause I can just...

220
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,689
- I am fine, okay?
Go do your job.

221
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,343
Go!
Go and do your job.

222
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,432
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

223
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,180
- Social services to the ICU.

224
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,272
- Dr. Kapoor, I just got
Tawan's test results back.

225
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,665
- And?

226
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,277
- Nothing in the labs
or MRI points to MS.

227
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,235
- I'm not surprised.

228
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,326
I wrote down my diagnosis.

229
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,763
- Schilder's disease?

230
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,721
- You asked
the right questions,

231
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,637
but you should have listened
more carefully to the answers.

232
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,813
Tawan's behavior,
his withdrawing--

233
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,859
- So he needs corticosteroids?

234
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,643
- A rigorous course.

235
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,428
In future, it's all right
to offer a hypothesis,

236
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,430
but only if it's
an informed one.

237
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:38,828
- Get them off me!

238
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,308
Get them off!
They're on my face!

239
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,788
- Tawan,
there's nothing on you!

240
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,485
- He thinks there are spiders
crawling all over him.

241
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,791
- Haloperidol.

242
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,618
- Get them off!
Get them off!

243
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,708
- Hold him still.
- They're on you too!

244
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:51,711
Get them off!

245
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,538
Get them...

246
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,193
Shh.

247
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,330
- Hallucinations aren't
a symptom of Schilder's.

248
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,506
Are they?
- No.

249
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,814
-LOC is shifting.
BP dropping.

250
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,337
- He's still.

251
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,472
- Dr Sharpe,
did you discharge Shayna Davis?

252
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:17,388
- No, why?
- I think she bolted.

253
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,434
Should I call security?
- No.

254
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:22,829
No, no.
I think I know where she is.

255
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,837
- Hey, I got it.

256
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,853
Shayna.

257
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,815
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

258
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,512
This is all I have--

259
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:40,558
this or the pain,
and I cannot take the pain.

260
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,256
I--I can't.
- Shayna...

261
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,606
You're not gonna
talk me out of it.

262
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,786
- Okay, all right.

263
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,484
If you're gonna do this, then
at least do it somewhere safe.

264
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,051
- Ugh.

265
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,314
- Somewhere with clean needles
and clean works.

266
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,055
- Oh, yeah?
And what place is that?

267
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,452
- I'm gonna take you there.

268
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,630
- Okay, Gabi.
This is it.

269
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:09,936
Big push.

270
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,025
- Oxytocin interval.
15 minutes.

271
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,897
Okay.

272
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,986
That's it.

273
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,293
- 2 Mu per minute dose.

274
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,469
You're doing great.

275
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,735
You're doing great.

276
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,490
- Okay.
Great job, Gabi.

277
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,840
- You did it.

278
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,929
You did it, Gabi.
It's over.

279
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,976
- Pulse 92.
BP 130/90.

280
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,419
It's so quiet.

281
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,596
- I know.
- I know.

282
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,864
Gabi?

283
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,997
Do you wanna hold her?

284
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,737
I can't.

285
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,609
- I know.
I know.

286
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:17,568
I know it's hard,

287
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:20,441
but this is still
your daughter.

288
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,008
This is Sofie,

289
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:26,534
the baby you have loved
for months.

290
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:30,625
And it's okay to hold her,

291
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,714
even if it's just
to say good-bye.

292
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,937
I can't.

293
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,766
- It's okay.

294
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,464
It's okay.

295
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,565
- Gabi?

296
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,612
Sofie's here.

297
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:08,010
- This is called a CuddleCot.

298
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,317
It's a special bassinet that
keeps stillborn babies cool

299
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,016
so they can stay with
their parents a little longer

300
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,063
even after they're gone.

301
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,456
- How can...

302
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,547
It's so...
- Morbid?

303
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,942
These devices
can give you something

304
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,553
that nothing else can--

305
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,382
time.

306
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,385
- That thing can't
give me time with Sofie.

307
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,344
- Not the time
you wish you had.

308
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,041
Nothing can give you that,

309
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:42,914
but it can give you
time to grieve.

310
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,917
You know, some parents
keep a lock of hair

311
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,572
or make a footprint
or take pictures--

312
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,661
all the things
that you may have wanted to do,

313
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,489
and just because she's passed,

314
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,449
doesn't mean that
you can't have those memories,

315
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:58,017
those moments.

316
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:15,469
I think when you lose
someone that you love,

317
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:19,951
most of us would choose
a few memories,

318
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,476
painful as they may be...

319
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,741
Over no memory at all.

320
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,746
Do you want to talk
to a grieve counselor?

321
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,269
- No.

322
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,969
- Do you want me
to take her away?

323
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,407
- No.

324
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:48,458
I just want more time.

325
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,460
- Yeah.

326
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,119
- Dr. Romer, 78...

327
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,208
- Tawan's not responding
to anything.

328
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:02,124
His crit's low,
oxygenation's poor--

329
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,691
I don't know what to say
to his parents.

330
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,475
- I'm sorry, Agnes.

331
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,783
This case was not the piece
of cake I was hoping it to be.

332
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,741
- I think we should go over
his medical history with them

333
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,134
one more time.

334
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,266
Maybe we're missing something.

335
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,485
- No.
Time for talking is over.

336
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,400
We need to perform
the brain biopsy.

337
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,447
That's the only way to get
his definitive diagnosis.

338
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,405
- Don't you think
drilling a hole into his head

339
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,667
is a little drastic?

340
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,626
- We are running
out of time, Agnes.

341
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,280
Go and book an OR,

342
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,325
and page me when you find
Dr. Chambers, okay?

343
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,417
- IM typical in appearance.

344
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,594
- Fracture union normative.

345
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,773
- No attributes...

346
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,385
- Dr. Bloom's tibia realignment
looks good.

347
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,343
- So she's doing okay?

348
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,389
- I would say better than okay.

349
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,174
Dr. Bloom should have
a relatively easy recovery.

350
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,741
- Great.

351
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,222
Oh, um,

352
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,702
can you keep
my being here just between us?

353
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,314
I don't want Dr. Bloom to know.

354
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,185
- That you care?

355
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,839
- No, no.
She knows that I care.

356
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:08,408
She just doesn't like it
when I care.

357
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,845
- Dr. Reynolds?

358
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,586
Duke didn't show up
for rounds today.

359
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,806
I can't find him anywhere.

360
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,722
- I thought we were past this.

361
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,857
- Outpatient pharmacy.
4401.

362
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,338
Outpatient pharmacy.
4401.

363
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,176
- Thank you.

364
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,705
Okay, nearly there.

365
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,534
Um, I'm here to see Omar.

366
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:50,101
She's with me.

367
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,886
Thank you.

368
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,149
- Yeah, just meet me
in half an hour.

369
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,369
- You all right?
- Mm.

370
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,719
Who is that?

371
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,242
What is this?

372
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,418
- This is a safe
consumption space.

373
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,811
People come here to use

374
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,552
without the threat
of assault or rape,

375
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,380
and they're monitored
by health care professionals

376
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,729
to minimize the risk
of overdose.

377
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,253
How is this legal?

378
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,560
It's not.
- Helen Sharpe--

379
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,257
as I live and breathe.

380
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:18,739
- Omar,
thank you so much for this.

381
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,219
- We have a cot over here
for you.

382
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,439
- Okay.
Come.

383
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,267
Have you had much trouble?

384
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,834
- Oh, comes and goes,

385
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,923
and we've gotten better
at evading the cops.

386
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,751
This one's you.

387
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:36,757
Can you, uh,
can you show me your works?

388
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,454
- It okay.
You can trust him.

389
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,807
- Thank you.

390
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,250
And if you'll allow me?

391
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,613
- Thank--thank you.

392
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,572
- I need to test your product
for Fentanyl to be safe.

393
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,892
I see you've not fully embraced
the value of what we do here.

394
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,850
- I believe
your intentions are good.

395
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,462
- Yeah, but not our methods.

396
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,465
If people can start making
good decisions here,

397
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,511
then we're helping.

398
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:36,860
You're good to go.

399
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,525
- I got a page.
What happened?

400
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,614
- Room six.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:52,963
- Don't take her away!

402
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,487
- He's just moving her.
- What? Why?

403
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,227
- We have another delivery
coming in,

404
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,533
and we have to move
Ms. Alvarez to post-partum.

405
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,013
- You said I could have
more time.

406
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,971
- No, she gets to stay.
- But Dr. Goodwin--

407
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,800
- No.
Out, now.

408
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,367
- We still have to clean--

409
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:08,501
- You will if she asks you to.
If not, you won't.

410
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,764
She can use every resource
in this hospital

411
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,722
or none of them
or anywhere in between.

412
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,376
She is my patient,

413
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,510
and she gets to stay
in this room with her daughter

414
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,641
as long as she wants.

415
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,643
Is that clear?
- Yeah.

416
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:26,040
I--I mean it, Gabi.

417
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,825
As long as you need--
days, weeks.

418
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,740
This room is yours.

419
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,969
- So what do I tell the OB's?

420
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,667
- That Gabriela Alvarez
is not to be disturbed,

421
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,452
and if anyone has
a problem with that,

422
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,279
they can come talk to me,

423
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:51,370
which'll be very easy
because I'll be right here.

424
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,826
Isn't she beautiful?

425
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,350
Oh, she is.

426
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,285
- Duke?

427
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,808
Duke.

428
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,506
What, you too good
to go on rounds now?

429
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,116
- Rounds?
- Yeah, rounds.

430
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,031
Where the hell have you been?

431
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,773
- I was trying to--
I wanted to help,

432
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,470
but I--I think--I think
I just made things worse.

433
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,908
- Hey, hey, come here.
What are you talking about?

434
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,388
What happened?

435
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,521
- When we were in the ED,

436
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:58,828
I didn't know Ms. Alvarez's
baby wasn't viable.

437
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,527
And when I saw her so--
so scared and worried,

438
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,398
- You didn't.

439
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,837
- I told her we had the best
doctors in the country...

440
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,317
and that her baby
would be fine.

441
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,972
- Never promise a patient
everything will be fine

442
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,495
because you never know
what might happen.

443
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,236
- I know.
I know.

444
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,498
I just--
- No more "I just," man.

445
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,195
Come on, this is day one stuff.

446
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,154
All right?
You never promise.

447
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,503
- But you always say
patients need hope.

448
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,026
Give them hope.

449
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,506
Without it,
they don't get better.

450
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,986
- That's right. They don't.
- So which is it?

451
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,422
How am I supposed
to give someone hope

452
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,597
without telling them
that we're going to help?

453
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,991
- Just be there for them,
all right?

454
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,209
When they're waking up
from surgery,

455
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,428
when they're going under--

456
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,821
you don't even
have to say anything.

457
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,997
Just be there.

458
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,870
- It makes all the difference.

459
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:31,007
- How we feeling?

460
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,227
- Oh.

461
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,576
Better.

462
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,668
Whew.

463
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,975
But it never lasts.

464
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,281
- Will you come back
to the hospital now?

465
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,379
If you told me a year ago

466
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:59,253
that I'd be jonesing for heroin

467
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,039
to manage the pain
from a rare form of cancer,

468
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,999
I'd have thought
you were crazy.

469
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:12,353
I should--
I should've called you.

470
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,268
I should've asked for help.

471
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:17,271
- You still can.

472
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,281
Vijay.

473
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:30,458
- So how is Ella?

474
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,942
- Ella?
- Yes, Ella--

475
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:38,031
works in Pain de Vie,

476
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,033
is carrying
my potential grandchild.

477
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:42,122
- I am aware of who Ella is,

478
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,472
and you know that I can't
talk to you about this.

479
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:46,561
- So she is a patient.

480
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,302
- Do I look like I'm gonna
tell you anything?

481
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,173
- I just don't understand.

482
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,219
What I'm trying to tell
over here is...

483
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:55,135
Okay, I understand.

484
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,615
I know, I know.
Vijay, I get it.

485
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,442
You're feeling helpless.
You're feeling stressed.

486
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:02,446
We're all stressed.
Hell, I'm stressed.

487
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,665
- Stressed about Ella?

488
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,102
- No, not about Ella.

489
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,498
I did something stupid.

490
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:13,588
I contacted an agency about
adopting another child,

491
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,242
and now they have
a baby for me,

492
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,114
and I really, really
want this baby.

493
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,685
But I haven't told Martin
about it yet.

494
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,252
- About any of it?

495
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:28,124
- I know.
Ooh, this is bad.

496
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,560
This is super bad.

497
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,258
I, um...

498
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,653
I swear.
I'm gonna tell him tonight.

499
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,393
- Adoption.

500
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,134
- Yes, about the adoption.

501
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,570
- No, no, no.

502
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,138
My patient--he was adopted.

503
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,184
Oh, my God.

504
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,540
- And now for
the burr hole incision.

505
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,064
Stop.

506
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,718
Tawan was adopted.

507
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:00,287
He has SSPE
from the measles virus.

508
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,335
- Are you sure?

509
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,773
- We have confirmed a high
level of measles antibodies

510
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:10,253
in Tawan's bloodstream.

511
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,779
The virus has imbedded
itself in his brain.

512
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,606
- But we vaccinated him.

513
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,261
- Tawan was three years old
when he came to the U.S.

514
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,654
- He must've been exposed

515
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,700
while living in the orphanage
in Thailand.

516
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,397
- That was seven years ago.

517
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,660
SSPE can lie dormant
for up to ten years,

518
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,184
but once it becomes active,

519
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,186
it progresses
through full stages.

520
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,797
Tawan is in stage three.

521
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,582
- Well--well,
what does that mean?

522
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,238
- We will do everything we can
to help Tawan fight the virus.

523
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,502
- But?

524
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:45,201
- Every case of SSPE
I've seen has resulted in--

525
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,725
in the child's death.

526
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,607
- Hey.

527
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,784
Mind if I join you?

528
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:06,440
Dr. Proctor asked me to come by
and do a consult for Gabriela.

529
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,442
- She wants to be left alone.

530
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,487
- Yes, that is what
grieving people say they want,

531
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:14,230
but it is not always
what they need.

532
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,233
Sounds like Gabriela needs help
saying goodbye to her daughter.

533
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,801
- She's not ready
to say goodbye.

534
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,629
If she does,

535
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,501
then her daughter
will be gone forever.

536
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,810
- We still talking about
Gabriela here?

537
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,117
- Don't do that.
- Hey, I'm not doing anything.

538
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,814
I'm your guy, okay?

539
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,381
Since the day you came back,

540
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,774
I've been running
interference for you.

541
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,428
Telling people
to give Max his space--

542
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:40,822
you know, not to project
their needs onto you,

543
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,432
that you'll open up
when you're ready.

544
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,869
- I don't want to open up.

545
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,567
- Yeah, I know.
I can see that.

546
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,656
We can all see that,

547
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:51,746
but that's the only way
that you get better.

548
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,314
- Then I don't want
to get better.

549
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,925
If I get better,
then I have to let her go.

550
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,757
I don't want to.

551
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,435
- Helen.

552
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,306
Where have you been all day?

553
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,526
- Meetings off-site.
Why?

554
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,180
- We still haven't decided

555
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,703
what we're doing to do
about the proton beam laser.

556
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:36,965
- Yes, we did,

557
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,706
and I'm not having
this conversation again.

558
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,534
As long as we are co-chairs
of this department,

559
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,362
we both have a say
on its direction.

560
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,886
- Excuse me.
Are you Dr. Helen Sharpe?

561
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,583
- Yes.

562
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,716
- Please place your hands
behind your back.

563
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,196
- Wait, what's this all about?

564
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,719
- You have the right
to remain silent.

565
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,547
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

566
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,896
in a court of law.

567
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,637
You have the right
to an attorney.

568
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,683
If you cannot afford one,
one will be assigned to you.

569
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,250
If you choose to answer
our questions,

570
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,730
you have the right to stop
at any time.

571
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,733
Do you understand these rights?

572
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:20,052
- Thanks for the rescue.
- What was I going to do?

573
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:23,011
Let you rot in jail
on some trumped-up charges?

574
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,709
Don't worry.
We took care of everything.

575
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:27,015
- We?

576
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,887
- Well,
I hope you're well-rested

577
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,845
because I certainly am not.

578
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,412
- She got the charges dropped.

579
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,718
- And I kept it
out of the press.

580
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:37,199
Do you know how many favors
I had to call in tonight?

581
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,898
They have photos of you
in a heroin den.

582
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,508
- It's a safe
consumption space.

583
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,336
And because of it,
my patient is in New Amsterdam

584
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,033
instead of dead on the street.

585
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,905
I am not gonna
apologize for that.

586
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,384
- I don't care
if you apologize,

587
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,517
but there will
be consequences for this.

588
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,127
- What consequences?

589
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:55,174
- The board will discuss
your fate in the morning.

590
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,830
- I'm so sorry, Helen.

591
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:02,964
I thought she was on our side.

592
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,276
- Anything?
- Not yet.

593
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,410
- I've seen so many children
die in developing countries

594
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:17,109
from preventable diseases
because

595
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,850
parents did not
have access to vaccines or--

596
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,330
or know
they were important or--

597
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,289
or couldn't afford them.

598
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,073
But here?

599
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,770
In this country,

600
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,250
with all its wealth
and education

601
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,339
and abundance of vaccines...

602
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,950
- Dr. Kapoor?

603
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:40,001
- There's a new treatment?
- Very new.

604
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,221
- With a lot of anti-vaxxer
kids coming of age,

605
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:45,006
SSPE is becoming more common.

606
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,227
It's forcing doctors to try
new, untested treatments.

607
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,403
- This one is seeing
a very limited success.

608
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:54,798
It's a combination of antiviral
and immunomodulatory drugs.

609
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:58,411
You need to understand.
SSPE has no cure.

610
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,021
If this treatment works,

611
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,110
Tawan will have to stay
on these medications

612
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,590
for the rest of his life.

613
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:06,462
I'm just happy it might work.

614
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,116
It will work.

615
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,944
- When can we start?

616
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,815
- You will have to ask
your doctor.

617
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,949
- She's the one
who discovered it.

618
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,472
- We can start right away.

619
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,088
- Any available IV nurse
to OR two.

620
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,307
Any available IV nurse
to OR two.

621
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,533
- Oh.

622
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,884
Look who decided
to finally show up.

623
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,147
Couldn't even be bothered
to bring me any balloons

624
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,193
or a stuffed elephant,
could you?

625
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,456
- Thought you didn't
want me hanging around?

626
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:47,025
- Of course
I want you hanging around.

627
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,983
You're like my best friend.

628
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,420
- How much morphine you on?

629
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:54,162
- But hey, this is what
I need you to do for me, okay?

630
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,424
- Mm-hmm?

631
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,426
- I need you to go down
to the gift shop

632
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,428
and buy all the balloons

633
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,605
so all the nurses think
that people care about me.

634
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:05,043
- Come on.
People care about you.

635
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,914
- No.
That is not true.

636
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,177
People do not care about me.

637
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,440
People tolerate me.

638
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:14,052
People are glad
when I leave a room.

639
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,531
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

640
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,098
I guess it's just me.

641
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:20,406
- Okay, just, uh--
first of all, stop that.

642
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,364
And if I didn't care about you,

643
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,237
why would I bring you this?

644
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:30,198
- Peter Lugers?
- Bam!

645
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:33,636
- My dad used to take me to
Peter Lugers when I was a kid.

646
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,944
- When Jeanie
was being extra Jeanie.

647
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,380
- You remembered.

648
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,034
- Yeah.

649
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,384
So now you've got
to get better.

650
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:43,603
- Oh!

651
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,955
Oh, my God.
Yes.

652
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,524
- You're gonna save some
for me, right?

653
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,482
- Sure.

654
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,180
So good.

655
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,536
- Do I have to go?
- No.

656
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,147
I promised.
Remember?

657
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:09,063
I'm just heading home
for the night,

658
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:13,198
but everyone here knows
you're not to be disturbed.

659
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,634
- Am I crazy?

660
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:21,510
Keeping her close like this
even though she...

661
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:24,252
Is it--is it healthy?

662
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,167
Is it okay?

663
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,038
- It's okay.

664
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,084
It's more than okay.

665
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:36,308
You can hold her if you want.

666
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,313
- I want to,

667
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:44,359
but my head keeps telling me

668
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:46,187
that it'll make it worse,

669
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:49,234
you know,
that that's not really her.

670
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,585
She's gone.

671
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,154
And then my heart tells me
that's my Sofie.

672
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,331
That's my baby.

673
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,556
What would you do?

674
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,645
- Uh...

675
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:12,692
All that matters here is you.

676
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:16,174
- I feel like I'm sick.

677
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:20,221
I feel like I'm not normal.

678
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,180
Please, just help me.

679
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,138
- Yeah, I, um...

680
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:31,276
I--I lost someone...

681
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,755
a few months ago, and it-

682
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:37,107
it can't, uh, compare

683
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:39,588
to what you're going through,
but, uh...

684
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:47,074
I--I talk to her...

685
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,034
All the time.

686
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:55,300
I mean, full-on conversations.

687
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:59,217
And I--I know that people
would say that's crazy,

688
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,523
that it's not healthy, but I--

689
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,222
what am I supposed to do?

690
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:11,098
She--she, uh, died

691
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,709
right after
our daughter was born.

692
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:17,713
She would've loved
every second of it.

693
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:26,200
But she doesn't--
she doesn't get to.

694
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,508
She didn't get any of it.

695
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,771
And I don't get her,

696
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,164
and neither does--

697
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,166
neither does Luna.

698
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,212
So I--

699
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,258
I tried keeping her alive.

700
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,783
You know, to make her a part
of these memories.

701
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:47,134
And I don't...

702
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:50,616
I really don't care
if it's healthy.

703
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:55,185
It's just what I have to do,
you know?

704
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,667
To keep going.

705
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:10,418
My worry for you, Gabi,
is that...

706
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:14,292
you will never say goodbye
to Sofie...

707
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,818
If you never say hello.

708
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:36,923
Hey.

709
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,794
- Guess who I talked to
a little while ago?

710
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,622
- I--I don't know.
Who?

711
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,884
The kids okay?

712
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,191
- Our kids?
Yeah, our kids are fine.

713
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,716
It seems that there's
an issue with another kid--

714
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,198
a baby that,
according to Roz,

715
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:53,505
we're adopting?

716
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,289
- Babe, I can explain--

717
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,683
- Yeah, you could if you were
coming home tonight.

718
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,902
Iggy, I can't even
look at you right now.

719
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,382
- Martin.
- No, don't.

720
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,905
- Hey.

721
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,484
Yes?

722
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,579
Ella.

723
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,582
- I've been thinking
a lot about everything,

724
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:30,759
and I think I finally--I--

725
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,893
I think I figured out
what I really want.

726
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,679
I'm...

727
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm keeping the baby.

728
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,517
Really?

729
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,389
