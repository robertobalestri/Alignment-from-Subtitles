1
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,051
Okay, home stretch, Luna.

2
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,715
We just need to find
Dada's other shoe.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,667
Did you steal Dada's shoe?

4
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:11,884
No? Well, that's nice of you.

5
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,800
Where is it?
Where's my shoe?

6
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,802
Shoe, shoe, shoe. Shoe!

7
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:19,022
Luna, shoe!

8
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,545
And...

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,720
Oh, yogurt.

10
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,986
Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,621
Hey! Thank you guys so much.

12
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:30,396
- I know it's last minute.
- Oh, no worries.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,957
My Tuesday nanny
just canceled on me.

14
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,646
- I didn't have anyone.
- What is that smell?

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,169
Oh, uh, fun fact,

16
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,128
when Luna's waffle gets stuck
in the toaster too long

17
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,085
it becomes a charcoal
briquette.

18
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,391
I'll get that for you.

19
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,132
I think I smell
something else.

20
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,059
Yeah, that's her,
uh, lo mein.

21
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,049
- She really likes it spicy.
- Takeout for breakfast.

22
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,395
Uh, well,
it's usually milk and eggs

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,253
but we are out of milk.

24
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,212
Also eggs.

25
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:54,491
So I tried to do
the waffle thing

26
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,581
but that turned
into a briquette.

27
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:57,843
So, I, uh, yeah.

28
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:58,844
It was either lo mein or soup.

29
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,150
Could you guys do a quick favor

30
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,499
and go to the grocery store?

31
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,064
We just need milk and eggs
and, uh, waffles.

32
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,330
Come on, sweetheart.

33
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,853
Grandma's gonna
get you changed.

34
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,289
Hey.

35
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,074
You got a double kiss!

36
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,512
- Oh, and wipes?
- Wipes, yes. We need wipes.

37
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:16,348
Thank you so much.
Best grandparents ever.

38
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,777
The stuff of legends.
Yes!

39
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,126
Luna, I love you.

40
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:23,152
Okay, thank you, guys.
Seriously. Bye.

41
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,305
Wow.

And I took it back out.

52
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,362
We need to talk about him,
Ig.

53
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:53,119
Yeah, we will.

54
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,387
What? You've been
saying that for a week.

55
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,252
- Have you thought about a 21/20?
- No.

56
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,646
I mean, yes, I've thought
about a 21/20, obviously.

57
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,430
But that's a psychiatric hold,
it's not...

58
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:04,823
It would keep Chance
off the street

59
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,478
- and away from our kids.
- For 72 hours.

60
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:09,958
And then he'd be back on
the streets, feeling betrayed.

61
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,569
Okay, fine.

62
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,353
Then go for something
more permanent.

63
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,667
No, Martin,
I am not discussing

64
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,406
a restraining order with you.

65
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,317
Hey.

66
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,542
Hi, babe. Hi.

67
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,364
Everything's fine, okay?
We're just discussing some

68
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,844
boring old grown up stuff.

69
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:27,759
Why don't you go back up
and log in to school, okay?

70
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,152
I'll meet you there.

71
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,878
It's okay. Go for it.

72
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:32,754
And music off, sweetie.

73
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,813
That is exactly why I didn't
want to discuss this, okay?

74
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,598
A restraining order
is a formal connection

75
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,165
between Chance and I.
It's what he wants.

76
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,645
All that matters
is they reduce risk.

77
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,084
- Sometimes.
- Most times.

78
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,824
And they got
a way better track record

79
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,174
than wishful thinking.

80
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,436
If we provoke Chance,
he could hurt himself.

81
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,699
This is not about Chance.

82
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,961
This is about us.

83
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,401
Our safety, our kids.

84
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,184
Look, we...

85
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,055
No, you know what, Iggy?

86
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,690
You have to do something.

87
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:05,822
Today.

88
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,395
- What? I don't want that.
- It's just oat milk.

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,745
What you mean,
"just oat milk"?

90
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,270
You ever seen
an udder on an oat?

91
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:16,881
- That's not natural.
- Natural?

92
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:18,404
A few minutes ago
you were just raving

93
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,711
about some beer
made out of oysters?

94
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,930
Oyster stout is normal beer

95
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,498
made from the shells
of oysters. It's...

96
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:26,673
And I've yet
to meet a mollusk

97
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,327
made out of grain,
hops, or yeast.

98
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:30,242
- All right, look, that's it.
- I'm... I'm gonna take you out

99
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,285
to have that beer tonight.

100
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,292
Oh, no. I... I'm...

101
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,293
I'm sorry. Not like that.

102
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,904
I wasn't trying to make a move.

103
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,601
Uh-huh.

104
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,212
I can't be home tonight.

105
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:46,302
You know, I'm trying to think
of a reason to stay out.

106
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:48,173
- Why's that?
- You know, my...

107
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:51,524
My roommate is having
a gentleman over for a "visit."

108
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,092
You have a roommate?

109
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:56,094
Yeah, my mom.

110
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,270
My roommate is my mother.

111
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,620
You live with your mom?

112
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:03,331
And your mom is the one
hanging the sock on the door.

113
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,583
So now we're clowning?
Is that it?

114
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,411
Yeah, you definitely
were not making a move.

115
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,586
See, now, that...

116
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,545
That's the way...
Now you owe me a drink.

117
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,373
Fine, I know
the perfect place.

118
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,807
- I will text you the address.
- Okay.

119
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,603
Helen. Hey, uh,

120
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:27,687
hey.

121
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,477
- What do you need?
- Uh, nothing.

122
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,218
I just saw you
walking down the hallway

123
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,002
and it looked like more fun
than my hallway so...

124
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,091
Okay.

125
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,964
You okay? Um, work, life?

126
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,618
- It's good. All good.
- All good.

127
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:42,780
What's with the rosary?

128
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,098
It's not a rosary.

129
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,535
Yeah? Uh, well, you know,

130
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,767
if it looks like a rosary
and smells like a rosary...

131
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,439
It's personal.

132
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,595
I don't think
that's how it goes.

133
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,937
You're actually
considering it?

134
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,113
- Leaving New Amsterdam?
- Hey, it's a good gig.

135
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,551
More money, less drama.
Plus, I could walk to work.

136
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,683
Plus, it is Mt. Zion.

137
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,163
Oh, I'm Casey,

138
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,818
and I want to work at a big,
posh, private hospital

139
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:09,820
where nothing exciting
ever happens.

140
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,387
- Whatever.
- Your accent's wack.

141
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,084
Incoming!

142
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:14,694
Bertha James, 64 years old.

143
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:17,001
Accidental impalement
on pruning shears.

144
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,483
BP 138 over 74
and slightly tachy at 114.

145
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,006
Already vaccinated for COVID.

146
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,312
Okay, let's get her
to Bay 24.

147
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:26,576
Just get these things
out of me!

148
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,100
We will, but first
you need a CAT scan and work-up

149
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:31,624
so we can figure out the safest
way to remove them, okay?

150
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,279
How bad is the pain?

151
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,629
- Bad!
- Okay, uh, Turan,

152
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,283
can I get, um... what the...

153
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,116
Is everybody okay?

154
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,684
You okay? Everybody okay?
We need help over here!

155
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:49,207
What the hell is going on
in here?

156
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,687
Let's pull them out.
Let's get them out of here.

157
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,385
Okay, get maintenance
down here now.

158
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,995
Are you kidding me!?

159
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,868
- Feel the excitement.
- Excitement?

160
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,566
Okay, let's get them
out of here.

161
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,873
So great to see you all
in the flesh again.

162
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:05,135
Mask-less, here we are.

163
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,529
You know, virtual visits
were great.

164
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,618
What a great tool
we got to use but, man,

165
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,184
have I missed in-person

166
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:12,186
inpatient visiting days.
These are the best.

167
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,406
I mean, families coming
together, reconnecting.

168
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,234
This is why we do
what we do, right?

169
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:18,105
Are gifts okay?

170
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,324
Yeah.

171
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:22,414
'Cause I, uh,
brought my son a journal.

172
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:23,894
Great, yeah, journal.
Good call.

173
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,896
Anything that encourages
expression, I'm all for it.

174
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,246
Yeah, but the orderly
confiscated it.

175
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,466
Ahh, yeah...

176
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,642
spiral-bound, I'm guessing?

177
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,861
Yeah, okay, good segue.

178
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:36,472
Couple ground rules
we should talk about.

179
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:38,648
No sharp objects
are allowed inside.

180
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,912
Anything spiral-bound,
jewelry, earrings.

181
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:44,349
Um, anything that
a child inclined to self-harm

182
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,133
would or could self-harm with.

183
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,961
Um, also,

184
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,486
no outside medication
is allowed in, okay?

185
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,748
So any pills
that you came with,

186
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:52,749
you can leave them with me.

187
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,098
You get them when you leave.

188
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,229
Uh...

189
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,929
but, guys, that's not... that's...

190
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,409
Hey, that's not what
today is about, all right?

191
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,020
Today is about progress.
Your kids are getting better.

192
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:05,805
They're getting better
every day and in a few moments,

193
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,155
you are going to see that
with your very own eyes, so.

194
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,288
You can bring your son
my cookies, if you want.

195
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,507
I made way too many.

196
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,422
Yes, that is
the spirit right there.

197
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:14,553
Okay, guys, what do you think?

198
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,294
Want to go see your kiddos?

199
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,684
Let's go! Follow me.

200
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:24,302
DeMarcus Lott, 27.

201
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:25,782
Taxi-to-bike head-on collision.

202
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:26,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

203
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,611
What the hell happened here?

204
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,569
Emergency bowel disimpaction

205
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,528
of the building's
old drainage pipes.

206
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,617
- Crap.
- Well, let's hope not.

207
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,836
Uh, Mr. Lott,
how are you feeling?

208
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,316
Like I'm about
to be Internet famous.

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,274
Check this out.
Tossed off the hood of the car,

210
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,408
rebounded off the mailbox,
landed smack on the pavement.

211
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,323
That's why you wear a GoPro.

212
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,759
And a helmet.

213
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:51,155
Brunstetter, let's order
a CT scan for Mr. Lott.

214
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,983
Any more openings
at Mt. Zion?

215
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,285
Heard that.

216
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,901
Dr. Bloom.

217
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,891
Damn it, she's tachypneic.

218
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,563
Okay, let's get her
on nasal cannula O2.

219
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,868
It was the shears?

220
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:10,435
Nowhere near her heart
or her lungs.

221
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,045
Hello?

222
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,134
Somebody?

223
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,177
What's this on my leg?
You see this?

224
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,184
I got that on my arm.

225
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,075
We need to evacuate the ED.

226
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,424
Evacuate? Why?

227
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:46,903
That's not dirty water.
That's a chemical spill.

228
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:53,130
Okay, the sickest patients
and those with the most

229
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,653
chemical exposure
go to the front of the line

230
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:57,134
for DECON showers, chest CTs,
and arterial blood gases.

231
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,657
Less acute
are gonna have to wait.

232
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,485
Uh, Mrs. Westbrook,
how you feeling?

233
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,356
- Better.
- Blood sugar's down to 187.

234
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,401
Okay, that's what
I like to hear.

235
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,794
Low exposure, back of the line.

236
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,014
Dr. Bloom, I ran
the symptoms by Poison Control

237
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,625
and they suspect
herbicide called

238
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,366
4-methyl-2-chlorophenoxyacetic
acid.

239
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,847
Apparently,
MFCA is odorless, colorless,

240
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,109
and highly corrosive.

241
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,807
Huh, what a great trio.

242
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,157
- Coming through.
- I put the ED on diversion

243
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:23,421
- and activated HazMat protocol.
- HazMat!?

244
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,292
Busted pipe doused
Bertha pretty bad.

245
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:28,078
- Into the open wound?
- Direct hit.

246
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,470
Since then,
she's been tachy with runs

247
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:30,950
of wide complex V-tach.

248
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,257
Not to mention
the gardening shears

249
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,564
- still sticking out of me.
- We're gonna get to those.

250
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,522
But first we gotta take care
of your heart and lungs.

251
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,568
Which means a DECON shower

252
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:41,265
to get the chemicals
off your skin.

253
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,788
And then some wound irrigation

254
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,747
to get the rest of it
out of your insides, all right?

255
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,052
Just try to breathe.

256
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,793
Bertha's in,
but we only have two showers.

257
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,578
It's gonna take hours
to get everyone through.

258
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,623
Okay, HazMat's bringing
more tents with more showers.

259
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,190
Until then, we just
need to hold on.

260
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:55,540
I'm gonna go find where
an herbicide banned in the '70s

261
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,194
is hiding in our hospital.

262
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,248
Oh, just who
I was looking for.

263
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:09,902
Dora, the HCC heard about

264
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,121
our chemical spill, I take it?

265
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,123
And I need an important file

266
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,733
the medical director
should have on hand.

267
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:15,908
Well, then you need to talk

268
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,388
to the medical director.

269
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:19,477
Because Max would know
where any important files are?

270
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,434
I'm betting
I'll have better odds

271
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,522
with his former number two.

272
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:22,785
All right,
what are we looking for?

273
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,831
Hazardous material
inspection reports.

274
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,486
If we were briefed

275
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,707
on any MFCA storage issues,
then we're liable.

276
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,447
The ED ceiling caved in

277
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,927
and poured poison
all over our patients.

278
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,364
I'm pretty sure we're liable.

279
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,715
Just find the report.

280
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,887
I'm just doing my job.

281
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,679
The MFCA has branched
into all these pipes.

282
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:50,551
Corrosion's not as bad
as the ED.

283
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:51,857
You get a flood
of that stuff,

284
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,598
- all these pipes will go.
- And then instead

285
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:55,165
of one chemical spill,
we'll have 50.

286
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,340
It's gotta be
coming from somewhere.

287
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:57,863
We'll split up
and we find the source.

288
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,571
The protection order will
legally compel Chance Becker

289
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:12,748
to stay away from you,
your workplace, and your home.

290
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:14,532
He'll be prohibited
from any direct contact

291
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,708
with you or your family.

292
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,188
The court may add exceptions,

293
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,146
but I've been in-house counsel
here a long time,

294
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,408
there won't be any issues.

295
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,323
Do we need
to inform anyone internally?

296
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,498
No, only if you want us to.

297
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,848
I think I'd like
to keep it quiet.

298
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:28,024
You know, for Chance's sake.

299
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,416
For Chance?

300
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,373
- Yeah, um...
- Anne.

301
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,727
Uh, Neil,
if you'll excuse me.

302
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,729
Thank you, thank you very much.

303
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,252
Hey, Anne, Julie.

304
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:40,514
Hey, guys, wait up.

305
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,038
Whoa, what's the matter?

306
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,517
What happened?
Something happen with your son?

307
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,867
Alex just got upset.

308
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,695
Upset? He was screaming.

309
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,522
He was completely
out of control.

310
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,089
Okay, well, why don't we all

311
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:51,438
go have a chat in my office

312
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,613
- and we'll figure it out.
- What's there to say?

313
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,832
He doesn't want us here,
so we're leaving.

314
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,355
Well, that's a bit
of a hasty reaction.

315
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,748
Sorry folks,
we're shutting the exits.

316
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,445
There's been a chemical spill
downstairs.

317
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,317
No one in or out
until it's safe.

318
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:02,188
- But the kids...
- Everybody's fine up here.

319
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:03,494
I just need you to hold tight

320
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:04,974
until the downstairs exit's
decontaminated.

321
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,497
Okay.

322
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,452
Okay, thank you. Um...

323
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:13,983
Well, since we're
all stuck here...

324
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,812
come on, let's have a chat.

325
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,465
Come on, let's go.

326
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,430
Couple more should do it.

327
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,737
Take your time.

328
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:31,301
Certainly, don't worry
about the shears.

329
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,830
We haven't forgotten,
I promise.

330
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,747
No rush.

331
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,270
Once we stabilize
your vitals,

332
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:41,532
they are coming out.

333
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:42,576
Would you like
more pain meds?

334
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,883
What I'd like is a hospital

335
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,755
that's not falling apart.

336
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,540
I mean, how can you even
see what you're doing

337
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:51,281
when the lights keep dimming?

338
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,152
It's like a cavern in here.

339
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,764
The lights aren't dimming.

340
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:58,418
But why is everything
getting darker?

341
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:05,686
♪

342
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:21,615
You ever heard of MFCA
exposure causing blindness?

343
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,617
I'd barely even heard of MFCA

344
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,402
before it gushed
all over my ED.

345
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:26,751
Well, Bertha's
now experiencing

346
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,709
complete and total vision loss.

347
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,233
She did take the biggest hit.

348
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:31,887
Had the most extreme exposure.

349
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:33,976
Well, I put her on dialysis
to try to clean the toxins

350
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,804
out of her blood but, look,

351
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,893
if this is blinding people,
then we need to get

352
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,895
everybody decontaminated
as soon as possible.

353
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:41,200
Oh, yeah,
'cause up until now,

354
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:42,288
we've been dragging our feet.

355
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:43,463
Hey, look, I'm just saying

356
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:44,638
there could be more surprises.

357
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,858
Got it. Thank you.

358
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,129
Let's get this line moving,
people.

359
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,870
Come on.

360
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,800
Come on!

361
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:07,025
Help!

362
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,334
Help!

363
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,336
I need some help in here!

364
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,988
Anybody! Help!

365
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,517
Max, Sandra Fall and I

366
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,301
have been looking everywhere
for the hazardous materials

367
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,521
inspection report
that you should've filed.

368
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,218
But of course,
it's nowhere to be found.

369
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,307
Much like yourself.
Where are you?

370
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,700
Call me, please.

371
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:35,140
Miguel, do you know where
Dr. Goodwin went after this?

372
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,663
They just called me
for clean-up.

373
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:37,922
Right.

374
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:54,681
Ah, bike man, good news.

375
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:56,727
Your CT came back clear.

376
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,686
I'd prescribe Advil
and a brake on that Fixie.

377
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,036
- So I'm good to go?
- Ah, no.

378
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,776
Not until you go through DECON.

379
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,256
But I was barely in there.

380
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,389
Which is why I'm sending you
to the back of the line.

381
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,614
Um, is the insulin
back in the ED?

382
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,051
Check over there.

383
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,487
I put them in the crash cart

384
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,011
but we're still moving stuff
out of the ED.

385
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:23,754
Ah, somebody is thinkin'.

386
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:26,104
Hey, you had
way more exposure

387
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,845
- than anyone else.
- And your point is?

388
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,368
You need to be the next one
into the DECON showers.

389
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,370
Okay, I don't know
how it works at Mt. Zion,

390
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:33,369
but in my ED,
patients come first.

391
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,823
Oppositional defiant disorder
is tough.

392
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:53,088
Kids with ODD like Alex
are rude.

393
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,741
They're aggressive, vindictive.

394
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:58,702
- Our son hates us, Dr. Frome.
- He doesn't...

395
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,399
You were there. You saw him.

396
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,663
- No, no, listen to me.
- It can feel a lot like hate.

397
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,926
It can look exactly like hate.

398
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,145
But it's not hate.

399
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:11,019
It is brain function,
that's it.

400
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,672
It's an inflated response

401
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,152
to perceived threats.

402
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:15,936
And exactly how
did I threaten him?

403
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,634
You didn't.

404
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,940
She didn't. I...

405
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,116
I honestly think
this morning was just

406
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,161
a low blood sugar moment.

407
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:25,120
You know how he gets.

408
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:30,125
I bet now that he's had
a minute, he'll be different.

409
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,563
We should go back in
and try again.

410
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,739
No, actually, I don't think
that's a good idea.

411
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,262
Julie...

412
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,134
- Why not?
- Because I don't think that

413
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,657
the problem today was Alex.

414
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:46,706
I think that the real problem
is here, in this room.

415
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,277
You think Alex's ODD
is our fault?

416
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,453
No, ODD is no one's fault.

417
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,890
I'm... I'm talking
specifically about

418
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,240
what triggered Alex today.

419
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,329
And you think it was his moms

420
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,154
bringing him cookies.

421
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,117
I'm sorry.
I don't understand that at all.

422
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,376
Your wife does.

423
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,514
Anne?

424
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:20,436
Anne, look at where you are.

425
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,090
Hiding the truth
is not working.

426
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:34,102
The two weeks that Alex
was out of the house...

427
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,674
Have been the best two weeks
I've had in years.

428
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:47,027
No screaming.

429
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:48,986
No hitting.

430
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,860
No one...

431
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:57,386
attacking my beautiful wife...

432
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,649
when she's just
trying to be nice.

433
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:12,052
I didn't want to see him today.

434
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,148
And on some level,
I think that he knows it.

435
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,458
Dialysis went great, Bertha.

436
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,590
We're gonna give your sight

437
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,418
a little more time
to reset, okay?

438
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,422
In the meantime,
I'll just lay here impaled.

439
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,554
Not at all.

440
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:39,254
Look, next stop,
those shears are coming out.

441
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,345
I'm so sorry.

442
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,303
None of this is your fault.

443
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,044
Don't worry about me.

444
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,177
Just focus on you.

445
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:52,267
Focusing on me
is why I started gardening.

446
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,920
My shrink said

447
00:19:54,004 --> 00:20:00,710
it's a way to tune everybody
else out and hear the universe.

448
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,755
I know, it's hippy.

449
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,106
But doesn't that sound nice?

450
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,153
Hearing the universe.

451
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:11,764
- It does.
- I'm trying to hear it now

452
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,419
but these shears...

453
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:17,074
makes it kinda har...

454
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:22,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

455
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,603
Grab me two milligrams
of Ativan IV.

456
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,737
Do we need to get
her back on dialysis?

457
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,304
It's too late, her body's
absorbed too much MFCA.

458
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:31,175
So where does that leave us?

459
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:38,878
Dr. Reynolds?

460
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,529
I... I don't know.

461
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,894
Max?

462
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,817
Anybody?

463
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,690
Max?

464
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:09,779
Help!

465
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,351
Max?

466
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,222
Max, you need
to get out of there.

467
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,703
I... I can't, I... I...

468
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:22,748
If I let go of this,
the whole tank's gonna give.

469
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,359
And it'd go
all over the hospital.

470
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:25,838
Hundreds of people
are gonna be exposed.

471
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,013
You need to go get help.

472
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:30,408
No, you're gonna leave.

473
00:21:30,492 --> 00:21:32,018
I'm gonna hold the pipe

474
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:33,019
and you're gonna
go and get help.

475
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:36,022
- I can't.
- Why not!?

476
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:37,023
I can't see.

477
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,733
Anne, what you just described

478
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:52,648
is a perfectly normal feeling.

479
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:55,303
But Alex didn't erupt
this morning

480
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:57,870
because you asked him
a question.

481
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:59,394
Alex erupted

482
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:03,485
because Julie stopped you
from disciplining him.

483
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,051
And you just said that at home,

484
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,747
Alex is triggered
by Julie just being nice.

485
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:13,495
The threat that
Alex is perceiving

486
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,671
is your positivity.

487
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:17,760
How can positivity
be a threat?

488
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,675
Well, Alex knows
that his troubles

489
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,025
are deeper than blood sugar.

490
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,853
And when you pretend
that they aren't,

491
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:25,028
it scares him.

492
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,856
It denies his reality.

493
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,857
And Anne's, too.

494
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:35,430
You agree with him.

495
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,874
Yes, I try to be positive.

496
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,266
Alex can't. You won't.

497
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,138
- Somebody has to be.
- Why does somebody have to?

498
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,096
Why can't we just acknowledge
what's actually happening?

499
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,707
You of all people
asking me that?

500
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,752
The person who stood up
in front of all of us today

501
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:55,232
like some camp counselor,

502
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:57,452
acting like we weren't
all here to visit our kids

503
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,888
in a mental hospital.

504
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:00,846
Telling us, "Oh, it'll be
a great day today.

505
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,239
"Just remember
to remove your jewelry

506
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:04,502
so the kids don't try
and kill themselves."

507
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:05,938
I'm denying reality?

508
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,907
You're actually
removing the shears?

509
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,691
Floyd, it's too late for her.
She's dying.

510
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,563
Because of us.

511
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:23,695
We did this to her.

512
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,958
This hospital,
this... this building.

513
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:29,222
You know, Bertha said that

514
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:31,050
the shears were making it hard
for her to hear the universe.

515
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:32,965
Well, if there's ever a time

516
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,664
that we deserve
to hear the universe,

517
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,970
it's when we're leaving it.

518
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:45,935
Staff's all through.

519
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,066
After Ms. Westbrook,

520
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,241
it's just you
and DeMarcus Lott.

521
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:49,939
- Where is he?
- He's around the corner,

522
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,894
editing video
of his head-on collision.

523
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,269
Mr. Lott?

524
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,445
It's okay,
I've got you, DeMarcus.

525
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,924
I got you, I got you,
I got you.

526
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,539
I need help over here!

527
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,236
Casey!

528
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,630
A blood vessel
damaged in your accident

529
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,066
must've just given way.

530
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,937
It's caused
an expanding hematoma

531
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:35,637
and it is closing off
your windpipe.

532
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,465
I can fix it. I... I can fix it.

533
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,858
I just gotta... just need to
drain the blood.

534
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:41,599
Casey!

535
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,645
Help, Casey!

536
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,353
I need help!

537
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:56,761
Come on, come on.

538
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:58,589
Come on, breathe. Come on.

539
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:01,461
Come on.

540
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,668
Her end-tidal CO2 levels
just went off a cliff.

541
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:34,930
It's severe acidosis.

542
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:36,584
Push two amps of bicarb.

543
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:39,282
Removing the shears
caused a pancreatic storm.

544
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,633
This is not
how she's going out.

545
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:43,765
Suture.

546
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:50,902
Helen?

547
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,425
Hang on, Max.

548
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:53,688
You need... you need to go.

549
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:54,950
- Not without you.
- And if you're not willing

550
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:56,473
to let go of that pipe,

551
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,997
then I've got
to seal the drain.

552
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:01,130
Helen, just go! Please!

553
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:04,133
I won't, so stop yelling at me.

554
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,614
What are you doing?

555
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:08,743
Weighing down the trash lid
over the drain.

556
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:12,576
- It's working.
- Wait, it's working?

557
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,796
- Give me your hand.
- Are you sure?

558
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,059
Give me your hand.

559
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:18,321
Come on.

560
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,411
Come on, watch your step.

561
00:27:21,495 --> 00:27:22,281
Come on.

562
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,982
Lean on there.

563
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:33,075
We're almost at the tent.
Just hang on, okay?

564
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,685
He... help!

565
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,470
Can someone help, please!

566
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:38,471
Help! Oh, Floyd!

567
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,082
Floyd, he's drenched in MFCA.

568
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,300
How are we treating
acute exposure?

569
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:42,606
- We tried everything.
- And?

570
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,447
There's no treatment.
Nothing's worked.

571
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,690
The bolus bicarbonate
and IV saline that you ordered.

572
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:34,659
I need CHEM panels drawn
Q15 minutes

573
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:35,910
until his toxicity is halved.

574
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:37,302
Q 1 hour after.

575
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:38,913
His BP was only 80/50.

576
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,566
- The bicarb will work.
- How can you be so sure?

577
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,872
I'm barely getting a pulse.

578
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:42,917
When we removed
the shears from my patient,

579
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,396
it caused a pancreatic storm.

580
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,877
She was going to die,
but then we pushed bicarbonate

581
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,966
to neutralize the acid
in her pancreas.

582
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,315
Which raised the pH
in her blood,

583
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,839
enhancing excretion.

584
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:53,753
Dr. Bloom's
responding to treatment.

585
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,541
How did you know
to remove the shears?

586
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,543
Listened to the universe.

587
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:24,175
Welcome back.

588
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,613
Hey, so, uh, your numbers,
they look great.

589
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:29,006
You're gonna be fine
by tomorrow.

590
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,965
And don't worry about the ED.

591
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:32,531
I got it taken care of.

592
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,707
And I'll...

593
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,453
You can't go to Mt. Zion.

594
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,936
I can't do this without you.

595
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,979
You know that, right?

596
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:52,725
Yeah.

597
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,684
I ain't goin' anywhere.

598
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,339
But um, let's just, uh...

599
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:00,255
Let's dial it down a little bit
on the excitement, all right?

600
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:02,257
I can't take this no more, man.

601
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,650
Oh, come on.

602
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,394
This morning, I was, um...

603
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:14,008
I was pushing the hope
pretty hard.

604
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:18,447
And, uh, I was asking
you all to ignore...

605
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:23,582
everything else.

606
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,063
It's just, it's a weird idea

607
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:30,502
that positivity can be toxic.

608
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:33,592
But it absolutely can.

609
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:36,595
Especially when it comes
at the cost of what is true.

610
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,382
And what is true...

611
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:45,213
is that nobody wants
to be in this room.

612
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,954
None of you want to be here.

613
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:50,696
And no pep talk
that I can give you

614
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,350
will wish that away.

615
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:58,617
So I wanna
reframe this meeting.

616
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:04,319
I want to use this time and
this space to tell the truth.

617
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:06,712
The real truth,
the brutal truth.

618
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:07,975
I want you to say the things

619
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,064
that you're
not supposed to say.

620
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:12,283
I'm giving you permission
to say them in here.

621
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,806
The hope that you and your kids

622
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,852
actually need only comes

623
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:17,593
with that kind of truth, so...

624
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:20,596
I keep my gas tank full.

625
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,903
Just in case I, uh,
I can't take it anymore.

626
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:28,647
And sometimes
I dream about just...

627
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:29,953
Just driving away.

628
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,912
I sit in the bathroom...

629
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:37,178
And check prices
on one-way flights.

630
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,658
Just knowing I could leave...

631
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:40,877
It's okay.

632
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:42,661
Oh, baby, it's okay.

633
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,667
I love my daughter.

634
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:49,799
I do.

635
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:54,499
But when we're out
in public, she...

636
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,809
She screams and she...

637
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,115
says awful things

638
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:03,726
and I beg her to stop
and she won't.

639
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,815
And sometimes I...

640
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:09,384
I hate her.

641
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:12,865
What's wrong with me?

642
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:22,788
My son.

643
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:24,703
He's my miracle.

644
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,707
But sometimes I wish...

645
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:41,024
Sometimes I wish
he hadn't been born.

646
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,860
Please.

647
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:12,186
- I woke up at 4:00 a.m.
- to bake the cookies.

648
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,148
I wanted them to be fresh
because Alex is here.

649
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,851
And when he threw them
in my face, I...

650
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:28,985
I swear to God,
I almost hit him.

651
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,683
I would never. I...

652
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,120
of course, I... I...

653
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:41,867
I just want him to know
how much he hurts me.

654
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:45,219
How much I hurt.

655
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,962
It's not his fault.
I shouldn't feel like this.

656
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:25,824
Lyn.

657
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:27,301
This isn't a bar.

658
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:31,003
You said drinks.

659
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:38,272
Okay.

660
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:41,666
You still married?

661
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,147
It's like this.

662
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:46,802
My husband and I,

663
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:50,197
we have this understanding.

664
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:53,025
When he's out of town,

665
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,551
we're both allowed to...

666
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,474
Wow, um...

667
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,869
you obviously...

668
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:14,264
got a vibe that I dig.

669
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:21,315
But you also have a ring.

670
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:28,757
And "understanding" or not,

671
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,281
I can't get down like that.

672
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:40,247
It... it's not me, either.

673
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,945
I never actually, um,

674
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:45,164
acted on it.

675
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:48,298
I... I just... I thought this
would be easier.

676
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:50,909
Or at least,
not totally humiliating.

677
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:54,609
Because I, um,

678
00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:57,046
I dig you, too.

679
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,179
Yeah, so you know what?

680
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,877
I probably should
stop talking right now

681
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:02,921
so that's what I'm gonna do.

682
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:04,183
I am going
to stop talking and...

683
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,098
Hey.

684
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:07,274
Grab a coat.

685
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,887
Why?

686
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,193
You still owe me a drink.

687
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:16,935
Now it's a double.

688
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:29,684
Helen?

689
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:36,778
Can you see?

690
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:41,217
I see you.

691
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:50,447
What happened?

692
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,621
I remember getting to the tank
and then...

693
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:58,887
It just goes blank.

694
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:12,901
It was just...

695
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:19,517
Just DECON
and bicarb and stuff.

696
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:22,433
Stuff?

697
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:26,875
I'm gonna go.

698
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:29,225
Just gonna let you rest.

699
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,963
Thanks.

700
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,883
You were there, weren't you?

701
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:47,588
I'm sorry.

702
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:53,467
Guess sometimes...

703
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:57,035
it takes me a minute...

704
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,472
to remember...

705
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:02,780
what matters.

706
00:40:02,864 --> 00:40:07,176
More than anything.

707
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,091
You.

708
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,835
<i>♪ Well, I tried
to repress it ♪</i>

709

I... I didn't know
we still had landlines.

724
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,423
I have to...

725
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:22,164
give me a sec, sorry.

726
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:23,208
Hello, hello?

727
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,210
Max, we have Luna.

728
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:26,647
Oh, thank God, um...

729
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:28,736
We heard
what happened to you.

730
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,651
- We, uh...
- I have been...

731
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,304
We're taking her
back home with us.

732
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,089
Y-yeah, okay.

733
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,439
Great, um, that would
be great, actually.

734
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:37,484
And I... no, no.

735
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:39,311
I will... I will pick her up, um,

736
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:40,312
first thing tomorrow, okay?

737
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:43,185
You almost died, Max.

738
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:44,578
We want her to stay with us.

739
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:45,970
That's really not necessary,
Gwen.

740
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:47,798
I appreciate it but
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

741
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:50,061
No, Max.

742
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:51,759
We're filing for custody.

743
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,457
Uh...
