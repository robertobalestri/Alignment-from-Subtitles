00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,797
[Max] <i>Previously</i> on New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,882
[Helen] Have you met the group?
That's Willow.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,427
-And Millie.
-Don't be scared. We don't bite.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,931
You're calling yourself this and you're
going to keep suffering until you stop.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
If I can stop.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,477
It's been a family tradition
since before I was born.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,939
Sunday means church, family
and a meal with two meats!

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,733
It's so good. I can't live without it,

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,152
-like I can't live without you.
-Aw. [chuckles]

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,909
-[Helen] How's Luna?
-Frolicking in suburban splendor

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,161
with Georgia's parents.

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,705
I miss her. It's just not safe enough
to bring her home.

13
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,415
Nothing's safe anymore, though, is it?

14
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,209
[distant cheering]

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,089
[Floyd] Every tile in her house
needed re-grouting.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,760
Every pipe needed to be winterized.
That was between the grocery store runs

17
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,054
and delivering chicken dinners
to the usher board.

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,556
I knew your mama
would have you rippin' and runnin'.

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,225
You know she's still mad
we moved to San Francisco.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,438
Every time I tried to talk about it,
she just snuck off to bed. [chuckles]

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,525
But just getting to see her and my sisters
for two weeks made it all worthwhile.

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,278
Well, when you get off that plane,
you'll putting those eyes on me.

23
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,281
-Well, hopefully more than eyes.
-What did you have in mind?

24
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,575
-[chuckles]
-[phone beeps]

25
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,911
Oh, surprise. That's her.

26
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,162
-[chuckles]
<i>-Hang on.</i>

27
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,372
Oh.

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,417
Three goodbyes at the door wasn't enough?

29
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,754
Mama?

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,217
Whoa... whoa, Mama, hang on.
I can't... I can't understand you.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,594
Mama.

32
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,930
No, no, no.

33
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,389
Do not move. I'm coming.

34
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,391
Hey, we need to turn around.

35
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,227
[tires squeal]

36
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,817
{\an8}Am I supposed to feel
like I'm being choked?

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,486
{\an8}-I want this off now.
-You need to stay immobilized.

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,780
{\an8}-I told you not to call an ambulance.
-Mama.

39
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,990
{\an8}[scoffs] You know how expensive
those things are?

40
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,743
{\an8}-It's fine. I'll handle it.
-Oh, sure, Mr. Moneybags,

41
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,496
{\an8}while you're dragging me
all through COVID-land here.

42
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,957
{\an8}If I could've given you
a CT scan at home, I would have.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,875
{\an8}-I don't need a scan.
-You don't need a scan?

44
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,336
{\an8}I found you laid out on the ground,
bleeding from your head.

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,172
{\an8}We're going to run every test we can
to make sure you don't have trauma.

46
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
{\an8}-Do I sound like I have trauma?
-Floyd! I just heard.

47
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,343
{\an8}-How you feeling, Ms. Reynolds?
-Lousy. You?

48
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,804
{\an8}-It's crazy. I was going to the airport...
-I got you.

49
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,098
{\an8}We're going to run tests.
I'm going to run point.

50
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,267
{\an8}-You don't have to do...
-No. You were here for Vijay.

51
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,561
{\an8}-Now we're here for you.
-[elevator dings]

52
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,647
{\an8}-It's just down there.
-[Helen] Oh! Max!

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,440
{\an8}I hear Floyd's mother's in the ED.

54
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,693
{\an8}Oh, yeah, she took a fall,
but we're getting some tests.

55
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,445
{\an8}I think she's going to be okay.
Speaking of falling...

56
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,448
[Luna babbling]

57
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,242
Oh, Luna!

58
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,327
[giggling]

59
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,371
{\an8}She'll be walking in no time.

60
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,916
{\an8}-I'd say she's walking now.
-No, no. That's... that's a stumble.

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,336
{\an8}Well, it's less than a saunter.
I'll give you that.

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
{\an8}Yeah, but it couldn't be
because there's no way

63
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,674
{\an8}that my baby girl would take
her first steps without me.

64
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,177
{\an8}All video evidence to the contrary.
When you bringing her home?

65
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,598
{\an8}Not till it's safe. If Luna doesn't
need to be here, she shouldn't be.

66
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,517
{\an8}Her grandparents are great. They're
crazy careful. They got a big yard.

67
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,436
{\an8}-They take lots of videos.
-They do.

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,521
{\an8}-Of Luna not walking.
-She's not.

69
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,939
{\an8}-Max?
-Yeah?

70
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,191
{\an8}-Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec?
-Yeah, perfect timing.

71
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,903
{\an8}-What does this look like to you?
-Um... Oh, my gosh!

72
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,572
{\an8}-Luna! She's walking!
-No. No. Wrong answer.

73
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,825
{\an8}Oh. Sorry, yeah. Hard to tell what's
happening on that tiny little screen.

74
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,077
{\an8}-It is!
-Which is what I want to talk about.

75
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
{\an8}I was trying to get
some screen time in with Ella and Vijay,

76
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,707
{\an8}who I think is recuperating well,
but I wouldn't know,

77
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,626
{\an8}because the hospital's system sucks.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,836
-Yeah, agreed.
-It glitches all the time.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,505
-It does.
-The telemedicine thing is getting brutal.

80
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,633
I need to be with my patients in person.

81
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,551
-I need to see them.
-It's not safe, Iggy.

82
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,011
Unless we're talking life or death,

83
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,472
the longer people stay away
from the hospital, the better.

84
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,642
-They'll wear masks.
-How are you going to read facial cues?

85
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,187
-All right. We'll sit outside.
-Not until they're vaccinated like us.

86
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,272
Iggy, it's too soon. I'm sorry.

87
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,275
[indistinct chattering]

88
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,693
Can someone help?

89
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,447
-I'll take her, but you just can't...
-It's okay.

90
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,865
-I got it.
-It's her wrist.

91
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,908
Can you move it?

92
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,076
Ah, it hurts so bad.

93
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,078
Okay, we're going to do a COVID test.

94
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,830
Casey's going to get your patient history.
We'll order a scan...

95
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,291
I'm thinking Colles fracture
of the distal radius.

96
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,001
And you are?

97
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,546
-Her DriveTime driver.
-I can take it from here, but thank you.

98
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,257
-Five stars.
-[door thuds]

38-year-old woman.
Stage-II esophageal cancer.

100
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,136
Millie?

101
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,472
[sighs] I'm so sorry, Dr. Sharpe.

102
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,015
Large-volume hematemesis.

103
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,476
Now tachy, but otherwise
hemodynamically stable.

104
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,729
-Can we get her in the back?
-Yeah.

105
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,362
[Helen] We've been worried about you.
My office reached out.

106
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,030
I know. I know.

107
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,616
-You've missed a number of treatments.
-[sighs]

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,910
We were doing
the whole stay-at-home order thing

109
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,204
and I was feeling so much better.

110
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,456
I thought it was crazy to take the risk.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,835
I mean,
after three years of fighting cancer,

112
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,380
to die of some stupid virus? [chuckles]

113
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,717
We'll need to do some new tests.

114
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,554
I'm going to be all right, aren't I?

115
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,767
[indistinct announcement of PA system]

116
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,272
[Iggy] June, remember our agreement?

117
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,568
I love a carousel as much as the next guy,
probably even more, truth be told,

118
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,903
but, uh,
let's try to keep the focus on you.

119
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,573
Thank you.

120
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:24,991
How's your day?

121
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,745
You do any journaling this week?

122
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,623
Okay, June, I, uh...

123
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
I get that this is not ideal,

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,422
the video thing, but I would love it
if both of us could give it our best shot.

125
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,631
What do you think?

126
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,843
So tell me about your journaling.
What've you got?

127
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,805
<i>-I guess it was...</i>
-[static interference]

128
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,266
No. Oh, no. Ah!

129
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,143
June, hang... hang on one second.

130
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,728
What is... Hold on.

131
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,897
Can you hear me?

132
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,482
June, can you hear me?

133
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,859
Oh, my God.

134
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,611
This sucks. [frustrated chuckle]

135
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,654
<i>Welcome to my world.</i>

136
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,614
[chuckles] Yeah.

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah.

138
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,537
How often do you get to see anybody that's
not trapped inside of this little box?

139
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,247
Folks not included, obviously.

140
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,708
<i>Never, like never.</i>

141
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,003
And most of your friends,
they're all congregating outside again?

142
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,213
<i>They all are.</i>

143
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,674
<i>I'm just the immunocompromised freak
still stuck at home.</i>

144
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,968
Whoa, whoa. You are not a freak.

145
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,096
You have an illness that you are managing.

146
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,640
Maybe we can talk to your parents

147
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,392
and see if we can set up
some safe visitations or...

148
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,645
I don't know, something.

149
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,979
<i>Good luck.</i>

150
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,065
<i>They won't even let me out on our stoop.</i>

151
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,735
[sighs] Right.

152
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:52,495
When COVID hit and everybody was, like,
stuck in their house, hating it,

153
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,497
that must've been really weird for you

154
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,709
because suddenly, everybody kind of knew
what it was like to be you.

155
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,129
<i>I mean...</i>

156
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,882
<i>I guess I felt normal for a couple months.</i>

157
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>I could hang out with my friends online
without missing out</i> on anything,

158
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,391
<i>but now, everything's back to normal...
for them.</i>

159
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,564
June?

160
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,108
Will you show me your hands?

161
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,863
You have to show them to me, June.

162
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,822
Now, please.

163
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,497

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,586
-Max.
-Hey. Still waiting on those labs.

166
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,671
-How's she doing?
-Well, she's more concerned

167
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,882
-about getting COVID than the fall.
-She should be.

168
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
I'm sure that'll make her feel better.

169
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,594
I don't suppose
there's a safer place for her.

170
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,471
How do you feel about New Zealand?

171
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,515
-Now I don't even want to be here.
-Maybe you shouldn't be.

172
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,768
-Wait outside. I'll give you an update.
-Think I'm going to do the six-feet thing.

173
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,687
-Max.
-Dora!

174
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,648
The conquering traitor returns.

175
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,066
It was a promotion.

176
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,152
Yeah. I still can't believe
those evil pencil pushers

177
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,446
lured you away with a fancy title
and more money.

178
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,405
Shocking, I know.

179
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,866
Yet here you are
finding your way back to me.

180
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,327
It wasn't hard.
There's hardly anyone here.

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,329
Yeah, which most would call good news.

182
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,458
Speaking of which, can I show you this
adorable video of my daughter not walking?

183
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,711
No and it's not good news
if you're trying to dig yourself out

184
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,256
of a massive financial hole
left by this pandemic.

185
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,717
The public is wary
of coming back here, Max.

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,513
Without the money from elective surgeries,
you can't pay for the emergent ones.

187
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,683
So we need a powerful and effective PSA
to save this place.

188
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,643
A what now?

189
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,439
HCC's funding a campaign to encourage
patients to return to New Amsterdam.

190
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,527
But I don't want patients returning
to New Amsterdam,

191
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,280
not if they don't have to, not until
there's enough vaccine for everyone.

192
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,325
We can't wait for that.
We need revenue now.

193
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,619
You need to step
in front of a camera, smile

194
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,665
and tell the good people of New York
to get their butts back here.

195
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,544
Or you'll go down in history
as the medical director

196
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,004
who closed
America's first public hospital.

197
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,343
[easy listening music]

198
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,928
Can I be straight with you?

199
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:19,433
Here at New Amsterdam, we all honestly
feel that, despite our great challenge...

200
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,560
[scoffs]

201
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,770
Max?

202
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,522
Sorry, I'm not a writer or anything.

203
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,483
It feels like calling
our recent experience a challenge

204
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,694
feels like calling the Holocaust a bummer.

205
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,947
You know what I mean? Maybe this thing
is just a little beyond words.

206
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,074
Oh, no. We have the words.

207
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,826
Your job is to say them.

208
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
Oh, okay. Great.

209
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,204
And action.

210
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,126
Can I be straight with you?
I don't know. Can I?

211
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,671
Am I allowed to be? Because if I was
honestly being straight with you,

212
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,548
-then I would probably tell you never...
-Max!

213
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,758
Okay, I'll just do it again.

214
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,386
[murmuring]

215
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,887
Okay. [clears throat]

216
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,725
Of course, no one likes
coming to the hospital,

217
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,561
although that's not even true.
What about having a baby?

218
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,188
That's a great moment!
That's exciting. Right?

219
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,066
Can I be straight with you?

220
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,488
Sorry. My brain just kind of... [whistles]

221
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,366
We should probably cut.
Is that okay if I say that?

222
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,328
Can I be straight with you? Uh, sorry.

223
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,038
I don't know why I did the point thing.

224
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,624
Can I... no, cut. Let's cut that.

225
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,128
[clears throat] Sorry, cut.
Sorry for shouting. That was bad.

226
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,714
I got it this time.
Nope, I lied. What's the line?

227
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,133
[exhales] Uh, what's the next one? Uh...

228
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,887
As an administration, we've implemented
dozens of new safety measures.

229
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,849
So, as a patient, nothing should deter you
from walking through those doors.

230
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,851
Except, I don't know, death maybe.

231
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,187
Which, of course, no safety measure
can completely rule out

232
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,773
and is a pretty strong deterrent,
wouldn't you say, Brad?

233
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,236
Can I be straight with you?

234
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,324
Here at New Amsterdam, we honestly feel...

235
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,409
[sighs]

236
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,121
I can... [sighs]

237
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,999
I can honestly tell you...

238
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,711
What's wrong now, Max?

239
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,005
When people
are genuinely being honest with you,

240
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,549
they don't keep telling you
how honest they are.

241
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,843
They don't say things like,
"Can I be straight with you?"

242
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,930
It implies that they haven't been
straight with anything else,

243
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,183
which, to tell you the truth,
makes me sound like a liar.

244
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,894
How could you be a liar
when you haven't said anything?

245
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,980
Including the tagline,
"Come back to New Amsterdam."

246
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,857
Because that would be
the biggest lie of all.

247
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,652
What happened to the guy who used to say,
"Our doors are always open"?

248
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,821
What happened to bringing
in patients off the streets?

249
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,241
What happened was a global pandemic
with no fully-vetted vaccine

250
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:45,037
and even when we get enough doses,
30% of Americans won't take it,

251
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,498
because
of all the insane conspiracy theories.

252
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:52,169
So can I be straight with you, Dora?
This hospital is not safe.

253
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,712
Not completely.

254
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,173
And if you want a tagline, how's this?
Uh...

255
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,675
"Come back to New Amsterdam,

256
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,428
'cause if you're not dead yet,
we can finish the job."

257
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,604
I wanted to bring you both into this,
because if June's anxiety

258
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,774
-has escalated into self-harm...
<i>-Ripping off her fingernails?</i>

259
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,484
<i>How long has this been going on?</i>

260
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,611
I don't know. I just saw it this morning.

261
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,405
<i>But how could we have missed this?</i>

262
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,866
Because she hides it.
But it's not your fault.

263
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,786
You should know I have been pushing to get
my patients back in here with me.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,497
If I we'd been working with in person,
I would've caught it sooner...

265
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>-She can't come back to the hospital.
-Are you even allowed?</i>

266
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,627
Um... not at the moment,

267
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,298
but I could convince our medical director
in this particular case.

268
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
<i>No. It's too dangerous.</i>

269
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,136
She would be wearing an N95 mask
just like our frontline workers.

270
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>Have any of your frontline workers
died from the virus?</i>

271
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,684
Yes. But with
all of our safety protocols in place,

272
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,895
New Amsterdam is safer
than going to the market.

273
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,480
<i>We don't let her go there either.</i>

274
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,485
<i>We want her here with us. Our home
is the only place where she's 100% safe.</i>

275
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,737
But she's not safe.

276
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,325
COVID has caused
an epidemic of loneliness in this country.

277
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,120
The studies coming out show that
living like June with no peer contact,

278
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,414
it's like smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

279
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,626
Your daughter is on the brink
of serious clinical depression.

280
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,086
<i>But she's not dead.</i>

281
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,798
<i>And that's what lets us sleep at night.</i>

282
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,261
[sighs]

283
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,765
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

284
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,779
As you can see from the charts,
there's no evidence of fracture, bleed,

285
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,281
-or subdural hematoma.
-So zero damage from the fall.

286
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,367
-Everything looks normal.
-Uh, not quite.

287
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,077
Right, okay, thank you.

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,329
Um, sorry, I told Floyd
I'd help out on this one.

289
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,582
There does seem to be a type
of central hippocampal atrophy.

290
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,834
-So?
-Max, we found no indication of trauma.

291
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,088
-Right, because his mother has diabetes.
-Diabetes?

292
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,173
I've been living with her
for the past two weeks...

293
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,633
Did she seem overly tired?

294
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,386
Was she going to bed early?
Did she forget things? Repeat stuff?

295
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,762
Well, sometimes, yeah, but...

296
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,932
Neuropathy from diabetes.
I think it's why she fell, Floyd.

297
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,020
And it's good news,
because now we know how to treat her.

298
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,197
[Helen] <i>It's going to get a little loud.</i>

299
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,034
Louder than a house
full of forced homeschool kids?

300
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,372
-Probably not.
-[chuckles] <i>Quarantine wasn't all bad.</i>

301
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,666
The whole family stuck together.

302
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,793
Found our rhythm.

303
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,755
<i>Movie nights. Cooking together. Puzzles.</i>

304
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,798
[clack of keyboard]

305
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
So many puzzles.

306
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,760
You remember Brandon?

307
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,431
<i>-The quiet one?</i>
-Yeah, the moody one. [chuckles]

308
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,727
Without all the chemo, my hair grew back
and he became a different person.

309
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,896
<i>Because of your hair?</i>

310
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,732
Because he stopped seeing me as a ghost.

311
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,775
I became Mom again.

312
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,485
[machine pumping, clanking]

313
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,322
And without chemo brain,
I could actually listen.

314
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,782
I could really hear him, you know?

315
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,787
I could hear my son
for the first time in years.

316
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>Dr. Sharpe?</i>

317
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,760
It's back, isn't it?

318
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,184
<i>-The cancer's metastasized.</i>

319
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,812
[exhale softly]

320
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,399
[voice breaking]
Is there anything we can do?

321
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,822
<i>I'm so sorry, Millie.</i>

322
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,875
[sobs softly]

323
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, you do, in fact, have
a broken bone in your wrist.

324
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,133
Crack diagnosis from your DriveTime gal.

325
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,219
It's crazy. It was days ago.

326
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,222
I was riding so slow.
The bike started to tip.

327
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,891
I stuck my hand out to brace myself
against the wall.

328
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,309
That's what did it.

329
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,562
There was hardly any force.
How could I have broken anything?

330
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,148
Hey. How are you feeling?

331
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,942
You're back.

332
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,152
-Did you...
-I got tested outside.

333
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
-[door thuds]
-Her wallet. Found it in the car.

334
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,865
Pedestrian on the wrong end of a taxi.

335
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,326
Severe head and neck trauma.
Intubated in field.

336
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,869
Okay, let's get him to Trauma One.

337
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,623
-Stat, page respiratory and get me ortho.
-You've really gone above and beyond.

338
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,625
-Can I give you something?
-No, please.

339
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,585
[gags]

340
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,089
-Riley?
-[monitor beeping]

341
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,092
-Can you breathe?
-[gasping for breath]

342
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,762
This woman needs help!
-[gasping for breath]

343
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,306
[grunts]

344
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
Nurse! Anyone!

345
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,643
[monitor beeping]

346
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,894
[gasping for breath]

347
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,530
[gasps, coughs]

348
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,532
[coughing]

349
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,659
What the hell are you doing?

350
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,202
Someone call security!

351
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,332
Adult-onset diabetes is nothing to fear.

352
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,793
You should be thrilled
we caught it when we did.

353
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,211
This is me thrilled.

354
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,755
[chuckles]

355
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,384
Um, so seeing as your pancreas can no
longer produce enough insulin on its own,

356
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,262
we're going to need to start you
on basal-bolus therapy.

357
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,931
And, uh, Dr. Goodwin is going
to take you through the routine

358
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,558
so you can do it by yourself, Mama.

359
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,436
I've been doing for myself my whole life.

360
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,064
Diabetes won't slow me down.

361
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:50,319
Good. So let's say you're in your kitchen
and, uh, you've just finished this meal.

362
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,780
You need to figure out
how much insulin to take.

363
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:57,159
So you're going to divide your carb intake
by your personal IC ratio.

364
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,120
You didn't tell me there'd be math.

365
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,789
Well, we'll take it slow, I promise.

366
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,874
So your ratio is 1:20.

367
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,377
That is one unit of insulin
to 20 grams of carbs.

368
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,674
So you're going to take the total number
of grams in that meal and divide it by 20.

369
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,970
[murmuring] Okay, dividing that...

370
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,722
I would...

371
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,265
stop hovering.

372
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,601
If it's on me, let it be on me, you hear?

373
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,686
Max is here to help, Mama.

374
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,609
3.25 units.

375
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,739
[Max] That's very good. That's excellent.
Great. Okay, so, step two.

376
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,908
Administering the insulin.

377
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,536
So what you're going to do after
you've washed your hands

378
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
is simply remove this,

379
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,334
insert the needle into
the rubber stopper here,

380
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,961
turn the bottle upside down

381
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,421
and why don't we try just that much.

382
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,223
Come on.

383
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,766
Come on, now.

384
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,935
Oh.

385
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,022
That's okay. Maybe...

386
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,566
I've got it.

387
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,152
I've got it.

388
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,740
[sighs]

389
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,539
Oh. [sighs]

390
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,793
I can do this.

391
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,170
Mm-hmm.

392
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,630
I can do this.

393
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,676
[Max] It's okay. Let's just try again.

394
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,097
My mother's raised three kids,
owns her own home,

395
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,058
prays harder than anyone I know
for everyone else's troubles,

396
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,019
and now she needs full-time care.

397
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,937
She can't live by herself.

398
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,440
[Evie] <i>Wish I was there with you.</i>

399
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,193
Well, maybe
if I click my heels three times.

400
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,696
[Evie] <i>Or maybe if you just turn around.</i>

401
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,620
[chuckles]

402
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,169
-Why'd you...
-'Cause we're family too, baby.

403
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,548
-Come here.
-[siren blares in background]

404
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,345
Two centimeters to the left
and you would've killed her.

405
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,846
One centimeter, actually.

406
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,433
Oh, they teach you that
in DriveTime school?

407
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,601
I saved your patient.

408
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,478
You knew nothing about my patient.

409
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,439
You swooped in here with no knowledge
of preexisting conditions,

410
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,609
or current treatment plan,
and you stabbed her with a syringe.

411
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,487
You're not curious
why her wrist broke with no fall?

412
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,949
You need to check her bone density.
Maybe test for Wilson's disease.

413
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,201
Okay, WebMD,
I think it's time for you to leave.

414
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,329
If it's Wilson's and you don't push
magnesium, her heart could stop.

415
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,124
Or if it's a calcium deficiency,
maybe you could pick us up a quart of milk

416
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,085
-on your next run.
-[frustrated sigh]

417
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,587
Get her out of here
before I file assault charges.

418
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,505
[sighs]

419
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,596
[exhales] Okay.

420
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,308
[phone buzzing]

421
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,103
Dr. Frome.

422
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,439
What? Gabriella?

423
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,985
No. No, June is not here with me.

424
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,114
Then where is she?

425
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,244
Okay, did...
Okay, did she take her phone with her?

426
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,082
Then you need to check all of her texts
and call all of her friends.

427
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,001
Yes.

428
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,877
I'll be in touch.

429
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,048
[sighs]

430
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,926
You're still here?

431
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,387
Yeah, don't worry.

432
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,973
I'm not making you do the PSA.

433
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,560
Sorry, I... [mutters]

434
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah, I appreciate that.

435
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,981
Mm, I forgot that no
one can make you do anything.

436
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,900
Well, except for you. You could always
get me to do what was right,

437
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,111
even if I couldn't see it at the time.

438
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,905
-You know, if you ever want to come back...
-No.

439
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,700
-Okay, maybe you want to think about it...
-No.

440
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,826
Oh.

441
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,827
Okay.

442
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,831
So if you're not doing the PSA
and you're not coming back,

443
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,083
then why are you still here?

444
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,084
Oh.

445
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,213
I said you weren't doing the PSA.
I never said I wasn't. Oh.

446
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,925
But, uh, how are you going to do it
without me?

447
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,136
Uh, you've been recast.

448
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,057
Tell me it isn't true.

449
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,018
-If you're referring to the PSA...
-No, it's not a PSA.

450
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,563
Saying, "Don't text and drive,"
that would be a PSA.

451
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,440
This is propaganda!

452
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,153
You are putting your name,
this hospital's name, on a dangerous lie.

453
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,404
Millie came in today.

454
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,865
She might have a week to live.

455
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,535
While you were out
seizing the moral high ground,

456
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,663
I got to tell her that her kids
would soon be without a mum.

457
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,000
Her chemo was working,

458
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,504
but she missed six vital treatments
because she was worried about coming here.

459
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,631
So, yes,
of course I'm going to do the PSA.

460
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,549
Oh. Millie.

461
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,761
If we'd have got word out a month ago,
it might have saved her life.

462
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,973
Yeah, maybe, but it won't just affect
people like Millie.

463
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,687
Elderly people deciding to get a physical,

464
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:22,275
or, uh, diabetics wondering
if now's the right time to get LASIK.

465
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,278
Things that can wait should wait.

466
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,198
No hospital's 100% safe,
but we've made ours a lot safer.

467
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,867
-Consider the alternative...
-Jumping off the third floor is safer

468
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,954
than the roof, but it's not going
to make a difference in the outcome.

469
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,414
I won't even bring my own daughter here.

470
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,668
How can I ask anyone else to come here?

471
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,213
If something happened...

472
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:45,924
to her...

473
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,637
or anyone
because I put my thumb on a scale...

474
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,812
After what I've seen today,
I am more than happy to tip the scale.

475
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,940
[pager beeping]

476
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,861
It's Millie.

477
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,746
[machine beeping steadily]

478
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,416
Millie's cancer metastasized to her brain.

479
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,460
It caused a massive bleed.

480
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,839
But she was feeling so much better.

481
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,133
[Max] I'm so sorry, but...

482
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,678
it doesn't look like
she's going to regain consciousness.

483
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,933
[Helen] Millie's being kept alive
by the life-support machine.

484
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,770
Her brain has stopped functioning.

485
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,317
There's nothing more that we can do.

486
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,695
[exhales shakily]

487
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,113
We just got her back.

488
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,358
Hey, I'm just curious.
Why is this your virtual background?

489
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,695
Before COVID,
my parents used to let me come here.

490
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,656
You know, see some friends.

491
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,700
They wouldn't let me ride, though.

492
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,868
Too many germs.

493
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,121
Well, better than nothing, I guess, right?

494
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,001
-You going to tell my folks I'm here?
-Yeah, bad news.

495
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,254
I, uh... I narc'd on you already.

496
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,589
The second I saw you.

497
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,341
But you got some time.

498
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,011
You want to tell me why you're down here?

499
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,062
You know, sometimes when people
hurt themselves, it's a distraction.

500
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,733
The physical pain, just for a second,
it stops the emotional pain.

501
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,281
Maybe you came down here
to make it really stop.

502
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,290
You need to put your mask on now.

503
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,249
Why?

504
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,836
We can talk about that
after you put your mask on.

505
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,045
Please.

506
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,589
If I knew when this virus would be over,

507
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,426
I could maybe do it.

508
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,014
Just... just deal with it
until it was done.

509
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,851
And what if the virus
never goes away for kids?

510
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,353
There's no vaccine for us.

511
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,814
I'm just stuck in my room forever.

512
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,818
It's basically like being dead anyway.

513
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,490
I can't keep being alone.

514
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,369
[exhales]

515
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,833
So, after much discussion,

516
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,169
we decided to take Mama
back to San Francisco.

517
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,212
-Oh, hell, no.
-Wa... wait.

518
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,673
-Mm-mm, absolutely not.
...Can I lay it out first...

519
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,634
What makes you think taking her away
from everything and everyone she knows

520
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,969
is going to be good for her?

521
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,638
Court, we got the space
and with both of our incomes...

522
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,973
-So it's about your money?
-No.

523
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
Is Mama good with this?

524
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,852
I thought we should be
on the same page first.

525
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,228
Oh, your page.

526
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,772
Mama's golden child.

527
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,316
-Whatever her baby Floyd says is law.
-Oh, come on, Court.

528
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,778
I'm just trying to step up. You and Brandi
have your own families to deal with.

529
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,572
Our lives are a little more flexible,
so we can do more now.

530
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,409
Not more than us. Where were you
when we were checking in on her every day,

531
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,245
bringing her food,
making sure she was safe?

532
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,706
We did all that with no problems
while you were chillin',

533
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,376
-bunned up in San Francisco.
-He wanted to be here.

534
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,005
Every second of every day, he was worried
sick about Mama and you and your family.

535
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,217
-Pump the brakes. This is family business.
-Whoa. Don't talk to her like that.

536
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,510
Stop this!

537
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,470
I am not dead!

538
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,307
So stop talking about me like I am.

539
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,065
[background chattering]

540
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,775
I know she was out of line,

541
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:19,072
but pulling off a successful needle
decompression is pretty cool.

542
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,949
In fact, she kind of reminds me of...

543
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,826
Are you sure
you want to finish that sentence?

544
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,911
It's Riley. She's having runs of V-tach.

545
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,163
-You push esmolol?
-Yes, no change.

546
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,207
-Procainamide?
-Didn't work either.

547
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,875
[machine beeping rapidly]

548
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,378
Yeah, it's V-tach, all right.

549
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,546
Push amiodarone.

550
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,588
[machine beeping]

551
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,269
-BP's dropping. It's not working.
-[machine beeping]

552
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,859
Magnesium. Push magnesium.

553
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,569
You sure?

554
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,738
One gram now.

555
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,991
[machine beeping frantically]

556
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,207
[beeping slows down]

557
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,375
[sighs]

558
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,711
Nice save, boss.

559
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,879
[sighs]

560
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,089
[machine beeping steadily]

561
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,011
[man] Settle.

562
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,221
Okay, Helen, and action.

563
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,349
I'm Dr. Helen

564
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,604
and this office adjoins one of our new
Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms.

565
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,941
It's built with negative airflow pressure.
The HVAC filters are cleared daily,

566
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,987
and it's fitted with outdoor air intake
COVID-19-safe exhaust handling.

567
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,450
Here at New Amsterdam, we're confident...

568
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,202
[chuckles awkwardly]

569
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,626
Here at New Amsterdam,
we're confident that you'll be...

570
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,756
-Actually, I'm sorry.
-You're doing great.

571
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,132
No, I'm not.

572
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,301
Helen, everything you're saying is true.

573
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,889
-The HVAC, the exhaust.
-Yes, the facts are accurate,

574
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,391
but "Here at New Amsterdam,
we're confident..."

575
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,064
I'm not confident...
of anything right now. Are you?

576
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,069
'Cause to tell you the truth,
I'm terrified...

577
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,947
most of the time,

578
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,908
because we've been living
in a dystopian nightmare.

579
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,995
We are losing good people with children
and with families

580
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,957
and I'm standing here
talking about exhaust handling?

581
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,627
People need reassurance.

582
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,337
Do they?

583
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,556
'Cause the people I know want to stop
feeling scared

584
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,224
and they want to stay alive.

585
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,102
And I can't reassure them of that.

586
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,063
No one can, because the world is not safe!

587
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,775
You can't expect me to stand here and say
there's nothing to be afraid of,

588
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,652
when everyone should be afraid!

589
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,153
[breathes heavily]

590
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,197
So what do we do?

591
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,034
[breathes heavily]

592
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,578
We can tell... [exhales]

593
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,289
We can tell people the truth...

594
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,793
that we may never get rid of this virus,

595
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,046
so we have to find a way to live with it.

596
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,924
'Cause even if we vaccinate
every single American,

597
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,801
there's another virus around the corner

598
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,263
and another one after that
and we can't stop living.

599
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,390
We can't barricade ourselves in,

600
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:36,352
because that is when you give up things
that you can never get back. [sighs]

601
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,899
[exhales deeply]

602
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,039
So, Brandi and Courtney will take turns
helping you during the day

603
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,791
and we'll get
someone to stay with you at night.

604
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,711
That don't sound too bad, does it?

605
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,422
So...

606
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,758
I'll be living with a stranger?

607
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,719
A trained healthcare professional.

608
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,601
Would you do that to your mama?

609
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,944
I hope I never have to make that decision.

610
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,863
Because it sucks.

611
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,074
All of it.

612
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,578
-I like her.
-[chuckles]

613
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,623
Oh, Mama.

614
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,166
[sighs heavily]

615
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,046
I wish there was another way,
but there isn't.

616
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,094
I'll visit as often as I can.
You know that.

617
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,931
New York will always be my home.

618
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,727
Mm.

619
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,937
Hm?

620
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,773
Come here.

621
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,402
It's okay.

Hi.

627
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,349
Thank you...

628
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,019
for saying what we've all been feeling.

629
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,272
What? What?

630
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,523
[applause continues]

631
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,151
What did I...

632
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,487
I'm on the news?

633
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,990
Meltdown is a strong word,
don't you think?

634
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,408
-Max?
-I wouldn't worry about it.

635
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,286
You only have, like, 3.2 million views.

-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

641
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,880
Why would you release that?

642
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,757
-Who, me?
-Just stop.

643
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,051

Yes, I would, but I didn't.
And you were brilliant!

Okay. Big swing, Max.

646
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,601
Of course you think I did it.
You think I did everything, but I didn't.

647
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,560
Stop it.

-I'm relieved that my words are out there.
-I'm glad to hear you say that.

in our scheduling.

-Sorry, what worked?
-You were both right.

656
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,173
People don't need reassurance.

657
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,925
They need honesty.

658
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,135
You didn't release it?

659
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:57,970
No.

660
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,473
But I think I know who did.

661
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,061

[Iggy] Hi. Hi, guys. Thank you.

665
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,334
Thank you so much for coming. I know
that's a really big deal, so thank you.

666
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,710
You're sure this is safe?

667

As safe as it can be, yeah.

668
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,343
You ready?

669
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,640
-Are they all your patients?
-Um, no, no.

670
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,185
They're just a group
of really cool young women just like June.

671
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,479
Each one is immunocompromised
in one way or another,

672
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,108
each still living at home on lockdown
without much family or friends,

673
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,444
and each one knowing
