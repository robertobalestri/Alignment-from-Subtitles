00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>Dada, hi.</i>

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,704
<i>Later, Daddy!</i>

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,884
That's from last week.

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,582
One recording doesn't prove
he's a present father.

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:15,932
How about 100?

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,108
My client records one of these
almost every day.

7
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,632
I've made a supercut.
The judge will love it.

8
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,677
You don't want to take this
before a judge.

9
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:23,809
You're right.

10
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,115
They'll throw us
right out their chamber.

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,117
The standard for grandparents
to claim custody

12
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,640
over a willing parent
demands evidence

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:31,121
of deprivation, addiction,
or abuse.

14
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,992
He fails to meet
the standard of fitness

15
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,559
set by Barnett v. Jeffries.

16
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,474
Barnett?
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,258
What judge will believe
that a widower doctor

18
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,738
who still wears
his wedding ring

19
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,349
and sings his daughter
to sleep every night is unfit?

20
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,308
He is unfit.
No.

21
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:45,874
Advise your client
that Dr. Goodwin

22
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,615
is showing
extraordinary compassion

23
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:50,531
by not pursuing charges for her
reckless disruption of custody.

24
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,142
No, those voice recordings
are beautiful,

25
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,491
but you only made them

26
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,319
because you don't see Luna
for days at a time.

27
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,408
Dr. Goodwin has
a very important job.

28
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,018
Well, you could leave it.

29
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,369
You could work fewer hours,
but you choose work over Luna

30
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,110
at every opportunity
even when it meant

31
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,851
sending her away for months.

32
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,244
You work in a hospital.

33
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,289
You've brought a child
into the middle of a plague

34
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,335
to make yourself feel
more like a father.

35
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,685
You were in a recovery ward
for days

36
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,992
because you exposed yourself
to toxic chemicals.

37
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,689
Did you stop to think
about Luna then?

38
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:21,084
I think about her
every moment of every day.

39
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,520
About protecting her,

40
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,044
but no one will be safe
until everyone is,

41
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,176
So that is a lot
of people that...

42
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,351
You saw a room
full of poison,

43
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:28,787
and you ran right in.

44
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:31,746
You were thinking of Luna?

45
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,183
You nearly orphaned her.

46
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,967
Her mother is dead.

47
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,664
Luna will never remember her,

48
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,927
and if you died,
all she'd have is voice memos.

49
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,366
The sound of some dead stranger
who loved her,

50
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,021
just not enough
to put her first.

51
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,545
Georgia died in your care

52
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,718
knowing she never came first.

53
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,376
She was our daughter.

54
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,814
We're not letting that happen
to our granddaughter.

55
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,611
Maybe you're right.

56
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,791
Maybe she is better off
with you.

but you can't make
any of it about you.

94
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,479
Only you would ask
for a favor

95
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,046

Our chemistry's insane.
Yeah?

108
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,862
And honestly, I just
can't stop thinking about her.

109
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,603
Now, I'm not down
for the polyamorous thing,

110
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,649
but it feels kind of weird

111
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,000
hanging out as friends
with this secret attraction.

112
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,523
Well, it's not a secret.

113
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:06,396
It's keeping something
complicated to yourself

114

to protect the other person.

115
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:11,183
Well, can't do that,
and I'm seeing her tonight,

116
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,098
so please tell me
how to end it

117
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,753
before I fall off this cliff
and somebody gets hurt.

118
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,843
Huh,
why does this sound familiar?

119
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,975
I knew it.
Right, right,

120
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,630
because it's exactly
what you did with us.

121
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:26,677
You start something
that you've already decided

122
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,375
doesn't have a future,
so even though it's great,

123
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,681
you're gonna torch it.

124
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,596
Well, because it's not
what I wanted.

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,380
Look, I never wavered on that...

126
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,339
A traditional marriage,
a Black family.

127
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,688
Yet you let Evie go.

128
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,301
Look, Floyd, I know that you
like to think of yourself

129
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,347
as this man who walks the path,

130
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,913
but you keep ending up
on the cliffs.

00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,351
Incoming.
I don't know.

132
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,309
Maybe it's because
you really want to jump.

Five-year-old Kiri Almeida.
Status: post heart transplant.

She's got

136
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,367
Had four heart surgeries
and a transplant last year.

137
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,238
They have her file.
You can read everything.

138
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,153
Hey, Dr. Reynolds.
Ted, Madeline, what happened?

139
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,807
Kiri can't breathe.

140
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,419
Oh, Kir, I thought we agreed,
no more emergencies.

141
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,639
Let's type and cross.
Well, she's AB.

142
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,380
Kiri's been my patient
since she was born.

143
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,382
Well, could she be
rejecting the heart?

144
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,557
I have to do a biopsy.

145
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,646
But could she?
Yes.

146
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,082
The question is how badly.

147
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,824
Book an OR and page Dr. Sharpe
for a biopsy.

Sir, can you hear me?

153
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,532
Okay, let's run a chem 7,
CBC with diff,

154
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,229
and let's get
a blood tox screen stat.

155
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,968
Got it.
And who is next?

156
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,018
She's had
so many risky surgeries.

157
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,673
Yeah,
it's all standard protocol.

158
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:54,242
I know, but for a child?
Extracting heart sample now.

159
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,425
Prepare to withdraw
the catheter.

160
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,991
Yes, Dr. Reynolds.

161
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,429
Heart rate holding steady
at 75 BPM.

162
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,086
What's the severity
of the rejection?

163
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,523
It's 2R? 3R?

164
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,699
Ox at 95.

165
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,962
Dopamine and vasopressin
all 4.

166
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,526
Zero.

167
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,836
Zero?

168
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,361
There's no evidence
that she's rejecting the heart.

169
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,582
Then what the hell's
causing her symptoms?

170
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,329
Tox screen's crazy.
Is that dioxin?

171
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,287
Who gets poisoned with dioxin?

172
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,290
Dioxin poisoning
was a favorite of the KGB.

173
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,596
Yeah, didn't we agree

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,772
that we'd leave
our nerd interests at home?

175
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,557
Oh, Cold War era spy craft
is the opposite of nerdy.

176
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,906
It's awesome.

177
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,387
And the Cold War
is also, you know, over.

178
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,780
Yeah, but the KGB players
didn't just disappear.

179
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,739
Man, everyone knows
that they're the guys

180
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,828
who poisoned
Viktor Yushchenko in 2004.

181
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,569
And now I'm worried
that you're serious.

182
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:03,268
This man is our patient,
not a Russian spy.

183
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,452
Sounds like Russian to me.

184
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,855
Reed?

185
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,465
Max.

186
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,293
Please don't tell me that
we're short on vaccines again.

187
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:31,296
I can't take that today.
No, no, we have the vaccines.

188
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,167
Problem is,
they've been thawing all night.

189
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,644
This freezer's dead.

190
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,389
How many are in there?
1,000.

191
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:41,393
We're gonna have to toss 'em.
Toss 1,000 vaccines?

192
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,655
Unless you have a Ferrari

193
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,004
and plan on delivering them
door-to-door.

194
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,531
Max!
That was a joke!

195
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:49,793
Max.

196
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,621
We are not tossing
1,000 vaccines.

197
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,057
Too many people
still need them.

198
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,188
We need to make it safe
for everyone.

199
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm sure we'll get
some walk-ins.

200
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,757
Take 'em to the prison ward.
Vaccinated.

201
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,019
Homeless clinic
across the street.

202
00:08:59,103 --> 00:08:59,803
Vaccinated.

203
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,065
Everyone in our system

204
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,153
who's wanted the shot
has gotten it.

205
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,549
Max, that's good news.

206
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:10,727
Uh, when do they expire?
Six hours.

207
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,251
Okay, now, that's good.
No, that's actually bad.

208
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,426
Not if we move quickly.

209
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,341
I will post
on the hospital's website.

210
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:17,603
You hit up social media.

211
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,213
If we've got six hours
to give out 1,000 shots,

212
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,299
then let's get
1,000 people in here now.

213
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,179
Thank you.

214
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:41,624
Oh.

215
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,283
The kids make it
to your mom's okay?

216
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,288
Please don't be mad.

217
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,165
That's the sashimi salad.

218
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,993
Here's your octopus roll.

219
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,176
Reed.
Hmm.

220
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,570
What is this?
Great response.

221
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,180
We've already administered
50 doses,

222
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,355
and the line's growing.

223
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,574
Most of these people
look like

224
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,054
they just stepped out
of a country club.

225
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,796
I literally saw a guy
checking his stock portfolio.

226
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,493
No, it's wrong, okay?

227
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,190
We need to get this vaccine

228
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,192
to the people
who need it the most,

229
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,803
the ones
who don't have access to it.

230
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,674
This isn't our patient base.

231
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,415
Our patient base
can't just leave their jobs

232
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,634
because they got an email.

233
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,287
Our patient base
probably isn't on Twitter.

234
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,554
I am so sorry, Reed.
Why?

235
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,512
Because you're gonna have to
apologize to all these people.

236
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,166
Why am I gonna
to have to apologize?

237
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,603
Because I'm taking
these vaccines.

238
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,996
Come on, man.

239
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,654
Max,
what you're doing right now

240
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:52,959
seems kind of crazy.

241
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,657
We need to get this vaccine
to the people

242
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,789
who can't come
to the hospital or won't,

243
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,096
to the holdouts
and to the communities

244
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,880
who are literally dying
at twice the rate

245
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,360
because they're being
vaccinated at half the pace.

246
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:03,317
But the people
who showed up...

247
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,710
Can be rescheduled.

248
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,233
If they can show up
at a moment's notice today,

249
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,192
they'll have no problem
showing up tomorrow.

250
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,585
Please don't do this.

251
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,239
Reed, no one is safe
until everyone is safe.

252
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,067
These vaccines expire
in six hours.

253
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,678
Four.

254
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:21,118
How are we feeling,
Mr. Osheyevsky?

255
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:24,425
Leave me alone.
Look, I have to ask.

256
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,167
Do you have any idea
how something as toxic

257
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,558
as dioxin ended up
in your bloodstream?

258
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,696
They want me dead.

259
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,227
Who wants you dead,
Mr. Osheyevsky?

260
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,446
Dr. Bloom?
Mr. Osheyevsky's son is here.

261
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,927
Okay.
I don't have a son.

262
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,802
Dr. Mendez to ER 1.

263
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,455
Okay.

264
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:59,199
Uh, have Mr. Osheyevsky's
visitor tested,

265
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,766
and I will meet him
in the waiting area.

266
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,202
Will do, Dr. Bloom.

267
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,118
Casey, move Mr. Osheyevsky
to the procedure room.

268
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:08,469
Close the blinds and stay
with him until further notice.

269
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,950
You think he's in danger?
Just as a precaution.

270
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,604
Sweet.

271
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,218
Oh, the exhibit
sounds exceptional.

272
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,655
It is.

273
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,482
I love Magritte anyway,
but the Briton stuff...

274
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,355
Sorry.
I'll wait in your office?

275
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,966
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Mina, come join us.

276
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,489
This is Alex Dorsett.

277
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:29,752
She's on our board
at the hospital.

278
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,014
Hello, Mina.

279
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,406
Your aunt's been telling me
all about you.

280
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,060
As I mentioned,
Alex is on our board,

281
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,584
but she also happens to be
the undergraduate dean

282
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,499
of Columbia University.

283
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,725
M... um, s...

284
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,987
Mina?

285
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:49,119
I told you
I wasn't staying in New York.

286
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,163
Yeah, it doesn't hurt
just to...

287
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,121
You invited me here
for lunch.

288
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,731
This is an ambush.

289
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,037
No, this is me caring about
you and wanting to help you.

290
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,299
I already told you
I don't want your help.

291
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,692
No, you told me

292
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,128
that you don't want me
writing you a letter.

293
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,390
Because letters are supposed
to come from people

294
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,696
who know you.

295
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,002
You obviously
don't know me at all.

296
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,314
Well, Kiri's chest X-ray

297
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,708
and CT scans
aren't what I hoped for.

298
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,884
Her lungs seem to be failing.
Why?

299
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,407
I don't know yet,
but we started her

300
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,670
on a cocktail of antibiotics
to help fight infection.

301
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:19,976
At least she's
not rejecting the heart.

302
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,455
That's your takeaway?

303
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,196
Just trying to find something
to hold on to, Ted.

304
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,198
Kiri.

305
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,852
Honey.
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,898
Oh, it's okay, baby.

307
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,073
Oh.
Floyd?

308
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,814
Excuse me.

309
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,164
Kiri, does this hurt?

310
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,777
Okay, just relax.

311
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,041
It's okay.
What's happening?

312
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,393
Her liver is failing
as well.

313
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,662
I went to the hospital
to see you,

314
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,927
but I found out you were sick,
and I got scared

315
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,056
because I really need
to talk to you.

316
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,323
You need to talk
to me about what?

317
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,713
This.

318
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,417
A restraining order's
pretty harsh, Dr. Frome.

319
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,072
And you're violating it
right now...

320
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,815
And you need to leave.

321
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,296
But...

322
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,776
but don't you want me
to get better?

323
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,952
Of course
I want you to get better.

324
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,347
But I can't help you.

325
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,313
And you need
to leave right now,

326
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,444
or I will call the police.

327
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,055
Sit down!

328
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,930
You're gonna help me.

329
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,933
Dr. Frome,
I need you to help me.

330
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,633
I'm not better.

331
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,288
You promised I'd get better,
but you lied.

332
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,943
Chance, please.
My father lied too.

333
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:03,514
He said he wouldn't hurt me,

334
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,470
but... he did.

335
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:11,304
And when I cried,
he called me weak

336
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,916
and damaged goods,

337
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,961
and...

338
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,918
no one in the house
would help me.

339
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:24,274
No one,
which is why I did what I did.

340
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:33,457
Chance,
your family died in a fire...

341
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,546
that you set by accident.

342
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,386
Guys, I'm telling you,

343
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,866
this vaccine
is so worth it, okay?

344
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,954
We don't even know
who you are.

345
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,129
Sorry, I told you

346
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,565
I'm the medical director
at New Amsterdam.

347
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,088
New Amsterdam?
Yeah.

348
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,873
You guys tried to sue me
when I was late on my bill.

349
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,962
No, no,
we don't do that anymore.

350
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:03,443
Tuskegee,
Henrietta Lacks, antebellum.

351
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,489
You've had a lifetime
to earn my trust,

352
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,013
and you never even tried.
Why should I trust you now?

353
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,493
Sickle cell anemia
screenings,

354
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:12,191
forced sterilization,
night doctors.

355
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,845
So you want to give me
one shot now,

356
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,151
another in four weeks,

357
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,153
and then I got to come back in
for a booster?

358
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,459
I got no money.
I got no house.

359
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:23,115
All I got is a history
of you killing us,

360
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,769
and I still got the vaccine.

361
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,292
Wait?
You did?

362
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:29,165
I don't trust you,
but I trust the science.

363
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,167
I got the shot last month.

364
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,865
Save your breath.
I'm already vaccinated.

365
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:34,953
Even though you sued me,

366
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,999
I still got the vaccine
from you.

367
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,044
I hear there are soldiers
refusing the shot.

368
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,480
I hear there's
doctors and nurses

369
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,526
that don't want the vaccine.
Heard that too.

370
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,267
If you're looking
for holdouts,

371
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,051
you should check
your own backyard.

372
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,970
Ben Osheyevsky?
Yes, hi.

373
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,711
Hi.
How's my father?

374
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,366
Can I see some ID?

375
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,886
Of course.

376
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,937
Oh, I must have left
my wallet in the car.

377
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,286
My wife couldn't find
a parking spot,

378
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,027
so I just hopped out and ran.

379
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,637
Is he okay?

380
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,640
I need to see some ID.

381
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,165
I need to confirm
that you're family.

382
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,121
Well, who else would I be?

383
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,128
How did you know
that your father was here?

384
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,913
I called every hospital
in the city.

385
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,742
Well, my patient is saying
that he doesn't have a son.

386
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,142
Well, he does.

387
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:36,362
Ben, I had to park
four blocks away,

388
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,061
and the meter was broken,
and then I had to get tested.

389
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,149
You left your wallet.

390
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,506
You thought his dad was a spy?

391
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,729
I know it sounds crazy,

392
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,254
but, well,
he said he didn't have a son,

393
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,430
and while I don't usually

394
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,085
suspect my patients
of espionage,

395
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,174
this particular drug...

396
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:09,134
How was he poisoned?
We don't know yet.

397
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,267
My father was a tailor
who spent 50 years

398
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,443
in the garment district.
We hardly ever saw him.

399
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,835
If he was a spy,

400
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,357
at least we might have had
some cool stories.

401
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,623
I know he's upset

402
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,104
because we've been
looking into homes for him,

403
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,190
but he's never
wandered off before.

404
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:33,985
Where is he?

405
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,248
Uh, just give me a second.

406
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:56,743
What?

407
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,708
First her lungs,
then her liver,

408
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,623
now her kidneys.
Yeah.

409
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,451
I don't want to put Kiri
through any more operations,

410
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,018
but that may be
our only option.

411
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,151
Will she at least be on
the top of the transplant list?

412
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,109
How many more surgeries
can she take?

413
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,371
What do you want to do?
Nothing?

414
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:15,110
Okay, guys, can we...
Can we go outside?

415
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,903
I just want to make a plan.

416
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,123
And I don't want her
to be in any more pain.

417
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,734
Our daughter
is going to die, Ted.

418
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,255
Guys, guys.

419
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,043
The only thing
that's gonna get you

420
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,871
through this again
is each other.

421
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,047
Dr. Malloy, call 247.

422
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,877
We're separated.

423
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,358
Five months now.

424
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:43,968
Ironic, isn't it?

425
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,926
The first minute that Kiri
doesn't have any problems,

426
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,059
we find out that we do.

427
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,714
Excuse me.
Sorry.

428
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,020
Dr. Reynolds,
can I have a word, please?

429
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,202
Please tell me
you have good news.

430
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,293
Our request to put Kiri
on the transplant list

431
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,643
has been rejected.

432
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,428
With multiple organ failures,

433
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:12,214
they don't see her
as a viable candidate.

434
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,046
How are they holding up?
They're not.

435
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,313
They've been
through so much together.

436
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,835
I mean, I really thought
nothing could break them.

437
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,276
They had the perfect family.

438
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,106
There's no such thing.

439
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:47,162
So your dad hurt you.

440
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,076
You said that he called you
"damaged goods"?

441
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,264
Chance, I can barely
get to the bathroom.

442
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:05,136
I'm not... I'm not
gonna run anywhere.

443
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:09,355
You asked me
if I want you to get better.

444
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,187
I do.
I really do.

445
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,277
Um, you need to help me.
You need to...

446
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:19,629
My whole family
knew what he was doing...

447
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:26,502
But they still let it happen.

448
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,902
So...

449
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,687
I shouldn't feel guilty
for what I did, but...

450
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,039
I get it.
No, no, you don't.

451
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,127
You can't!
I do.

452
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,346
How?
How?

453
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,000
How can you know
what this feels like?

454
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,307
Because...

455
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,830
I killed someone too.

456
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,885
I fully support
the vaccine effort.

457
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,453
I think Operation Warp Speed
has been a tremendous success.

458
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,194
Thank God.
I thought you were gonna say...

459
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,633
Personally, I didn't get it.
No, Todd, why?

460
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:08,982
I've chosen to wait.
Till when?

461
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,636
Everyone you know
is dead or dying?

462
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,985
May I speak freely?
Of course.

463
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,031
Without your
liberal condescension?

464
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,685
Maybe.

465
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,904
I have
no underlying health issues.

466
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,429
I've been fortunate
to primarily work from home,

467
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,648
so I've decided to wait
till the end of the line.

468
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,346
But this is
the end of the line.

469
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,957
Millions of people have
already been safely vaccinated.

470
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,089
To keep waiting now
would just be insane.

471
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,308
It would be crazy.
It would be...

472
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm sorry.
I tried.

473
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,093
Whatever happened
to my body, my choice?

474
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,486
Well,
it's not just your body.

475
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,228
Not getting the vaccine
could hurt someone else...

476
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,795
My daughter.

477
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,405
Fair point.
Really?

478
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,669
Sure, I'm pretty open-minded,
unlike some people I know.

479
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:46,193
Fair point.
Look.

480
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,195
All I'm saying is
that a lot of the conservatives

481
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,372
that I work with
still have questions.

482
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,417
Conservatives are here
in this hospital?

483
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,853
I hate to burst your bubble.

484
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:56,639
Unvaccinated?
Some.

485
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:57,901
Who?

486
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,511
Are you asking me
to name names?

487
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,075
No, uh... no, Todd.

488
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,604
We're never gonna have
herd immunity,

489
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:09,869
we're never gonna be safe
until everyone is vaccinated.

490
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,523
But I'm not part of a herd.

491
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:12,829
I'm an individual

492
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,483
allowed to make
individual decisions

493
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,223
for my own health care.

494
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,531
But you were also a soldier,

495
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:20,924
part of a unit.

496
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,447
You fought alongside
other people whose beliefs

497
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,493
and opinions may have
been different than yours,

498
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,711
but you fought as one.

499
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,409
That's all
I'm asking you to do.

500
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,933
I have 1,000 vaccines
ready to go

501
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,413
and only one hour
to deliver them

502
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:35,852
to I don't know who,
so I'm asking you, please,

503
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,723
to round up as many holdouts
as you can

504
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,029
and meet me
in the conference room.

505
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,727
I'm asking you
to fight with me...

506
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,818
So we can try to get back
some of what we lost.

507
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,436
I have been looking
all over for you.

508
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,916
Casey, what the hell
is going on?

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,744
What's going on
is that I was right.

510
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:02,963
Mr. Osheyevsky is a spy.
Well, was a spy.

511
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:07,187
You're serious?
And not just a regular spy.

512
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm talking, like,
a KGB double agent for the CIA.

513
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,496
It's the best day of my life.

514
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:18,895
Could you,
uh, give us a minute?

515
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,157
Oh, for sure.

516
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,724
I'll be the lookout.

517
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,165
KGB, huh?

518
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,650
The dioxin was yours.

519
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,307
I would rather die

520
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,875
than be sent to some home
like my son wants.

521
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,530
I am nothing
but a burden to him.

522
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:55,018
Is it possible
that he feels that way

523
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,412
because he never really knew
who you were?

524
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,502
It was my job
to keep secrets.

525
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:01,633
I understand...

526
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,507
But is it still?

527
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,775
Dr. Reynolds?

528
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,994
Where are we?
She's in respiratory arrest.

529
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,346
O2 stats are down to 84.
I'm gonna intubate.

530
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,827
Prepping intubation kit now.
Oh, baby.

531
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,916
I don't know what's happening.

532
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,701
Your body's
not rejecting your heart.

533
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,093
No, just everything else.

534
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,180
Floyd.

535
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,097
Her blood type,
you said it was AB.

536
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,540
Guys, think back
to four or five weeks ago.

537
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,019
Did Kiri get sick or...

538
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,021
I don't think so.
No, she had that stomachache.

539
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,023
About a month ago,
but it wasn't...

540
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,677
Lisa, get me tacrolimus
and methotrexate.

541
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,200
What's happening?

542
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,855
Hopefully Kiri's more
extraordinary than I thought.

543
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,469
Okay, what do you see?

544
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,906
Okay, it looks
like she had E. coli,

545
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,908
but this complication
is so rare...

546
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,692
But?
We were right.

547
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,172
Her blood type's changed.

548
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,869
She's not AB anymore.
Nope.

549
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,263
She is type O,
same as her new heart.

550
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,656
Which explains why
her body's rejecting

551
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,876
everything but the heart,
so if I bombard her

552
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,748
with immunosuppressants...

553
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,227
Go!

554
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,707
Go take care of our girl.

555
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:25,587
Max?
Todd?

556
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,156
Come in.

557
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,550
Wow, everybody, come on in.

558
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,770
Uh, you can
get set up right here.

559
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,860
Thank you all for coming.
But seriously, thank you.

560
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,252
You're welcome.

561
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,385
Uh, okay, everyone just...
Let's form a line,

562
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,343
and we'll be with you
in one second.

563
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,477
Thank you so much.
Okay, we're gonna do this.

564
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,741
Okay, there we go.

565
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,398
Um, you're the man, Todd.

566
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,269
You'll just feel
a little pinch.

567
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:57,836
Max?

568
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,537
Yeah.

569
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,974
Don't say it.
Max, I'm sorry, but...

570
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,452
Max?

571
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,894
I'm sorry, sir.
We're too late.

572
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,460
I don't understand.

573
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,811
These vaccines have expired.
They're no good anymore.

574
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,334
Just now?

575
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,031
But a minute can't
make a difference, can it?

576
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:22,644
There are regulations.
I'm sorry, Todd.

577
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,780
Sorry, everyone.
We're out of time.

578
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,801
His name was Tobias.

579
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,455
Toby.

580
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,239
He was two years
younger than me.

581
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,154
He was definitely the favorite.

582
00:27:55,238 --> 00:28:00,069
He was handsome,
confident, skinny.

583
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,990
I was...

584
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,601
I was me.

585
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,343
I could have cured cancer,

586
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,560
and it wouldn't have been
enough for our old man.

587
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:18,221
But Toby,
oh, Toby could do no wrong.

588
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,698
He was a golden boy.

589
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,530
So it was prom night,

590
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,530
um, senior year.

591
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,580
And Toby
was with Jenny Harmeyer,

592
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,801
queen of the cool kids,
and he'd rented a tux

593
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:36,192
and a limo and the whole show.

594
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,202
Um, I was up watching TV

595
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:46,463
when they came home late,
drunk.

596
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:51,817
They were kissing
and laughing and teasing me.

597
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,385
Making fun of the fat brother.

598
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:01,786
I just...
I hated the way he treated me,

599
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,702
especially in front
of other people,

600
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,138
in front of Jenny.

601
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,928
So that night...

602
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,147
I'd had enough, you know?

603
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:21,284
I called out
to our parents upstairs

604
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,242
to wake 'em up,

605
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,372
knowing that he would be busted
for drinking.

606
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,554
He was so pissed,
but what could he do?

607
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:34,079
He just... he snatched up
our mom's keys off the table,

608
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,691
and they went back out again.

609
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,784
Made it about two blocks
before he broadsided a truck.

610
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,614
No seat belts.

611
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,052
They both
went through the windshield.

612
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,968
Jenny lived, and Toby died
on the way to the hospital.

613
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,186
Iggy!

614
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,803
Oh, I'm gonna go get the kids.
You want anything?

615
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,195
Uh...

616
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,679
Yeah, some soup.

617
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,941
Sure, what kind?

618
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,511
Lentil...

619
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:17,688
from that little place I like
on 9th and 11th.

620
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,955
You got it.
Okay.

621
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,612
You could have
told him I was here.

622
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,745
How would that have helped?

623
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,404
I want to help you.

624
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,499
Tomorrow afternoon,

625
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,631
I'm gonna go
down to the courthouse,

626
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,285
and I'm gonna get this revoked,

627
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,762
but you have
to promise me one thing.

628
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:55,291
I need you to meet me
at my office tomorrow

629
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,946
at 3:00 p.m. sharp...

630
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,034
and we're gonna pick up
your treatment

631
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,467
exactly where we left off.

632
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,427
Are you gonna tell anyone
I was here?

633
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,129
No.

634
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,824
Not even Martin?
No, not even Martin.

635
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,831
This is between me
and you, okay?

636
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:21,705
Thank you, Dr. Frome.

637
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,757
Now, go before my family
gets back with my soup.

638
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,818
Stop right there!
Don't move!

639
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,914
Listen, don't move.

640
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,785
Iggy?
Iggy!

641
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,224
I got you.
I got you.

642
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,923
You're okay.

643
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,709
I got you.
I got you.

644
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:13,891
Dada.

645
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,372
Dada!
Dada, hi.

646
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,069
Hi, Dada.

647
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,289
Hi.

648
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,678
Dada, hi.

649
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,203
Thought I might
find you up here.

650
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:29,034
Dada.
Dada.

651
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,390
Dada, hi.

652
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,867
Dada!

653
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,404
Max...

654
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:49,924
do you want some advice?

655
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:52,971
I'll take it.

656
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,105
You fight for her, Max.

657
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,069
Fight for her.

658
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,508
It feels like
all I do is fight.

659
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,470
This morning,
I had 1,000 vaccines

660
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,037
and a line of people
ready to take 'em,

661
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,126
and that wasn't enough for me.

662
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,172
I wanted to aim higher,
do better,

663
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:21,390
so because I was stupid...

664
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,005
Nobody got 'em.

665
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,488
Because I had to fight.

666
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:38,538
That wasn't really
a punch line.

667
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,892
When have you ever not wanted
all of us to aim higher?

668
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,899
To fight?

669
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,898
It's all a fight.

that part of me

out of that courtroom,

never see Luna again.

00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:53,252

And that is that I will never
stop fighting for my daughter.

797
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:09,399
I will fight for her
until the day I die...

798
