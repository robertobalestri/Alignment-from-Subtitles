1
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,625
Hey.

2
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,720
Drawer's empty.

3
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:22,908
You didn't have to do that.

4
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:24,015
Oh, I didn't.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,093
Uh. Most of these drawers have
been empty since I moved in.

6
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,996
How's that?

7
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,859
Subtle.

8
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,828
Your place is so...
spare.

9
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,328
I just thought...

10
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,046
What?

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,815
It was intentional.

12
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:55,890
It's not.

Hey, Gwen.

22
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,586
Could you sing faster?

23
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:31,954
We're late
for our pre-nap walk.

24
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,096
Yeah, sure.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,485
Oh, speaking of sleep,

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,125
I'm gonna be done
by 7:00 tonight,

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,906
so I will have time to read
and put Luna to bed.

28
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,524
- Right.
- No, no. I'm serious.

29
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,007
Gwen, on the dot.

30
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,140
Kids need routine, Max.

31
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,368
- That's all.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,371
Which is what
I'm trying to do.

33
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,026
<i>Well, I...
I know you're trying.</i>

34
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,016
We all know you're trying.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,241
If there's something
you want to say, Gwen...

36
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,405
See you at 7:00, Max.

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,531
I will see you at 7:00.

38
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,765
Oh, morning.

39
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,452
Your school called.

40
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:24,484
Again.

41
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,593
You skipped calculus this time.

42
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,382
That's 'cause I already took
calculus when I was in Iran.

43
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,702
School saw my records.
Why must I repeat?

44
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,546
It's the way it is, Mina.

45
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,953
Like my world history class'
take

46
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,804
on American hegemony?

47
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,202
This isn't a joke.

48
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,336
Under my roof, under my care,

49
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:49,093
which means
school, college, job.

50
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,074
Don't I get a vote?

51
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:55,359
If this were
a true democracy, then yes.

52
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,593
But since you've learned
the truth, no.

53
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,353
What's the first move?

54
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,172
My old job,
it's waiting for me.

55
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,116
Do they know
the reason you left?

56
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:17,343
Yes, I told them
everything.

57
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,757
Plus, I'm tight
with the foreman.

58
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,991
And, like, we're supposed
to trust you?

59
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,353
It's handled, okay?

60
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:24,094
Careful.
You sound triggered.

61
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:25,844
That happens out in
the streets, you are done-zo.

62
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:28,288
Give me the three names
on your phone list. Go.

63
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,109
- You got a place to live?
- Covered.

64
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,503
Covered ain't an answer,
primo.

65
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,284
- He ain't ready.
- I got seven people

66
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,155
on my phone list,
not just three.

67
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,820
All know my story.

68
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,902
I found a studio apartment.

69
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:41,600
It's under the A train,
which is perfect

70
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,777
because you literally
have to be crazy

71
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,241
to want live under the A train.

72
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:49,274
And if I lose my job,

73
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,654
my pad, or my temper,
I got backups.

74
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,421
- Yeah.
- I got a cousin.

75
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,953
She's got a
brownstone.

76
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,157
There's a bed in there
for me.

77
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,532
She's vaccinated,
in the program, and...

78
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,093
Okay, great, you got a plan.
Good.

79
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,677
What's your purpose?

80
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,754
Since the world doesn't care
about your plan,

81
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:06,320
what makes you think
you're ready?

82
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,632
I know the source
of my trauma.

83
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,546
My role in it.

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,890
The pain, which I've learned
to forgive myself for.

85
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:22,452
The healing, which I'm
an active participant in.

86
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:26,226
And I know the debt I owe
to those who've loved me,

87
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:28,421
starting with love
for self.

88
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,249
Oh, my God.

89
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,133
Chance Becker, everybody.

90
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:43,218
Ready for reentry.
Look at this guy.

91
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:47,827
Help!

92
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,265
Help! Help!

93
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,181
- What happened?
- Drive-by.

94
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,316
My daughter got shot.

95
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,849
Pulse is weak and thready.
Get her to Trauma One!

96
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,928
Start two large bore IVs,
normal saline wide open.

97
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,596
Please, save her!

98
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,334
We're gonna do
the best we can.

99
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,153
Send crit, coags,
type and cross.

100
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,678
She's in hypovolemic shock.

101
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:13,202
About to hang a bag of O neg.

102
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,987
Probably a pumper in her chest.

103
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,163
Another shooting,
another child.

104
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,231
Where's the bleeder?

105
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:23,842
- Come on.
- Dr. Bloom.

106
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,124
Cardiac arrest just rolled in.

107
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,010
- You got this?
- Go.

108
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,716
V-fib arrest on transport.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,500
Shocked three times
with no response.

110
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,374
Okay, push high dose epi.

111
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,624
Clear.

112
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,931
She's back.

113
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,638
Let's take her to Bay 30.

114
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,671
Headed to the OR.

115
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,571
- Who do we have here?
- Corona test negative.

116
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,124
Robin Perez, 61.

117
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,519
Blurred vision, dizziness,
and low blood pressure.

118
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,976
Now, why does that
sound familiar?

119
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,631
Same symptoms
as the two sisters

120
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:14,416
we just moved to Bay 23 and 24.

121
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,288
And the guy over in 26.

122
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:17,827
Dolores?

123
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,460
- What you doing here?
- I don't even know.

124
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,801
I got dizzy,
and then I was gone.

125
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,283
- Aw.
- Hey, ladies.

126
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,247
It's Bruce.

127
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,944
- From 425?
- Oh.

128
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,510
Is Miss Vera with you?

129
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,797
Miss Vera?
No.

130
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,644
Did you see Mr. Olenchalk

131
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,732
from the fifth floor?

132
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,094
Oh, I am right here.

133
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,405
What the heck is going on?

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,489
Wait, so you all
know each other?

135
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,210
We live in the same building.

136
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:49,222
It happened so fast,
I... I couldn't really see.

137
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:52,966
I mean, it was such a blur,
but maybe Black or Latino?

138
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,316
I don't know.
His hoodie was hiding his face.

139
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,622
Oh, my God! Allison!

140
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,058
- Ma'am, ma'am!
- Mommy's here.

141
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,668
I need you to keep your
mask on until you're tested.

142
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,974
Look, we're going to the OR.

143
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,279
The bullet's lodged
near her spine.

144
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:04,585
We're gonna do everything
we can.

145
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,109
We'll keep you posted.

146
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,922
This is what happens
when you defund the police.

147
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:15,099
We've got more fake
coronavirus cures out there.

148
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,077
- How do you know?
- Because a patient suffering

149
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,167
from acute cardiotoxic
poisoning had this on her.

150
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,430
Rona-Vaxx?
Nice name.

151
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:23,736
"All natural, organic.

152
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,086
"Made from the petals and stems

153
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,234
of the cascabela thevetia
flower."

154
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,452
Yellow oleander.

155
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:32,744
A plant that's toxic to, you know,
all living vertebrates.

156
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,137
I guess "Drink this,
and you die"

157
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,965
doesn't really fit
on the poster.

158
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,967
First, it was the
essential silver toothpaste,

159
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:39,752
then the aromatherapy oils

160
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,275
that actually cause
lung inflammation.

161
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,669
And who can forget that surge
of patients brought in

162
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:45,296
to my ED after drinking bleach?

163
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,561
Actual bleach.
Now this.

164
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,346
Yeah, another case
of disinformation.

165
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,696
If only it were one case.

166
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:52,843
They targeted
a low-income building

167
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,538
in East Harlem
with these flyers.

168
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,366
Hundreds of residents.
They're getting worse.

169
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,520
How many more didn't come in?

170
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,210
How many more
might be poisoned?

171
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,812
Okay, team, two goals.

172
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,032
We're gonna go door-to-door.

173
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,339
Any resident
who has ingested Rona-Vaxx,

174
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:38,680
we immediately escort them
to an ambulance.

175
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,813
If somebody has bought
and not yet ingested it,

176
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:43,337
the Department of Health
will meet them to exchange it

177
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,944
with a debit card on the spot.

178
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:47,167
Clear?
Great, let's roll.

179
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,690
Second floor, third floor.
Go.

180
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,078
- "Let's roll"?
- I don't know.

181
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,643
I was trying to fire people up.
No good?

182
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,830
Hi there, ma'am.

183
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:58,961
Do you live here?

184
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,223
What's it to you?

185
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,921
Oh, I just have a question
for you.

186
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,792
Did you buy any of this?

187
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,793
Sure did.

188
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,316
Man was wearing scrubs
like you.

189
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,491
Said he was a doctor.

190
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,227
Well, he wasn't.

191
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,713
- Oh, and I guess you are?
- Yeah, yeah.

192
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:13,236
I even brought my ambulance
to prove it.

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,789
You didn't ingest this,
though, did you?

194
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:15,671
Oh, no.

195
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,718
My son Nathan,
he lives in Buffalo.

196
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:20,156
He researched Rona-Vaxx
on the Internet

197
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,245
because we don't have it here,

198
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,856
and he said it was shady.

199
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,569
Well, I wish everyone
in your building had a Nathan.

200
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,235
As the current head
of the search committee

201
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:36,541
to find a new
chair of neurology,

202
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,992
it is incumbent upon me
to inform you that...

203
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,690
- You picked someone?
- Uh, no.

204
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,321
No, um, but that's only
because I haven't...

205
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,051
actually met with anyone yet.

206
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,356
- What?
- I know. I know.

207
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,562
I tried. I did.
I just... you know what it is?

208
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,391
I'm too close to it.
I...

209
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:51,829
I got emotional today
looking at résumés

210
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,657
that are still inside
of the envelopes.

211
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:56,661
That actually happened,
so I am appointing you

212
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,805
the interim head
of the search committee.

213
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,335
Ta-da!

214
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:03,888
But I'm already
the interim chair of neurology.

215
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,757
Exactly, that's how I know
you can handle it, so...

216
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,559
- Dr. Frome.
- Yeah?

217
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,991
I know it's hard,
but there's no doubt in my mind

218
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,688
that you're the person
who should be making

219
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,255
this incredibly
important decision

220
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,734
to replace Dr. Kapoor.

221
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,388
Mm-hmm, and the decision
I'm making

222
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:20,782
is that you should make it,
okay?

223
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:21,890
Uh, Dr. Frome?

224
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:23,859
Chance. Hi.

225
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,396
- Are you okay? What's going on?
- I... I hate to, uh...

226
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,399
Well, you know that old job I
talked about in group earlier?

227
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,476
- I do, yeah.
- Did that not work out?

228
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,653
No, they're actually
closing down.

229
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:36,234
I see.
That's... that's a bummer.

230
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,145
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

231
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,540
But thanks to our class,
I got resourceful.

232
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,585
I already found a new gig.

233
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,370
I just need
a character reference,

234
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:45,372
so would you mind?

235
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,374
Would I mind?
Here, give me that thing.

236
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,679
I truly appreciate it,
Dr. Frome.

237
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:49,942
Can I use your back?

238
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,046
Can I not be in charge
of the search committee?

239
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,472
- Here we go.
- Handled.

240
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,778
And, Chance, congratulations.
I'm proud of you.

241
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,476
Where's the...
Where's the new gig?

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,217
- Oh, you didn't see?
- No.

243
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,436
It's here.
At New Amsterdam.

244
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,479
First paycheck, lunch is on me.

245
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,402
Doesn't the American
Psychiatric Association

246
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,099
frown on being friends
with patients?

247
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:20,538
Mm-hmm, actively,
but we're not friends, so...

248
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:22,452
Does he know that?

249
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:25,398
Yeah.

250
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:26,564
And, girl,

251
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,827
when they played them slow jams

252
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,242
at the skating rink,

253
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:31,757
here comes Thom,

254
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:34,377
holding his hand out
like Billy Dee Williams.

255
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,694
"You want my arm to fall off?"

256
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,697
I couldn't help it.

257
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:43,079
So when I saw his face pop up
on our school reunion page,

258
00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:44,821
I couldn't help myself neither.

259
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,601
Miss Juanita just had
to reach out.

260
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:47,523
Had to.

261
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,352
I hadn't seen his face since

262
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,541
he joined the army
right after high school.

263
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,538
Well, her father
had something to do with that.

264
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,275
I told you,
we ain't going there.

265
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,012
But it's like
we just picked up

266
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,773
where we left off.

267
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,148
So what's next
for you two lovebirds?

268
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,788
Gonna make up for lost time.

269
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,051
Hit Route 66.

270
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,977
The Gateway Arch,

271
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,991
the Meramec Caverns,

272
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,559
Petrified Forest.

273
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,171
He's been promising me
that trip since we been kids.

274
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:19,382
I'm gonna fulfill it too.

275
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,922
Thomas,

276
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,174
uh, the bruising on your arm

277
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:25,022
and underneath

278
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,112
on your side here.

279
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,476
I know.

280
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:32,265
We've just been busy
catching up and whatnot.

281
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:34,154
I'd like to run some tests.

282
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,124
Tests for what,
Dr. Sharpe?

283
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:41,046
She thinks
my cancer is back.

284
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,718
- Lap pad.
- TS kit on the tray.

285
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,587
Okay, that should do it
for the bleeder.

286
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,545
But if she has any hopes
of walking again,

287
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,538
we'll have
to take the bullet out.

288
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,853
Nurse, can you call
Dr. Salaita?

289
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,343
Will do.

290
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,030
Do you want
to update her family?

291
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,813
Yeah, but before I do,
will you take a look at this?

292
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,101
- Powder burns?
- Yeah.

293
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,327
And you see
that stippling there?

294
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,765
Seems inconsistent
for a drive-by.

295
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,507
This was close range.

296
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,796
I'm gonna call Social Services.

297
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,466
I can't believe I gotta go
to the hospital for this.

298
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,101
You all got the vaccine.

299
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,671
The rest of us
just do what we can.

300
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,066
We're gonna take good care
of you.

301
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,257
I promise.

302
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:40,563
Whole building's
accounted for.

303
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:41,852
We're taking 16 back with us,

304
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,226
and housing bought back
46 unused treatments.

305
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,489
Of snake oil.

306
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,362
It's like we're living
in the Wild West.

307
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,930
Well, these families
might as well be.

308
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,118
This building's located in
the middle of a Wi-Fi desert.

309
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:52,646
If you can't access
the Internet,

310
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,951
you can't debunk the snake oil.

311
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,953
And this is just
gonna keep happening.

312
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,655
Fake news, fake cures,
unless...

313
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,507
Unless we do something
about it.

314
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,992
Something like what?

315
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,009
We're gonna get
free broadband access

316
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,187
for every household
in New York City.

317
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:16,147
I mean, I've heard
of 4G and 5G but never no G.

318
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,726
Not in New York.
That's crazy!

319
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,716
And imagine what it's like
for people in rural areas

320
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,921
without broadband.

321
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,795
I mean, no wonder the virus hit
the way that it did.

322
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,546
Yeah.
What you got in the bag there?

323
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,952
- Oh, this?
- This is, uh...

324
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,308
this is my secret weapon
to fight injustice.

325
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:30,441
Oh, whoa.

326
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,139
And a secret it shall remain,
I guess.

327
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:34,476
Order up, Dr. Frome!

328
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,757
- Chance.
- Yeah.

329
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,611
It's one filthy chai,
just the way you like it.

330
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:38,962
- Five pumps, coconut milk.
- No, no.

331
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,104
I didn't... I didn't order this.

332
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,218
It's all good.
I got you.

333
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,304
Hey, next in line, please.

334
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,825
Your résumé and references
are...

335
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,531
impeccable.

336
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:52,923
I never thought
we'd find someone

337
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,751
to replace Dr. Kapoor, but I...

338
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,188
Thank you, Dr. Kao.

339
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:59,016
I've devoted my entire life
to the nervous system.

340
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,154
I see.

341
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,976
You were head of neurology
at Holy Cross in Houston

342
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,896
for 12 years.

343
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,010
Can I ask what brought you
to New York?

344
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,374
Simply put, regular
psychosocial stimulation

345
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,203
is good for your brain.

346
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,091
I believe it's essential.

347
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:14,982
I so agree!

348
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,862
Our senses deliver information
that's key to survival.

349
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:19,622
Exactly.

350
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,763
So how would you describe
your leadership style?

351
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:23,247
- I lead by example.
- Uh-huh.

352
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,960
Management should share
the same sacrifices

353
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:25,911
as their team does.

354
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:29,724
And I give each weekday
its own funky theme.

355
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:34,323
I'm sorry.
How do you mean?

356
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:36,051
Like Moon Tower Mondays,

357
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,144
basically '70s garb.

358
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,919
Tahiti Tuesdays.

359
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:43,234
Waikiki Wednesdays have
to be reconceived because

360
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,208
employees start recycling
their Tuesday outfits.

361
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,185
You want to guess Thursday?

362
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:52,833
No. I'm good.

363
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,872
How are you feeling, Sydney?

364
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,118
Tired.

365
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,833
So ridonkulous the Rona-Vaxx
made me this sick.

366
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:01,382
Actually, it's not,

367
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:04,386
because Rona-Vaxx is not
a real treatment for COVID.

368
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,301
Well, I'm just lucky
that my silver pills

369
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,044
didn't kick my butt like this.

370
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,959
You're taking silver pills
as well?

371
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,311
Yeah, only 'cause my dude
with the hydroxychloroquine

372
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:14,396
bailed upstate.

373
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,771
Hydroxychloroquine.

374
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:19,008
So you're taking all three of
these things at the same time?

375
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:22,193
And obvs it's working 'cause
I'm, like, COVID-free, right?

376
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,661
Okay.

377
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,457
Evan Nashton,
board member extraordinaire.

378
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,154
- You here for the big meeting?
- Oh, God.

379
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,112
- Not the suit.
- What? This old thing?

380
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,289
You only wear a suit when
you're trying to shake us down.

381
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:39,291
Shakedown?
Evan, I'm offended.

382
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,814
I mean, can't
the medical director

383
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,337
of New York's
largest public hospital

384
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:43,817
just have a friendly chat
with the CFO

385
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,427
of New York's
largest telecom company?

386
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,994
Just two old buddies gabbing,
huh?

387
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:48,778
Save it.
You have some idea.

388
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:51,346
I'm sure it's inspiring
and financially ruinous.

389
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,566
Do you know how many
households in New York City

390
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,176
- don't have broadband?
- 500,000.

391
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,031
- 5... oh.
- That's exactly right.

392
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,726
Now, wouldn't it be cool if you

393
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,586
hooked them up?

394
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,401
- "Hooked them up"?
- Yeah.

395
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:06,013
Free Internet for everybody.

396
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:08,723
Take the thing that
my company sells for money...

397
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,452
- Give it away for free.
- Right.

398
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:11,627
You know, when people

399
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,194
can't afford
their power bill,

400
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,370
Con Ed doesn't show up
with a new AC.

401
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:18,113
Broadband is the same,
a utility to be paid for.

402
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,247
Right, and if broadband
is a utility,

403
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,425
then it's like power
or clean water.

404
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,255
And shouldn't everyone
have access to that?

405
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,040
Think about it.
Telemedicine.

406
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,260
Prescription refills.

407
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,176
Our patients will be healthier!

408
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,353
Look, I applaud
your idealism...

409
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:34,746
No, no, I applaud yours,

410
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:36,785
like when you donated
free Internet

411
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,691
to impoverished areas
in sub-Saharan Africa.

412
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,781
You helped people in a desert

413
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,012
5,500 miles away.

414
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,637
Now, surely, Evan,

415
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,707
I think you can do
a little something

416
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,362
for the broadband desert
right here

417
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,175
in your own backyard.

418
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,120
I'll give you ten apartments.

419
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,644
17 housing projects.

420
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:59,213
One building, and you
don't speak to me for a year.

421
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:00,346
Done.
It's always a pleasure

422
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,410
to casually bump into you,
Evan.

423
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:10,770
Thomas, three years ago,
your leukemia was in remission.

424
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:15,125
But now your cancer
has mutated

425
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,941
into a new, aggressive form

426
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:21,089
that won't respond
to any of our treatments.

427
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,011
And...

428
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,597
if we tried another protocol?

429
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,917
I'm afraid there aren't any.

430
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:33,908
How much time does he have?

431
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:37,394
I may be able to get him
a couple of extra months.

432
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:39,889
Good ones.
Good ones.

433
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:42,239
You'll need to come
to the hospital every few days

434
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:43,980
for blood transfusions
to stave off...

435
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,847
I can start all that
when we get back from our trip.

436
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,567
No, no.

437
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,789
Thomas, in order to get
those extra couple of months,

438
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,619
we need to start
the transfusions immediately.

439
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,230
That means staying here
in New York.

440
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,273
No Route 66.

441
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,434
Well, if I only have
a little time left,

442
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,392
then each day
is going to count.

443
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,136
We're taking this trip.

444
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,666
Without the transfusions,

445
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,323
your pain will be excruciating.

446
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:17,870
You'll begin vomiting blood

447
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:19,842
as your body breaks down
on itself.

448
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,714
That will occur
within a matter of days,

449
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:23,846
which means you will bleed out

450
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,153
in some motel
in the middle of nowhere.

451
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:29,465
Is that how you want
your love story to end?

452
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,904
Social Services?

453
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,609
The wound was close range,
all right?

454
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,306
It wasn't a drive-by.

455
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,482
And I have an obligation...

456
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,615
We only had that gun a month,
okay?

457
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,823
Allison must have found it
when she...

458
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:58,978
It wasn't my husband's fault.

459
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,885
Then why make up some story?

460
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:03,940
Just tell me how she is.

461
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,940
She's stable.

462
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,579
But in order
to take the bullet out,

463
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:12,320
she's gonna need
a riskier procedure

464
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,538
and it's gonna take
some more time.

465
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:20,151
It was the demonstrations.

466
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,893
Black Lives Matter.

467
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,635
The protestors.

468
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:28,244
We were scared.

469
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:29,924
You saw the news.

470
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,932
They were smashing windows,
burning property,

471
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,221
beating people up.

472
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,377
We just wanted
to protect ourselves.

473
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,573
But apparently,
not all lives matter.

474
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:46,119
It's your daughter.

475
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,982
Um, excuse me, everybody?

476
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,546
Can I get everybody's...

477
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,199
Can I... can I get... can I, um...

478
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,182
Hey!
Listen up!

479
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,273
Wow, loud.
Thank you.

480
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,797
So I have some news.

481
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,495
You are all here

482
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,559
because you were sold a lie.

483
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,354
A fake cure.

484
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:13,171
Disinformation
that you couldn't debunk

485
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:15,588
because you didn't have access
to the correct information.

486
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:16,829
Until today.

487
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,830
Hold on to your nasal cannulas.

488
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,703
Everybody is getting
free broadband access.

489
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,002
- Really?
- What is that?

490
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:23,729
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

491
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:24,894
How the hell
you pull that off?

492
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:26,908
- Don't say the suit.
- Can't deny the suit.

493
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,738
Is this a "fell off the back
of the truck" situation?

494
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,252
No, totally legit.

495
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:31,776
Where do we pick up
our computers?

496
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,480
Uh, well, I didn't get
any computers.

497
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,657
That's a'ight.
Tablets are way cooler anyway.

498
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,378
Yeah.
Yeah, they are.

499
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,293
But I didn't get
any of those either.

500
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,471
You think everybody's
got smartphones?

501
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:43,698
Uh, I guess...

502
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:46,615
So basically, he got us gas
but no stove.

503
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,183
- Oh, that makes sense.
- This guy.

504
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,731
I understand it now.

505
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:51,777
What did you get us?

506
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,979
What do I do with that?
I ain't got no phone.

507
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:59,690
Alexis Luther,
my favorite board member.

508
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,090
- No.
- No?

509
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:02,396
I didn't even say hi yet.

510
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,354
I'm familiar with the suit,
Max.

511
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,226
And I'm impervious
to whatever you think

512
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,010
its powers of persuasion are.

513
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,272
No, no, I'm just here
to tell you

514
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:10,883
that you are no longer
on the board

515
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,928
of America's
greatest public hospital.

516
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,234
- What?
- Sorry. Sorry.

517
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:15,627
To be clear,
you're still on the board,

518
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,194
but we are no longer
America's greatest hospital.

519
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:19,544
See, you remember
when you gave us

520
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:22,068
those computers and laptops
from your company?

521
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:23,722
You said they were
state-of-the-art,

522
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:27,203
but my doctors are telling me
they're pieces of junk, okay?

523
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:28,596
But they don't use
the word "junk."

524
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,989
That's impossible.

525
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,730
Just ten months ago,
it was top-of-the-line tech.

526
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:34,602
Right, but in an IT eval
with two dozen other hospitals,

527
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,951
we came in dead last.

528
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:37,866
Isn't that right, Dr. Frome?

529
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,433
Our computers are outdated,
right?

530
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,261
Oh, gosh, I mean,
you know, maybe

531
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:43,132
a little tricky at first,
but now they're awesome...

532
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,743
Now they're struggling.

533
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:47,180
I mean, you were just telling
me about that graphics issue.

534
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,617
Um, I don't really
use graphics for much, so...

535
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,617
No, no, you don't, 'cause
they're pretty much unusable.

536
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:56,231
Oh, I see.

537
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:58,209
- Dr. Frome, you're very polite.
- Thank you.

538
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,733
We can't let courtesy

539
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:01,432
impede this hospital's
public standing.

540
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:02,542
100% agree.

541
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:03,675
Totally.
Yep. What he said.

542
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,459
How many new units
are we talking?

543
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:08,723
Ooh, I don't know.
Maybe three, four...

544
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,201
Thousand.

545
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:13,496
- Yeah.
- 3,000 or 4,000.

546
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:16,151
400 is the best I can do.

547
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:17,284
Sold.

548
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,679
I... thank you.
Thank you, Alexis.

549
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:20,807
That's very generous.

550
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:22,201
Always nice
to casually bump into you.

551
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,160
Yes, very good to see you.

552
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,206
Why would you do that to me?
That was terrifying.

553
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:27,784
- My computers are fine.
- I know. I know.

554
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:30,657
But the board would never agree
to donate new computers

555
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,252
to a random building full
of low-income residents, so...

556
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:35,663
But if we got 400 new ones,
we would have

557
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,542
400 perfectly good used ones
that suddenly need a new home.

558
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,979
I was right there with you.
I got it.

559
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,372
Why are you dressed
like James Bond?

560
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:43,503
I'd tell you, but then I'd...
have to kill you.

561
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,515
Please have a seat.

562
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:53,784
May I have a Perrier?

563
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:55,948
Oh, we don't
actually have that.

564
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,292
Ah.

565
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:04,865
Dr. Kao running late?

566
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,086
Oh, my God.
I'm Dr. Kao.

567
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,522
Sorry, it's a short last name

568
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,350
that tends to get lost
in introductions.

569
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,738
You're
Dr. Agnes Kao?

570
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,496
I am.

571
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,113
You're 12.

572
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,152
I wish.

573
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,109
Well, not 12, but...

574
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:26,409
I'm older than I look.

575
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,847
You're interviewing me
for the position

576
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,328
of chair of neurology?

577
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,182
I'm trying to.

578
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:38,886
I don't hear any questions.

579
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,433
Sydney, can you hear me?

580
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:47,121
I'm barely getting a pulse.

581
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,643
- Heart rate's 20 and dropping.
- Damn it.

582
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:51,782
One milligram of atropine.
IV push.

583
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,490
Heart rate's 45 and climbing.

584
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,411
What... what's happening?

585
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:12,588
You're okay, Sydney.
You're okay.

586
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,414
Knew I should have never came
to the hospital

587
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:15,894
in the first place.

588
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,460
I'm only getting sicker.

589
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:20,115
Okay, try to relax.
Take deep breaths for me.

590
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,638
I'm just saying.

591
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:24,634
I never needed that machine
before today.

592
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,915
Okay.

593
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,571
Dialysis cleared the Rona-Vaxx
poison out of her blood,

594
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:40,360
but her EKG is still showing
low voltage and pseudo-infarct.

595
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:41,710
That doesn't make much sense.

596
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:44,697
Unless she was born
with cardiac amyloidosis.

597
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,143
- An autoimmune disorder?
- Well, think about it.

598
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,666
It'll cause heart palpitations,
fatigue, shortness of breath.

599
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,278
Making her think
she had COVID.

600
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,845
While masking
her real issues.

601
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,191
Page cardio, stat.

602
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:01,286
Now what?

603
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,376
Heart rate's skyrocketing.
BP plummeting.

604
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,420
- Bleeder?
- No.

605
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:05,552
Surgical fields are clean.

606
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:07,285
- Septic?
- No fever. No white count.

607
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,801
- Med reaction?
- No rash.

608
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:14,496
There.
Left ventricular thrombus.

609
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,099
That is a massive clot
in her heart.

610
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:18,024
Yeah, that explains why
her blood pressure's so low.

611
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,484
If we don't do something,
she's not gonna make it.

612
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,744
Clamp.

613
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:25,964
Scalpel.

614
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:37,064
Chance, hi.
What...

615
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:38,909
- Oh, hey.
- What are you doing?

616
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:41,582
It's day-old muffins, and...

617
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:43,136
Yeah. No, no.
That's...

618
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,746
- They're not that stale.
- No, Chance.

619
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,223
This is, um...

620
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:52,319
Uh, I need you to hear me,
okay?

621
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,486
I need you to really hear me.

622
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:59,073
Um, our relationship is very,

623
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:01,346
very important to me,

624
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:03,591
which means that it needs
to be protected.

625
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:05,811
That's why we have
structured sessions, right?

626
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,030
We arrange a time and a place
to meet,

627
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:09,875
we meet up, we share.

628
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,993
It's great, but it's safe.

629
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:13,796
And it's protected.

630
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:17,516
But in order for our
relationship to be effective,

631
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:21,134
we can't... we can't have
this kind of casual contact.

632
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,523
Do you understand?

633
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,337
That means no muffins,
no free chais,

634
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,095
no popping in to say hello.

635
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:29,340
I'm just talking about
boundaries here, Chance.

636
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:32,664
I... yeah.

637
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,401
Okay.

638
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:37,364
Well, it's just,

639
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:40,088
you're the closest thing
to family I have.

640
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,196
But I'm not your family.

641
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:45,503
I am your therapist.

642
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,896
That's it.

643
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:51,112
You know, which...
You know, that's...

644
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,074
I have the same relationship
with all my patients.

645
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:56,383
The same rules apply, you know?

646
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,080
I feel bad that
I wasn't more clear.

647
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:00,427
- I think it's my fault.
- No. No, I get it.

648
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:04,072
Thanks, Dr. Frome.

649
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:12,687
Now,

650
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:17,171
I like to pride myself
on listening to my patients,

651
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:18,797
so...

652
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:24,803
This is your Route 66 road map.

653
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:28,297
These red dots here, these are
your stops along the way.

654
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,665
Now, here, when you get to your
beloved Meramec Caverns,

655
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,290
you'll call Dr. Dutton
in Branson.

656
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,688
He'll have a bag of platelets
waiting for you.

657
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:39,553
Oh, my God.

658
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,255
And then...

659
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,562
in Albuquerque,
next to the Petrified Forest,

660
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:47,303
is Dr. Cho,
who will take care of you.

661
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,784
And then it's on
to the Grand Canyon,

662
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:53,419
where you'll stop at Flagstaff
and meet Dr. Perlin.

663
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,488
So each red dot has
a transfusion center?

664
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,411
Think of them more as,
um, pit stops along the way.

665
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:04,903
But it is absolutely crucial

666
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,976
that you stick to this route.

667
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,109
Okay?

668
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,760
I won't mess this up.

669
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:17,565
I should warn you both

670
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,380
that this may not be easy.

671
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:22,384
Thom will face some significant
challenges along the way.

672
00:29:23,602 --> 00:29:26,376
There will be days
that he'll feel sick.

673
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,672
Days he'll feel exhausted.

674
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:32,898
Call me any time
you want to check in.

675
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,686
You sure you want to do this?

676
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,398
Take it.

677
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:48,901
Unless you want my arm
to fall off.

678
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:02,424
- Thanks again, Dr. Goodwin.
- Oh, of course.

679
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,605
Now you're COVID-free,
and you're vaccinated.

680
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,925
And this laptop
is gonna be a lifesaver.

681
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,300
Yeah, literally.

682
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,660
And now you can
look up real remedies

683
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,042
for whatever ails you.

684
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,925
I don't even need
to bother Nathan.

685
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,523
I already found something
for my knee problem.

686
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,656
- Good.
- Clay enemas.

687
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,159
Wait, what?

688
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:22,858
Well, it sounded better
than powdered ants, see?

689
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,113
No, no.
Don't click on that.

690
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,055
That's a pop-up.
You don't want...

691
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,518
See how well it knows me?

692
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:31,817
Vera, it doesn't know you.
It's tracking you.

693
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:33,714
- Oh, is that bad?
- Yes, that's bad!

694
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,673
You don't know where
this information comes from.

695
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:37,370
This could be just as bad
as Rona-Vaxx.

696
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:39,372
But it's on the computer
you gave us.

697
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:41,200
I know, but, Vera,
you can't believe

698
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:44,203
everything that you read
on the Internet.

699
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,509
Oh, so instead

700
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:48,729
of one lying ad in the lobby,

701
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,211
now I have a whole lying
machine in my apartment?

702
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:54,123
How is that progress?

703
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,560
Hey, I got the message.
Is Chance okay?

704
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,136
Security found him
in the stairwell.

705
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,827
- We're checking for burning.
- For burning?

706
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,705
- Why? What happened?
- They said he drank cleaning fluid.

707
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,435
You're here
for the department interview?

708
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,364
Yes.
Is there a problem?

709
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:36,686
But I'm sorry.
You're Dr. Lució?

710
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,583
Dr. Romy Lució?

711
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:42,348
That's right. Yes.

712
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:46,000
I studied your neuroanatomy
book in med school.

713
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:50,594
How often is there a fresh take
on epithalamic structure?

714
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:52,358
In fairness, not often.

715
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:53,839
And you're here?

716
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,231
You're really here
for the chair position?

717
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:00,726
Would you like
to start the interview?

718
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,593
Why?

719
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:04,718
That's often how it works.

720
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:06,676
You won the ANA Award
in neuroscience

721
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,482
and the Wolfe Neuropathy
Research Prize

722
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,658
in the same year.

723
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,322
Your book gave me purpose.

724
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,234
It changed my life.

725
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,704
I'm hiring you...

726
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:16,890
Right now.

727
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,813
Hmm, can you do that?

728
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,040
They said this was
my decision to make.

729
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:25,260
Practically forced me
to make it, so you know what?

730
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:26,859
I will.

731
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:31,049
Dr. Lució,

732
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,267
come meet
your new department.

733
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,710
Oh, okay.

734
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:40,523
Look who's awake.

735
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,713
I heard about your big save
on my ticker.

736
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,541
Cray, right?

737
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,761
No.
Not cray, actually.

738
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:49,371
Not remotely cray.

739
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:52,244
This is an underlying condition
that you have had for years,

740
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,202
and we would have known
about it a lot sooner

741
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:55,943
if you'd come in
for a routine checkup.

742
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:57,989
Eh, you live and learn.

743
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,729
- Can I go now?
- No!

744
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,683
Listen to me.
This isn't over, okay?

745
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,300
You're gonna need follow-up
and actual medication.

746
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,999
And you have got to stay away
from those crappy fake cures.

747
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,652
Crappy?

748
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:12,742
You only figured out what was
wrong with me because of them.

749
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,092
Technically yes, but that's...

750
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,398
So the way that I see it is,

751
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:17,831
they actually helped.

752
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,705
Oh, boy.

753
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,277
Soma Kulkarni, my all-time
favorite board member?

754
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,800
Skip it.
Hard no.

755
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:27,932
I heard what you did
to the others.

756
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,368
That's fair, but listen.

757
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:31,552
I have been doing this
whole thing backwards, okay?

758
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:32,937
I've been running around
trying to get everybody

759
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:36,083
broadband access without
considering, access to what.

760
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:38,708
Listen, I'm not asking
for much, really.

761
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,552
I just need a portal.

762
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,270
A portal to information
that people can trust.

763
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:46,080
That's all I need.

764
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:48,082
Having access to broadband,
to information, is a right,

765
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,215
but what I finally realized is

766
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,304
that it's the quality
of information

767
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:54,045
that affects
our quality of life,

768
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:55,873
so let's create a safe space

769
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,831
outside the walls
of this hospital.

770
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,834
The New Amsterdam
Tele-Health Network.

771
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,705
Let's call it N.A.T.H.A.N.

772
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,237
A place where
our patients can go

773
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,843
anytime,

774
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:12,541
day or night,

775
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,690
for care,

776
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:17,751
for connection...

777
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:26,642
And community.

778
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,767
Okay. All right.
All right.

779
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,563
Shh, guys.
Shh. Shh. Shh.

780
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:35,825
A fully integrated system

781
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,610
with the information
people need

782
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:40,656
to make the right
health-care decisions.

783
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,251
Just like walking through
the doors of New Amsterdam,

784
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,773
and all from the comfort
of your home.

785
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,250
Done.

786
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,749
I'll even design it myself.

787
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:57,312
Yes!
Thank you.

788
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,666
Um, I have to go.

789
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,799
It's story time,
and my daughter's a stickler,

790
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:04,051
but thank you.

791
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,030
Max?

792
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:09,076
Next time, stick to the scrubs.

793
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,539
This is just... wrong.

794
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:13,951
Yeah.

795
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:16,700
Oh, thank you! Thank you.

796
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:18,694
That's... what
a wonderful introduction.

797
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:20,351
Thank you so much.

798
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:23,438
Dr. Vijay Kapoor,
chair of this department

799
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,571
for 35 long years,

800
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,399
and in that tenure,

801
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:31,317
he used his...
unique perspective

802
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:34,606
and his old-fashioned ideas

803
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,769
to run this department
straight into the ground

804
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:40,277
while tarnishing
the very tenets of neurology.

805
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,501
What he did was a disgrace.

806
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:45,417
It was an embarrassment.

807
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,106
But as your new chair,

808
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:51,205
I vow to rectify
his inept failures.

809
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:55,145
And I will redress
his egregious oversights.

810
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,603
And I will restore dignity
to this department

811
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,138
by throwing away
every last thing

812
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,651
that Dr. Kapoor
has ever touched.

813
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:20,488
Think we could have
a minute?

814
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:22,023
Thank you.

815
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:30,312
I failed you.

816
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,296
Chance, even the fact that you
were concerned with failing me

817
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,046
is, um...

818
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:43,866
It's just proof
that I failed you.

819
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,470
And I did. I failed.
Um...

820
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,210
So I am, uh...

821
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:55,835
I'm transferring you
to another therapist

822
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,168
at another hospital.

823
00:36:57,287 --> 00:36:58,718
Wait, what?

824
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,493
- No.
- Yeah.

825
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:03,499
No! You can't!

826
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,921
I'm sorry.

827
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,343
Oh, please.

828
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,333
I'm... I'm sorry

829
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:17,984
that I couldn't give you
what you needed.

830
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:23,273
Dr. Frome, you can't do this!

831
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:25,952
You can't!

832
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:27,780
Dr. Frome!

833
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:29,008
No!

834
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:30,406
Hemiplegic?

835
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,961
Instead of paraplegic,

836
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:34,295
Allison's paralysis
is hemispheric.

837
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,094
In her case,
the right side of her body.

838
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,569
Could it be temporary?

839
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,219
Months, years.

840
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:41,468
It all depends on how long
it takes her to heal.

841
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:43,202
Either way, it won't be easy.

842
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,593
Oh, my baby.

843
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:50,968
I think they'd like
to speak with you.

844
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:55,116
Wait, what? Why?

845
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,543
Mr. Mulvane,
you panic-bought a firearm

846
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:58,805
and left it loaded and unlocked

847
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,720
in the proximity
of your daughter.

848
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,991
And when she got hurt,
you tried to cover it up

849
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:06,213
by filing a false police report
based on race,

850
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:07,389
a felony in New York.

851
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:08,610
- Wait, I...
- No, I'm not done.

852
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:10,263
Because then
y'all had the audacity

853
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:12,266
to claim that all lives matter

854
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:14,380
while the police
were combing the streets

855
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:16,209
profiling Black
and brown faces,

856
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,559
faces like mine,

857
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,215
which apparently
don't matter enough to you.

858
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,870
And here's what I don't get.

859
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:24,700
What I will never get is if
it's intentional on your part

860
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,399
or you're simply conditioned,
because you definitely

861
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:30,097
aren't the first
to falsely accuse a brother.

862
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,053
And I doubt you'll be the last.

863
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:36,701
This is the part
where you thank me

864
00:38:36,786 --> 00:38:38,703
for saving
your daughter's life.

865
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:43,851
We... we're not racists.

866
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,384
<i>♪ Is it that time
where I put my hand ♪</i>

867
00:38:56,468 --> 00:39:01,479
<i>♪ Where the drink is
in my blue denim jeans ♪</i>

868
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,875
<i>♪ If only you knew

869
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,529
Hi.

870
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,297
You look comfortable.

871
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,618
How was school?

872
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,608
I don't know.
I dropped out.

873
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,123
I took my GED.

874
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,186
Like you said,

875
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:23,797
school, college, job.

876
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,545
I said tons of things
that you haven't done.

877
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:27,633
Why start today?

878
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:29,064
You can stop pretending
to be my parent.

879
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,153
I am not your mum,
nor will I ever pretend to be.

880
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,369
However, I am in charge

881
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,857
for making the best decisions
for you...

882
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:34,860
You mean the best decisions
for you!

883
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:36,852
The decisions that make
your life easier.

884
00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:40,553
Really? Do you think any of
this is making my life easier?

885
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:41,946
Isn't that why I'm here?

886
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,863
Because you feel guilty
for ignoring your brother

887
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,430
for all those years?

888
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:46,868
How can you even say that
to me?

889
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:48,986
Oh, so I'm just here out
of the kindness of your heart?

890
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,494
You're here because
you're my family!

891
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:52,757
That you ignored
for your whole life!

892
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:53,934
You don't know what
you're talking about!

893
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,000
I know what family is,

894
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:56,438
and what you're doing
isn't even close.

895
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,271
It was your grandfather,
my father,

896
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,623
who just left his wife
and child back in London.

897
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:02,755
Me! I was the one
who was abandoned first!

898
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:05,000
I was the one
who was ignored first!

899
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,818
Ta-da!

900
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:28,274
Shh!
You'll wake Luna.

901
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,540
What?

902
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,283
Gwen, it's not even 7:00 yet.
I'm early.

903
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,418
Yeah, sorry, Max.
We had a big day.

904
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:38,008
Poor thing was so tired.

905
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:39,662
But couldn't you have
kept her up just a few minutes?

906
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,794
I mean, I was... I really wanted
to read to her.

907
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:44,547
I needed...
to read to her.

908
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:46,672
Of course you did.

909
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:50,297
But keeping a tired child up
solely for your benefit

910
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:53,461
would not have been very fair
to her, now, would it?

911
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,746
I do appreciate you
being punctual, though.

912
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:59,272
In fact, I just might be able
to make my 7:30 train tonight.

913
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,663
Good night, Max.

914
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,958
What the...

915
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:30,383
It looked smaller
in the picture.

916
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:32,303
I can take it back.

917
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:33,961
No, it's...

918
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,377
it's fine.

919
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:40,535
It's just very, very big.

920
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,704
Is it real?

921
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:51,375
Very much so.

922
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:54,274
Why?

923
00:41:55,604 --> 00:41:57,079
It's just, uh,

924
00:41:57,655 --> 00:42:01,500
I'm not really good with
living things.

925
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:11,922
I disagree.
