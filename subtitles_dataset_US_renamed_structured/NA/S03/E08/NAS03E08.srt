Mina, breakfast is ready!

16
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:52,949
We have 12 minutes.
Let's go!

17
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,559
Please tell me you're dressed.

18
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:56,083
I'm late.
Bye-bye, Ammeh Joon!

19
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,693
Oh, no, no, no, wait!

20
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:58,989
Um...

21
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:00,370
breakfast?

22
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,444
I'm not much
of a breakfast person.

23
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,534
Floyd Reynolds, my friend.

24
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:14,362
Do you ever just want to
bust out in song?

25
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:15,624
You know, like,
serenade the halls?

26
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,278
- Not today, Iggy.
- What's the matter?

27
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,931
What stole the song
in your heart, my friend?

28
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,237
Deacon Earnest Porter

29
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,283
of Anointed Balm of Gilead
Full Gospel Church.

30
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,024
- That's who.
- Say that three times fast.

31
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:25,634
Oh, man, it's my mom's
church friend.

32
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,854
He's always showing up to try
to fix something, you know?

33
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:30,943
Always stopping by with his
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

34
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,510
He's doing what?

35
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:34,295
What a menace.
Have you kicked his ass yet?

36
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,905
I'm being serious.

37
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,907
So you're feeling a little
squeezed out by the old Deacon?

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,214
It's like this, me and my
mom, we have a set schedule.

39
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:41,519
Right?
We have an understanding.

40
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:43,608
Whenever he's around,
she loses focus.

41
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,697
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,525
Okay, so you know,
you coming back here

43
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,353
to be you mom's primary
caregiver was a big decision,

44
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,616
and somebody's suddenly
picking up that mantle,

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,532
that could feel like
maybe you made a mistake.

46
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:57,318
Don't shrink me, and I won't
cut open your chest, deal?

47
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:59,581
What you're feeling
is very natural, right?

48
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,583
But what your mother is feeling
is also very natural.

49
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,107
She needs space and time
to flirt

50
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,500
and to eat
those buttermilk biscuits

51
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,850
and to be a fully realized
sexual human being.

52
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:08,981
- Oh, God.
- What?

53
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,940
Come on.
Hey, hey.

54
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,376
So should you.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,886
Right?
#selfcare, my friend.

56
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,258
Looks like your dilation's
right on schedule.

57
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,042
There's two more C-sections
incoming.

58
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,435
Our O.R.s are booked solid.

59
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,001
Okay, take 'em to five.

60
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,222
I convinced ortho to cede an OR
to your overflow, okay?

61
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,920
Look at all this new life.

62
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,400
How oddly chipper of you.

63
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,575
I can't help it!

64
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,838
There's a miracle
in every room.

65
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:41,144
Oh, look at that one.

66
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:42,624
Good, and it wouldn't
have anything to do

67
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,408
with all the great publicity
that we've been receiving

68
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,802
for taking over Southwest's
labor and delivery?

69
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,195
God bless Evelyn Davis,

70
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,806
destroyer of subpar Labor
and Delivery departments.

71
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,635
That's what, five I and Ds
that she has sued closed?

72
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,289
- Thanks.
- So long as we positively

73
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:57,117
reap from others' misfortune.

74
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,988
Mm, I wouldn't phrase it
that way.

75
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,034
Let us pick up the shattered
remains and profit off their...

76
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,819
Yeah, or how about,
our delivery protocols

77
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,864
have led to the best birthing
outcomes in the city?

78
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,823
And we can even afford
to scale up

79
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:09,738
if we can convince the board
to fund...

80
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:11,174
No, miracles!

81
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:14,071
A room full of miracles.

82
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,486
- Ugh.
- What, today that bad already?

83
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,922
Just ending yesterday.

84
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,576
Longest night ever.

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,492
Okay, well, at least business
is finally picking up.

86
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,669
Two drunk frat boys fought
over the future of Bitcoin

87
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,714
and then threw up
in my backseat.

88
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:30,933
Oh.

89
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,674
It took two hours
to clean it all out.

90
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,076
Who knows how many fares
I missed, and then...

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,722
Yeah, I think
you, uh, missed a spot.

92
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,594
I just want
to scrub myself raw

93
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,248
and then collapse
in the closet.

94
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:42,858
Well, enjoy.

95
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,425
More Southwest mommas
have landed.

96
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,930
- Several look ready to pop.
- Great.

97
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,212
Dr. Bloom...

98
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,519
I've got a migraine
and having auras in Bay 3.

99
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,261
- Spotting in Bay 11.
- Blood sugar spike in Bay 9.

100
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,958
Can't feel her toes
in Bay 18.

101
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,133
More on the way.

102
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:59,160
Abdominal pain in Bay 23.

103
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,877
Everybody.

104
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,707
Assess, process, and discharge
or get them up to floors.

105
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,666
No long workups.
No time for chitchat.

106
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,800
Let's clear out these bays
before the next wave hits.

107
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,888
Monica Cole-Weston.
Hi, I'm Dr. Reynolds.

108
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:17,872
Is that the doctor?

109
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,287
My wife, Andrea, who promised
she'd just listen in.

110
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,724
Yeah, so long as you don't
downplay your symptoms.

111
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:24,595
You are 31 weeks along
this time,

112
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,770
and I'm out of town,
and you have to understand...

113
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,014
Babe.

114
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,254
Tell me about
this pelvic pain.

115
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,605
It started there, but it's
all over my stomach now, too.

116
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,303
It just keeps building.

117
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,914
Dr. Reynolds, she hasn't
pooped in like three days.

118
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,419
Okay.

119
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,310
This is the furthest
I've gotten

120
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:44,485
in a pregnancy in four tries.

121
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,008
We're both a little on edge.

122
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:49,141
Understood. And where are you
on the pain scale?

123
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,665
Five-ish, six.

124
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,493
I thought it was just one
of those pregnancy aches,

125
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:53,929
but it wouldn't go away.

126
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:57,367
I'm just gonna feel around
a bit if that's okay.

127
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,282
Just let me know
if anything's tender.

128
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,458
Any spotting?

129
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,138
All right, I think we should
get you up to OB.

130
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,463
Is something wrong
with the baby?

131
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,465
Not saying that,
but you're 31 weeks,

132
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:10,424
and I'd like them
to take a look

133
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:12,077
and do their own workups.

134
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:15,167
Take some of that worry
off you and your wife.

135
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,473
Ydalis Fournette?

136
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,083
I'm Dr. Bloom.

137
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,260
So, how far along are you?

138
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:24,220
Wow, so I can't just be big?

139
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,353
We fat shaming out the gate?

140
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:29,138
Uh, no, no, sorry, I...

141
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,314
I just assumed that you were
another pregnancy transfer

142
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,837
from Southwest.

143
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,405
Well, your assumption
is all the way wrong.

144
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,102
I'm here for this.

145
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:40,367
This trick at the shelter
was trying to snatch my bag.

146
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,759
I had to tighten her ass up.

147
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,569
Okay.

148
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,069
Yeah, you're gonna need
stitches.

149
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,984
I think we should send you
for an X-ray

150
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,794
just to be sure
we're not missing anything.

151
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:54,144
Thanks.

152
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,886
Huh.

153
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,690
Well,
it turns out I was right.

154
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,563
Your blood test says that you
are, in fact, pregnant.

155
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:05,087
Your test is wrong
as you are.

156
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:06,940
I'm a virgin.

157
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,486
Nia, the biopsy confirmed

158
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,489
that the mass in your thyroid
is cancerous.

159
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,186
It's stage three.

160
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,561
Stage three.

161
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:25,020
That's... bad, right?

162
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:28,415
Without treatment, this
could progress to terminal,

163
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,330
but there's hope.

164
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,288
We have an excellent chance

165
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:35,857
using intravenous radioactive
iodine treatments.

166
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:38,841
Radioactive?
But I'm going to breastfeed.

167
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,279
I'm afraid you can't.

168
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,849
O-okay.

169
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,681
Okay.

170
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,007
Nia.

171
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,836
You're also gonna need
to isolate from your family

172
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,403
during the course
of the treatment.

173
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:03,039
Isolate, like, for how long?

174
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,278
Four to five months.

175
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:07,541
- Hold on.
- No, no, no.

176
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,498
We can't be near her
for four to five months?

177
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:09,717
No, I couldn't.

178
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,718
How's that even work
with a newborn?

179
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,067
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I understand.

180
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,547
Pearl's gonna need
her mother.

181
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,418
Exactly,
Pearl needs her mother,

182
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:16,724
you need your wife,

183
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,247
and Nia needs these treatments

184
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,057
if she's gonna have a chance
of surviving.

185
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,254
I understand that this is
difficult to hear.

186
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,603
I do.

187
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:30,243
But we want to give you
the best chance possible.

188
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,576
When do we start?

189
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,579
Your cancer is aggressive.

190
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:48,218
We need to start your treatment
today.

191
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,943
I know it's disheartening.
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,032
Sorry is not something
I expect to hear

193
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:06,121
from the head of the best labor
and delivery department

194
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,209
in New York.

195
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,471
My OB just transferred me here

196
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,212
for an optimal birthing
experience,

197
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:11,866
but you're no better
than Southwest.

198
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,433
What's going on in there?

199
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,609
Dr. Matsudaira won't let her
walk to progress her labor

200
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:16,914
because of her condition.

201
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,786
Our policy is to encourage her
to labor in bed.

202
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,614
Right, so why not
just tell her that?

203
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:22,616
Because that's Evelyn Davis.

204
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,487
That's Evelyn Davis?

205
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,446
The lawyer?

206
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,925
Is here?

207
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,274
I mean, you can talk
to the team, yes?

208
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:31,146
Mm-hmm, and it was six
departments she closed,

209
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,610
not five.

210
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,895
Talk to me straight,
is New Amsterdam

211
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,287
gonna support
my VBAC birth plan?

212
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,985
We're gonna do everything
we can to make sure

213
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:45,160
you have a great birthing
experience.

214
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,379
How very political of you.

215
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:50,557
Truthfully, vaginal births
after caesarian, VBACS,

216
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,689
depend on many things,

217
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,561
like your prior caesarian...

218
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,040
Which I didn't want.

219
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,651
But my labor
was taking too long,

220
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,348
so they gave me Pitocin,

221
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,306
and then they pushed
an epidural on me

222
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,265
because that was their protocol
for Pitocin.

223
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,528
And all I could do was lay
there, then came more Pitocin,

224
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:07,051
and then my son started
to decelerate.

225
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,575
Warp speed after that.

226
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:11,099
People were just doing things
to me, to my body

227
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,580
- without asking.
- I barely made it into the OR

228
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,016
before they were
pulling him out.

229
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,410
He's five now, inquisitive,

230
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,892
the kind of eyelashes
people would kill for.

231
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:25,200
But his birth was a nightmare.

232
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,724
I refocused my practice
on birthing justice

233
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,465
because of it.

234
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:32,163
So you can appreciate how
"great experience"

235
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,383
means letting me walk if
that's what I feel like doing.

236
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,951
But the only reason that
they're not letting you walk

237
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:40,781
is to monitor your labor
progression internally,

238
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:44,219
and your VBAC calculation
of 28%...

239
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,829
Means that, according
to your numbers,

240
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,266
that my likelihood of having
a successful vaginal delivery

241
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,444
- are slim to none.
- 28% isn't exactly optimal.

242
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,708
Says your calculator,
which already counts a point

243
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,274
against me
just for being Black.

244
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,886
Unfortunately, that's true.

245
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,715
Black and Latina mothers tend
to have less successful VBACs.

246
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,630
And lower birthweight babies,

247
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:06,807
more complications postpartum,
higher maternal deaths.

248
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,723
None of which has anything
to do with our beautiful skin,

249
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,750
just how we're treated in it.

250
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:17,818
Ms. Davis, the only thing
that we want is for you

251
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:20,541
and your baby to walk out
of here healthy.

252
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,303
It's just that when you're
still 5 centimeters dilated

253
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,175
- after almost four hours...
- Sounds like you're laying

254
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,917
- the groundwork to deny my VBAC.
- That's not my intention,

255
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,398
but if you don't progress
naturally soon,

256
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:37,446
then a C-section may be
your only recourse.

257
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,621
Do you understand?

258
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:42,693
Oh, you've made things
abundantly clear.

259
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,678
Nia, your procedure room's
all set.

260
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,704
Are you ready to go?

261
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,708
I've hardly seen Pearl
at all.

262
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,191
Barely got to hold her.

263
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,041
Where is she now?

264
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,433
She's with Bim.

265
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,723
They're running tests,
making sure she's normal.

266
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,833
Normal.

267
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:20,489
I know that all of this feels
about as far from normal

268
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,712
as you can get right now,
but you can get through this.

269
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,782
You can.

270
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,722
How can I help?

271
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:38,333
I want to feed her.

272
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,989
Just once, I want to
feel her on my skin,

273
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:43,947
nourish her,

274
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,514
bond with her,

275
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,110
and then you can take me.

276
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,651
Of course.

277
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:54,943
We'll give it a few more hours,
okay?

278
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,836
Oh, are you
the psych consult?

279
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,098
- I am, yeah.
- I'm Dr. Frome.

280
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,490
How's she doing?

281
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:07,492
Ydalis Fournette,
8 centimeters dilated,

282
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:11,061
in active labor, and still
angrily denying she's pregnant.

283
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:13,063
Okay, yeah,
that's cryptic pregnancy.

284
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:14,630
Means her mind is having
a hard time accepting

285
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,110
she's carrying a child.

286
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,112
Well, whatever it is,
the chief signed off.

287
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,417
We're going to get
a court order

288
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,897
to perform a C-section,
if that is required.

289
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,943
No, hold on, Dr. Goldman.
Hang on.

290
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:26,381
Just taking unilateral action
could be further traumatizing,

291
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,557
so maybe before we get
the courts involved,

292
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,080
you and I can assess
what triggered this.

293
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,429
With what time?

294
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:32,996
That baby's coming out
one way or another,

295
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,606
whether she wants to
believe it or not.

296
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,912
Okay, what I'm saying

297
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,653
is that you and I need
to proceed with care.

298
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,220
Care?

299
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,352
Dr. Frome, that woman never
received any prenatal care.

300
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:42,571
None.

301
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,791
Other than the ultrasound
I just performed,

302
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,836
we know literally nothing
about the health of this child.

303
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,709
Okay, I recognize that you
are trying to advocate

304
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,189
for the health of that baby,
but I am down here

305
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,495
to advocate for
the health of that mother.

306
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,453
- Dr. Frome...
- Which means that we do not

307
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,368
just strip her of her rights
with a court order

308
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,414
- before I even speak to her.
- Well, she's going to have to

309
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:02,069
- participate in her own care.
- Okay.

310
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:03,331
Look, you are more
than welcome

311
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,462
to try to get through to her,

312
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,117
but I'm getting
that court order.

313
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,930
So you have until I get back.

314
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,940
Walsh.

315
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:25,092
This isn't a M.A.S.H. unit.

316
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,311
Go and find a bay to examine
your patient in.

317
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,617
All the bays
are still filled because...

318
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,923
- I don't care.
- Where am I supposed to go?

319
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,185
I don't know.

320
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,100
You know, if only we were
in a huge building

321
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,362
filled with lots of rooms,

322
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:37,800
and you just needed to find
one empty one.

323
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:40,150
Go.

324
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,370
Monica, what happened?

325
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,372
They ran some tests,
did a pelvic exam,

326
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,591
said my baby's fine, and now
I'm back here talking to you.

327
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,158
And you explained
all your symptoms?

328
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:51,360
- Yes.
- Unreal. Let's go.

329
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,645
Here we go.

330
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,299
Can I help you?

331
00:14:58,383 --> 00:14:59,909
I'll be right back.

332
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,869
Hi, uh, Doctor... Malvo.

333
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,350
It seems that Ms. Cole-Weston
was sent back down to the E.D.

334
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,657
Now, I don't know if
you're maybe overwhelmed

335
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,267
with the influx
of new patients...

336
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:13,227
Oh, so you're saying
my OB is sloppy?

337
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,403
- Not my words.
- I examined her myself.

338
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,884
The baby's right on target, CBC
and chem panels were normal,

339
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:20,277
no signs of labor,
and her pelvic exam revealed

340
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,888
no dilation or softening
of the cervix.

341
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,541
So basically I did everything

342
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,978
that should've been done
in the E.D.

343
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:26,893
Wait a minute...

344
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,503
Which means, Dr. Reynolds,

345
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:31,158
her symptoms would make her
the E.D.'s patient, not OB's.

346
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,203
Okay, now, hang on.

347
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,902
The E.D.'s job is to triage,
not treat all,

348
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,642
which is exactly what we did.

349
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,384
Now, real talk,
what you should've done

350
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:42,865
was call a surgery consult
to handle her abdominal pain,

351
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,911
instead of shuttlecocking her
down to us.

352
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,303
And now you're mansplaining.

353
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,392
- No, I'm just...
- You wanna do real talk?

354
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,046
Do you know
how exhausting it is

355
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,483
having every other department
dump their patients on OB

356
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,051
just because that patient
happens to be pregnant?

357
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,748
- It's just lazy.
- Guys...

358
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,142
Or maybe just concerned
with the patient's welfare.

359
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,970
Well, they have
all the same organs.

360
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:02,779
Stop being afraid of vulvas.

361
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:05,888
Let's get her on a stretcher.

362
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,411
Okay, okay, it's okay.

363
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:09,936
Oh, she's warm, diaphoretic,
and tachy.

364
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,894
- Where does it hurt?
- All over my stomach

365
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,548
- and my back now.
- Sepsis?

366
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,766
Her white blood count was 14,

367
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,290
which is in the range
for pregnancy,

368
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,161
and her ultrasound
on non-obscured organs...

369
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,033
Obscured organs?

370
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:21,512
Appendicitis.

371
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,775
Page O.R., and let 'em know
we're on our way.

372
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,067
- Paging O.R. now.
- Told you, your department.

373
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:29,825
- Max!
- What's the 911?

374
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,175
- Evelyn Davis.
- What happened now?

375
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,090
She checked herself out, AMA.

376
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,856
- Still in labor?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,906
Hey, what did you say to her?

378
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,886
Ms. Davis!
Um...

379
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,758
Glad I caught up with you.
I heard you were going home?

380
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,978
- Our OB is meeting us there.
- Ms. Davis...

381
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:54,415
I was a fool to think
any hospital would listen...

382
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,244
Ooh!
Honor my wishes,

383
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,160
do right by me and my baby,
so I'm going home.

384
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:02,771
Home births can be amazing.

385
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,104
It's perfect, unless it isn't.

386
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:11,084
I ended up delivering
my daughter in my bedroom

387
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,433
with a kitchen knife,

388
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:14,261
praying that the ambulance
would arrive in time

389
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,959
for both her and...

390
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,638
my wife.

391
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,269
I can't let that be
a possibility for you.

392
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:26,012
We're prepared for anything
at this hospital.

393
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:29,145
You're already here.
You're in labor.

394
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:30,494
Please.

395
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:33,149
Let us safely deliver
this baby

396
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,369
at New Amsterdam.

397
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:38,136
I'm going home, Dr. Goodwin.

398
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:45,205
Mr. Davis.

399
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,859
I just want what's best
for you and your wife.

400
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,731
Is there anything
that you can say...

401
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,193
Dr. Goodwin, have you ever
loved a Black woman?

402
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,650
I've heard lots of numbers
today,

403
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:56,999
how they'll keep my wife safe,

404
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,870
how they'll help ensure
my child is born safely,

405
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,004
but I really haven't seen
my wife in your numbers.

406
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,484
There's nothing worse
than being told

407
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,253
how to be grateful.

408
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:09,170
Julian!

409
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,869
Page Dr. Bloom.
Get the ER rapid response team.

410
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:18,437
Mind if I sit down?

411
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:21,415
Okay, good.

412
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,809
So first off, I am Dr. Frome,
but you can just call me Iggy.

413
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,289
Everybody does.

414
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,856
Okay.

415
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,379
Yeah, why don't you...
You start.

416
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:30,859
You tell me in your own words

417
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,339
what happened with this fight
at the homeless shelter?

418
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:35,298
I don't know.

419
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,953
I already told that bitch
to mind her business.

420
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:39,911
She always talking
'bout what I eat,

421
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,217
wondering what's in my bags,

422
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,176
and that trick's hands
got sticky, so...

423
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,875
Okay, so she was trying
to exert control over you?

424
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,225
The shelter does that.

425
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,054
Ain't no different here
at the hospital neither.

426
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,883
Everybody just doing
what they wanna do to you.

427
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,712
You're supposed to just
go along with it?

428
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,931
So, hey, when was
the last time

429
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,629
you felt like you were
in control of your life?

430
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:04,371
Do you remember?

431
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,808
Full control.

432
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:08,331
I don't know.

433
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,072
It's been a minute.

434
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:11,726
Yeah.

435
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,554
I bet, and you strike me
as the type of person

436
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,034
that values that deeply.

437
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,687
Am I right?

438
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:20,474
Yeah, so then you would know
when you felt like you lost it.

439
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,505
W-When was that?

440
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,116
About a year ago, maybe.

441
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,096
Okay, so did something happen
about a year ago?

442
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,316
Something that made you feel
like you lost control?

443
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,579
Hang on!

444
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:41,128
We're taking her now.

445
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:52,201
Walsh?
What are you doing in here?

446
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,768
- You said to go find a room.
- Yeah, but I...

447
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,161
So I found a room.

448
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,119
You mind?

449
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:59,382
Bloom!

450
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,731
Your friend?

451
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,646
- Walsh found her.
- What?

452
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,720
He got security
to clear her out.

453
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,004
Based on the amount
of abscess fluid,

454
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,572
it doesn't look like the
appendix has fully ruptured.

455
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,139
That's good.

456
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,471
But I still can't get
a visual.

457
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,144
I don't know.

458
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,320
It's like the appendix isn't
where it's supposed to be.

459
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:25,974
The magic of gestation,

460
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,063
moving everything
out of the way to make space.

461
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,847
It's back there somewhere.

462
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,573
All right.

463
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,856
All right.

464
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,057
I'm gonna have to expand
the field.

465
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,166
You good?

466
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,212
Haven't had to do one
of these in a while,

467
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,517
since residency.

468
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,432
Just root around,
and mind the extra human.

469
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,913
- It's no different.
- Let's hope it is.

470
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,509
That time we lost the fetus.

471
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,426
You do music in your O.R.?

472
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,011
Nurse Kamoe?

473
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,232
Can you cue up my people?

474
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:07,954
You know where to start.

475
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,848
Oh, okay.

476
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,502
These are your people?

477
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,460

478
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,115

00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,936

483
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,175
Why hasn't Nia been sent up
to radiation yet?

484
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,872
Because she wanted time
to bond with her baby

485
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:39,134
to try and form a connection.

486
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,570
Understandable,
but she has to...

487
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:42,485
Look, that family could end
up physically apart

488
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,878
for upwards of a year.

489
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:46,384
All she asked for was a moment.

490
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,798
I was just asking because
things have been a bit crazy

491
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,495
in neurology with Dr. Kapoor's
retirement,

492
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,497
and I'm trying to keep
all the balls up in the air

493
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:55,411
until we find his replacement.

494
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,500
Of course.

495
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,241
- Is everything okay with...
- It's fine.

496
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:01,184
I'm just gonna take Nia up now.

497
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:07,467
Nia?

498
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:10,103
She won't latch.

499
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:14,412
Please don't take me.

500
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:17,955
Do you want me to start
a regional block?

501
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,218
For what?

502
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,262
I'm checking
your progression, hon.

503
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:22,786
You'll feel a little pressure.

504
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,615
Looks like the bleeding's from
a small tear in the placenta.

505
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:27,095
Nothing to worry about,

506
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,358
but you're still only
60% effaced

507
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:30,925
and at station -2.

508
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,100
It's a go on the C-section.

509
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,320
C-section?
But why?

510
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,278
- You want her fetal or supine?
- Let's get her supine for now.

511
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:38,846
This isn't what I want.
Listen to me.

512
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,588
- On it.
- Type and cross for two units.

513
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,329
Make sure her foley's in.

514
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,721
Julian.

515
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,593
I'm sorry, sir, you can't be
in here right now.

516
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,856
- But this is my wife.
- You can wait right outside.

517
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,944
It's hospital policy.

518
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:52,076
Are we getting decels?

519
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,991
No, baby's holding steady
on the monitor.

520
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,080
BP's 135 over 80.

521
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:58,325
Everybody, stop.

522
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:02,348
Listen.
Not to me, to the patient.

523
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:04,263
Evelyn.

524
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:05,873
How can we help?

525
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:09,137
I want to deliver my baby
naturally.

526
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,792
Then let's try to do that.

527
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,969
She's geriatric
with a history of FTP

528
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,623
and a VBAC score of 28%.

529
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,669
If Evelyn wasn't Black,
would her VBAC score be better?

530
00:23:19,753 --> 00:23:21,149
Allow for a longer trial
of labor?

531
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,977
- Technically, but...
- Then do it.

532
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,805
Change her VBAC calculation.

533
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,749
- How?
- Make her white.

534
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,295
She's fully effaced
and at -1 station,

535
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,819
but she's still
only 5 centimeters dilated.

536
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,672
Dr. Goodwin.

537
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,785
That woman should be having
a C-section.

538
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:50,657
Well, that woman
disagrees with you.

539
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:52,876
Evelyn Davis is many things,
but not a doctor,

540
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,575
and all signs point to her
vaginal birth going poorly.

541
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,533
- You don't know that for sure.
- Why, you're right.

542
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,230
If only there were
an instrument we could use

543
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,754
to estimate the risk of things,

544
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:02,408
like uterine rupture
after a previous C-section.

545
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:03,887
A calculator, say.

546
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:06,542
- Your sarcasm is unnecessary.
- Then I'll be blunt.

547
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,022
By ignoring
the VBAC calculator,

548
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,850
you're risking the life
of that woman and her baby.

549
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:11,591
If her VBAC score
can be changed

550
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:12,940
just by switching her race,

551
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,595
then maybe the VBAC calculator
is a racist tool.

552
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,901
Different populations
have different likelihoods

553
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:19,207
of different issues.

554
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,688
Factoring in race
isn't inherently racist.

555
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:23,037
No, you're right,
but treating some races

556
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,431
like they are automatically
a health risk is,

557
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:28,042
when we should be focused
on the racism

558
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:29,522
that Black mothers encounter,

559
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:31,437
which is ultimately
what is leading

560
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,221
to these poorer outcomes.

561
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,049
And how's fixing racism
working out?

562
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,224
I can't fix it,

563
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,834
but I can throw out
that calculator,

564
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,532
which we're just using
to cover our ass.

565
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,534
Not to mention,
and by your own words,

566
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,753
to deliver the best outcomes
in the city.

567
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,842
At the expense
of the mothers.

568
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:48,236
Our focus on making the numbers
look good is turning this place

569
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,280
into a hatchery.

570
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,935
It shouldn't be like that.

571
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:53,922
It should be like this.

572
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,420
And if it's a risk,
then it's the risk

573
00:24:58,504 --> 00:25:00,379
that she wants to take.

574
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,468
And if the baby dies,

575
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,731
comes out damaged in a way
that was avoidable,

576
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,385
she's not gonna blame herself.

577
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:07,560
She'll blame her doctor.

578
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:09,736
This isn't just Evelyn's risk.

579
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,154
Now it's the whole hospital's.

580
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,572
Let's try a wider angle,
and just lift your breast up.

581
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:20,834
- Lift it, lift it higher.
- All right, okay, here.

582
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,139
- Lift it higher.
- Honey, I just need to...

583
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,314
Well, I know.
I just can't...

584
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,925
- Babe, you gotta try...
- I am trying.

585
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,405
Nia, Nia, the baby
can feel your stress.

586
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,668
I am trying to relax, but...
Stop.

587
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:31,220
Just stop, stop, stop.
I said stop.

588
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,485
Just get the bottle.

589
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:49,210
You know,

590
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:53,344
breastfeeding is
incredibly special,

591
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:57,436
and it's important,

592
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,309
but it is not everything.

593
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,313
It doesn't make you less
of a mother.

594
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,993
Do you have children?

595
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,102
No.

596
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:16,741
Then you can't possibly know
how this feels.

597
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:25,986
Dr. Bloom.

598
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,770
Leyla had nothing to do
with this, okay?

599
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,990
She selflessly brought
a patient in,

600
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,558
and when I heard that she had
no place to stay,

601
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,864
I let her use the closet.

602
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:37,867
I mean, we're in the business
of helping people, right?

603
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:41,548
And I'd do it again, okay?
'Cause she's an amazing person.

604
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:47,660
I mean, she's super cranky,
but wouldn't you be

605
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:49,531
if you had to drive around
puking frat boys

606
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,863
when you're actually a doctor?

607
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,756
Look, I know that I committed
like a hundred violations,

608
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,019
and I'm gonna gladly take
whatever I've got coming,

609
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:02,006
but I'm not gonna let you press
charges against Leyla.

610
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:06,461
Ms. Shinwari told me she
doesn't know you at all,

611
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:09,448
that she found the closet and
took up residence on her own.

612
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:15,063
So I'm gonna go with her story.

613
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:25,349
This is my jam.

614
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:27,351
Reminds me of the first boy
I kissed,

615
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,875
Benny Galan.

616
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,616
You're barely as old
as this song.

617
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,488
Just the feeling of it.

618
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:35,098
I was so nervous.

619
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:36,709
I'd never kissed before.

620
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:40,190
- How'd you do?
- Is that even a question?

621
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:42,018
Okay, you got it.

622
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:43,585
I didn't see my first kiss
coming.

623
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:45,369
I had to swallow my gum.

624
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:47,720
So she put the moves on you?

625
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,489
Always been
into confident women.

626
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:54,335
♪ I'm not the only one
that holds you ♪

627
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:55,728
Cheers.

628
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,889
Appendix been removed.
Now all we have to do is...

629
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:03,866
Baby's heart rate dropped
to 94.

630
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,216
Acute bradycardia.
Dammit.

631
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,089
Probably a uterine abruption
from all the manipulation.

632
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:12,614
Set me up for a classic,
and get NICU down here stat.

633
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:14,252
- Paging NICU now.
- Scalpel.

634
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:22,624
You're doing so great.

635
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,452
- Deep breaths.
- Get off of me!

636
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,062
- I'm trying to help you.
- Calm down.

637
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,673
Ydalis, what are these people
doing?

638
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:29,283
Stop, stop,
stop that right now.

639
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,458
Dr. Frome?
What's going on?

640
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,851
What is this OB doing
in here?

641
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:33,809
- You are not pregnant.
- Have you lost your mind?

642
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,637
This is my colleague,
Safia Lazarre.

643
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:36,986
We have received
new information.

644
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,336
You are not pregnant.
You were right all along.

645
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,816
What we have is a GI blockage,

646
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,644
and we need to resolve it
immediately, okay?

647
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:44,385
Dr. Goldman, you know
Safia can handle it.

648
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:45,734
She is excellent.
So here we go.

649
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:48,128
Dr. Frome, a word?

650
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:50,982
Okay, I'll be back.
Hands off, please.

651
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:53,742
What the hell are you doing?

652
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,178
I am getting her
to participate.

653
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:56,397
All right?
You need to follow my lead.

654
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,790
Safia is an amazing midwife.

655
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:00,444
If we need you for anything,
you will know.

656
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,776
This is for Ydalis
and the baby.

657
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,259
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

658
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:13,414
Hey, sis, I'm Safia.

659
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,329
Look like you might be
a bit uncomfortable, yeah?

660
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:16,460
Yeah...

661
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,836
Let's fix that.

662
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:22,249
What feels better?

663
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,729
If I could s-stand up?

664
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:25,774
- Okay, then let's do that.
- Yeah, okay.

665
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,080
Let's get you standing up.

666
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:28,342
Why don't you put your arms
around my neck?

667
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:29,909
Okay.

668
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:31,432
There you go.
Lean on me.

Okay, I got you.
It's okay, you're good.

I got you.
I got you, okay?

672
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,873
Just like this.
Just like this, okay?

673
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,353
I got you.
Don't worry.

674
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,355
That blockage wants to make
its way out, huh?

675
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,139
Yeah.

676
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:45,011
- You need to help it, okay?
- Okay.

677
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,622
That wave of pain is helping
you move it out,

678
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:48,841
so use it.

679
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,017
When you feel it,
push like you're pooping.

680
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:52,105
Pooping?

681
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,280
It's the only way
to get it out.

682
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:54,847
It's okay, it's okay.
Piece of cake.

683
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,284
- Piece of cake.
- Okay.

684
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:59,547
Push.
Good.

685
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,375

699

a year ago for you, right?

the beginning of the pandemic.

and whatever you tell me...

"Shelter in place.
The city's on lockdown"?

707
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,133
Yeah.

708
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:49,570
My moms was tripping,

709
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:52,878

I could stay with him.

went real quick.
