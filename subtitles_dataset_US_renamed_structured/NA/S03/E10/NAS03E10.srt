00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,042
<i>Previously, on</i> 
<font color="#ffff00">"New Amsterdam"...</font>

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,618
As your new chair,

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,773
I will restore dignity
to this department

4
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:12,102
by throwing away
every last thing

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:14,539
that Dr. Kapoor
has ever touched.

6
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,594
Chance, you are trying
to fill a void in you,

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,742
but the way you're trying
to fill it, it's not real.

8
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:19,921
I'm transferring you

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,796
to another therapist
at another hospital.

10
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:23,504
Dr. Frome, no!

11
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:25,724
There's this, uh,
record store in East Village.

12
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,546
Want to go Saturday
and maybe grab dinner after?

13
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,509
I'm flattered, but...

14
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,765
Oh.

15
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,608
Oh, God.

16
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:41,992
Ah!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,070
Leyla?

18
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,718
What happened?

19
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,480
Oh, okay.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,296
Uh, how bad's the pain
from one to ten?

21
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,601
Is that a smile?
Are you smiling?

22
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:57,210
I passed
the medical board exam.

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,967
What?

24
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:01,523
I can train 
in the U.S. now.

25
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:04,532
You took the boards?
But how?

26
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,243
You gave me
a bed at the hospital

27
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,585
and then this.

28
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,246
I didn't have to worry
about surviving.

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,074
I could study.

30
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,510
Leyla, that's amazing.

31
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,773
I'm so happy for you.
I...

32
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,875
I should get some ice for this.
Uh...

33
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,257
Lauren, because of you,
I can be a doctor again.

34
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:27,765
Uh...

35
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,750
I'm so sorry.

36
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,560
Yeah, no, no.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,190
No, it was, uh, fine.

38
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:42,234
Um, totally fine.

39
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,929
Actually, I just remembered
I've got to get to work early.

40
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:49,148
Okay, uh, well, look,
I will see you later, okay?

41
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,335
Oh, good. You're up.

42
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,120
Chop, chop,
you'll be late for work.

43
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,171
Chop, chop, I'm working?

44
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,503
Yes, indeed,
because I know someone

45
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,734
who knows someone
who pulled some strings

46
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,737
and got you a job at...

47
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,571
New Amsterdam.

48
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,218
I don't want to work
at New Amsterdam.

49
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:16,051
Yeah, that feeling
usually goes away by lunch.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,575
I'm a child.

51
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,835
Isn't it illegal
to make a child work?

52
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:23,546
Well, it's no more illegal
than letting her quit school.

53
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:28,499
I'll get dressed.

54
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,543
Good.

55
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,453
Think, um,
public hospital chic.

56
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,638
Jane Munsee,
history professor.

57
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,814
Her students brought
her in with a massive DVT.

58
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,031
How's her recovery?

59
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,208
It would go a lot better
if she weren't demanding

60
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,938
- to be discharged.
- Uh, why exactly?

61
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,778
Something
about imperialist crimes

62
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,127
against Native Americans.

63
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,406
Oh, that.

64
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,234
Professor Munsee,

65
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,335
I am Max Goodwin,
the Medical Director.

66
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,422
Nice to meet you.
Please sign this so I can go.

67
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,922
Well, uh, the thing is

68
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:04,535
you have a pretty sizeable
blood clot in your leg

69
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,799
and standing or walking
or moving of any kind

70
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,149
could cause that blood clot
to break free

71
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,324
and travel to your lungs,

72
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,892
and we need you
on a heparin drip now

73
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,329
and here at New Amsterdam.

74
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,331
Those two words,
Doctor, are exactly why

75
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:19,841
I need to leave.

76
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,467
New Amsterdam?

77
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,554
You know what New Amsterdam
means to me?

78
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:30,398
Death, lies,
the erasure of my people.

79
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,031
I see.

80
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,390
You mean when the
Dutch colonized Manhattan.

81
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:38,359
Before this land
was New Amsterdam,

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,273
It was Lenapehoking...

83
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:47,133
the home of the Lenape people,
my ancestors.

84
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:49,765
We were here
long before the Dutch.

85
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,973
As long as the name
New Amsterdam

86
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,711
is emblazoned on this building,

87
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,585
you're accepting,
even celebrating

88
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,893
the destruction
of indigenous lives.

89
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,141
Okay.

90
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,374
I hear you.

91
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,723
You don't want to stay here,

92
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,672
but right now
you have a ticking time bomb

93
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:05,804
in your veins.

94
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,764
You need this heparin drip,

95
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,546
or you could die.

96
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,265
So tell you what,

97
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:15,821
if you think you
can make up for 400 years

98
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:18,261
of crimes
against Native Americans,

99
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:21,539
I'll stay here
at New Amsterdam.

Give me your phone.

103
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:36,053
Girl, where I'm from,

104
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:37,540
jacking a phone
gets people got.

105
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,325
A, I'm not people,

106
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,240
just a colleague here
to edify your day.

107
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:42,772
So...

108
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,967
give me your phone.

109
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,404
B.

110
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:53,803
Uh, C, I made you...

111
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,209
A playlist.

112
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,855
Text me when you
get to track five.

113
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,670
- Dr. Frome?
- Talk to you soon.

114
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,151
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course.

115
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,256
I need to talk to you

116
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,279
about the new chair
of neurology.

117
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,826
Dr. Lucille... Agnes,
oh, my gosh, what a coup.

118
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:11,177
- How did you get her to join us?
- That's the thing.

119
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:14,794
Is there any way
that she could maybe unjoin us?

120
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,108
Oh, that's just a formality.
Don't worry about that.

121
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,327
The board officially
approves her tomorrow.

122
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,148
It's gonna be gravy, okay?
And I got to tell you...

123
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,107
I didn't think anybody
could do better than Vijay,

124
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,732
but you nailed it.

125
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,921
I'm thinking
maybe I didn't... nail it.

126
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,547
You nailed it. Trust...
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,463
Hi, Dr. Romy Lucille, hi.

128
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,656
I'm honored.
It's, uh...

129
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,397
You don't know who I am.
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,295
I'm Dr. Iggy Frome,
chair of behavioral health.

131
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,688
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

132
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,342
Yeah, likewise, and, uh,

133
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,430
let me just say,
I'm really looking forward

134
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,431
to working with you.

135
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,736
Dr. Kapoor and I...

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,107
We had a number
of collaborations

137
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,100
going on here,

138
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:47,256
and I just can't wait
to pick your brains about them.

139
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,545
Oh, uh, fabulous.

140
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:52,789
But, uh, if you'll excuse me,
patients call.

141
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:53,834
Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,575
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
get in there, go.

143
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,229
Sorry.
Look at you two.

144
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,101
Nice to meet you.
Have a great day.

145
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,147
Can you please make sure
I'm never alone

146
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,406
with that weirdo?

147
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,239
His breathing
was bad last night

148
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,937
and even worse this morning.

149
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:12,375
He's a lymphoma survivor,
an asthmatic,

150
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,333
but he's never been this bad.

151
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,727
Well, his COVID test
was negative.

152
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,773
Niall, is the oxygen helping?

153
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,602
I'm pretty sure
that's your call.

154
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,735
He never takes
anything seriously.

155
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,125
That's why she loves me.

156
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,178
Do you know how he got these
scratches on his hands?

157
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,311
Oh.

158
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,965
We went mushroom foraging
yesterday.

159
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,186
I'm gonna get my colleague
to take a look at him.

160
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,493
Is that okay?

161
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,669
Shh, you're gonna be okay.

162
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,154
Hey, uh, I got a patient
in the procedure room...

163
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,808
Niall Fincannon.

164
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,723
He's got some pretty
serious lung issues.

165
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,247
Lymphoma survivor.
Girlfriend brought him in.

166
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,814
What did his chest X-ray say?

167
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,512
I'm looking
for Niall Fincannon.

168
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,514
Uh, Niall's my patient.
How can I help?

169
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,948
I'm his boyfriend.

170
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,129
Dr. Reynolds
was just heading over there.

171
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,775
He can show you the way.

172
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,439
Follow me.

173
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,621
Michael.

174
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,414
Hey, baby.

175
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,510
Uh, okay, that's great.

176
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,033
I bet you're all wondering why

177
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,471
I have called this
emergency session.

178
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,298
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

179
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,910
Particularly because you
don't have that authority.

180
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,912
Great, thank you
for joining us, Karen.

181
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,828
So this morning
I was challenged

182
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,396
to reckon
with this hospital's past,

183
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,137
to do something about
the crimes that were committed

184
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,748
on this very ground.

185
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,184
Lindsey, did you know
that as Americans,

186
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,317
most of us live our lives
on land that was taken

187
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:12,103
by brutal imperialistic
violence.

188
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,932
I live in Hoboken.

189
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,587
Yeah, so I know there's
not a lot that we can do

190
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,762
about our past,

191
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,068
but there is something
that we can do

192
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,983
about our present.

193
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,117
We can honor the original
people of Manhattan,

194
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,119
the original stewards
of this land

195
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,729
that we are currently
standing on...

196
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,296
The Lenape people.

197
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,168
Max, what in God's name
are you talking about?

198
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,519
We're changing the name
of this hospital.

199
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,478
Say goodbye to New Amsterdam

200
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,393
and welcome...

201
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,740
to Lenapehoking.

202
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,965
Well, the good news
is that it's pronounced

203
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,844
exactly like it's spelled.

204
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:02,283
I sincerely apologize
for wasting your time.

205
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,763
This meeting's adjourned.

206
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,069
No, not adjourned.

207
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,941
Uh, Evan, Evan, did you know
that New York

208
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,943
has a larger Native American
population

209
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,293
- than any other city in America?
- No.

210
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,209
No, no, so just imagine
for a second

211
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,951
what it must feel like for our
Native American patients.

212
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,301
I have a patient
right now upstairs who is ready

213
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:23,435
to walk out these doors and die
because of that name,

214
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,917
because it says to her that
her history doesn't matter,

215
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,223
that she doesn't matter, but...

216
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,964
Evan, just listen.

217
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,140
A simple name change

218
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,596
could reckon with our past,
rectify our present,

219
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,580
and cost us
practically nothing.

220
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,799
Aside from decades

221
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,659
of carefully crafted
branding efforts

222
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:44,292
and multimillion-dollar
design campaigns,

223
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:48,269
New Amsterdam has been
here for almost 300 years,

224
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,766
and it will be around
for another 300.

225
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,419
The name stays.

226
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,508
Meeting adjourned.

227
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,639
Meeting's
not adjourned, Karen.

228
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,075
We're gonna un-adjourn, guys.

229
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,144
We're re-adjourning,
so everybody go ahead

230
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,550
and adjourn around the table.

231
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:00,777
Back me up.
I need a little help.

232
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,864
I'm all alone here.
I'm all alone here.

233
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,519
People who try to shame
themselves into losing weight

234
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,787
are actually acting in direct
conflict with their goal.

235
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,667
Harsh self-criticism triggers
a flood of stress hormones,

236
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,096
like cortisol and adrenaline,
that create anxiety

237
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,968
and can lead
to emotional eating.

238
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,666
You get far better results
with regular exercise,

239
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,451
a nutritious diet,
and self-care.

240
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,018
You know what I mean?

241
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:27,194
Yeah, I do know
what you mean.

242
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,109
Although I had
to go to school for 13 years

243
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,285
to learn about it, but I do
know what you mean.

244
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,374
Saffy, look at you.
Look at this.

245
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,115
You don't even need me
on this journey.

246
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,509
No, I don't.

247
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:40,294
What I need is your signature.

248
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,122
My signature...

249
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,255
for gastric bypass surgery?

250
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,039
Yep.

251
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,432
I'm a little lost here.

252
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,565
What about everything
you just said?

253
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,870
It's all true, I guess.

254
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,308
It just doesn't work for me.

255
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,876
Dr. Frome...

256
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,399
look at me.

257
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,053
I-I am.

258
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,665
Saffy, I am looking at you.

259
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,406
I'm looking right at you,
and I see

260
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,583
an incredibly impressive,

261
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,367
beautiful young woman.

262
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,499
That's what I see.
Gastric bypass surgery...

263
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,893
I get the allure,
but it is not always effective.

264
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,286
It can be dangerous.

265
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,550
So I say we recommit.
We stick with the plan.

266
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,987
- Six more months of exercise...
- Come on!

267
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,249
And healthy eating.

268
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,379
Saffy, that's how we do this.

269
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,869
Dr. Frome...

270
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:39,615
I'm genetically predetermined
to look this way.

271
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,620
But I don't want to.

272
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,799
I assume that you need
my signature on this

273
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,888
because your parent
refuses to sign it?

274
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,541
She refuses.

275
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,805
Yeah, that's because
she loves you

276
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,502
and she wants you
to be healthy.

277
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,723
No, my mother
doesn't care what I eat.

278
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,377
She wants me to be fat.

279
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,469
He's a lymphoma survivor,
but there's no lymphadenopathy

280
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,036
on his chest X-ray.

281
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,779
Uh, Michael mentioned
that on their morning run,

282
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,086
Niall had to stop
because of chest pain.

283
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,783
So cardiac ischemia?

284
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,437
Troponins are flat.

285
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,483
Oh, I also noticed that Niall
had scratches on his hands.

286
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,616
Zara said the went mushroom
foraging yesterday.

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,619
- Amanita mushroom poisoning?
- You think?

288
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:31,057
It's an odd presentation,
but that explains everything.

289
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,187
I'll get him started
on treatment.

290
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,845
Uh, can I help you?

291
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,673
My boyfriend was brought in.

292
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,500
- Niall?
- How'd you know?

293
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,850
Follow me.

294
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,465
Hi, hi.

295
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,818
He's gonna need
a bigger room.

296
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:56,126
Don't be such a square.

297
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,172
Right, your job, my dear,
is to input these records

298
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:02,001
into the online database...
All of them.

299
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,656
This is from 1998.
Who would ever need this?

300
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,831
I'm glad you asked.

301
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,659
It's quite interesting,
actually.

302
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,792
Extending the chronological
span of our records

303
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,098
creates a researchable X axis
of diagnoses across time...

304
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,970
- Did I die?
- Sorry?

305
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,841
Am I in some kind
of weird, boring hell?

306
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,148
A question working adults
grapple with every day.

307
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,802
Uh, Helen, uh...

308
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,629
Oh, hi.
Okay.

309
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,457
I just thought you
should know that the board

310
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,025
is blocking my attempts
to change New Amsterdam's name

311
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,027
- to Lenapehoking.
- Shocking.

312
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,073
I know, I think
I'm saying it right.

313
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,162
It's like "hawk."
The Lenape-hawk-ing.

314
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,990
Is this is guy
you were dating?

315
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,514
Mina, that is completely
inappropriate.

316
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,950
Oh, no, that's fine,

317
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,212
because we're not dating,
so, you know...

318
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,824
I mean, we never dated.

319
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,260
We just, uh,
have spent time together.

320
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,132
We spend time together
from time to time,

321
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,612
you know, as people do.

322
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,832
And I think that other
people get ideas,

323
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,311
- and they talk...
- Max.

324
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,530
Yeah, shut up.
Idiot, sorry.

325
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,532
Real quick...
Did you say "were dating"?

326
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,490
Does that mean you and Cassian
are not dating now?

327
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,579
- Are you...?
- You might be right.

328
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,191
- This may actually be hell.
- Nice meeting you.

329
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,409
Let me rewind.
I need your help.

330
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,063
If I can change
this hospital's name,

331
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:05,499
then I can save
my patient's life.

332
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,805
Max, I don't know what this
is about,

333
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,241
and I don't want to ask,

334
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,287
but if you really want
to change the hospital's name,

335
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,721
you're gonna need
a lot more support than me.

336
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,557
Justice for Lenape!
Justice!

337
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,168
- This is our land!
- You're on stolen land!

338
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,475
Put that camera away.

339
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,347
- Who's in charge here?
- Hot white guy.

340
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,393
Karen, grab a Sharpie
and some cardboard.

341
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,917
- What the hell is going on?
- Well, first off, it's safe.

342
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,527
Everybody has been tested.

343
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,270
And, secondly, it looks like
we are renaming New Amsterdam.

344
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,446
- These people are trespassing.
- Get them out of here.

345
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,884
- Sorry, I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

346
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:45,240
Because this is their land
and we're the ones trespassing.

347
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,848
How about a plaque
commemorating

348
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:50,893
the Lenape people?

349
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,155
Look around, Karen.

350
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,070
This protest is filled
with Native Americans,

351
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,985
all of whom are residents
of this city.

352
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,379
They deserve to feel at home
in their city's hospital,

353
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,728
and so does my patient.

354
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,730
Well, fine, a statue.

355
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,036
We'll take a wing.

356
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,821
Oh, look, here come
the TV cameras.

357
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,735
Damn it, Max.

358
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,955
You can rename this lobby.

359
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,609
And that's my final offer.

360
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,654
That's very generous of you.
You've just did a good thing.

361
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:14,830
Don't act so surprised.

362
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,179
You're amazing.

363
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:18,616
Thank you all for coming.

364
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,397
Excuse me.

365
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,316
Helen!

366
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,491
Romy.

367
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,928
We'll be really quick.

368
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,930
Dr. Kao and I wanted
to fill you in

369
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,932
on some departmental changes.

370
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,672
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,370
As you know,
our departments have

372
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,458
a lot of overlaps.

373
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,286
Yes, our support staff,
for one.

374
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,809
Oh, exactly.

375
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,768
And I plan on downsizing
the support staff

376
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,292
and uncoupling our budgets.

377
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,294
Uncoupling oncology
and urology?

378
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,948
We share almost all
of our equipment.

379
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,384
Dr. Sharpe's right.

380
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,734
Well, we're still share
everything, Helen.

381
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,301
This is just on paper.

382
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,259
Okay, then,
I look forward to seeing it.

383
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,827
And I look forward
to seeing more of you.

384
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,661
If we uncouple out budgets
but downsize support staff,

385
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,358
that means we get the savings
on staff,

386
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,665
but oncology still foots
the bill on equipment.

387
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,058
You're quick.

388
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,408
Oh, and maybe
don't contradict me

389
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,364
when I'm talking
to the other doctors, okay?

390
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,458
Gastric bypass surgery?

391
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,720
Saffy!

392
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,506
And you went behind my back?

393
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,030
And before you start,
our numbers are stellar...

394
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,598
Cholesterol, blood sugar,
all of it.

395
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,600
And do you tell him about
the booty Zumba classes

396
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:30,688
I drive you to twice a week?

397
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,516
It's obviously not working.

398
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,431
Ms. Zaree,

399
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,477
Saffy says that she thinks
you want her to stay fat.

400
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:40,437
Does that sound right to you?

401
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:44,093
Is that what you said?

402
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:55,843
I spent years
starving myself...

403
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,584
hating myself.

404
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,196
And I raised Saffy to know
that healthy and beautiful

405
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,546
can look a lot
of different ways.

406
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,026
But here she is...

407
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,725
Falling right into
that same trap.

408
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,423
You're going
to sign the form, right?

409
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,031
Saffy...

410
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,733
I, uh...

411
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,214
I just... I can't help but wonder

412
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,346
if by signing off
on the surgery,

413
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,870
I'm not just making the world a
harder place for kids like you,

414
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:24,611
for kids like me,

415
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,483
like your mom.

416
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,093
She's here for you.

417
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:31,009
My dad, when I was your age,
he taught me to hate my body.

418
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,402
I was ashamed of it.

419
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,143
He weighed me every day.

420
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:37,711
Why are we talking about you?

421
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:41,019
You're the therapist here.
It's not my problem you're fat.

422
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,369
Saffy! You will not talk
like that in this office.

423
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,371
And my mother's
not supportive.

424
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,895
She just wants me
to look like her...

425
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,507
to make her feel like
being fat is okay.

426
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,162
Being fat is okay.

427
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,294
Then why are you trying
to lose weight?

428
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,259
We are not...

429
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:06,088
We're not here
to talk about me, Saffy.

430
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,046
We're talking about you.

431
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:14,531
Well, I am talking about me,

432
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,356
and you're not listening.

433
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,299
<i>♪ Mm, L.A.</i>

434
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:28,109
<i>♪ Proved too much
for the man ♪</i>

435
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,721
<i>♪ Too much for the man</i>

436
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,288
<i>♪ He couldn't make it</i>

437
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,638
Blasting music in the E.D.
is a really great idea.

438
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,467
Ease of communication
just doesn't matter here.

439
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,469
Sorry.

440
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:43,081
Hey, what do you think
this song is really saying?

441
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,605
I think the title
gets us most of the way there.

442
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:49,827
Yeah, but
could it be something else?

443
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,656
Like... like a metaphor?

444
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,137
In other news,

445
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,748
Niall is now on treatment
for Amanita mushroom poisoning,

446
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,489
and so far, so good.

447
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,491
I'm gonna go give
his quad the update.

448
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,841
Do you think you could be
in one of those, uh,

449
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,843
polyamorous relationships?

450
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,149
Okay.

451
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,108
You are
in a really weird space,

452
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,241
and I like it on you.

453
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,591
Seriously, could you?

454
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,636
I think the jury
is still out on me

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,682
and relationships in general.

456
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,466
You?

457
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,644
There is no way

458
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,125
that I could share my person
with someone else.

459
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,997
And what makes a person yours
to share anyway?

460
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,912
I don't know.

461
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,698
It just seems wrong to me,
like, morally.

462
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,308
Morally, okay.

463
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,181
Not every relationship has
to look like yours and Evie's.

464
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,358
Oh, I think it's better
if they don't.

465
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,668
It's hard to find a person,
period...

466
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,453
let alone share them.

467
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,889
Yeah.

468
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,934
Especially people our age,
you know?

469
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,849
With all this...

470
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,982
history.

471
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,503
History isn't always
a bad thing.

472
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:07,905
- What's happening?
- O-2 sats are dropping.

473
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,385
All right,
we need to intubate.

474
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,169
Which one of you
is his medical proxy?

475
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,431
- Uh...
- Um...

476
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,346
Okay, I need
to do a lung biopsy now.

477
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,523
Who can legally
sign off on that?

478
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,917
His wife.

479
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,571
- He's married?
- To someone else?

480
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:22,746
Don't bring Tweetie
into this.

481
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,226
Tweetie?

482
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,184
Maggie. She left him when he
came out to her as bi.

483
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,230
- She broke his heart.
- They haven't spoken in years.

484
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,536
Listen to me... Niall could die
if we don't figure out

485
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,190
what's really happening,
all right?

486
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,932
Now, whose got
the wife's number?

487
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,155
It is amazing

488
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,244
what a group of students
and protesters

489
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,594
and an impending
TV spectacle can do.

490
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,771
Professor Munsee,
we are naming the lobby

491
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,860
for the Lenape people.

492
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,602
The Lenape legacy will live on.

493
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,125
Hold it.

494
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,471
Hold it?

495
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,523
The Lenape legacy?

496
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,830
The Lenape are not extinct,
Dr. Goodwin,

497
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,571
nor do we intend to be.

498
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,007
Does your sign improve

499
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,271
Native American
access to healthcare?

500
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,793
Does it address
tribal health disparities?

501
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,628
This hospital
has a long way to go

502
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,065
to earn the trust
of patients like me.

503
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,763
Professor Munsee...

504
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,719
please...

505
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,813
Just let me treat
the clot in your leg.

506
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:33,208
That's the only thing I know
for certain I can fix.

507
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,689
So rarely does someone

508
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:41,172
in a position of power
try to make change.

509
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,566
So why would
I let you stop now?

510
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:51,878
Because you could die
while I'm trying.

511
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:58,189
Dying for change...

512
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,887
I couldn't think
of a better legacy.

513
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,982
Uh, Lauren,
sorry to interrupt.

514
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,027
I have a potentially loaded

515
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,594
and inappropriate
question for you.

516
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:12,812
Should I leave?

517
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,379
No, it's fine. He knows.

518
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,467
- He does?
- I do?

519
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,730
Yes,
Floyd and I used to hook up,

520
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,602
but we have no problem
working together,

521
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,821
and, in fact, our relationship
has never been better.

522
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,171
That's not, uh...

523
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,348
Anyway, I have a patient
upstairs right now

524
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,002
that I think would like
to be treated

525
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,352
by a Native American doctor,

526
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,223
but I'm having some trouble
tracking one down.

527
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,486
- "Tracking one down"?
- No, see? So many landmines.

528
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,705
I don't know how to ask

529
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,010
if someone
is Native American or not.

530
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,055
Yeah, you absolutely
shouldn't.

531
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,491
Yeah, don't do that.

532
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:40,710
Yeah, but it would...

533
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:43,016
I'm trying to save
my patient's life.

534
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,801
She won't let me put her
on a heparin drip,

535
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,891
but the more I think about it,
the more I realize she's right.

536
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,936
- Why should she trust me?
- Because you're a doctor.

537
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,982
American doctors
and Native American patients,

538
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,331
not the easiest history,

539
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,202
but if I can find
someone to convince her

540
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,422
to get on that drip,
then I can keep her alive.

541
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,468
Okay, so what
do you need me for?

542
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:03,036
Because I may have heard
a long time ago a little rumor

543
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,519
that you were maybe
a quarter something.

544
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,997
"Shmative Shmishmerican."

545
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,471
No way this ends well
for you.

546
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,532
Wrong kind of Indian,
but I did do ayahuasca once.

547
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,534
Does that count?

548
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,320
Nope.

549
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,452
Seriously?

550
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:31,543
Nope, but some people
think I look like Cher.

551
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:34,372
I'm Jewish.

552
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,110
Mazel tov.

553
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,335
You knew about this,
didn't you?

554
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,553
Oh, boy.

555
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,468
Your new rock star chair
has orchestrated

556
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,252
a little reorg that's
gonna suck the funding

557
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,950
out of oncology
and stick us with the bill

558
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,386
for operational costs.

559
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,390
Dr. Sharpe,
I wasn't in on this, I promise.

560
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,958
But I know she's been
sucking money

561
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,916
out of other departments
and out of patients

562
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,222
who don't have much to give,

563
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,616
and I know that's
not what we do here.

564
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,095
Agnes, you need
to get rid of her

565
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,488
before she systematically
dismantles

566
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,708
every other department
in this hospital.

567
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,840
I agree,
but the board loves her.

568
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,625
Can't you fire her?

569
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,716
- You're deputy medical director.
- Not anymore.

570
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,457
I never should
have hired her.

571
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,588
Wait, you hired her?

572
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,242
Were you even
on the search committee?

573
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,591
No.

574
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,463
No.

575
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,899
No, I wasn't.

576
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,256
Maggie McGuire?

577
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,389
- Hi, I'm Dr. Reynolds.
- How is he?

578
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,695
Well, Niall's
lung biopsy shows

579
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,957
interstitial pneumonitis,

580
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,472
and we're not sure
what's causing it,

581
00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:41,004
but his lungs are enflamed,

582
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,484
and they're getting worse
by the second.

583
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,486
We'd love to be a part
of your private conversation

584
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,705
since the three
of us are still actually

585
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:47,967
in a relationship with him.

586
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,183
Okay, I'm sorry,

587
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:52,797
but legally speaking,
Maggie is the only person here

588
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,321
who has a say in Niall's...

589
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,149
It's pretty insulting
for you cut us out like this,

590
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,760
when we're the ones
who've been here all day

591
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:58,847
worrying about him.

592
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,331
All right, I'm gonna have to
ask you all to leave.

593
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,894
Dr. Reynolds,
they can stay.

594
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,850
I know none of you
think much of me,

595
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,291
and I still don't understand

596
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:10,151
this relationship of yours.

597
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,662
But I'm here now...

598
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,651
Because I still love him.

599
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,042
Maggie, your hand.

600
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,661
African Greys...

601
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,663
My parrots.

602
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,536
- You have parrots?
- Yes.

603
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,929
Quite a few.

604
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,848
I'm sorry I yelled at you,
Dr. Frome...

605
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:45,285
and called you fat
in a negative way.

606
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,175
I shouldn't have done that.

607
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:50,203
Apology accepted.

608
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,205
And I feel like
I should apologize

609
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,773
because I brought my issue
into the discussion,

610
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,688
and that wasn't okay.

611
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,600
Apology accepted.

612
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,173
And I'm going to go ahead
and let Saffy

613
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:06,002
go through
with the gastric bypass.

614
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,221
I mean, what...

615
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:11,224
Are we sure that's a good idea?

616
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,271
I've chosen
to love my body as it is,

617
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:17,927
but I can't impose
that choice on Saffy.

618
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,885
I need to respect
her right to determine

619
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,496
what happens to her body.

620
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,410
Yeah, well,
look, look, you know,

621
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,717
there are a lot of steps
that we can take

622
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,154
before we just jump
into a drastic surgery.

623
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,548
- You mean like therapy?
- Yeah, exactly like therapy.

624
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,375
Saffy is young.

625
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,855
We have a really good shot

626
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,118
at getting you somewhere
great mentally and physically.

627
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,903
You think therapy
is gonna make me happy?

628
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,776
My mom thinks radical
self-acceptance is the answer,

629
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,605
and isn't surgery
an answer, too?

630
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:46,085
It's a risky one...

631
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,566
one that could be a mistake,

632
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,131
a mistake
that you cannot take back.

633
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,530
Well...

634
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,533
It's Saffy's mistake to make,
Dr. Frome.

635
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:03,276
Well, guys, guys, I'm, uh...

636
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,670
I'm not used to my sessions
ending like this. Saffy...

637
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,020
You mean with your
suggestions being ignored?

638
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,283
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

639
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,198
You know, I feel like I've...

640
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,636
I did a disservice
to you somewhere along the way.

641
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,072
I hijacked your issue,

642
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,074
I totally made it about myself,

643
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,772
and, um, I'm doing
that right now, aren't I?

644
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,121
Yeah.

645
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,949
I just feel like I failed...

646
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,603
I failed you.

647
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,650
Sometimes you just
have to own it.

648
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,649
I whiffed it.

649
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,217
You whiffed it.

650
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,788
Yeah.

651
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:46,842
Dr. Goodwin,
how's Professor Jane doing?

652
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,452
Still refusing treatment.

653
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:51,281
Nothing I've tried
has changed her mind.

654
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,805
- Sounds about right.
- Professor Jane's relentless.

655
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:56,591
I even tried reaching out
to Native American personnel

656
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,810
- here at the hospital.
- And how did that go?

657
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,683
Well, we don't have any
Native American personnel

658
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,337
- here at the hospital.
- And you're surprised by this?

659
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,774
To be honest, Doc,
I've never seen

660
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,297
a Native doctor either.

661
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,516
Back in high school,
I told my guidance counselor

662
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,345
I was interested
in medical school.

663
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,218
He handed me a flyer
for landscape design.

664
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,523
Of course he did.

665
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,787
And even if med school
felt like an option,

666
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,572
even if you did get in,
it's expensive, you know.

667
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:24,401
Who's gonna ask their family
to go into more debt?

668
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:26,446
Cool sign, though.

669
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,237
Uh, it's Jane.

670
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,545
O sat's below 80,
and her heart rate's rising.

671
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,199
- Clot's moved to her lungs...
- We need to get her

672
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,853
to the operating room
right now.

673
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,289
Wait, wait.

674
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,644
You're going
to save her, right?

675
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,341
She was ready
to die for this.

676
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,128
If you don't save her,
you'll fail us again.

677
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,923
Why are you standing there?

678
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:09,881
I need to tell you something.

679
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,454
I really looked up to you,

680
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,283
but if modernizing
means milking patients

681
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,676
for all they're worth,

682
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,895
rushing them out of consults
and into admissions,

683
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,810
and if it means fleecing
other departments

684
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,857
out of their budgets...

685
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,772
then I'm not sure
you belong here.

686
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,862
And Dr. Kapoor
may have been old-fashioned,

687
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,951
but his methods are not a joke.

688
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,301
They were hopeful
and compassionate,

689
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:42,305
whereas yours are heartless,
cold, and manipulative.

690
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,699
All right, get to the point.

691
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,961
You're fired.

692
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,532
That's kind of funny.
I didn't know you were funny.

693
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:53,795
No.

694
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,710
I'm not funny.

695
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,190
You're fired.

696
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:00,758
I'm firing you.

697
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,108
Well, I'm sorry, Agnes,
but I don't think

698
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,806
you have the authority.

699
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,677
Well, that's the thing.

700
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,071
I didn't have the authority
to hire you either

701
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,725
or even recommend you
to the board,

702
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,424
which means that I am still
the interim chair of neurology,

703
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,339
and as the interim chair
of neurology,

704
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,384
I am terminating
your interim employment.

705
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,343
You can leave your keys
and I.D. badge

706
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:21,736
with security on your way out.

707
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,259
Oh.

708
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,874
How are you feeling?

709
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,834
Yeah.

710
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,574
Fantastic.

711
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:37,099
Thanks.

712
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:40,058
You have psittacosis,
Niall...

713
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:44,277
also known as parrot fever.

714
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,849
Maggie.

715
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,199
Maggie, indeed.

716
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,723
Oh, God.

717
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,508
They won't be happy.

718
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:58,685
And we haven't even done
anything, Maggie and me.

719
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,470
Just talked.

720
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,080
Well...

721
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,996
I thought polyamory
was all about freedom...

722
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,474
letting people be themselves.

723
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,916
You know, I spent years
putting labels on myself,

724
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,223
monogamous, polyamorous,

725
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,657
bisexual, but now...

726
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,706
I want those three
beautiful beings out there...

727
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,236
And I want Maggie.

728
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,847
I can't apologize for that,

729
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,716
but I also can't find
a label for it.

730
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:38,116
And you feel like
you need a label

731
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,206
to explain what you want?

732
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,600
It's terrifying
to ask for something

733
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,342
when you can't put
a name to it,

734
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,083
but there you go.

735
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,737
I'm a greedy bastard.

736
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,739
I want them all.

737
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,570
I love them all.

738
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,921
Just don't know
what to tell them.

739
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,230
I think you tell them that.

740
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,285
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,633
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

742
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,249
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

743
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,084
Hi, Professor Jane.

744
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:40,483
Why am I still here?

745
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,007
That blood clot
in your leg broke free

746
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,748
and traveled to your lungs.

747
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,402
We had to do
a pulmonary artery embolectomy

748
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,969
to get it out.

749
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,798
It was clear to me,
to all of us,

750
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:56,499
that your life
mattered more than your death.

751
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,850
You really don't listen,
do you?

752
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:03,503
400 years,
they mean nothing to you?

753
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,206
I can't make up
for what this country did

754
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,208
to you and your family,

755
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:14,299
but after listening
to your students...

756
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:17,041
I think I may have found
a way forward.

757
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,347
Have you heard

758
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:21,002
of the Jane Munsee
Medical Pathways Program?

759
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,826
No.

760
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,832
Well, that makes sense.

761
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,270
I just came up with it
about an hour ago.

762
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,837
It's this amazing
new program that gives

763
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:33,188
Native American students
shadowing programs

764
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,755
and scholarships
and test prep courses

765
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,671
and a direct pipeline
into the medical profession.

766
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,152
And the way the new students
pay it forward

767
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,241
is by giving back,

768
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:45,069
mentoring local
and tribal schools.

769
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:48,072
A living, breathing new wave...

770
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,335
of Native American doctors.

771
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,381
Like me?

772
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,032
Like you.

773
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,212
Well...

774
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,000
It's a start.

775
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,482
Start.

776
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,484
It's a good start.

777
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:16,100
I'm so glad I was here
to see it.

778
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,536
Me too.

779
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:28,243

I'm sorry your day
was so weird.

795
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,457
Oh, so weird.

796
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,329
So weird. I whiffed it.

797
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,679
- Their words, not mine.
- Oof.

798
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:14,724
Yeah.

799
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:15,942
What about you? How's yours?

800
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,554
Uh, I had
a tremendous breakthrough

801
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:19,946
with a new patient.

802
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,689
He's a combat vet,
so you can imagine the PTSD.

803
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,952
- Mm.
- But he wants to get better.

804
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,474
In fact, I'm seeing
him tomorrow.

805
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,351
Is that his hat?

806
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:37,225
Oh, uh,
he left his hat in my office.

807
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,358
His name wouldn't happen to
be Chance Becker, would it?

808
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,536
Uh, yeah, how'd you know?

809
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,761
I do hope
you've made some progress.

810
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,284
I...

811
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,157
I did with most of them,
I promise.

812
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,072
Mina?

813
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,291
These are all people.

814
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,769
Each one.

815
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,121
This is a long file.

816
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:14,784
I knew her...

817
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,178
For years.

818
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,046
I knew her children.

819
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,013
She died.

820
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,630
She just died.

821
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:39,069
There's a drawer over there
for inactive files.

822
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,811
You mean dead people.

823
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,726
Yes.

824
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,901
How do you do this
every day?

825
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,908
Don't you get sad?

826
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,605
It's part of being a doctor.

827
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,825
I just have to put
some things away.

828
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:58,567
Well, I don't want
to do that.

829
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,786
I don't want to forget!

830
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,481
I can't!

831
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,318
Mina...

832
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,364
I'm so stupid!

833
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:15,192
Coming here to you,

834
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,151
I thought it would
make things better,

835
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,413
but nothing gets better!

836
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,024
It's just worse!

837
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:24,419
Every day it gets worse!

838
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,897
My baba is gone.

839
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:30,990
Mina.

840
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,514
Mina...

841
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,863
My baba is gone.

842
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,268
Come here.

843
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,155
You know, if you keep
taking my spot up here,

844
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,244
I don't know where
I'm gonna solve

845
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,115
all the world's problems.

846
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,769
So you didn't
change the name

847
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:14,120
- of the hospital, I take it.
- Surprisingly, no.

848
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,296
How'd you do?

849
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,037
Well...

850
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:21,215
I traumatized a child.

851
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,436
Makes you feel any better,

852
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,743
I'll probably do that
when I get home.

853
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,487
I stupidly brought
her into the hospital,

854
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:35,272
not realizing that...

855
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:39,189
being here,
the illness, the death,

856
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:42,627
it would take her right back
to losing her father.

857
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,326
I should have seen it coming.
I should have...

858
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,762
I should have protected her.

859
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,242
I don't think
we can protect our kids

860
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,419
from that kind of pain.

861
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,033
I couldn't.

862
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,608
But it helps not to be alone.

863
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,626
I'm sorry about Cassian.

864
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:32,895
I don't know what to... say.

865
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,810
I mean, we never talk about it.

866
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:16,068
Max...

867
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:17,418
Yeah?

868
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:24,294
What you said earlier...

869
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,427
What... what did I say?

870
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:31,693
I'm really glad
that we're friends.

871
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,266
Me too.

872
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:01,026
What are you doing?

873
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,203
I have been packing
and unpacking all day.

874
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,858
- Oh, come on.
- But I decided I'm leaving.

875
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:08,991
No, come on, don't do this.

876
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,341
I am so sorry
for this morning.

877
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:14,518
- No, no, don't be.
- I made you run out of here...

878
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:15,650
- Your own house.
- No.

879
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,434
I made you feel...

880
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,349
Surprised, okay?

881
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,745
I was just surprised.

882
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,663
What, that I like you?

883
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,491
No.

884
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,757
I'm just surprised that...

885
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,498
it felt normal.

886
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,589
I'm not used to normal...

887
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,504
or real.

888
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:51,682
You think...

889
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:54,123
this is real?

890
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:02,653
I've been thinking about you
all day.

891
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,792
And I don't think that you
should walk out that door.

892
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:12,611
Why not?
