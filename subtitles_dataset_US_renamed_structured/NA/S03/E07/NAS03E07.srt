1
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,526
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,017
- Whoa.
- Oh, hello.

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,214
Oh, sorry, I had
the TV on pause earlier.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,891
Now it's not the only thing
you have on pause.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,697
- What's wrong?
- Where is that thing?

6
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,534
I need to turn this off.
There we go.

7
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,449
Hey, Martin.

8
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,111
Hey.

9
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:41,150
I like seeing you.

10
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,924
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,494
Yeah, Martin, I can't.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,145
I can't.

13
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,807
You don't have to apologize.

14
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,924
I'm sorry, I just,
you know.

15
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,633
I love you, I just...
These issues are...

16
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:07,299
I know.
I said...

17
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,374
you don't have to apologize.

18
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,860
I get it.

19
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,127
Really.

20
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,745
It's late anyway.

You will make it end."

Those words
were written in 1985

33
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,651
as this hospital faced,

34
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:07,085
not the crisis we're in now,

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,627
but a different one:

36
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,785
The AIDS epidemic.

37
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:16,119
So, here to honor
National HIV Testing Day,

38
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,651
please welcome
the man who wrote those words.

39
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,260
My personal hero,

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,635
the former Medical Director
of New Amsterdam,

41
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:25,872
Dr. George Helms.

42
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,630
Yes! All right!

43
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,299
Whoo!

44
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:33,337
Thank you, Dr. Goodwin.

45
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,197
I'm so proud

46
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:42,687
to be here on a day
when we offer free care

47
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,378
to every HIV patient

48
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,604
that has come through
these doors.

49
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:50,980
Undocumented, uninsured,
under-insured.

50
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:54,683
It's top-to-toe coverage,
and it's on the house.

51
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:58,468
<i>Yes, amazing.</i>

52
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,080
Luna's banned from daycare.

53
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,307
Banned?
C-can't you just give her

54
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:07,624
a detention or something?

55
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,066
I'm sorry, Max, but
we take biting very seriously.

56
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,195
- Biting?
- Especially repeat offenders.

57
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,941
She's teething.
She's not a felon.

58
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,347
Look, let me come up there,
and I will calm her down,

59
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,722
and then you can give her
a second chance.

60
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,058
We've given her three.

61
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,246
Three?

62
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,465
Is any family around?

63
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,380
My in-laws, but, uh,

64
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,484
you know what
our hours are like.

65
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,065
If she's not here,
I'm never gonna...

66
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:28,609
I'm never gonna see her.

67
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,401
Marsha,
I don't have a plan B.

68
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,290
Neither do I, Max.
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,031
I'll bring up Luna.

70
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,618
Ig, Ig, look.

71
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,925
I told Casey I'd be out of
the E.D. for like, ten minutes.

72
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,318
Yeah, no, any second now
he's gonna

73
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,928
walk through that door
and his sweet smile's

74
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,799
gonna light up that perfectly
round bald head of his, kay?

75
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,628
Surprise!

76
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:55,909
Shut the door, shut the...

77
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,378
- He's not here yet?
- Nope, nope.

78
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,776
Ig, look, I really got to go.

79
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,068
Fudge. No, no, no.

80
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,548
Let me text Ella one more time.
Don't... don't eat those.

81
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,115
- Say hi for me.
- Um, you know what?

82
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,682
Actually I just wanted to
pop my head in real quick,

83
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:05,900
- and I got to get back to work.
- Wait, wait, guys.

84
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,728
Have you forgotten that
he almost died?

85
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:09,643
Okay, he had COVID,
he had open heart surgery,

86
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,254
then he battled through
a hellish rehab.

87
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,690
Now today,
our friend is coming back here

88
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,300
and I want to celebrate him
for ten minutes

89
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,475
of your time, please.

90
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,607
- Surprise!
- Aah!

91
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,738
- Shoot!
- Sorry I'm late,

92
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,218
- I was working on my toast.
- Agnes...

93
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,698
- What, he's not here yet?
- No.

94
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,065
Yeah, you know what?
Give him my love.

95
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:23,182
- Just give him my love.
- C'mon, Floyd...

96
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,003
Just tell him to come into
the E.D. and say hey.

97
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,530
Oh, Brunstetter,
you're back on too.

98
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,253
Let me grab one more
of these pastry things,

99
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:29,964
- and then I am right behind you.
- They're called laddu

100
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,274
and they're decorative,
Brunstetter.

101
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,971
God, what is wrong
with you people?

102
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,366
Ten minutes! Guys, ten min...
Shut the door, at least.

103
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,009
Just...

104
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,195
Great, now it says "Kapoop."

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,372
And then you start placing
one on each of the seats.

106
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,243
Oh, and please don't
forget the pens, okay?

107
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,649
Thank you.

108
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,289
Uh, why are you all jittery?

109
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,074
Because we're
about to be hit

110
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,685
with an influx of HIV patients,

111
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,252
and with 6 feet
between each chair,

112
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,298
I'm not sure we have enough
hallway to accommodate them.

113
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,082
No, you know what?
This feels more like

114
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,388
the kind of freak-out you have

115
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:01,347
when you're 24 hours away
from becoming a mum.

116
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,219
Yes, Mina is coming tomorrow

117
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,090
but I'm not her mum,
I'm her aunt.

118
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,527
And a cool aunt doesn't
freak out, thank you.

119
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,529
Uh,
she's a 16-year-old girl.

120
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,749
You're never gonna be
a cool anything.

121
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,072
Oh, shush.
I just mean I'm gonna provide

122
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,709
a calm, accepting environment.

123
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,321
My role isn't to control her
life, it's to follow her lead.

124
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,908
And whatever may come,
this cool aunt

125
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:21,409
- is just gonna roll with it.
- Ammeh Helen?

126
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:27,242
Mina. I'm...

127
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,362
I thought that you were
coming tomorrow.

128
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,720
I flew standby.
I thought I'd surprise you.

129
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:35,047
Hi.

130
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,036
Um, yes, yes, you did.
I just, um...

131
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,157
Oh! I just wish you'd called.

132
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,000
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

133
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,438
Full refund from the venue
and from the caterer.

134
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,658
Damn. What'd you have to do
to pull that off?

135
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:51,919
I played the

136
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,313
"His mom has diabetes
and he broke" card.

137
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,141
I'm not broke.

138
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,971
- Just say thank you, Floyd.
- Oh, I thank you.

139
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:01,842
So what's left on the
cancelled wedding checklist?

140
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,061
Nothing.

141
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,110
All our business
is officially handled.

142
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,230
- We're done.
- Good, all right.

143
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,374
- How's Mama Nola?
- Mama Nola's good.

144
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,028
Yeah, she's, uh, she's good.

145
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,334
And what about Floyd?

146
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,901
Is he good?

147
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,816
Uh...

148
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,600
Incoming.

149
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:21,775
Oh, uh, Evie,
we got incoming.

150
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,690
- I got to go.
- Go do your thing.

151
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,302
Kwame Adu. Passed out
at HIV testing upstairs.

152
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,173
Pulse 140 and thready.

153
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,566
Kwame, I'm Dr. Bloom.

154
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,481
You're in New Amsterdam E.D.
We're gonna take

155
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,917
- good care of you, okay?
- Okay.

156
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,266
Okay, let's get him
on the bed.

157
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,399
- Take a look at these.
- Okay, nice and easy.

158
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,222
- Okay.
- Nice and easy.

159
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,594
- Hey, Kwame.
- Yes?

160
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,275
We got the results from
the HIV test you just took.

161
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,176
- Uh-huh.
- It's positive.

162
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,853
No.

163
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,371
No, that... that can't be true.

164
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,592
Kwame, I'm sure it's not
the result that you wanted,

165
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,203
but HIV isn't a death sentence
anymore.

166
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,683
It's manageable.

167
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,947
- This can't be happening.
- Hey, hey, hey.

168
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,712
Look, just take it easy,
all right?

169
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,268
That test is wrong.

170
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,125
Okay, but the results
also say that

171
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,518
your pancreas is damaged.

172
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,867
That's why you're sick,
all right?

173
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,739
- You just need to relax.
- That test is wrong!

174
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,654
- Okay...
- Okay? Okay?

175
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:17,396
Just... Kwame, Kwame,
just have a seat right here.

176
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,702
Kwame!

177
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,971
If you don't get treatment,
you could die.

178
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,236
Okay, let him go, okay?

179
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,894
You can't keep him here
against his will.

180
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,361
His pancreas
is gonna explode.

181
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,666
Then he's gonna be back.

182
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,604
Mariana,
get Trauma room one

183
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:29,985
ready for an acute
pancreatitis.

184
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,386
Yes.

185
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,195
Uh, look out.

186
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:35,719
Oh, no, sorry about that.

187
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,373
Hey. Hey, hey, Luna.

188
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,893
Running from Dada is a bad,
bad move.

189
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,551
It's not very good, okay?
If you keep doing it,

190
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,011
you're gonna be on time out.

191
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,511
Hey, that's just the way
the world works.

192
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,383
Come here. There are rules.

193
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,168
And we got to follow
the rules, okay?

194
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,596
And when people do bad things,

195
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,171
they don't just get to...

196
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,837
To get away with it.

197
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:10,400
Dr. Val! Uh, any word on
the blood bank records?

198
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,319
Yeah, here you go.

199
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:12,756
All we got on
Howie Cournemeyer.

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,192
Interesting stuff.

201
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:15,411
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, she is.

202
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,064
Until she gnaws your face off.

203
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,916
Howie Cournemeyer
donated blood in 1986.

204
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,066
- This is interesting why?
- Oh, it's much less the when

205
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,220
than the how much.

206
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,508
A thousand pints in a month?
What, is he a whale?

207
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:28,294
His blood type keeps changing.
Sometimes in a single day.

208
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,071
Oh, yeah, that whole thing's
total B.S.

209
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,859
Not sure how it'll help you
catch a vandal though.

210
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,209
- Okay, check this out.
- His blood type changes,

211
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,454
but his address stays the same
on almost every donation.

212
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,935
Max with
the detective skills.

213
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,635
Well, it's all about
keen skills of observation.

214
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,149
Like I'm observing
your kid eating a plant?

215
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,978
- Hey, um...
- Hey.

216
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,534
What if I started
chewing on you?

217
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:51,189
That's enough plant-based
eating for one day.

218
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,393
Okay, come here.
So we are daycare-less.

219
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:57,579
And, uh, recent development,
we don't have a plan B.

220
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,790
Great story. Sign these.

221
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,149
- Um, you love kids.
- Very much the opposite.

222
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,543
Right. Let me rephrase that.

223
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,764
You love being my assistant,
right?

224
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,771
Yes, it's my childhood dream
come true.

225
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,775
We would love to hang out
with you, Sandra.

226
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,603
- 'Cause you're so cool.
- No.

227
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,694
Really? Please?
I'm begging you.

228
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,949
- Kay, try cash.
- Yeah, okay. I'll pay you.

229
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,692
Double? Triple. Quadruple.
Whatever it takes.

230
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,260
Please. Please take my baby.

231
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,741
- You're the best.
- What?

232
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,971
She's the sweetest thing
in the world.

233
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,973
Watch out,
she does bite sometimes.

234
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,999
- Don't drop her. Food, water.
- I've...

235
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:30,598
Hello.

236
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,878
- So sorry.
- I'm sure this isn't

237
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:39,501
how you imagined spending
your first day in America.

238
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:43,157
But I-I have a patient
who's in rough shape

239
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:45,421
so if you need me,
I'll be in the Oncology...

240
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,269
What's... what's funny?

241
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,657
It's just like watching

243
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:56,138
- Dr. Helen on TV.
- Ah.

244
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,142
My father would watch you
sometimes, and...

245
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,624
he'd say,
"Look, that's your Ammeh."

246
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,322
But it just felt so odd.

247
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,782
Like if he said my Amoo was

248
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,728
Ryan Seacrest or something.

249
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:13,000
Uh, well. Look, if, um,

250
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,906
if it feels odd,

251
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,796
calling me "ammeh," then, um,

252
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,485
p-please don't.

253
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,793
But that would be
disrespectful.

254
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,890
No, no, no.
No, I'm asking you to.

255
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,796
Um, I should be more like your

256
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,757
big sister or your friend.

257
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,828
Your friend Helen.

258
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:33,880
That's what you should call me.

259
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,926
Just Helen.

260
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,500
"Just Helen,"

261
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,914
I know it's rude to be
so direct,

262
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,734
but can I get some tea?

263
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,976
Oh, yes.

264
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,250
Um, course.
You don't even have to ask.

265
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,892
The cafeteria's on
the fourth floor.

266
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:53,054
- Cool.
- Yeah.

267
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,956
It is cool.

268
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:58,535
Hi, yes, I am in
desperate need of a nanny,

269
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,496
and I heard you guys
are the best agency around.

270
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,890
No, thank you.

271
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,132
Well, I'm looking for
someone in the mid-town area.

272
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,718
Uh, let's see,
teaching experience is a must.

273
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,112
Bilingual is great.

274
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,158
Trilingual is better.

275
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,509
Uh, what else?
CPR certified, obviously.

276
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:15,355
And, uh, oh!
Like a wizard with vegetables.

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,011
I mean an actual wizard.

278
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,451
Great.

279
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,846
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, that's amazing.

280
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,662
Um, um, starting tomorrow,
if you have it.

281
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,087
What... when you say
"ten-month waiting list,"

282
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:36,469
do you mean actual months
or is that a figure of speech?

283
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,660
Yeah?

284
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,444
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

285
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:44,578
Hi, are you Howie Cournemeyer?

286
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,555
- Yeah.
- I'm Max Goodwin,

287
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,507
Medical Director
at New Amsterdam.

288
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:51,549
I knew you bastards
would come for me one day.

289
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:56,546
I walk in this morning
with HIV,

290
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,244
and now I have cancer, too?

291
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,618
I mean this can't be happening.
I can't even pronounce it.

292
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,161
Hemangiosarcoma.

293
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,134
And we don't know for certain
that's what you have.

294
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,381
Okay, then
what do you think I do?

295
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,122
I mean, you just found a lump.
That could be anything, right?

296
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:11,300
Hemangiosarcoma often occurs
when HIV goes undertreated.

297
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:14,434
We won't know anything
for sure until your MRI.

298
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,566
HIV is not supposed to be
a big deal anymore.

299
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,916
I mean, I've been on
my cocktail for years

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,744
and I've been fine.
Now I miss a few check-ups

301
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:23,312
- and I might die?
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

302
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:28,047
Oh, my God, what's happening?

303
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,841
Okay, can somebody
help please?

304
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,959
Get her to the E.D.!

305
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:36,922
He's back. No pulse.

306
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,153
They found him
in a parking lot.

307
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,750
V-TACH.
Charging at 360.

308
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,243
Shockable rhythm present.

309
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,551
- Clear.
- Clear.

310
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,988
Shocking.

311
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,253
Screen for.

312
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,585
Airway is patent.

313
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,822
He's back.

314
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,046
- Normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse ox, 97.

315
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:58,919
Kwame.

316
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,575
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- Are you all right?

317
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,705
- No, out. You need to be out.
- I'm responsible for him.

318
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,962
- You don't have a mask!
- I'm the president of

319
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,580
his mission for
the Church of Jesus Christ.

320
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:08,270
- Elder Shumway.
- It's gonna be okay.

321
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,576
I'm here.

322
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,360
I'll get the lidocaine
drip ready.

323
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,006
Tell me what happened.

324
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,539
I can't.

325
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,070
You can tell me anything.

326
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,429
Remember?

327
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:25,578
I was...

328
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,593
with a man.

329
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,742
I have HIV.

330
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:47,526
Please don't send me back.

331
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,007
I want to finish my mission.

332
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,575
The Church is all I have.
God is all I have.

333
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,608
Then why did you
turn your back on Him?

334
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,546
Your mission is over.

335
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,148
Elder Shumway, please.

336
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,329
Please! Please.

337
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,203
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

338
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,321
Vijay! Oh, hey.

339
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:20,367
What's up? What's wrong?

340
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,977
He's not coming.

341
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,930
No, I don't know. He probably
just forgot his glasses

342
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,344
and he headed back
to get them...

343
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,308
I just got an email.

344
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:31,658
The whole neurology
department did.

345
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,125
Dr. Kapoor just resigned.

346
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,656
He's not coming back.

347
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,265
Ever.

348
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:58,539
Okay, here's what
I think is happening.

349
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,079
I think
you're embarrassed because

350
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,644
you and I talk every day.

351
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,742
And now you're worried
that I'm gonna be mad

352
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,219
because you've been lying to me
literally the entire time.

353
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,782
But I'm not. I'm not mad.

354
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,672
I know that you have
one of those

355
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:13,437
ancient answering machines
that you can actually hear me

356
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:14,884
leaving a message for you
right now.

357
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:16,790
You can hear me talking.
So just pick up.

358
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,420
I'm not mad,
I swear I'm not mad.

359
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,143
Okay, you know what?
I am mad.

360
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,971
I'm pissed.
I'm furious with you

361
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,581
because I'm your best friend.

362
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,649
You told the entire
neurology department

363
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,498
that you were resigning
before you told me.

364
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:30,717
Y-you still haven't told me

365
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,024
because you won't
pick up the phone!

366
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,766
Pick up the phone, Vijay!

367
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:38,203
Do you want to know
where I was when

368
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,758
I heard your
little announcement?

369
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,337
I was at your surprise party.
Surprise!

370
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,306
I planned you a party
that you didn't show up to.

371
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,454
And you know, I don't...
I don't deserve this.

372
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,952
Vijay, I do not deserve this.

373
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:50,258
Unless I'm just your
deluded work friend

374
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,304
who's been putting himself
on for years.

375
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:53,879
In that case, by all means...

376
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,519
Oh, n...

377
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,109
Oops. I forgot yours.

378
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,953
Um, Mr. Cournemeyer.

379
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,430
Howie, listen...

380
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,125
No, you listen.
I'm not scared of you.

381
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,976
I knew what I was doing
was against the law.

382
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,238
That was the point.

383
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,066
You're way too young
to remember any of this.

384
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,547
But back in the '80s,
at the height of AIDS?

385
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,352
The healthcare industry
failed its patients.

386
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:21,855
New Amsterdam
failed its patients.

387
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,465
Gay men
were treated like lepers.

388
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,946
Your nurses wouldn't even touch
friends of mine with AIDS.

389
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,984
Just left them alone
in the corners to die.

390
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,176
Let me assure you...

391
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,493
Big pharma?
Boy, do not get me started...

392
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:32,779
I think that train's
left the station.

393
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,520
Big pharma profiteered

394
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:37,218
off the gay community's
desperation to survive.

395
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:39,820
So I decided to fight
on behalf of those who had it.

396
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:42,485
I became an activist.
Then I joined ACT UP.

397
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,961
And we did
what we had to do.

398
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,966
To make things right,
to make some noise.

399
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,707
And, so, yeah.

400
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,014
That's why I stole
the New Amsterdam seal.

401
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,973
And why I encased it
in a gigantic condom.

402
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:55,309
And no,
I will never give it back.

403
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,197
Wow, that's, uh,

404
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:00,938
impressive, actually.

405
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,722
But not why I'm here.

406
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,071
No.

407
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,218
Not for the... big condom.

408
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:13,254
Uh, Mr. Cournemeyer,
I came here to ask you

409
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:14,560
how,

410
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,128
in March of '86,
you orchestrated a scheme

411
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:20,368
to donate a thousand pints
of blood under your name?

412
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,468
What?
I would never have

413
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,701
donated a single drop
of my blood to your hospital,

414
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:26,876
even to make a point.

415
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,269
But then why is your name...

416
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:32,099
Come to think of it,
March of '86, I was in jail.

417
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:36,016
I demanded a coordinated
national policy to fight AIDS

418
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,409
by chaining myself
to the Statehouse doors.

419
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:39,742
They heard me.

420
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,026
In jail.

421
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:43,401
Wrong guy, Doc.

422
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:47,375
Esophageal?

423
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,016
No negative interactions.

424
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,493
I'm thinking
variceal bleeding,

425
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:53,772
likely from liver cancer.

426
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,429
BP's dropping.
Have you got that tube in yet?

427
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:59,257
- I'm trying.
- STEMI ruled out at this time.

428
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,607
Looks a bit more distal.

429
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,348
About 2 centimeters
should do it.

430
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,828
Right...

431
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,527
- There.
- Got it?

432
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,050
I think so.

433
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:12,226
We should know
once the bleeding stops.

434
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,967
It's good for now.

435
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,970
Fingers crossed that it holds.

436
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,164
How did she let herself
get so bad?

437
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:22,345
Because apparently
"HIV isn't scary anymore."

438
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,965
Yeah, I guess some people
need to be scared.

439
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:30,883
Have a seat.

440
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,484
I can't tell you about faith.

441
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,788
But I saw what your Elder did.

442
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,921
You shouldn't have to repent
to someone who abandoned you

443
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,476
at a time when
you needed him the most.

444
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,262
Elder Shumway
loves me like a father.

445
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,937
He knew I was gay.

446
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,399
He treated me with grace
and acceptance.

447
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,823
All he asked of me was
to not act on my desires.

448
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:01,398
He did not turn his back.

449
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,426
I did.

450
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:06,728
I threw God away.

451
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,101
And this disease,

452
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,763
it means I will never
get God back.

453
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,046
Is there a pill?

454
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:22,862
A surgery?

455
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,559
Anything to scrape these

456
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,170
disgusting urges
out of my body?

457
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,983
Kwame, Kwame.

458
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,262
Brother,
this is not disgusting.

459
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,742
This is who you are.

460
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,960
Sex is not who I am.

461
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,860
I am my community.

462
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,927
My family, my faith.

463
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:46,407
I am an Elder

464
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:50,150
in the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints.

465
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,978
That is who I am.

466
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:54,286
That is not that simple.

467
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,375
But it is that simple.

468
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,330
Think of the one thing

469
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,109
you can't live without.

470
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,789
That is who you are.

471
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:14,835
Well, so I gave it
some thought,

472
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,142
and I realized I was being

473
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,329
way too stringent with
the nanny requirements,

474
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,188
so here's what
I'm looking for now.

475
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:23,575
Anyone. I will take anyone.
Do you... do you have anyone?

476
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,633
Dr. Val!
Ma'am, I will take

477
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,361
a well-trained Saint Bernard
at this point.

478
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:28,667
Okay, thank you very much.

479
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:31,278
So Howie couldn't really
shed any light.

480
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,063
He did have
a giant condom situation.

481
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,413
Not really sure what
that's about,

482
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:36,936
but I'll deal with that
tomorrow.

483
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,242
- Makes sense.
- Does it?

484
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,287
I need to track down the head

485
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:43,203
of the blood bank from 1986,
and problem is,

486
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,292
his information
on his W-2 is outdated,

487
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,120
so I was wondering if you
could ask the older staff.

488
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,339
Maybe they know him?

489
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:49,818
Oh, yeah, sure thing.
What's the name?

490
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:51,559
Uh, Dale Rustin.

491
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:53,431
- You sure?
- Yeah, why? You know him?

492
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:55,694
No, but the whole blood
bank's been talking about him.

493
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:58,218
- He's upstairs.
- He still works here?

494
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:00,641
No, he's a patient.
He's dying.

495
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:07,488
I'm sorry about
that last phone call.

496
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:10,608
Um, I didn't mean to
dump all that on you.

497
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,527
I love you,
and I hope that you are okay.

498
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,880
But I gotta draw
a boundary here, Vijay.

499
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:27,987
You need to pick up the phone,
right now,

500
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:33,471
or you and I can't ever be

501
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:36,430
the same kind of friends
anymore.

502
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:37,896
At all, really.

503
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,035
So pick up the phone.

504
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,001
Pick up the phone, Vijay.

505
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:17,283
Stage III Astrocytoma.

506
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,155
I'm sorry to hear that.

507
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:25,596
"New Amsterdam.
Shame then, shame now."

508
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,513
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

509
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:38,666
I had worse things to say
about Medical Director Helms,

510
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,800
but kids do use that hallway.

511
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:44,324
Dr. Helms is a pillar
of this hospital.

512
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:48,415
So you don't want to
explain yourself?

513
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,156
You just want to
slander him anonymously?

514
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,854
I'd slander him to his face

515
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,509
if I thought anybody
would care.

516
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:58,193
Try me.

517
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:05,519
In 1986,
this hospital needed blood.

518
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:08,290
As so many did.

519
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:15,224
But sexually active gay men

520
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:18,140
were banned from donating it
in this country,

521
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:22,493
even if they knew they were
HIV-negative.

522
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:23,842
That's not Helms' fault.

523
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:25,931
It's...

524
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:27,062
It's the way
the world was then.

525
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,195
Gay men can't donate

526
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,373
convalescent plasma
for COVID right now.

527
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,375
So you tell me,

528
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:38,335
what exactly changed?

529
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:42,324
I'm fine.

530
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:50,999
I was a gay HIV-negative man.

531
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,422
My friends were dying.

532
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,166
They needed blood.

533
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:02,562
I couldn't donate.

534
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:09,612
I was the head of
the damn blood bank.

535
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:15,284
You know what that feels like?

536
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:18,766
A person has to do something.

537
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,581
Has to act.

538
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:24,598
Like Howie Cournemeyer?

539
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:33,346
Howie was fearless.

540
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,130
I never met him,

541
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:38,747
but God, was he inspiring.

542
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,443
He made it so simple.

543
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:47,169
Just do something.

544
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:49,623
Act up.

545
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,785
And I did.

546
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:59,241
You had gay men
hide their identities

547
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:00,888
and donate

548
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:03,805
using Howie's name.

549
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,618
That's the best thing to do
in a plague.

550
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:09,861
Give.

551
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,607
Help.

552
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,318
I got to see scared men
going from

553
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:19,513
helpless to heroes,

554
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:22,099
drop by drop.

555
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:26,146
Until...

556
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:28,497
Helms found out.

557
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:31,552
He said he'd fire me.

558
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,997
My staff too.

559
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:38,419
Howie Cournemeyer
would have kept fighting,

560
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,990
but I needed my job.

561
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,272
So I shut the program down.

562
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,117
And that's something
I have to live with

563
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,540
for the rest of my life.

564
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,289
You refilled this hospital's
blood bank

565
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:05,641
in under a month
during a pandemic.

566
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,478
You're a hero.

567
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:13,867
Yet you honor the man
that made me a coward.

568
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:20,874
The world is burning,
Dr. Goodwin.

569
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,068
And you spend your day
hunting me down

570
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,970
for defacing a photograph?

571
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:37,238
Shame then, shame now.

572
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,074
You came back.

573
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:51,339
Reynolds?

574
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,371
What was that?

575
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:57,316
What Kwame wants
more than anything

576
00:26:57,455 --> 00:27:00,308
is to be a Mormon husband
to a Mormon wife,

577
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:01,801
and he thought he lost that.

578
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,715
He has lost that.
He's gay.

579
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,280
No, no.
He thought he lost that

580
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:07,282
because he's HIV-positive,

581
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:09,676
and he thought that meant
that he couldn't have children.

582
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,897
Which is the cornerstone
of his spiritual community.

583
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,855
Gay people can have children.

584
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:18,337
But between HART therapy
and PrEP, of course,

585
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,035
HIV can be untransmittable
and safe for conception.

586
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,516
So I called the Elder,
let him know that,

587
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,605
and he feels
there's a path for Kwame.

588
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,972
He even suggested
that he can marry a woman

589
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,335
who knows about his struggles.

590
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:33,516
Are you kidding me?

591
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,441
You used the science of HIV

592
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:38,097
to put someone
back into the closet.

593
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,824
Well, that's...
That's what he wants.

594
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:43,405
So if he wanted to shoot
himself in the head,

595
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:45,190
where would you have
stood on that?

596
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:47,449
What if he wanted to leave
the E.D.

597
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,802
with a failing pancreas?

598
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:51,756
You think I like this?
I don't.

599
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,807
But we can't pick and choose
when to respect

600
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:55,156
our patient's wishes.

601
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,185
And being a Mormon
is more important to Kwame

602
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,465
than his sexuality.

603
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,510
Well, the guy he had
unprotected sex with

604
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:03,512
- disagrees with you.
- Oh, come on.

605
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:05,819
Nobody's torturing him.
He's choosing this.

606
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:06,989
Yes.

607
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:09,183
Yeah, he is choosing a life

608
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:11,425
based on the idea
that he has to

609
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:13,958
be somebody that he's not.

610
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:17,178
Because there's something wrong
with who he is.

611
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,007
Look, I get what you were
trying to do here, Floyd,

612
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:23,917
but we're talking about
his heart.

613
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:41,115
Well, hello there.

614
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,553
So, I noticed that
you went out earlier.

615
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:47,295
Yes. With Kevin.
He's my old friend.

616
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:49,515
- Your old friend?
- Yes.

617
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,125
You've been in New York
five hours,

618
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,344
and you've got an old friend?

619
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:53,475
He's a friend
from the internet.

620
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,216
From when we were kids.

621
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,654
I see. And he's, um,

622
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,612
how old?

623
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,397
I'm not sure.
Can I go to your office now?

624
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,749
Mina.
Did you get my texts?

625
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,576
I was busy.

626
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,100
Busy.

627
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:10,754
Is there a problem?

628
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:13,191
I thought you said to
treat you like a friend.

629
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:14,583
Yep, absolutely.

630
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,482
And I didn't text any of my friends
to tell them

631
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,929
- that I was hanging out with Kevin.
- Yes, no, of course.

632
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,328
It's just, um,

633
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,278
you've never
been to New York before.

634
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:25,238
Oh, it's a lot like Tehran,
just a little less crowded.

635
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,591
I'll see you when you're done?

636
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,430
Max, you wanted to see me.

637
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:37,723
Hey, George.
I, uh...

638
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,951
I heard about
Howie Cournemeyer.

639
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,106
Oh, I know how that looks.

640
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,750
If I let that continue
for one more day,

641
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,653
it would have been
an unmitigated disaster.

642
00:29:55,578 --> 00:30:00,281
It did circumvent a ugly,
very discriminatory regulation.

643
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,415
No, no, it violated
federal policy.

644
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:04,633
I may have been a maverick,

645
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:06,766
but I wasn't about to
become a criminal.

646
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,204
The liability alone
would have crippled us.

647
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,434
What did you do with
all that blood?

648
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,234
Disposed of it.

649
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,472
Even though all
donated blood is screened?

650
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:20,475
You threw it away, George.

651
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,086
You could have helped
people.

652
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,563
And you chose not to.

653
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:31,682
You know, the last time
I checked,

654
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,012
those were still
the FDA guidelines.

655
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,950
And as far as I can tell,

656
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,638
you aren't doing a damn thing
about them either.

657
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:54,291
- Ella? Hi.
- Hey, hey, Dr. Frome.

658
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,076
Hi, are you okay?

659
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,338
What about Vijay?
What's happening?

660
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,166
No, hey, we're good.
We're all good.

661
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,864
Um, I just have to be quick

662
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:02,169
'cause he doesn't know
I'm calling you.

663
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:03,823
I heard your messages.

664
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:06,695
Okay, well,
I'm glad somebody did.

665
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,003
Yeah, uh, Iggy,
you have been so good to him.

666
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,005
To me.

667
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:14,689
You deserve to know
what's going on.

668
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:18,359
You know, honestly, Ella,
I don't...

669
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,275
I don't really care
anymore, so...

670
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,017
Vijay's doctor told him
he's never gonna work again.

671
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:28,185
Um, about a month ago.
He didn't want to believe it.

672
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,501
He kept saying that
the guy was crazy,

673
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:30,662
didn't know what
he was talking about.

674
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:33,716
But, um, a couple days after,
he got ready,

675
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,770
and decided to come into
the hospital early,

676
00:31:35,855 --> 00:31:37,817
and surprise everybody.

677
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:41,183
Um, he couldn't make it out
the front door.

678
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,973
He won't talk to me about it.

679
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,611
He won't talk to anyone
right now.

680
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,177
So, um,

681
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,231
that's why I had to call.

682
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,227
- You know, so you'd know.
- Yeah.

683
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:02,664
Uh, a couple days ago,

684
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,449
he told me a story about you.

685
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,060
About a patient
who thought he was dead?

686
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,280
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember.

687
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:11,760
And Vijay said how much
you helped the guy.

688
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:15,155
Helped his fiancée
to understand.

689
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:16,940
And Vijay said that

690
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:19,122
he might have saved
the guy's life but...

691
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:22,437
But you saved his soul.

692
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,869
That's what you do.

693
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:26,997
Dr. Frome, you just
go around saving souls.

694
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,680
I learned from the best.

695
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,139
Great news.
It's just a hemangioma,

696
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:43,444
which is a collection
of blood vessels

697
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,654
that should
disappear on their own.

698
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:46,004
Oh, my God. Thank God.

699
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:48,058
- Okay.
- So, next step is to

700
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:49,798
adjust your antiretrovirals.

701
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:51,322
I'll need to see you
back here tomorrow.

702
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:52,787
Oh, my God,
I'm so behind on work.

703
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,659
There's no way
I can come in tomorrow.

704
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,740
Your HIV care is important,
Karla.

705
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:58,938
Yes, I know it's important,

706
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,722
but it didn't give me cancer,
right?

707
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:02,376
Didn't almost kill me.

708
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,756
So can I call you when
I come back up for air?

709
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:09,106
Perfect. Next time I see you,
it'll be in the morgue.

710
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,974
You are walking out of here.

711
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:15,999
You're lucky,
'cause the kind of cancer

712
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,391
we thought you had is deadly,

713
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:20,067
and it's God's own luck
that you don't have it.

714
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:22,962
If what you take from this
is that you can continue

715
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:24,572
treating your HIV
like it's hay fever,

716
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:26,717
then I have no doubt
I'll be seeing you very soon,

717
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,744
whether you have room
in your schedule or not.

718
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,539
Um, tomorrow's good.

719
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:36,706
I can take him from here.

720
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,748
Ah, this one.

721
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,849
This one, unfortunately.
You mind?

722
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,489
I don't retract
a word I wrote.

723
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:45,911
Shame then, shame now.

724
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:49,692
Yeah, well, I hope you don't,
because you were right.

725
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:54,153
Dale, I'd like you to meet
Howie Cournemeyer.

726
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:00,812
- Mr. Cournemeyer...
- Howie.

727
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,396
Excited to meet you.

728
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,449
You know, the gay blood ban?

729
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:07,930
It's not just a regulation.

730
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,487
It's hate.

731
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:11,880
We should be ashamed
for allowing it.

732
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:15,319
So I'm initiating a new policy
regarding the gay blood ban.

733
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:19,831
I'm ignoring it.
And Howie is our first donor.

734
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,877
You can't.
They'll strip your funding.

735
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,942
Yeah.

736
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,639
Well, then we'll just take
them to court.

737
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:33,163
And when we win,

738
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:37,036
they will throw that
bigoted law in the trash,

739
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,329
thanks to you.

740
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,364
I've been screaming about
this nonsense for 30 years,

741
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:50,397
and nothing happened.

742
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:52,828
Look what you did.

743
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,064
Hey, I'm finishing my chart
on Karla.

744
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:06,544
Any surprises at discharge?

745
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:09,068
Uh, no. She just needed
a little bit of tough love.

746
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:10,548
Scared her to death, huh?

747
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:12,550
Love it when
you get all Mama Bear.

748
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,073
A quality
that's deserted me now that

749
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,510
there's a Baby Bear
in my office.

750
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,730
Um, honestly,

751
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,297
Mina walked all over me today,

752
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:21,820
and I'm just letting her do it.

753
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:23,333
I... I don't know what to say.

754
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:26,085
Just talk to her
like she's a patient.

755
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,387
But she's not.

756
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:30,220
I mean her father's just died,
she's in a new country.

757
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,656
If someone should be
playing bad cop with her,

758
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,614
it really shouldn't be me.
I barely know her.

759
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,312
I'm not her aunt at all.
Really, I'm just...

760
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:38,358
some woman.

761
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:40,708
My sister and I,
we're both addicts

762
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,580
who only trust chaos and

763
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:45,670
are incapable of having
intimate relationships.

764
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:48,890
That's what happens when no one
gives you boundaries.

765
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:50,675
You're all Mina has now.

766
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:53,504
You've got to be her mother,
her aunt, her friend.

767
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:54,853
Her everything.

768
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:58,117
And if you can't do that
then, yeah, you're right.

769
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:02,208
You're just some woman
who doesn't deserve her.

770
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,472
Those are wise words
coming from someone that

771
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,866
let a stranger
live in our storage closet.

772
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,955
Well, you can't win 'em all.

773
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,305
Good luck.

774
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:21,372
- Hi!
- Here's Baby Dahmer.

775
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:23,011
That bad?

776
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:25,536
When she wasn't
gnawing on me,

777
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,625
I checked out
some parenting blogs.

778
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,975
Um, apparently
biting's pretty normal,

779
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,890
so I wouldn't, like,
beat yourself up.

780
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:35,807
Yeah, I guess it's their way
of, I don't know, acting out.

781
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:39,637
I... she's trying to tell me
she's missing something.

782
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,756
Yeah, her data plan,
by the looks of it.

783
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,058
Her grandma.

784
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:49,434
Oh, problem solved.

785
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,127
Can't she just spend more time
with her?

786
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,668
Uh...

787
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,620
Gwen would love nothing more.

788
00:36:56,955 --> 00:37:00,339
And that's bad because...?

789
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,129
Just means I can't
do this on my own.

790
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,019
Max.

791
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,607
I don't think
you're supposed to.

792
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:24,856
Days like this make me think
of His mysterious ways.

793
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:39,392
Hey.

794
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:41,351
Floyd.

795
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:42,961
Did the Venmo not go through?

796
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,702
No, no, everything's
all good.

797
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:47,008
Uh, I was just thinking.

798
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:48,967
Well, not thinking.

799
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:50,955
I, uh...

800
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,016
I know that...

801
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,975
Know what?

802
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:58,528
That I made a mistake.

803
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:01,284
Floyd, I...

804
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:02,372
You know that
old school joint,

805
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,243
- "If loving you is wrong..."
- Floyd.

806
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,970
I know you feel me.

807
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,726
I do.

808
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,991
I do.

809
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,907
But I also know that
I'm nobody's wrong.

810
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,562
And if I were your right,

811
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:23,958
we wouldn't be having this
talk thousands of miles apart.

812
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,873
But if our love was real,

813
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:29,050
you know, we can cover that.

814
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:31,270
The "if"

815
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:33,737
is doing all the lifting
in that statement.

816
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:37,711
You saying it wasn't real?

817
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:40,105
I'm just saying

818
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,195
that whatever it was,

819
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,372
it obviously wasn't enough
for you.

820
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,447
You need to own it, Floyd.

821
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,147
You made your choice.

822
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,934
And so have I.

823
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,037
Evie...

824
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:15,706
- Hi, Gwen.
- Is everything okay?

825
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,229
No, no, no,
everything's fine.

826
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,450
Um, uh...

827
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,148
Well, we were just wondering
if, um,

828
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:25,498
you might be able to come over.

829
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,892
Uh,

830
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:31,939
a few days a week?

831
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:34,812
I think Luna really needs ya.

832
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:38,642
And, uh,

833
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:40,992
I think I really need the help.

Ugh, long. How 'bout yours?

Oh, my God, so long.
So long.

844
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:30,389
Can you remind me
whose bright idea it was

845
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,435
to put a full-length mirror
in our bedroom?

846
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,654
Uh, yours?

847
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:38,049

Oh, no, really?

851
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,498
Yeah, I was really
upset about it for

852
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:54,413
most of the day, actually.

853
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:57,416
Selfishly.

854
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,462
- He validates me, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,507
Waiting most of my life
for a father figure

856
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,901
to tell me that
I'm good enough.

857
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:05,468
Now he's gone.

858
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:08,848
Hey, I'm sorry.

859
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:14,085
It's okay.

860
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:16,522
Because I, um,

861
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:19,482
I think it's time
that I start to feel

862
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:23,137
like I'm good enough on my own.

863
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,705
I want to look in this mirror

864
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:27,911
and I want to see someone...

00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,582
