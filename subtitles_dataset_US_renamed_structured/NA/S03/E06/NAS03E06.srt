1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,171
Karen!

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,968
Uh, K-Kar... Karen... What's the deal?
Did you not see me?

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,970
Of course I did,
but I ran because your face says

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,179
you want money for something.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,389
Oh, well, yeah, I do.

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,891
What is it today?
Therapy dogs for postpartum mothers?

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,352
Improv classes for survivors of PTSD?

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,856
Uh, no, good idea, both of those,
but I was thinking that, um...

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,946
-I want to end systemic racism.
-Oh, for God's sake.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,990
No, just at the hospital.
Start small, right?

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,368
Wow, kind of controversial stance,
walking away, siding with racism.

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,661
Kind of a Karen move, Karen.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,206
My exasperation with you has no relation
to my thoughts on racism.

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,626
-Why today, Max?
-Knew you were going to ask that.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,087
There is no answer.
We should be asking the right question,

16
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,173
which is, why not yesterday?
Why not a year ago?

17
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,383
Why not two years ago
when I first took over?

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,844
Systemic racism
should have been the first thing

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,930
I addressed when I got to New Amsterdam
and I'm appalled that it wasn't.

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,475
-So today it is.
-And you need money for...

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,935
A new position,
someone to help us identify

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,979
and eliminate systemic marginalization

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,440
while correcting inequities
throughout the whole hospital.

24
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,275
You want a chief equity officer?

25
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,444
Yeah, that's perfect. We'll call it that.

26
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,197
Oh and I am not going anywhere
until you give me one.

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, in that case, go away,
because we already have one.

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,369
We do?

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,920
-Hey.
-Oh, hi there. Uh...

30
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,921
Are you...

31
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,257
Let's see here. Isabel?

32
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,802
-Yes.
-Great, I'm Max Goodwin, medical director.

33
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,969
How can I help?

34
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,472
I see what you did there.

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:43,478
Um, yeah, I'm here to discuss
some pretty disturbing, uh, statistics.

36
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,604
-Hit me.
-Okay.

37
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,357
Well, according to the latest report
by Health and Human Services,

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,027
Latinx women are 40% more likely
to have cervical cancer

39
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,072
and 20% more likely to die from it
than white women.

40
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,075
Indigenous Americans
have twice the HIV infection rate

41
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,827
as that of non-Hispanic whites.

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,579
Black women are two to six times

43
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,291
more likely to die from complications
of pregnancy than white women.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,794
Actually, it's 12 times more likely
in New York City.

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,589
Your statistics are a bit... generic.

46
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,549
Oh.

47
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,135
-How long have you worked here?
-Three years.

48
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,220
Three... three years?

49
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,056
Well, we have a lot of work to do.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,810
That's exactly what
I say to you in my messages.

51
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,855
Once a week,
I leave word with your office,

52
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,773
hoping to get some time with you.

53
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,986
Sorry, sometimes,
with this hospital, I'm just running

54
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,071
and, uh... Not important. Listen.

55
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,949
-I'm here now, okay?
-Okay.

56
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,492
And we are going to fix this.

57
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,121
So I want innovative proposals
on my desk by tomorrow.

58
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:47,250
And think big. You know, get creative.
No solution is off the table.

59
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,837
Should we start with acknowledging
New Amsterdam's biggest illustration

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,255
of embedded systemic racism?

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,883
Yes, yes, of course. What is it?

62
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,426
You.

63
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,767
{\an8}-Good read?
-Don't get me started.

64
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,269
{\an8}Actually, do get me started.

65
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,521
{\an8}I've been made executor
of my brother's will

66
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,274
{\an8}-and I haven't the foggiest.
-I thought you two weren't close.

67
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,486
{\an8}Well, we weren't, but now I'm in charge
of his house, his car, his saxophones.

68
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,615
{\an8}The only thing I'm confident about is
making arrangements for his daughter Mina

69
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,826
{\an8}to live with her aunt in Dubai...
[chuckles] in an actual palace.

70
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,119
{\an8}You have a niece.

71
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,580
{\an8}And a rich second aunt
who doesn't want my brother's boat

72
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,290
{\an8}because she already has several.

73
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,418
{\an8}Well, you keep it.
We could spend our vacation at sea.

74
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,379
{\an8}Sky, the waves, you and me.

75
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,131
{\an8}It's a rowboat.

76
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,133
{\an8}Then Bora Bora it is.

77
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,554
{\an8}So did you like the rest
of <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

78
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,307
{\an8}What about that red hunting hat, man?

79
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,226
{\an8}I thought that would be
right up your alley.

80
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
{\an8}-Mm, it was fine.
-It was fine.

81
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,523
{\an8}You, uh... you talked my ear off
about the Ducks last session.

82
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,400
{\an8}The red hunting hat is way more important.

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,944
{\an8}[grunts softly]

84
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,655
{\an8}Oh, I'm sorry. What's up with your hand?

85
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,115
{\an8}I... I fell on it wrong.

86
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,159
{\an8}Oh, okay. Well, just in case,
let me take a look.

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
It's fine.

88
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,748
{\an8}That's a little too much <i>fine</i>
for one session, Ollie. Let me see.

89
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,630
{\an8}Radiology's slammed,
but they'll fit him in right away.

90
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,883
{\an8}Okay, thank you. See that, buddy?
VIP treatment for you, right?

91
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,385
{\an8}What happened?

92
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,729
{\an8}Uh, he said he fell.

93
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,024
{\an8}No, Mama, last night, I separated them all

94
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,777
{\an8}and put them
in your monthly pill organizer, remember?

95
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,322
{\an8}Yes, of course you can still call me
whenever you want, but...

96
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,451
No, but take the yellow pill now,
the yellow pill while I'm on the phone.

97
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:46,911
[door bangs open]

98
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,121
Incoming!

99
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,331
A tour bus jumped the curb
in Times Square.

100
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
Superman may have a fractured wrist,

101
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,043
but he won't stay put long enough
for me to check.

102
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,462
-Okay, what's his real name?
-ID says Murph Coleman,

103
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,506
but he only responds to Superman.

104
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,175
Kebir Abad,
38-year-old male falafel vendor.

105
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,511
Second-degree hot oil burns
covering both arms.

106
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,388
-[groaning]
-Superman, get back in your chair.

107
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,848
Not till this man's in bay 24!

108
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,182
-Hammond!
-On it.

109
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,060
Skelly, Williams, team three, bed five.

110
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,187
Hey, you got to hold this, okay?
It's important.

111
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,189
Stable vitals? Team one, bed nine.

112
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,150
You okay? You got to keep your eyes open.

113
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,068
-Someone get me Cassian.
-All right.

114
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,737
-Let's do it.
-You going to be okay?

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,071
-Got to go.
-I can't...

116
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,157
Come on. Let's not back up triage.

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,199
Hammond.

118
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,744
-[sighs] Hammond!
-[grunting]

119
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,289
-Sorry. He really is faster than...
-Do not! Just get him back in his chair.

120
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,792
Wilmer Belasco, male, 42 years old.
Blunt force trauma to the chest.

121
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,796
Heart rate 113, BP 161 over 98.
Possible cracked sternum.

122
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,631
-My boy...
-Don't try to talk. Mr. Belasco.

123
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,591
Hector Belasco,

124
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,343
-13-year-old boy BP 126 over 87.
-That's my son!

125
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,970
Lauren, I got him. I got him.

126
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,097
-[muffled speech]
-Doc, no!

127
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,726
-[Floyd] He's going to be taken care of.
-Hi, Hector, I'm Dr. Shin. It's okay.

128
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,937
-We're going to take good care of you.
-Bilateral compound femur fracture,

129
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,107
-possible hypovolemic shock from injuries.
-Okay, let's take a look.

130
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,487
-[screams]
-[both yelling, screaming]

131
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,613
Trauma one.

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,325
-Dad!
-[yelling in Spanish]

133
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,621
Sir.

134
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,292
-In the chair, Superman.
-But I just...

135
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,502
Stay put.

136
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,630
[phone vibrating]

137
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,675
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

138
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,094
<i>I'm not going to Dubai.</i>

139
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,222
Mina, um, so just give me a second to...

140
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,308
<i>I have friends, a boyfriend,
a whole life here.</i>

141
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,686
<i>If you had bothered to call me
after my father died,</i>

142
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,439
<i>you'd know that.</i>

143
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,441
<i>Do you know how far Dubai is from Tehran?</i>

144
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,984
Mina, I know that it's hard,

145
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,362
but I'm sure your dad would've wanted you
to be with family.

146
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,280
You know nothing about my father.

147
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,912
-Can I talk to you a second?
-Can it wait? I just got...

148
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,749
No, uh, I just made a commitment to ending
the inherent and systemic racism

149
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,043
here at this hospital
and I know what I need to do.

150
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,587
-[clears throat] Max...
-I'm stepping down as medical director.

151
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,590
Who is taking over?

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,634
You are.

153
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,886
[breathes heavily]

154
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,475
You want me to be medical director?

155
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,561
-Yeah.
-And you, you'll just...

156
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,771
Quietly recede into a supporting role.

157
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,024
-You've never done anything quietly.
-Yeah, I know. That's exactly the problem.

158
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,110
I tried to force an initiative
on Black barber shops

159
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,987
to get them to turn into
community health ops.

160
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,866
I have called the WHO every single day
for three months, three months,

161
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,535
trying to get racism
coded as a health risk

162
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,498
and now I realize that none of it was ever
actually going to change anything,

163
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,542
because I am part of the problem.

164
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,335
-Says who?
-My chief equity officer.

165
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,171

Yeah, Isabel. She's very sweet.

But as women of color,
you are both vastly under... Hi.

168
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,719
...underrepresented in management,

169
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,388
which makes you much less likely
to get a promotion

170
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,892
and therefore not in a position
to then hire other women of color,

171
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,812
so it's a vicious cycle really,
but the thing is it can be changed

172
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,648
if a woman of color is at the top,
which is exactly why

173
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,484

174

-No.
-You could do a lot of good.

223

of the game that we've been playing?

224
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,631
Expert level.

225
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,759
I only win
if the loser doesn't think they lost.

226
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,803
If I upset them or hurt them, I lose.

227
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,929
Correct.

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,850
So when you smashed Ollie's hand,
you lost.

229
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,395
Except I didn't smash Ollie's hand.

230

I don't think you're telling the truth.

232

Right now or before?

233
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,905
Now. I think
you're lying to protect yourself.

234
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,366
-Final answer?
-This is not a game, Juliet.

This is not the game!

236
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,249

Don't worry. It's safe.

340
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,324
[sighs]

341
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,577
So what's it like working in Times Square?

342
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,496
Oh, it's the best. [chuckles]

343
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,416
Ever since I was a kid,
all I ever wanted to be was a hero.

344
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,459
-Always Superman?
-[chuckles] No.

345
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,006
I wanted to be a cop,
maybe a soldier, firefighter.

346
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,008
And why didn't you?

347
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,219
I tried, but I didn't meet
any of the size requirements.

348
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,931
Always been too small
to make a real difference.

349
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
But when I put on that cape...

350
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,361
Hey, Murph.

351
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,824
Being a hero's
got nothing to do with size.

352
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,294
So, Luisa, do you have anything at all
that you want to tell me?

353
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,712
About what?

354
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,173
I don't know.
I was thinking about Ollie's hand.

355
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,217
Did you hurt Ollie's hand?

356
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,969
No.

357
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,514
Well, Juliet, she says that you did.

358
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,726
She did?

359
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,144
Yeah, she did.

360
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,315
Then... I did.

361
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,735
No, don't tell me what you think
I want to hear, okay?

362
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,195
You just tell me the truth.

363
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,781
I am.

364
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,245
Luisa. Luisa, can I see your hand please?

365
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,540
It's okay. It's okay. Just...

366
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,043
I just need to take a peek, okay?

367
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
[sighs]

368
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,055
Did Juliet do that to you?

369
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,973
No.

370
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,268
She'll never know that you talked to me.
I promise you that.

371
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,856
I just want to make sure that
she never, ever hurts you again.

372
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,483
Do you understand?

373
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,360
Juliet didn't hurt me.

374
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,445
I'm her friend.

375
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,575
Juliet said that?
She told you that you're her friend?

376
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,535
Yes.

377
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,205
Her only friend.

378
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,168
-Right this way. Yeah.
-I have lunch...

379
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,004
I know. We'll be done in a second.
Come on in. Thank you, Dr. Bloom.

380
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,091
Okay, so, uh, guys,
I'm just going to dive right in.

381
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,760
So the reason that
I've asked you all here...

382
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,346
To the fourth floor storage room?

383
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,391
That's right.
...is to exercise a little discretion

384
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,228
and discuss something
that is a little uncomfortable, uh, money.

385
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,775
All of you in this room are the highest
earning doctors at New Amsterdam,

386
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,362
so I'm going to ask all of you,
uh, including myself,

387
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,700
-to renounce 10% of your salaries.
-[murmuring]

388
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,659
-Excuse me?
-What?

389
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,828
-What?
-Uh, wait. Is this a joke?

390
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,955
Not a... not a joke, actually.

391
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,541
We're going to take that money
from our collective reductions

392
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,794
and carefully redistribute it
to the physicians of color

393
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:35,757
who work in this hospital,
despite systemic pay discrimination.

394
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,010
Are you suggesting reparations?

395
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,388
Yeah, kind of. See? Harold gets it.

396
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,892
But we didn't hand out subpar salaries.
HCC did.

397
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,271
No, true, very true.
But, um, uh, well, we benefit from it.

398
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,357
So why don't you just raise the salaries
of the non-white physicians?

399
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,610
Right, yes.
Another very good idea, Harold.

400
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,070
Really kind of on fire today,
but I tried that.

401
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,281
I tried that and HCC could not afford it.

402
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,367
Did you notice that the wage gap
is even wider for women?

403
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,286
-Yeah.
-10% worse, in fact.

404
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,205
So, uh, why are women here?

405
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,917
Right, well, uh, of course, but we're not
discussing gender at the moment.

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,668
Oh, okay. So when's that meeting?

407
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,298
That meeting
is going to be scheduled right...

408
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,477
I knew
there was secret white doctor meetings.

409
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,063
Yeah, I'm going to go with you.

410
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,316
Dr. Bloom. Uh, guys,
uh, let me just say one more thing.

411
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,026
Wait, wait. Guys, guys, hold on.

412
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,239
Shut the door. Wait, one second please.
If I could finish. It's not a lot to ask

413
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,492
and it's really going to help
a lot of people,

414
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,953
but, um, thank you so much for listening.

415
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,746
Richardson retractor.

416
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,831
[monitors beeping]

417
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,083
Asystole.

418
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,793
EPI and a ten gauge.

419
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,719
-[Cassian] No response.
-[chattering]

420
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,845
Heart's gone.

421
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,722
[monitors beeping]

422
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm not calling it.

423
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
-Dr. Reynolds.
-Give him a minute.

424
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,191
-Come on, Hector.
-[chattering]

425
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,371
Initiate cardiac bypass.
At least we can give him a few more hours.

426
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,206
[sighs]

427
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,294
[background chattering]

428
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,131
Heart transplant?

429
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,180
He's just a child.

430
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,599
Yes.

431
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:55,897
And pediatric heart transplant recipients
have challenging size restrictions.

432
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,113
But being on bypass puts him
at the very top of the donor list.

433
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,992
Don't lose hope for a match.

434
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,540
Dr. Reynolds, I love my boy,

435
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,293
more than anything in the world.

436
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,550
But how can I hope
for another boy's heart?

437
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,260
[sniffles] Hm?

438
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,142
Have you heard
of this term intersectionality?

439
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,687
-Of course. Haven't you?
-Yeah, of course, after I googled it.

440
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,731
Right, well, once you solve racism,

441
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,816
you can put out
a word of the day calendar.

442
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,861
I know you're joking,
but, uh, that's not a bad idea.

443
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,529
Look, I want to apologize.

444
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,325
Uh, it was really unfair of me for trying
to dump that whole thing on you.

445
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,286
-Thank you. I appreciate that.
-Yeah, so I have a better proposition.

446
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,788
Huh, I can't believe it.

447
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,457
Yeah, you could be my, uh... oh.

448
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,876
Be my partner.

449
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,004
Uh, co-medical directors.

450
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,007
And before you say anything,
just think about how... [chuckles]

451
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,510
how great, uh, we'd be together, you know?

452
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,180
I mean, you know the terminology
and I know the system and I just think...

453
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,102
You know, I'm always better when you're
around and... and it's starting...

454
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,395
to be obvious to me that...

455
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,274
Stop. Stop talking.

456
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,277
-Sorry. You're trying to pee...
-No. Just actually...

457
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,654
like, just stop talking.

458
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,116
Have you ever noticed that
you always present your big plans

459
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,826
while you're walking and talking?

460
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,369
[chucklers]

461
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,414
I... I think that it gives you a sense
of momentum that feels encouraging.

462
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:42,879
But it's actually an illusion,
because this building is a box, Max,

463
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,091
and you're walking in circles.

464
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,845
And while that might
sometimes be enough time

465
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,223
for you to come up with a quick fix,
you're not going to fix this,

466
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,726
because, and I can't believe
I actually have to say this, but...

467
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,314
systemic racism isn't about you.

468
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,109
But you want answers.

469
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
Well, then just hold still.

470
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,575
Just be quiet

471
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,702
and just...

472
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,374
Just really listen to the people
that you say you want to help.

473
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,294
It's not revolutionary.

474
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,882
It's not outside of the box and it is
certainly not going to be a quick fix.

475
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,470
And if you can't...
if you can't handle that,

476
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,139
then you're not an ally at all.

477
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,519
You're just another semi-woke liberal
with a white savior complex.

478
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,949
All right, we are here

479
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,870
because I want you to see firsthand
the damage that you've done...

480
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,706
and understand why you've lost the game.

481
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,416
But I didn't lose.

482
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,251
Two kids are hurt because of you.

483
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,671
And I'm afraid that
you can't stay here anymore.

484
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,926
-I didn't lose!
-I'm going to have to call your parents.

485
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,970
I didn't lose the game!
I'm better at the game than you are!

486
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,723
You're the one who lost.

487
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,768
You hurt Luisa

488
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,855
and when Ollie found out,
you hurt him too.

489
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,732
Is that what happened?

490
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,654
That's what happened, right?

491
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,790
-No.
-Don't look at her.

492
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,752
I don't care what she told you.
She is not your friend.

493
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,213
-Yes, I am.
-Juliet, not another word.

494
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,965
[sighs]

495
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,346
I'm sorry. I have to.

496
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,394
-It started when...
-It was Luisa! She just attacked me!

497
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,814
Because he kept grabbing me!
You did this.

498
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,775
He kept trying to hold my hand,
even when I told him to stop.

499
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,110
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,822
Because Ollie said he wouldn't get in
trouble for just trying to hold my hand,

501
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,907
but I wanted him to stop.

502
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,661
-You're being a baby.
-No, she is not and you are in trouble.

503
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,455
Ollie. Ollie...

504
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,458
-Thank you. Take him to his room.
-Told you.

505
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,757
<i>-Salam.</i>

506
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,967
<i>We broke up.</i>

507
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,094

-<i>You were right.</i>

That was stupid.</i>

510
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,185
<i>But I do want to come to New York.</i>

511
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,775
You changed your mind, didn't you?

512
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,652
It's, um...

513
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,738
It's complicated.

514
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,782

515
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,494

and this city is...</i>

516
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,997
It's big.

517
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,960
But I do care about you, Mina,
and I promise I will check on you

518
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,297
and make sure you have everything you need
with money or with, um,

519
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,965
help with college applications.

520
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,008
<i>So, basically...</i>

521
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,926
<i>you don't have room
in your life for family.</i>

522
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,137
<i>That's not what I said -</i>

523
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,639
No, that's what my father said about you.

524
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,684
<i>I guess he was right.</i>

525

526
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,780
I should have known that regular
anesthesia would be no match for...

527
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,416
-The surgery was successful.
-It was.

528
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,169
The burr hole relieved pressure,

529
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,130
but the bleed had already
done too much damage.

530
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,216
He's not going to wake up.

531
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,385
Okay.

532
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,263
-I'm going to look for next of kin.
-Yeah.

[PA announcements in background]

534
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,363
-You sure you got time for this?
-I got all the time in the world.

535
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,992
I started treating patients here the same
time as three other white residents,

536
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,787
but you know how long it took
the department chair to learn my name?

537
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,705
Go ahead. Guess.

538
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,042
Then I'll tell you how long it took
for him to stop calling me sister girl.

539
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,963
I'm not a female surgeon.
I'm not a Puerto Rican surgeon.

540
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,424
I'm a surgeon and I'm one of the best.

541
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,758
Nanny. [scoffs]

542
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,178
Do you see children around me?
I mean, I'm wearing my badge. Hello?

543
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,513
I'm not the translator.

544
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,516
Listen, you don't have to speak Spanish
to me all the time. I speak English.

545
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,600
It was misdiagnosed

546
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,562
because the test didn't account for higher
creatine levels in Black folk.

547
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,314
No matter how many times
I tell 'em, it's sickle cell,

548
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,775
white doctors always have me
take a drug test.

549
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,652
Blamed it on insurance.
I'm like, "For real?"

550
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,614
How does a white male gynecologist
know my pain better than I do?

Four generations, US.
My newborn does not need a TB shot.

552

I don't have a green card,
but I do have an American passport.

553
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,582
The only border I ever cross
is New Jersey.

554
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,626
I didn't go to school for 12 years
to learn how to smile more.

555
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,464
When Dr. Reynolds made chair, do you
think people asked if his dad was proud?

556
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,841
I see how they look at me
the moment they hear my voice.

557
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,719
He said we can't all be enlightened
as you about gender.

558
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,388
Max, it's not really about
remembering my pronouns.

559
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,099
It's about actually believing me
when I tell you who I am.

560
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,018
I don't know how many of us there are.

561
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,977
-AIDs.
-SIDs.

562

-Mixed race.
-Multiethnic.

563
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,606
-None of the above.
-Indigenous?

564
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,943
That can be from any part of the world.
I am a Native American.

565
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,613
People call me many things. Bitch.

566

-Chola.
-Coon. Spook.

-Other.
-Other.

570
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,876
So I owe you a huge apology.

571
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,212
I'm waiting.

572
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,464
[sighs]

573
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,550
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm very sorry that I doubted you.

575
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,638
No, worse. I...

576
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,100
I decided that you were guilty before
you ever even set foot in my office

577
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,310
and I am sorry.

578
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,147
Seems judgmental for a doctor.

579
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,152
I agree.

580
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,740
And I should have had more faith
in your progress, in you, honestly.

581
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:30,912
Ollie is bad, but I would never lose
the game just to hurt him.

582
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,455
Yeah, I believe you.

583
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,123
So I told Luisa how to do it.

584
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,793
You... You did what?

585
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,254
I told Luisa how to get him alone,

586
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,172
where no one would see,

587
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,091
and I told her to use the door

588
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,260
because it was the best way
for someone her size...

589
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,345
No, no, Juliet, no, you can't do that.

590
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,639
You can't teach kids to hurt other kids.

591
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,850
I taught her how to defend herself.

592
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,352
-That is not your job.
-But she's my friend.

593
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,361
Do you really consider Luisa
to be your friend?

594
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,158
Yes.

595
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,831
Okay.

596
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,167
Okay.

597
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,628
New rule to the game.

598
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:26,926
You can't help anyone hurt someone else.
If you do, you lose.

599
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,933
-Starting now?
-Yeah, starting now.

600
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,147
So I'm still winning, right?

601
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,232
Right.

602
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,485
You're still winning.

603
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,335
Heard about your 2021 listening tour.

604
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,259
-I was on the subway this morning.
-Mm-hm.

605
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,180
And there was this toddler, who's
a cute little Black boy around Luna's age,

606
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,642
-and he was just exploring.
-[chuckles]

607
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,310
You know, running around and...

608
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:24,025
And this random guy starts...
yelling at this kid's mom.

609
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,070
"Control your damn kid."

610
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,533
And... that guy would deny it...

611
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,456
but when Luna runs around like that,
nobody yells at her.

612
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,920
I mean, it's the opposite, you know?

613
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:49,217
People smile and do funny little voices
and...

614
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,348
Luna gets to grow up
seeing the world as safe,

615
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,558
friendly.

616
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,769
And that kid...

617
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,397
gets screamed at...

618
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,902
and his mom gets to be on high alert
every second of every day,

619
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,655
knowing there's always another guy
who's ready to yell at her kid

620
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,949
or make him feel small, or one day...

621
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,036
or one day kill him.

622
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,794
Do you know what I said
to that racist on the train?

623
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,218
Nothing.

624
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,728
Because I didn't even realize it
until I got off the train.

625
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:54,365
Look, I'm not going to ask you
to... fix everything.

626
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,286
I just want you to know
that I'm grateful...

627
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,295
that you're here.
It's... It's... It's been hard.

628
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,507
But it's been easier...

629
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,971
knowing that you are here.

630
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,943
I'm here to inform you

631
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,696
that I'm stepping down
as deputy medical director.

632
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,037
I'm sorry that it's poor timing.

633
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,333
The job has meant so much to me.

634
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,674
But I have to focus
on other things right now.

635
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,940
Okay, okay.

00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,609

So you changed your mind?

679
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,262
I did.

680
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:55,976
Having Mina here with me, getting to know
my family, that's what feels right.

681
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,019
Mm.

682
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,022
Well, then I'm very excited.

683
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,700
Um, but if I'm going to do this,

684
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,996
then I have to put my whole self into it.

685
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,832
Everything I have has to go to her.

686
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,043
Of course. I'll help in any way I can.

687
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,963
No, you won't.

688
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,468
'Cause everything I have...

689
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,431
has to go to her.

690
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,024
This is what you want?

691
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,655
<i>♪ There's a brand-new morning ♪</i>

692
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,240
But it's not about me anymore.

693
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,371
<i>♪ Rising clear and sweet and free ♪</i>

694
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,252
<i>♪ There's a new day dawning ♪</i>

695
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:10,176
<i>♪ That belongs to you and me ♪</i>

696
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,181
[sighs]

697
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:22,062
<i>♪ Yes, a new world's coming ♪</i>

698
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,317
-So what are you going to do about this?
-I have absolutely no idea.

699
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:31,113
No idea what to put up that won't offend
someone, or exclude someone else,

700
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,784
or seem too hollow,
or... or too charged. I...

701
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,997
For the first time since I got here...

702
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:47,421
I have absolutely no idea what to do
for the people in this hospital.

703
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,216
Good.

704
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,387
Good? Uh, why is that good?

705
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,640
You're not supposed
to do things for people.

706
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,517
-That's not sustainable, Max.
-But...

707
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,269
But if you do things with people,
you can start a movement.

708
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,357
What do you need?
Say the word and it's yours.

709
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,525
A new office.

710
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,778
How is that going to end systemic racism
at New Amsterdam?

711
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,822
Because my new office
is going to be right next to yours.
