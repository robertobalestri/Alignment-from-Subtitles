1
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,704
Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,663
I love you.

3
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:14,452
They keep hammering on
at you to open up,

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:17,629
but that has to go both ways.

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,152
And even though my body
is telling me

6
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:22,590
to just let go and jump,
I can't.

7
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:23,983
Not even for you.

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,159
I gave Chance everything.

9
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,900
I just wanted him
to get better.

10
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:30,729
But it was never enough.

11
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:32,426
If you don't
have to fight for it,

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,556
it's 'cause it's not worth it.

13
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:46,136
♪

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,746
Leave a message
after the tone.

15
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,749
Hey.

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,230
It's, uh, me.

17
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:57,190
I... I miss you.

18
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,105
I can't get you
out of my head.

19
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,761
It's, uh,
it's very distracting.

20
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,064
Um...

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:11,248
We said things to each other
that were just the beginning.

22
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:16,253
And we never quite, um...

23
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,994
Anyway, now you're gone,

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,085
and it just feels like
it's been forever.

25
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:26,045
And I really need...

26
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,652
I need to see you.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,051
I need to talk to you.

28
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:35,924
I need to be with you

29
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:40,059
in all of the ways
that I've been dreaming of.

30
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,672
And we're done.

31
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,196
All right. Easy enough.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,545
Everything looks good,
Dr. Goodwin.

33
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,807
Fantastic.

34
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,285
- Thank you so much.
- See you in six months.

35
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,565
Is everything okay?

36
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,178
Have you seen my wedding ring?

37
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:13,742
Sure haven't.

38
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:27,106
I need to see you.

39
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,369
I need to talk to you.

40
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,851
I need to be with you

41
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:37,073
in all of the ways
that I've been dreaming of.

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,162
And this one's too tight.

43
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,077
Everything looks terrible
on me.

44
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,732
- Oh, stop that.
You're just nervous.

45
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,256
- Wonder why.
It's only the beginning

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,171
of the rest of my whole life.

47
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,439
Hey. You've reached Max.

48
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,049
I can't take your call,
so leave a message.

49
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,617
Hi. Um.

50
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,707
I very much
enjoyed your message.

51
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,359
My flight's not till tomorrow,
but, um...

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,846
I've been doing
some fantasizing of my own.

53
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,718
Okay.

54
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,241
I'm ready. I think.

55
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,731
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, don't sound so surprised.

56
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,385
I was never gonna
stay here forever.

57
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,822
- But today?
But today?

58
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm gonna try and catch
a standby flight.

59
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,827
But I wanted you to come back
to Cambridge with me.

60
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,916
I know.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,310
I've had a wonderful time.

62
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,007
But you're all set up
in the halls.

63
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,919
You have an amazing dress.

64
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:50,233
And most importantly,
you don't need me anymore.

65
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,761
I'm so proud of you.

66
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,857
You took me into your home.

67
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,682
You never gave up on me.

68
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,950
I don't know how to thank you.

69
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,344
You don't need to.

70
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,038
You don't need to.
We're family.

71
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,196
And text me when you're
at the airport, okay?

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,371
I will.

73
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,022
I just have
one more stop to make.

74
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,326
Sorry I'm late, Mum.

75
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,457
Now that you're here,
we can leave.

76
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,198
I made you some red-red.

77
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:29,897
No use spending hard-earned
money on beetroot foam.

78
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,117
Well, let me
do this for you, Mum.

79
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,206
It's a meal.

80
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,599
And it's really good
to see you.

81
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,772
Glad you found time
to fit me in.

82
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,431
Yeah, uh, Nina got
into King's College

83
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,389
in Cambridge.
It's been a busy week.

84
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,434
I wanted to help her
get set up.

85
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,476
So, the truth comes out.

86
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,050
Mum, she is wonderful.

87
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,444
She's smart, she's driven,

88
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:57,360
and she is family.

89
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,013
And since I'm going back
to New York,

90
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,059
I put you down
as her emergency contact,

91
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,321
and I think that
if you would just meet her...

92
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,757
- Not on your life.
- Mum.

93
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,368
You say no all the time.

94
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,631
No to London,
no husband, no baby.

95
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,285
Why must I say yes?

96
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,158
But please, daughter, give me
that other woman's grandchild.

97
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,074
We are blood.

98
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,815
And since Baba
was kept away from me...

99
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,338
I didn't keep
your father from you.

100
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,775
He cut off ties.
He went home to Tehran

101
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,821
and found his ready-made
Persian wife.

102
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,039
He abandoned us.

103
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:26,389
Okay, so now what?

104
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:29,479
Hmm?
We abandon her?

105
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,698
You spent the past week

106
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,353
ignoring your own mother
for that other family.

107
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,224
Turns out you're
just like your baba.

108
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,630
Mum, how long have you
had that cough?

109
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,371
A few weeks.

110
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,112
Or more.

111
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,679
You'd know if you ever rang.

112
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,898
- Come on.
We're gonna go, Mum.

113
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,204
Come on.

114
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,959
This is your old clinic.

115
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,700
Yes.

116
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,003
It's certainly seen
better days.

117
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,051
Excuse me. Hi.

118
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,189
Hi, I was hoping to get my mum
in today for some scans.

119
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,888
She's had a persistent cough,
and today we found some blood.

120
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,803
We're booked solid,
I'm afraid.

121
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,892
I could maybe get her in
early next week.

122
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,024
This is why
I never bother with doctors.

123
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,154
No, Mum, wait, wait.

124
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,989
Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
My name is Dr. Helen Sharpe.

125
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,860
I used to volunteer here
when I was in college.

126
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,080
I started behind the desk,
just like you,

127
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,908
but this clinic
is where I found my passion,

128
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:54,128
and now I'm pleading with you.

129
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,998
I need to make sure
that my mum gets seen.

130
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,442
I can move things around.

131
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,488
Thank you. Thank you.

132
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,533
No, I don't want
any special treatment.

133
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:08,839
I don't like my daughter
pulling strings

134
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,101
just so we can jump the queue.

135
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,190
Mum, we are taking
the opening

136
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,931
whether you like it or not.
End of discussion.

137
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,585
- Right this way.
I'll take you back.

138
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,587
Thank you.

139
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,371
No, I don't need you
to come with me.

140
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,501
I can do this all on my own.

141
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,214
Helen?

142
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:39,043
As I live and breathe.

143
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,132
Elinor.

144
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,960
I didn't know
you were still here.

145
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,614
- There's still work to do.
What's your excuse?

146
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,919
No more New York?

147
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:49,006
- My mum's sick.
She's getting seen.

148
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,839
Can I just ask? Um...

149
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:56,147
This place... what happened?

150
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,323
We started hemorrhaging staff
due to Brexit.

151
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,065
And then we lost the funding
we used to get from Cambridge,

152
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,284
and it all started
to fall apart.

153
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:06,592
Last month, our medical
director packed up and left.

154
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,160
Now we're fighting to hold on.

155
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,988
This place is too special
to just...

156
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,074
Dr. Sharpe, can you join me?

157
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,081
It was good
to see you, Elinor.

158
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,993
- Oh, you too, love.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,783
Thank you.

160
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,838
I'm right here, Mum.

161
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,020
I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:46,237
So I just wanted you
to see what we found today.

163
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,901
Run blood tests on Bay 26,

164
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,729
and let's send her up
for a stress echo.

165
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,339
Why hasn't Bay 9
been discharged?

166
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,125
- Because I possibly forgot.
On it.

167
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,173
Hey, have you, uh,
have you heard from Iggy?

168
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,349
Uh, no. Not in weeks. You?

169
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,438
- Radio silence.
I've been thinking about him.

170
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,963
But... uh, what's up?

171
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,704
- Nothing. Stupid.
I lost my wedding ring.

172
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,009
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,358
But it's okay. No big deal.

174
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,316
I mean, it's not like
it's worth

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,578
a ton of money or anything.

176
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,407
It's just a little silly ring,
you know?

177
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,843
But it's gotta be in here
somewhere.

178
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:26,019
Okay, who loses one shoe?

179
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,543
Well, where did you
take it off?

180
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,719
I... I don't take it off.

181
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,372
- Not even at night?
- No.

182
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:33,505
- Well, what about to scrub in?
- No.

183
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,028
Not even when you were
dating that woman?

184
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:38,031
- Never. Okay?
I never take it off.

185
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,338
26-year-old. Tachy at 148.

186
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:44,603
100/56, respiratory rate 14
from an abdominal stab wound.

187
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,171
- From Excalibur?
- Cosplay gone horribly wrong.

188
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,521
Oh, that's a ton of blood
for a wound in that area.

189
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,610
Let's page Reynolds now.
Trauma one.

190
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:52,872
Gauze.

191
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:01,098
Gauze. Gauze. Gauze.

192
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,143
Damn it, keep them coming.

193
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,710
The puncture's bad,
but it shouldn't cause

194
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,233
loss of consciousness.

195
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,714
Dr. Bloom, look at this.

196
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,411
Negative P waves?

197
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,979
And negative QRS,
and T waves, plus low voltage?

198
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,154
What the hell?

199
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,417
Dextrocardia.

200
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,678
Her heart's on the wrong side
of her chest.

201
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,468
Boy, do I have
a great case for you.

202
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,384
Dextrocardia doesn't explain
the excessive bleeding.

203
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,865
Unless she also has
complete situs inversus.

204
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,998
Not just her heart, but all
of her organs were flipped.

205
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,305
Then her spleen
is on the right side.

206
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,263
Which means the dagger
is going right through it.

207
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,222
But that doesn't
explain the LOC.

208
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,963
Stop for a head CT
on your way to the OR.

209
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,309
Good idea.

210
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,406
- Hey, you.
What's going on?

211
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,714
The residency match list
came out.

212
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,284
I got a spot.

213
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:01,114
- You did?
Oh, that's amazing.

214
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,290
I honestly can't believe it.

215
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,770
Well, don't look
so surprised.

216
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,076
- Have you met you?
- Stop.

217
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,730
You know how competitive
these things are.

218
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,296
And it was my very first try.

219
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,820
And I'm
a foreign-trained doctor.

220
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,952
And you blew them all away.

221
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,041
Well, not all.

222
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,347
I didn't get a spot here.

223
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,610
But we knew that was
gonna be a long shot.

224
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,307
Wait, you didn't
get a spot here?

225
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,788
- Spokane.
Washington.

226
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:26,397
- Wow.
That's incredible.

227
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,142
It is, isn't it?

228
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,318
I haven't even told my mom yet.

229
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,146
Well, what are you
waiting for?

230
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,236
Give her a call.
Let her be a proud mama.

231
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,061
She's gonna explode.

232
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,687
So, you just chose
to ignore

233
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,559
my residency recommendation
for Leyla Shinwari.

234
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,955
I have been on the phone
all morning with board members

235
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,261
and angry doctors
just like yourself,

236
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,568
all astonished
that their personal recs

237
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,788
didn't open the doors
for their hand-picked proteges.

238
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:08,834
No, Dr. Shinwari is one of
the most promising candidates

239
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:11,532
we've had in years, okay?
She deserves to be here.

240
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,404
Yet her application
says otherwise.

241
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:14,710
Khyber Medical University?

242
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,799
One of the best
medical schools in Pakistan.

243
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,626
That has no
international standing.

244
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,369
She practiced medicine
in refugee camps, Hank.

245
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,110
Okay?
The fact that she even

246
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:27,200
has to redo her residency
is offensive.

247
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,811
Well, even if I agree
with you, what can I do?

248
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,727
I... I can't rescind an offer
that's already been made.

249
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,729
I can't make another spot
just magically appear.

250
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,774
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Well, what about two years ago?

251
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,384
Huh?

252
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:40,736
A fifth spot just magically
opened up in general surgery.

253
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,954
It was hardly magic.

254
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,866
Well then,
what the hell was it, Hank?

255
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,830
You want Dr. Shinwari
on your ED?

256
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,785
You want a fifth spot?

257
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,139
The dean of medicine
has been known

258
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:58,101
to make allowances
for the right price.

259
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,406
Are you talking
about a bribe?

260
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,495
What do you want me to say?

261
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,759
That is a federal crime,
Hank.

262
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,238
I could lose
my medical license.

263
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,631
I could go to jail.

264
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,850
I'm just telling you
what I've heard.

265
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,025
Not suggesting you do it.

266
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,415
Of course,
I am not gonna do it.

267
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,325
Dear God...

268
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,375
Grant me the serenity

269
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,944
to accept the things
I cannot change,

270
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,640
the courage
to change the things I can.

271
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,472
Dear God,

272
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,387
grant me the serenity

273
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,782
to accept the things
I cannot change,

274
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:13,477
the courage
to change the things I can...

275
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,482
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

276
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,333
This is just...

277
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,861
Thank you.

278
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,341
Congratulations.

279
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,568
Look, I have been
feeling guilty all day.

280
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,309
Why?

281
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,919
I was just so excited.

282
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,226
I didn't even think about what
you must have been feeling.

283
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,708
And I want you to know that I'm
not excited to be leaving you.

284
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,885
- You're everything to me.
- Leyla.

285
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,148
I can make this work.

286
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,150
I can.

287
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,370
I don't have a choice.

288
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,326
I'm in love with you.

289
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,164
No, you should...
You should get that.

290
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:31,732
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,778
Hello?

292
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,302
Yes, this is she.

293
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:40,350
Okay. Okay.

294
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,918
Are you serious?

295
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,050
That's...

296
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,573
I don't know what to say.

297
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:50,313
Yes! Yes. Thank you.

298
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,931
That was the residency director
from New Amsterdam.

299
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,022
The dean just opened up
a fifth spot in the ED.

300
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,890
And they offered it to me.

301
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:07,768
- That's amazing!
Congratulations!

302
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,728
Did you have anything
to do with this?

303
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:14,253
- What? No.
No, of course not.

304
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,299
No, this... this was all you.

305
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,515
Oh.

306
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,694
It was all you.

307
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,531
I moved across Lenox,
not the country.

308
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,620
I'll still see you
all the time, Mama.

309
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,709
Okay, yeah, just...

310
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,625
Try to remember I'm not
a little boy anymore, okay?

311
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,068
House special.

312
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,676
- Oh, what?
- Bam.

313
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,553
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,986
Mmm.

315
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,647
If I didn't know any better,

316
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,562
I'd say you're trying
to get me to move in.

317
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,477
Would that be so bad?

318
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,099
Mm, all right. Okay. Okay.

319
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,102
- What?
- You know the rules.

320
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,408
I also know that rules
are meant to be broken.

321
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,802
And we have.

322
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,325
You get one stay.

323
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,241
Somewhere along the line,
this turned into Thursday.

324
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,157
- Okay.
Look, look, I get it.

325
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:35,247
I tried to resist you
for months, right?

326
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:38,424
Finally had to give in.
Now look who can't resist.

327
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,255
Of course I'd fall
for two alpha males.

329
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,909
Oh, okay, hold on.

330
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,954
No, I got a rule, too,
all right?

331
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,479
None of that husband talk.

332
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,089
Come here.

333
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,088
- Floyd.
- Yeah.

334
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,616
This is the arrangement.

335
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,313
We can never be more than this.
Tell me you know that.

336
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,144
Yeah, I know.

337
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,065
I am going to take a shower.

338
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,643
Dextrocardia doesn't explain
the excessive bleeding.

339
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,472
Not just her heart, but all
of her organs are flipped.

340
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,822
Then her spleen
is on the right side.

341
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:31,042
Which means the dagger is
plunging straight through it.

342
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,522
But that doesn't
explain the LOC.

343
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,437
Stop for a head CT
on your way to the OR.

344
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,482
- Good idea.
All right.

345
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,267
I'll need the largest OR
that's empty

346
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,964
and every unit of O-neg we got.

347
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,487
Already ordered
and waiting for you.

348
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,185
- Okay, good.
We'll also need a fresh staff

349
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:44,316
that can work
at least 12 hours.

350
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,839
This one's gonna be a marathon.

351
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,189
- I'll round them up.
- I've got a full craniotomy

352
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,451
- set up on order for you.
- Oh!

353
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,322
Perfect timing.
I'll take her from here.

354
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,802
- Wait. What?
- Dr. Salaita.

355
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,761
The CT showed Ms. Madera
threw a clot from her abdomen

356
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,720
up through her poorly-formed
heart to her brain,

357
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,330
where it caused
a hemorrhagic event.

358
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,462
You'll need to drain the blood
from her head.

359
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,985
Our team's waiting,
Dr. Baptiste.

360
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,378
Okay, get a scanner in here

361
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,770
so you can do a real-time,
image-guided surgery.

362
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,511
They'll never let me have
the IGS system, sir.

363
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,773
Tell them
the chief of surgery

364
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,035
personally authorized it.

365
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,341
Dr. Flores, gather your team

366
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,690
for the septal reconstruction.

367
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,301
You'll be last,
so just wait in the obs deck.

368
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,346
- Will do, sir.
- And you.

369
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,826
You're the associate
ED trauma surgeon?

370
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,739
- Dr. Reynolds. Yes, sir.
- Let's see what you've got.

371
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:24,878
- All right, here we go.
Get the lap pads ready.

372
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,799
- Dagger's out.
- Replaced by blood.

373
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,627
There's gotta be a bleeder
in here somewhere.

374
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,325
- Whew.
- Another lap pad.

375
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,367
- Still can't see it.
Come on.

376
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,896
Come on.

377
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,460
Come on. Come on.

378
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:49,465
Got it. Suture.

379
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,992
Monitor the systolic pulse...

380
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,516
With situs inversus,

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,562
we got small mini-spleens
all through her abdomen.

382
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,434
Once I get this under control,
I can remove them.

383
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,914
No need; I'll do it myself
during the brain surgery.

384
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,178
Did you get a CT angio to
locate the accessory spleens?

385
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,919
Scissors. I did not.

386
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:09,271
You know what they say:
death begins in radiology.

387
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,182
standing by.

388
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,102
That should hold.

389
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,408
I can assist
in the splenectomy.

390
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,280
You're dismissed.

391
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,195
Where's my neuro team?
You guys are up.

392
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,283
Make sure
there's enough blood...

393
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,894
Switch up.

394
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:50,399
Do you dry clean?

395
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,314
Got a couple of shirts
that could use a press.

396
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,359
- Lost my wedding ring.
- Oof.

397
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,709
Well, you didn't have it
on this morning, if that helps.

398
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,059
You notice who's
wearing a wedding ring?

399
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,322
Recently.

400
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,976
I have looked
everywhere for it.

401
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,065
I'm gonna be sifting through
medical waste pretty soon.

402
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,677
I guess I just assumed
you took it off on purpose.

403
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,983
No.

404
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,336
I don't know.

405
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,643
Still means something, I guess.

406
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,341
I mean, it's everything we had,
you know?

407
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,822
It's like... come on,
it can't just be gone.

408
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:27,174
Actually, uh, I felt
the same way about Evie's ring

409
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:30,743
after we, uh, you know.

410
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,223
So what changed?

411
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,834
Well, I realized I wasn't
hanging on to Evie's ring

412
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:39,361
because she still had
a big piece of my heart.

413
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,799
I was hanging on to it
because she didn't.

414
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:45,407
And the ring wasn't
about our love anymore.

415
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,584
It was about my guilt.

416
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,763
Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Flores
needs you in the OR, stat.

417
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,384
- Flores?
- I'm trying to pull off

418
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,863
a triangular patch
reconstruction

419
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,909
of the ventricular wall.
You've done one?

420
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,519
- Several times.
- I just can't get it to hold.

421
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,826
- All right. I got it.
- BP's still dropping.

422
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,523
We need to increase
patch adhesion

423
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,656
to seal
microcirculatory leakage.

424
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,658
Go ahead and clamp
the inferior vena cava.

425
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,660
I'm gonna apply
direct pressure.

426
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,314
On my signal,
I want you to squeeze

427
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,619
the largest piece
of spleen you can fine.

428
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,839
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

429
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,667
Ready. Now.

430
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,147
Okay.

431
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:31,151
All right, so go ahead and
slowly release the vena cava.

432
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,416
All right.
Now increase the flow.

433
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,897
Gently. Ah. Slow it down.

434
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:41,814
Okay. And all the way.

435
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:54,261
- I don't see any leaking.
- Nice save, Floyd.

436
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,825
We'll close her up.

437
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,572
Dr. Reynolds.

438
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,270
After surgery,
may I have a word?

439
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,922
Get another blanket
on her leg.

440
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:10,100
- Custodial services, 224.
Custodial services, 224.

441
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:15,587
I've only been here
a little while, so tell me.

442
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,197
How'd you end up buried deep
in the ED...

443
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,330
Please, please, have a seat...

444
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,372
Associate trauma surgeon?

445
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,423
It's the only spot
I could get.

446
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,903
You never mentioned
you used to be

447
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:30,297
the chair
of cardiothoracic surgery?

448
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,864
So what happened?

449
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,866
Well,
I left about a year ago.

450
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,085
Poached?

451
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,956
Engaged.

452
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,307
Yeah, my fiancée got
her dream job in San Francisco,

453
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,179
so I followed.

454
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,181
Long story short, I'm back.

455
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,965
We got a lot in common.

456
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,359
I followed my girl
out here too.

457
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:52,581
But one big difference: my job
makes full use of my talents.

458
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,975
- Yours doesn't.
- Well, I'm not complaining.

459
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,455
And I'm not insulting.

460
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,502
I'm offering you a promotion.
Deputy chair of surgery.

461
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,508
That's a big promotion.

462
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,639
Bigger than
chair of cardiothoracic.

463
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,990
To say the least.

464
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,776
- Is that a yes?
- Oh, yes, it is. Thank you.

465
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,213
I... I don't know what to say,
but thank you.

466
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,388
- You're welcome.
You're welcome.

467
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,476
Knock, knock.

468
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,304
Hey, sweetheart.

469
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,563
Hey.

470
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:26,963
Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Lyn Malvo,

471
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,139
my wife, the one who lured me
to New Amsterdam.

472
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,143
Nice to meet you.

473
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:36,102
Floyd's gonna be
my new right-hand man.

474
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:39,541
Wow. Congratulations.

No, guys, let's sing
some harmonies, come on.

489
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,591
Or we can enjoy
the meditative silence

490
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,637
of a solid 45 minutes
of screen time.

491
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,466
Yes!

492
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,512
Boo. Boo.

493
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,872
All right,
dinner is in one hour.

494
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:51,177
Tell your brothers and sister.

495
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:52,483
- Okay, when I'm done.
- Oh, "When I'm done."

496
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,484
When she's done.

497
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,094
- She sassing you?
- Yeah.

498
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,096
Gosh.

499
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,403
You know, I hate to say it,
but I think, um,

500
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:00,970
I think we've been
COVID-blessed out here, babe.

501
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,580
- Yeah.
- You know, look at us.

502
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,234
We're out here being a family,
camping, making slingshots,

503
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:05,496
she's giving you sass.

504
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,106
I love it.

505
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,325
Kind of begs the question,

506
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:09,805
why don't we just
stay here indefinitely?

507
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,589
Uh, Iggy.

508
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,677
I'm just having
a little fantasy.

509
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:13,896
- Let me have my fantasy.
- All right.

510
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,984
Look, the kids are going back

511
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,203
to in-person learning
full-time.

512
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,118
I need to get back
to my practice,

513
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:22,121
and you need to get back
to the hospital.

514
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,428
Yeah, well, what if
I'm not ready to go back?

515
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,648
So, uh, we're gonna live out
of a rented RV

516
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,693
- in upstate New York?
- Pfft, no.

517
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,129
I thought maybe we'd live
out of a rented RV

518
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,958
in upstate Vermont next.

519
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,049
What?

520
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,790
You can't just
keep running, Iggs.

521
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:40,833
I'm not.

522
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,709
I'm not.

523
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:49,061
Help! Help!

524
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,020
Ah!

525
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,499
Dad!

526
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,544
What happened?

527
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,677
- Come on. Come on.
- Dad! Dad!

528
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,243
- Please!
- Father!

529
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,810
- Ow.
- Slow down. Slow down.

530
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,377
Splinter.

531
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:02,597
- Show us.
- Oh. Oh. Whoa.

532
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,512
Mamacita, you took
some shrapnel there, buddy.

533
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,645
Okay, but fortunately for you,
our crack team

534
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,560
- of surgeons are at the ready.
- Yeah.

535
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:12,476
Harper, bring me
the instruments of abscission.

536
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,825
- What?
- That old rusty saw

537
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:14,913
we found by the dumpster.

538
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,219
- You know what they are.
- Dad!

539
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,916
Saleem, bring me a towel
for all the blood

540
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,701
and a bucket to put
the severed limb in, stat.

541
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,790
- You got it.
- Dad, be serious.

542
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,706
- I... kid, I am being serious.
This is war, all right?

543
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,272
Here you go.

544
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,057
I promise you it'll be over
in a couple seconds, okay?

545
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,711
Harper, look away.

546
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,235
Nobody move. Nobody breathe.
Except for me.

547
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,977
I have to breathe, obviously.
I'm the doctor.

548
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,935
Here we go. Almost there.

549
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,328
- Yes.
- Oh!

550
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,112
- Victory.
- Look at that beast.

551
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,636
Whoa.

552
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,159
- Look at that thing.
That was inside your finger.

553
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:44,421
- Disgusting.
- I'll say.

554
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:45,727
That is a serious
piece of timber.

555
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,380
Actually, don't throw
that away.

556
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:48,643
We might want to ride that
down the Susquehanna later.

557
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,861
We're a big family.

558
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,428
Probably sink with all of us.

559
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,386
- Oh yeah, right.
Not with me as a captain.

560
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,867
- We have five family members.
- You are brave, private.

561
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,390
Sameera?

562
00:28:57,474 --> 00:29:00,263
I need you
to bandage this soldier.

563
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,134
- Sameera.
- Sameera.

564
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,527
What, did she go back
to the car?

565
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:06,008
- Uh, I don't know.
Did you guys see Sameera?

566
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,487
Sameera.

567
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,837
- She was just here.
She couldn't have gone far.

568
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,273
- Sameera!
- Sameera!

569
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,014
Sameera.

570
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,450
All right, um, you take

571
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:14,625
- everybody back to the RV.
- Hon.

572
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,105
No, no, I'm gonna
go look for her.

573
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,715
You find out where the nearest
ranger station is, okay?

574
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,456
- Guys, guys, stay close.
Stay close.

575
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,067
- Sameera.
- Sameera!

576
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,939
Sammy!

577
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,293
Sameera!
Sameera?

578
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,900
Sameera, baby!

579
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,513
Sameera!

580
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,304
Oh, God.

581
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,784
Oh, God, no.

582
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,971
Sameera!

583
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,929
Sameera?
Sameera, honey.

584
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm coming.

585
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,809
Sameera, honey?

586
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:15,248
Sameera, if you can hear me,
answer me, baby.

587
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:19,255
Sameera!

588
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,906
Sameera.

589
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,309
Sameera!

590
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:31,746
Sameera.
Oh, my God.

591
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,791
Did you... baby, did you not
hear me calling you?

592
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,400
Why didn't you answer me?
Sameera, honey, say something.

593
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,407
I don't want to go back.

594
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:42,669
You don't want... you don't
wanna go back where?

595
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,541
You don't want to go back
to the campsite?

596
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,413
You don't wanna...
Back to normal.

597
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,851
Back to normal?

598
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,549
What is it?
Is it school? Are you...

599
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,333
I like school better
on the computer.

600
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,292
I learn better.

601
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,468
Yeah.

602
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,383
Yeah, but what about
your friends, baby?

603
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,732
What about all them?

604
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:04,735
I'd rather be here
with you and Papa,

605
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,260
eating lunch together,
playing together.

606
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,262
Everything's easier at home.

607
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:13,875
Yeah.

608
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:18,488
Yeah. I like it too.

609
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,404
So why do we have
to go back?

610
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,798
Well, because...

611
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,540
Because it's not
supposed to be easy.

612
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:35,766
You know, asking your teacher
for help over and over again,

613
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,639
that helps you become
more resilient.

614
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:40,989
Navigating tricky friendships,

615
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,817
even though it's a pain
in your butt,

616
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,124
that builds self-esteem,
you know?

617
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:53,131
Life is starting again.

618
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:57,266
We can't stay here

619
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,787
where it's easy.

620
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,748
Make sense, kiddo?

621
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:14,802
Well, that was
quite the adventure.

622
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:18,374
- Oh, my God, that one...
- It's roasted.

623
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,984
- You okay?
- Oh, my God.

624
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,681
Yeah, yeah.

625
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,946
You know,
when Sameera went missing,

626
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,949
I just had
these visions of Chance.

627
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,211
Hurting her.

628
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,647
- Iggy...
- I know. I know.

629
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,386
I know it's irrational.
I know that in my heart.

630
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,394
There he was, you know,
clear as day.

631
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,135
Yes! It's golden.

632
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,832
And why not?

633
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:46,315
You know, day after day,
I just absorbed his despair.

634
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,404
It all just became
a part of me.

635
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:49,971
All my patients,
all their despair,

636
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:53,972
it just... it just becomes
a part of me.

637
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,630
But it was all worth it,
you know,

638
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,284
because at the end of the day,
I can just trade

639
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:02,592
my peace of mind for
the self-esteem it brought me.

640
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,069
Easy-peasy.

641
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:09,294
I don't wanna
make that trade anymore.

642
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:12,732
I don't... I don't need to.

643
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:16,388
Look at this.
Look at what we've done.

644
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:23,653
Martin, you give me
everything that I need.

645
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,486
Our family gives me...

646
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,190
Everything.

647
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,377
We can go home
whenever you need to.

648
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,767
No more running. I promise.

649
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,995
But I am not going
to see patients anymore.

650
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,869
I'm done with that life.

651
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,181
Watch it... I got mine on fire.

652
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:31,072
I knew you hated
budget meetings,

653
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,639
but this seems extreme.

654
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:35,551
I lost my wedding ring.

655
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,344
Max. Come out from there.

656
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,346
- I can't do it.
- Come on.

657
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,912
Mm-mm.

658
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,266
I mean, rings do hold

659
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,096
a certain amount
of symbolic power over us.

660
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,533
- Don't they?
- Yeah.

661
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,361
- I should know.
I've had three.

662
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,103
Three. You get it.

663
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,975
Oh, Max, I get it.

664
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,237
You feel like you're losing
a limb.

665
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,934
Part of your life.

666
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:09,632
And if it can be lost
that easily,

667
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,025
then what does that say?

668
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,680
Says you didn't deserve it.

669
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,900
All right,
come out of there now.

670
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,119
- Come on.
- Do I have to?

671
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,121
Yes.

672
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,777
If I've learned anything...

673
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:33,003
It's knowing
when to let them go.

674
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,396
When to move on.

675
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,051
I want to move on. I do.

676
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,183
But I didn't get
to make that decision.

677
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,531
That choice was taken from me.

678
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,318
She'd understand.

679
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,539
Max.

680
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,412
Look at me.

681
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:59,682
She'd understand.

682
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,289
I almost took it off.

683
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,684
On the anniversary of her...

684
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,297
Why didn't you?

685
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:14,262
Because when I look at Luna,

686
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,739
I don't even
see Georgia anymore.

687
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,877
I just see my little girl.

688
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:25,444
And when I look inside,
Georgia's not there either.

689
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:30,191
That ring...

690
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:33,194
It's all I have left...

691
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,151
Of our whole life.

692
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:42,942
Well, it didn't just
slip off your finger.

693
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,380
There's a reason
you took it off.

694
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,817
Maybe you should trust
your subconscious.

695
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:51,560
- Yeah.
Yeah.

696
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,779
Like I'm trying
to tell myself something.

697
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:57,174
- Found it.
- What? Really? Wow! Yes!

698
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,394
You're amazing. Thank you.
I gotta go.

699
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,744
Sorry. Wow. I... thank you.

700
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:03,267
Thank you,
Sandra Fall from billing.

701
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,703
Where did you find it?

702
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:06,879
- Your office.
In the pocket of your lab coat.

703
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,317
Oh, many lives were
saved today in this building,

704
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:10,753
but nothing as heroic
as what you just...

705
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,102
Yeah, I'm aware.

706
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:29,946
Sorry.

707
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,905
That was almost a pile-up.

708
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,517
Um...

709
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,606
- You're... you're here.
- Yes.

710
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,564
Six hours in a middle seat
that wouldn't recline.

711
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:44,653
- Oh. Rough.
I'm... I'm glad that you're back.

712
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:49,139
- Though a bit wrung out.
- Same.

713
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:50,445
- Why? Did something happen?
- No, no.

714
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:53,926
I just... I lost my wedding ring

715
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,274
for a minute, but...

716
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,282
Ah.

717
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:05,892
Kind of freaked me out,
but found it, so...

718
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,508
I see.

719
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,815
I spent the day with my mum
in a cancer clinic.

720
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:13,946
Oh, God, Helen.

721
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,470
No, no, she's fine,
but for hours,

722
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,385
I thought it was lung cancer.

723
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,779
But turns out it was just,
um, severe bronchitis.

724
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,387
That's a relief.

725
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,829
Do you want... do you wanna
walk with me?

726
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:34,271
You can tell me
about your "mum."

727
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:37,402
Did I say that right?
Came out weird.

728
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,020
I'm a little bit talked out
today, I think.

729
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,021
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

730
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,022
Yeah.

731
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,500
Me too, to be honest.

732
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,508
Maybe too much
was said already.

733
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,609
Helen.

734
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:17,096

735
