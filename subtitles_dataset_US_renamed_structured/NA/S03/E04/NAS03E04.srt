- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Whoa, prompt.

61
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,211
Good, I like that.

62
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:30,910
Already demonstrating you've
got what it takes.

63
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,129
To do what, exactly?

64
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:33,884
To take over Dr. Kapoor's
department.

65
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:37,671
Dr. Agnes Kao, interim chair
of neurology.

66
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,509
Sorry, I like to keep things
on the move.

67
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,220
- We'll work on that.
- I can't take over

68
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:43,297
- Dr. Kapoor's department.
- Why not?

69
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:44,982
I just finished
my fellowship.

70
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,180
I just took the boards.

71
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:48,579
- So how'd you do?
- 99th percentile, but...

72
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,075
- You're gonna be great.
- But...

73
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:54,047
Behold, the king of cardiac,
the duke of hearts

74
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,920
- returns to New Amsterdam.
- Stop.

75
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,140
Sorry, it's too much?

76
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,751
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,243
You need to find someone else
until Dr. Kapoor comes back.

78
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,892
Someone qualified.

79
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,568
You know, I'm trying to give
her her own department,

80
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,178
- and she's playing hardball.
- Been there.

81
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,258
What if I were just

82
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:09,746
the interim-interim chair
of neurology?

83
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,836
Would that make you
more comfortable?

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,880
Only marginally.

85
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,099
Sold. You got it.

86
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,324
Now get out there,
and go get 'em, tiger.

87
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah, how you holding up?

88
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,107
Well, I'll take the fifth on
that, but at least I'm here.

89
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,327
Well, I would love to be here
to witness

90
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,893
- your triumphant return.
- But?

91
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,068
I'm off to Connecticut.

92
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,844
Assuming I survive rush hour
on the FDR

93
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,595
and awkward silences with
Georgia's parents,

94
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,151
I'm finally bringing home Luna.

95
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,806
I can't wait to see the look
on her face

96
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,798
- when she sees me again.
- That's great, Max.

97
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,000
- What should I...
- Oh.

98
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:42,570
Uh, see Helen for instructions
on your royal return.

99
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,710
Got it.

100
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,750
So, um...
where is he?

101
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,393
He's out there.

102
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:48,956
Got it, okay.

103
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,390
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,680
Linus Wilding?

105
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,320
You Linus?

106
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,759
Hi, how you doing?
I'm Dr. Frome.

107
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:00,406
You can just call me Iggy.

108
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,023
I didn't do anything wrong.

109
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,790
No, I know.
I know that, I know.

110
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,671
I'm just here to talk.
That's all.

111
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,777
So, burning question.

112
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,254
You ever run away before?

113
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,539
- No?
- You ever wanted to?

114
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,073
Okay.

115
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,039
So then I got to assume that
something big,

116
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,884
something major happened,
right?

117
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:21,731
To make you want to do it
now.

118
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,743
And I know that this is hard to
talk about,

119
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:27,346
but I have to ask...

120
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,142
did somebody hurt you,
physically?

121
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,437
I didn't run away, okay?

122
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,692
My mom, she...

123
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,256
she threw me out.

124
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,859
Okay.

125
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,617
Well, maybe you can help me
understand this, then.

126
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,223
Why did she call the police and
file a missing persons report?

127
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,095
Okay.
Hi.

128
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,246
I'm so grateful you found
him, Dr. Frome.

129
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:00,814
- I haven't slept in days.
- Yeah, I can only imagine.

130
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,163
Um...

131
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,426
did you manage to bring
the things I...

132
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,862
Yes, everything
you asked for.

133
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,255
Linus's birth certificate,
immunization forms,

134
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,779
and recent school ID.

135
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,781
Oh, great, thank you.

136
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,696
Okay.

137
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,024
Ms. Wilding, can you think
of any reason why

138
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:18,133
there's confusion about the
events that led Linus to leave?

139
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,540
Did you guys have a fight?

140
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,747
- Anything?
- No.

141
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,935
Four weeks ago,
I sent him off to camp,

142
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,369
and he never came home.

143
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,455
Okay.

144
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,338
Okay.

145
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,370
Okay, here's what I think
we should do:

146
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,610
The three of us should
have a chat,

147
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:37,676
maybe clear up any of this
confusion that's going on.

148
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,025
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

149
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,289
I think now would be
a good time.

150
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:41,462
Are you okay with that?

151
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:45,951
Linus.

152
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,270
What's going on here?

153
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,626
Well, I think your son
is feeling a little...

154
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,813
I don't know who that is,
but that is definitely not my son.

155
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,234
I'm...

156
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,665
I'm fairly confident that is.

157
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,318
He looks like my son,
Dr. Frome, I know.

158
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,273
But they are not the same.

159
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:14,849
No, that boy is an imposter.

160
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,976
A mother knows.
A mother can tell.

161
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,008
That's not my son.

162
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:37,633
- There he is, in the flesh.
- Good to see you, Max.

163
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,519
No place I'd rather be.

164
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:41,641
Hey. Calvin.

165
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,806
I hope your drive wasn't
too bad.

166
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,992
Yeah, it was okay.

167
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:48,306
We've got Luna's stuff all
packed up, ready to go.

168
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,664
Oh, that's very sweet.
Thank you, thank you, Gwen.

169
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:52,173
Where is she hiding?

170
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,958
Oh, she's just
in the living room,

171
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,351
- playing.
- Oh, great.

172
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,614
Please say you'll stay
for lunch.

173
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,103
I'm perfecting
my bread machine.

174
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,993
No, I couldn't...
Couldn't say no to that.

175
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,056
Of course.
I, um...

176
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,790
I would love that.

177
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,774
All this one-on-one time
with her was priceless.

178
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:12,891
Luna!
Guess who's here.

179
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,124
Luna!
Dada's here.

180
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,423
Hammond Sims, 25-year-old
male, possible kidney stones.

181
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:42,485
More like boulders.

182
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,604
You'll be all right, brother.

183
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:45,134
How long have you had
this pain for?

184
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,141
It's been a minute.

185
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,790
Thought to come in
when it first hit...

186
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,980
But the nightclub got wiped out
by the 'rona.

187
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,243
No health insurance.

188
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,234
Oh, yeah, you and half
the city.

189
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,368
Oh, snap.

190
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,848
Okay, okay, we're gonna get

191
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,548
- you dialed in...
- Get away from me!

192
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,836
Stop!
No, stop!

193
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,379
Guy's on K2!
Call security!

194
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,299
- Ahh!
- Casey!

195
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:15,170
I will kill you!

196
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:20,915
I see you!
I see you all!

197
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,624
I see you all!

198
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,383
Brunstetter's in surgery.

199
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,363
Fractured ocular orbit.

200
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:39,844
That guy just snapped.

201
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,102
I knew he was on something
when we admitted him.

202
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,727
I should've paged security
right then.

203
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:45,180
No, it's on me.

204
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,414
I should've gotten there
faster or been closer...

205
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:48,462
Hey.

206
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,117
This is not your fault.

207
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,337
Or yours or yours.

208
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,882
How many of us have been
attacked while on the job?

209
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,216
Assaulted...

210
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,211
slapped, bit, kicked, clawed.

211
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,732
Come on.

212
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,062
How many of you feel unsafe
working here?

213
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:12,052
They said they were gonna
install metal detectors.

214
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,619
I heard
more security cameras.

215
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:16,133
Yeah, we keep waiting for
someone else to protect us.

216
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,493
And now one of our own.

217
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:20,495
We all deserve to feel safe.

218
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,497
And today, I am gonna
make that happen.

219
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,043
- Incoming!
- Oh, got another one.

220
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,216
Here we go.

221
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,016
No, no,
flight 117 isn't gonna work

222
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,898
because I need
to leave New York now

223
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,288
to get there in time.

224
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:37,599
Yes, I appreciate
it's short notice, ma'am,

225
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,063
but that's partly due
to the fact

226
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,321
that I waited 45 minutes
to talk to you.

227
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,607
I'm back and reporting
for duty.

228
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:49,187
Yeah, yes, I'll gladly hold
one more time.

229
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:53,203
Wait, you're back...
like, here?

230
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,835
Max didn't tell you
I was starting today?

231
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,141
No,

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,578
which is odd,
because he's usually so great

233
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,362
about communicating
important information.

234
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,973
Did he say
what I was supposed to do?

235
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,859
He said you have instructions
for my royal re...

236
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,712
Why don't I just pop
up to cardio and jump in

237
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:09,539
where they need me?

238
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,164
Sounds great, thank you.

239
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:13,700
Is everything good with you?

240
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,203
I'm just trying to book
a last-minute flight to Iran,

241
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,399
but no one's willing to help,
so...

242
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,618
Iran?

243
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,117
It's my brother.

244
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:25,578
Yes, n...
Yes, I'm here.

245
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,360
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

246
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:31,187
A layover isn't going to work
because it's time sensitive.

247
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,650
Sorry, can I speak to
your supervisor, please?

248
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,836
God, she's so big.

249
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,133
- And she uses a fork.
- She's like a real person.

250
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,882
When you see the floor
after she's done,

251
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,796
it won't seem as impressive.

252
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:45,976
What about peas?

253
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,063
She used to love peas
for lunch.

254
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:50,411
Dada misses seeing you chomp
on those peas...

255
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,326
Mm.

256
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,648
- Yeah...
- What?

257
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:57,417
Luna's perhaps not as much of
a pea aficionado these days.

258
00:12:57,502 --> 00:13:00,421
- No, she hates them.
- Truly.

259
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,226
- Really?
- That's new.

260
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,301
Anyway, what she really loves
is sausage.

261
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:12,694
- Sausage? No.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:15,479
- Gwen, show him the thing.
- Yeah.

263
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:19,919
♪ Sausage, sausage,
sausage, sa... ♪

264
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:24,141
♪ Sausage, sausage, boop!
Boo-do-do ♪

265
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,484
Wow!

266
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,856
There's nothing wrong
with me. I feel fine.

267
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,120
I know you do,
but I'd like to run some tests, okay?

268
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:48,539
You don't understand.

269
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:51,828
He was supposed to come home
from camp, and he never did.

270
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,562
Doesn't make any sense.

271
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,651
<i>And then that other kid
just shows up,</i>

272
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,828
<i>claiming to be my son.</i>

273
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:02,757
Yana, I need you to take
a deep breath and hold it.

274
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,076
And exhale.

275
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,163
<i>Doing great, Yana.
Good job.</i>

276
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,331
So scary.

277
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:24,367
This random person trying to
convince me he's my son.

278
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,017
Pretending.

279
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,555
You're sure they're related?

280
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,078
Yes, I'm sure.
I checked.

281
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,124
Linus is definitely her son.

282
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:37,007
There's gotta be
a better explanation.

283
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,843
There is.

284
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:49,704
So, you won't believe how
fast HCC works

285
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,010
when you threaten
to call the media.

286
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,794
We're getting new
security cameras.

287
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:55,580
Better. They finally agreed
to cough up some cash

288
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:58,539
for actual security
around here.

289
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:00,019
Excuse me.

290
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,281
Is there a Dr. Bloom?

291
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,543
Ta-da.

292
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,259
Yes, officers.
Welcome.

293
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,634
Thinking we would plant
you here, there,

294
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,637
and how 'bout over there?

295
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,078
Private hospitals have had cops
in the ED for years.

296
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:16,728
About time we got our own.

297
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,817
Problem solved.

298
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:24,538
<i>Speaking Spanish...</i>

299
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:34,924
Put me in, coach.

300
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,410
Floyd, hey!
So great to see you.

301
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,974
We just heard you were
coming back.

302
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:41,707
- Just heard, like...
- Ten minutes ago?

303
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,869
Hm.
Should've seen that coming.

304
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:45,844
Max isn't great
with communication.

305
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:48,314
Yeah, so I hear.
Well, sorry to surprise you,

306
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,720
but I am back, I'm here,
I'm ready for action, and, uh,

307
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,116
yeah, just put me wherever
you want.

308
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,612
I'll do
that triple valve replacement.

309
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,423
Oh, Alvarez is already
on that one.

310
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:57,511
Oh, okay, well.

311
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,094
Can't expect to start
at the top.

312
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,830
What about the aortic valve
replacement in OR 2?

313
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:04,214
That's you.

314
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,361
It's been crazy around here.

315
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,306
COVID cut
our elective surgeries in half.

316
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:11,612
Wow, okay.
Um, hell, I'll do anything.

317
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,440
What about the
mediastinal node biopsy?

318
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:16,032
Okay, I know how
this looks...

319
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,140
Duke, wow.

320
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,965
Well, Duke,
he's still a resident.

321
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,534
- I could supervise.
- Already assigned.

322
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,216
Wow.

323
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:28,822
Hey, go set up your office,

324
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,501
and I'll page you
if something comes up.

325
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:33,261
I don't really have
an office.

326
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:37,943
No, it's on reserve.

327
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:39,797
They're just waiting
on the visa.

328
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,686
Well, couldn't you...

329
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:45,516
Y... okay, yes, I understand.

330
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,022
Yeah.
Yes, I'll have my phone on.

331
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,077
Hey.

332
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,090
Just wanted to check in on you

333
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:55,830
after that phone call
this morning.

334
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,327
It's fine.

335
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,131
I didn't know you spoke
Farsi.

336
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,866
Well, I do.

337
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,687
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm here.

338
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,149
Let me help.

339
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,362
I need an immigration lawyer,
not a trauma surgeon.

340
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:15,078
Well, I definitely didn't
come here to make things worse.

341
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,984
I've spent this day wrangling
travel agents and visas,

342
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,854
and it's been nothing short
of a bureaucratic nightmare.

343
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,553
I'm barely holding it together.

344
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:26,122
So I'm sorry, but I really
don't want to talk about it...

345
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,452
With anyone.

346
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,437
Best immigration lawyer
in Manhattan.

347
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:48,535
"The dear deer dart
and play,

348
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,312
while the crow crows
the night away."

349
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:52,235
Sorry to interrupt.

350
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,975
Cal, do you think you could
help get her

351
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,259
in the car real quick with me?

352
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,548
Come on, Luna.

353
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:03,679
We're gonna see Grampy
and Grammy real soon.

354
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:07,119
I mean, maybe stay
another few minutes.

355
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:08,555
I think she just needs a nap.

356
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,862
Yeah, I know. I just think
I need to get her home.

357
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:13,470
Okay.
All righty.

358
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,477
Oof.

359
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,913
All right.
Thank you, Cal.

360
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,046
No go.
No go!

361
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,874
Mama here.

362
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:37,845
We found small lesions
in your mother's brain.

363
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:41,377
And they are the reason why
she has been so confused.

364
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,806
Okay.

365
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,390
It's a rare
misidentification disorder

366
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,651
known as Capgras syndrome.

367
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,774
But what does that even mean?

368
00:18:56,905 --> 00:19:00,912
Well, it's like her brain's
facial recognition system

369
00:19:00,996 --> 00:19:02,937
has been rewired.

370
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,308
And the emotional ties
that she should feel

371
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:08,920
when she looks at you are lost.

372
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,285
She doesn't feel them.

373
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,489
She thinks
you're an imposter.

374
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,669
But... but I'm not.

375
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:20,149
I mean, I'm me.

376
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,152
She was fine when I went
to camp, and...

377
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:28,461
I don't understand
what's happening.

378
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,594
If the lesions were
in a different spot,

379
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:33,292
maybe we could do surgery,
but in your mother's case,

380
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,943
it's not an option.

381
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:40,710
Well, there's gotta be some
medicine she can take, right?

382
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,564
Yeah, I've already
prescribed it,

383
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:48,261
but the meds will only stop her
symptoms from getting worse.

384
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:50,937
Uh...

385
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:54,796
Linus, there's no easy way
to say this.

386
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:58,590
Your mother is never going
to recognize you again.

387
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,702
Her condition is permanent.

388
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,608
So she's never
gonna know who I am?

389
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,366
I am so sorry.

390
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,900
But... but she's my mom.

391
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,296
I mean, I don't have
anyone else who...

392
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,765
well, what am I supposed to do?
Where...

393
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,647
Where will I go?
She's my mom.

394
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,788
Okay.

395
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,687
Where are we on the pain scale
now, big guy?

396
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,017
Seven.

397
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:47,497
That's better.

398
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,312
Zero would be better.

399
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,370
Let's up his morphine
2 milligrams.

400
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,070
These kidney stones
ain't no joke.

401
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,464
Don't worry, it'll pass.

402
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,768
Get it?
"Pass."

403
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:04,989
Come on.
It's funny because it's true.

404
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,214
What? Nothing?
Wow.

405
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,042
Tough crowd.

406
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:12,345
Can we talk?

407
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,048
What's going on?

408
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,577
It's the cops.

409
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:26,772
But they're here for us.

410
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:28,926
To keep us safe.

411
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,805
You know what I see?

412
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,503
I see the people
who've been stopping me

413
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,852
since I was 12 years old,

414
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:41,072
making me sit on curbs
and face walls.

415
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:44,249
I got handcuffed coming home
from work one day in my scrubs.

416
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,555
In my scrubs.

417
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,818
Casey, come on.
You know that I would never...

418
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,820
Ask Weber and ask Mariana,
Lauren.

419
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:51,343
We all got stories.

420
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:52,692
Hell, why don't you ask
your little friend

421
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:54,607
who's always up in here
using our showers?

422
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:55,913
Yeah.

423
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,393
I noticed.

424
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,220
Ask her if she feels
any safer

425
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,396
with all these cops
hanging around

426
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,527
watching everything she does.

427
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,876
Okay. Right.

428
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,367
So what are we supposed
to do next time

429
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,185
there's another assault, huh?

430
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,708
Brunstetter's still upstairs

431
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,362
getting his eye socket
repaired.

432
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,711
You think he'd want
them gone?

433
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,409
You think cops make
trans people feel safe?

434
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,411
Casey, I'm not blind, okay?

435
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,108
I know that there
are bad cops...

436
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,284
You didn't just try to "not
all cops" me now, did you?

437
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,286
But it's not all cops.

438
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,418
And you know that.

439
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:24,420
- And we need them here.
- "We"?

440
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:26,117
Tell me who's "we."

441
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,598
Because the undocumented,
they're gonna stay away.

442
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,948
The homeless,
they're gonna stay away, too.

443
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,863
And what about the next patient
who comes in here

444
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:34,168
under the influence?

445
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,083
You suddenly want these cops
feeling compelled

446
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,129
to make arrests because, hell,
they're already here?

447
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:40,523
What could possibly go wrong?

448
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:55,015
They're not making us feel
any safer, Lauren.

449
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,537
It's just a different kind
of unsafe.

450
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:59,036
Got a diaphragmatic repair.

451
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,864
40-year-old model rocket
enthusiast

452
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,213
ironically failed to launch.

453
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:04,520
I'll need an OR.
Oh, and another set of hands.

454
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,609
Right in here,
but we're short staffed.

455
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,088
I'm available.

456
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:09,176
Who are you?

457
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,757
Floyd Reynolds,
cardiothoracic.

458
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:12,571
Ever worked
a diaphragm before?

459
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,181
Once or twice.

460
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:24,975
And we have liftoff.

461
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,237
Diaphragm is exposed.

462
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,544
Oof, rocket did some damage.

463
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,589
Yeah,
one small step for mankind,

464
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:33,374
one huge abdominal tear
for James Feller.

465
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,028
Biological mesh.

466
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:37,074
You know, a monofilament
mattress suture

467
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,423
might work better.

468
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,033
Mesh will provide
a tension-free closure.

469
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,426
Yeah, but why not close it

470
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,298
without introducing
a foreign object, you know?

471
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,561
Because the uneven edges

472
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,780
of the monofilament closure
would pucker.

473
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:50,217
Eh, sutures could be laid
down to minimize it.

474
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,263
- I'm sorry, Doctor...?
- Reynolds.

475
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:53,873
Dr. Reynolds was chair
of cardiothoracic...

476
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:55,353
Oh, it's fine, Kat.

477
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:57,050
Chair or no chair, I asked
for another set of hands,

478
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,051
not a second opinion.

479
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,142
This is my OR,
and surgeries will be done

480
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:03,404
the way I want them.

481
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,621
Now, you can either
get on board or get out.

482
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:10,716
On board it is.

483
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,065
Mesh.

484
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,228
No, it's above and beyond.
Truly.

485
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,764
Thank you.

486
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,177
Okay, you too.
Buh-bye.

487
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:22,075
Okay, so Linus's cousin in Ohio

488
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,903
is going to take him in
permanently.

489
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,557
That's good news, right?

490
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:29,430
It's better than foster care.
That's true.

491
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:32,430
Or worse yet,
a runaway shelter.

492
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,569
Oh, man.

493
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:39,702
So what's wrong?

494
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,268
It's Yana.

495
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,443
I can't stop thinking
about Yana.

496
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:43,923
I mean, she's still convinced

497
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,447
that her son is out there
somewhere, right?

498
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:47,927
And she's never gonna stop
looking for him,

499
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,929
and we will never be able to
convince her of the truth.

500
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:51,583
That's just facts.

501
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,364
It's all just so...

502
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:00,720
What?

503
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:02,768
What?

504
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,117
You're looking at me.

505
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,928
Oh, yeah.

506
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,644
Yeah, I think this is usually
the time

507
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,167
when Vijay says
something profound

508
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,604
and gives me like a...
a good idea.

509
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,779
Well, I don't know
what to say!

510
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,998
Just try something.
Throw it at me.

511
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:16,216
Try what?

512
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,783
Yana thinks that Linus is
an imposter,

513
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,655
and you'll never be able to
convince her that he isn't.

514
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,047
I just said that.

515
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:22,483
Just like you'll never be
able to convince me

516
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:23,702
that I can fill
Dr. Kapoor's shoes.

517
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:24,964
These are facts!

518
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,139
I can't do this,

519
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:28,054
and Linus may as well be dead.

520
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:30,883
So no, I don't know
what to say.

521
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,190
That's...

522
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:34,670
that's genius.

523
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,367
What is?

524
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:37,716
Therapeutic fibbing.

525
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,805
That is a great success
in similar syndromes.

526
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,157
Wait, no.

527
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,507
You want to tell her that
her son is dead?

528
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,292
I didn't mean that literally.

529
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,510
Look, all she wants
is a way to move on.

530
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,382
Right?
A way to get on with her life.

531
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:53,558
Oh, what about Linus?

532
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:56,517
He lost his mom, and he knows
that she's not dead.

533
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,432
Yeah, he's looking
for a relationship with her.

534
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,131
He's looking for a connection.
That's it, so...

535
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:02,991
why don't we give him one?

536
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,573
One of you took it!

537
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:10,706
Hey.

538
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,577
Thanks for getting rid
of those cops.

539
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,535
Yeah, yeah.
Back to covering our own butts.

540
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,712
- Give it back!
- And right on cue.

541
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:19,192
It's my phone.
I know you took it!

542
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:21,020
- And I want it back.
- Sir, can you just...?

543
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,121
But sir... sir!

544
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,719
You told us you left your phone
at the bar.

545
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,155
- Not true.
- Everyone stay back.

546
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,939
- Where's my phone?
- No, Casey, I mean it.

547
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:29,028
If anyone else is getting hurt
today, it's gonna be me.

548
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,203
Think you can just
hold me here?

549
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,640
Sir, sir.
I need you to look at me.

550
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,380
We're gonna get you
sobered up,

551
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:34,730
and we're gonna get you
out of here.

552
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,427
But right now, I need you
to return to your bed.

553
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,298
I do not need to sober up.

554
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:40,387
What I need is my damn phone.

555
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,085
No, you need to return
to your bed.

556
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,564
Can you do that for me?

557
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:45,741
I'm not getting back
in that stupid bed.

558
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:46,872
And you can't make me.

559
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,700
This is my ED.

560
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,136
I make the rules.

561
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,310
Now put your damn mask on,
and get back in your bed!

562
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,859
I bet this whole "I'm a tank"
thing you got going on

563
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:19,818
comes in pretty handy when you
mess up someone's drink.

564
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:22,865
Actually, I was a bouncer.

565
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:25,386
Not sure how I missed that.

566
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:40,752
Thank you for the lawyer.

567
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,403
Did she help?

568
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:45,710
It was too late.

569
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,858
My brother died.

570
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:57,810
Half-brother.

571
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:04,341
We weren't close,
but...

572
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:07,431
I mean, I wanted to be,
I just...

573
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:09,822
I just thought
that I had time.

574
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,785
According to Islam,

575
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:16,919
he needed to be buried
before the next sundown.

576
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,831
But I ran out of time.

577
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:24,056
I keep...

578
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,881
I keep running out of time.

579
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:33,454
And I... I nearly got there,
but then my visa...

580
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,155
What does it matter?

581
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,984
I don't want to make excuses
anymore.

582
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,030
About him...

583
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,898
about you.

584
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,777
What was your brother's name?

585
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:58,134
Farhad.

586
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,541
Sorry.

587
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,324
We haven't visited since...

588
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,502
Since the funeral.

589
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,166
She just thinks
we're at the park.

590
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,212
She doesn't realize...

591
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:34,950
"Mama here."

592
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:40,959
I want to do the right thing,
but I...

593
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:42,740
I don't know what that is.

594
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:51,927
I love her so much.
I just don't know...

595
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:54,973
if I'm enough...

596
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:56,580
without you.

597
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:06,329
I don't know if
I'm ever gonna be enough.

598
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:18,010
Hi.

599
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:21,362
Just came by to check in.

600
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,348
I know this has been a lot,

601
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,644
with the diagnosis
and your son.

602
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,266
I can't believe he's gone.

603
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,662
And the strangest thing is,

604
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,222
a part of me feels...

605
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,324
relieved

606
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:38,418
to finally know the truth.

607
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,441
Is that awful of me?

608
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,727
No.

609
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:45,991
No.

610
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:49,004
When I thought
he was still out there,

611
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,168
all alone, lost,

612
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,144
needing me,
and I couldn't find him, it...

613
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,988
it was excruciating.

614
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,953
Now...

615
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,943
Now you can grieve.

616
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:08,870
I get it.

617
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,527
Yeah.

618
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:17,273
So, listen,

619
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:21,625
I know that this might not
be the best time, but...

620
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,149
there's actually
someone here

621
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,195
that is going through
the exact same thing,

622
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,754
if you wanted to talk to him.

623
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,668
Now?

624
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:32,839
Yeah.

625
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,411
I think that it would be great
for you to talk to someone

626
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,621
who knows what this feels like.

627
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,830
You know?

628
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,439
But only if you want to.
It's up to you.

629
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,746
Yeah?
Okay.

630
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:01,137
- You!
- She doesn't want to see me.

631
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,840
No, no, no.
Yana, hang on, listen.

632
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:04,581
Just hear him out, okay?

633
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:06,148
He broke into my house!

634
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,989
I know, I know, and that
must have been really scary.

635
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:12,394
But I'm asking you if you would
please let him explain.

636
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:13,672
That's all.

637
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:22,422
Thank you.
Good, okay.

638
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,078
Okay.

639
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,379
I, uh...

640
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,558
I did break in.

641
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:36,498
And I'm real sorry about that.

642
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:39,906
Tell her why.

643
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,464
I, uh...

644
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,189
I...

645
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:49,949
I just lost my mom.

646
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:52,144
And, uh...

647
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,805
it was sudden.

648
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:57,925
And ...didn't know

649
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,175
what to do,
where to go, but...

650
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:05,527
your place...
Your place, it felt safe.

651
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,574
Felt familiar.

652
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:11,472
Like home.

653
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:16,636
I'm sorry about your mom.

654
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,214
I know how hard that must be.

655
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:21,742
I just really miss her.

656
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:25,807
What was she like?

657
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:31,665
I know.

658
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,988
Go on.
Tell her.

659
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:49,925
She was...

660
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,839
one of a kind.

661
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:56,258
She was funny

662
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,816
and smart and honest.

663
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:05,789
I lost my son, you know.

664
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,550
You on the list?

665
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:23,604
Am I what?

666
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,199
You on the list?

667
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:28,069
It's cool.
He's with me.

668
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:30,449
I'm with her.

669
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:34,012
I just came by to check
on Brunstetter.

670
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:37,081
No ocular damage,
and the bone is stabilized.

671
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:40,258
- He's gonna be okay.
- Good, great.

672
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:45,175
And what can you tell me
about them?

673
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,139
- We defunded the police.
- What?

674
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,833
While I was in Connecticut?

675
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,269
All these bouncers,

676
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:53,315
who know a thing or two
about de-escalation,

677
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,360
were out of work
thanks to COVID.

678
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,015
Now they have a job
that comes with healthcare.

679
00:35:58,099 --> 00:35:59,712
Is this gentleman
bothering you?

680
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:01,453
I was just leaving.

681
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:19,950
Seriously?

682
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,169
I heard about your day.

683
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:23,083
And I came to apologize.

684
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,476
Epic fail on my part,

685
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,087
but then I pictured Cassian

686
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:29,525
not even knowing who you were.

687
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:32,049
Sorry, sorry.

688
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,268
Thanks.

689
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,921
It's kind of funny.

690
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:37,315
Right?
Sorry.

691
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,360
What did...
This is, like,

692
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:40,231
- the worst apology ever.
- I know.

693
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:43,060
Sorry, again.
I just, um...

694
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:44,888
I had kind of a day myself.

695
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:48,283
I got nothing left in the tank.

696
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:51,242
You got nothing left.

697
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:54,724
I'm living out of my suitcase,
with my mom,

698
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,117
my marriage was over
before it ever began,

699
00:36:57,201 --> 00:37:01,557
and the one place
that I ever felt right

700
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:03,686
doesn't have a place for me.

701
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,780
I know lots of places that
would happily give you

702
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,086
their cardio department.

703
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,915
I don't care
about other places, man.

704
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,269
I care about here.

705
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:16,665
Look, you wanna stick me in the
classroom, teaching interns,

706
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm there.

707
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:20,663
You want me to assist
in general surgeries,

708
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:21,664
I'll take it.

709
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:23,622
That's a huge step down
for you.

710
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:26,579
Huge step down from what?
I'm already there.

711
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:32,327
What I need is a hand
getting back up.

712
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,919
In Korea, women in mourning
wear white bows in their hair.

713
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:01,747
This is the best I could do
in K-town.

714
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,576
May I?

715
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,665
Yeah.

716
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:25,641
We had the same father.

717
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:28,513
<i>♪ Don't let your mind
get weary ♪</i>

718
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,448
He was younger than me.

719
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:35,324
I didn't even know that he
existed till six years ago.

720
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:39,660
I only met him once.

721
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,049
But once was all it took.

722
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,597
<i>♪ Don't let your heart get
heavy ♪</i>

723
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:49,172
I knew he was my brother.

724
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:51,272
Without a doubt.

725
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:00,558
Is this what your family does
when someone dies?

726
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:02,888
Martha and Tim Shinnler?

727
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,981
No, they wouldn't know
a Korean mourning custom

728
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,982
- from a hole in the ground.
- Wait, Shinnler?

729
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:12,209
I was adopted.

730
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,516
When I was three.

731
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,909
I shortened my name right
after college.

732
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:18,520
As far as the hairclip,
I learned about that

733
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,348
in my Korean lit class.

734
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:22,393
Huh.

735
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,221
So your family's...

736
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:26,152
German Irish.

737
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,658
I actually had to teach myself
to be Korean.

738
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,051
Still really don't know how.

739
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,551
<i>♪ In you,
that's where you'll find ♪</i>

740
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:42,927
So what else did you learn in
these college classes of yours?

741
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,350
Leyla, we should talk.

742
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:10,442
I knew using your showers
was too good to last.

743
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:14,899
Well, get it over with.

744
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,988
Grab your stuff.
It's not safe out here.

745
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:37,552
This is my secret spot.

746
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,057
Why do this for me?

747
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:46,996
I protect my people.

748
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,532
Here we go, you ready?

749
00:40:57,616 --> 00:41:00,186
- Yeah.
- Here it is.

750
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:02,319
This is home.

751
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,973
You remember this place?

752
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:05,409
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

753
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:07,542
There's a couch over there,
right?

754
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:10,153
This is our kitchen.
Remember the kitchen?

755
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

756
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:15,637
This is where you're gonna
throw lots of food at Dada

757
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,160
until he figures out
what you want,

758
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,249
which I guess is not peas
anymore.

759
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,116
And this is our sleepy room.

760
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:24,090
This is my bed.

761
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:27,608
And this,
this bed is for you.

762
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,920
You like it?

763
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah.

764
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:38,842
And this place...

765
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:42,530
this is just for you.

766
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:46,045
I know it's not much,

767
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,101
but, uh...

768
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,053
Dada here.

769
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:56,576
Yeah.

770
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,726
Yeah, Dada here.

771
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:16,175
Dada's always here.

772
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
