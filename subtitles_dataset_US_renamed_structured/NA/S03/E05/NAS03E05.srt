1
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,684
Ready to get started?

2
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,013
Yeah.

3
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,060
Okay, thank you.

4
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,508
Let's step on the scale,
please.

5
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,182
You've got a lot of history
and biology to overcome.

6
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,840
Your ghrelin is out of whack,

7
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,044
and you've got
high leptin resistance

8
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,362
making you feel hungrier
than you actually are.

9
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,216
But then your body is terrible
at signaling

10
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,669
when you're truly full.

11
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:43,287
Add to that
all the emotional stuff

12
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,638
you're working through,

13
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,241
having a healthy relationship
with food

14
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,328
will be a lifelong battle
for you.

15
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,395
Well, then it's a good thing
I'm halfway done, right?

16
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,560
You'll need someone
to work with you

17
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,902
on your ingrained
emotional assignments to food.

18
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,034
No, no, no.

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,271
No, I really like going
to group.

20
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:01,646
It's great.
I share in there.

21
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,082
- Everyone's really supportive...
- Iggy.

22
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,388
You haven't logged in once.

23
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,129
No, that's not true.
I've...

24
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,231
The system keeps track.

25
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,934
You have to stop lying
and do the work.

26
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,192
There's someone I want you
to talk to.

27
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,177
It's a recovery coach?

28
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,630
What is that, a food monitor?
Food chaperone?

29
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:26,380
That's not happening.
No, absolutely not.

30
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,036
No.

31
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,998
Can I put my pants on now,
please?

32
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,722
<font color=#FF00FF>*NEW AMSTERDAM (2018)*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03  Episode 05</font>

33
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,544
Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>" Blood, Sweat & Tears"</font>
Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">March 30, 2021</font>

34
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,075
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

35
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,881
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yes, Dr. Kao, what's up?

36
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:44,701
- You caught me.
- I just wanted to check

37
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:46,186
- and see, not to rush you.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,169
- But I was just curious.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,014
- How are the interviews going?
- Interviews.

40
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,779
For the interim chair
of neurology.

41
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:52,638
Yes, those interviews
are going great.

42
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:53,782
Really good.

43
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,175
You haven't started them yet,
have you?

44
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,123
Not in the technical sense,
no, but Agnes,

45
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,420
you are the best interim,
interim chair of neurology

46
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,037
a medical director could
ask for.

47
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:02,583
I appreciate your confidence
in me,

48
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,842
but Dr. Kapoor is a 30-year
veteran in the field,

49
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,201
and I'm not even an attending.

50
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,099
I am woefully underprepared.

51
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,404
You're not, Dr. Kao,

52
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,810
but if it makes you
feel better,

53
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:12,302
I will start
those interviews today.

54
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,951
Ah, Max, we've got a problem.

55
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,701
Tomorrow,
but what's one more day?

56
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:16,889
- How can I help?
- Sorry, Agnes.

57
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,372
- No, Max...
- This way, yep.

58
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,209
Our blood bank supplies have
reached critical lows.

59
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,528
How did that happen?

60
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:23,898
I've narrowed it down
to vampires

61
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,074
or the global pandemic.

62
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:26,380
There's a nicer way
to say that.

63
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,341
A third of our blood
donations normally come

64
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,498
from high school
or business blood drives,

65
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,920
but with everyone at home...

66
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,435
Well, what about
hospital employees?

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,562
Tapped out.

68
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,304
Everyone's within their
eight-week turnaround window.

69
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:38,306
But we've got
backup supplies, right?

70
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,916
Um...

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
most of it went
toward Haven yesterday.

72
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,747
There was a ten-car pileup
on the BQE.

73
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,092
The world's opening up faster

74
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,271
than we can replenish
our stores.

75
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:49,665
We're one major accident away
from catastrophe.

76
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:50,967
- Okay, okay.
- Don't worry.

77
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,276
You manage what little
we've got left,

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,582
and I will get
the blood flowing.

79
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,626
I love your enthusiasm,

80
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,888
but blood drives
aren't as easy...

81
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,325
I got this.

82
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,001
Oh.

83
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:01,938
Sandra Fall from billing?

84
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,548
Max Goodwin,
the dark overlord.

85
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,594
- Ouch, when did that happen?
- When I got downsized.

86
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,770
Oh, sorry.
There have been too many cuts.

87
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,162
Well, how am I supposed
to cover my rent

88
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:10,381
or pay my bills?

89
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,644
I'm gonna have to fight my cat
for food.

90
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:13,935
Wait, no, you won't

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,045
because I just had
a great idea.

92
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,779
You can be
my new executive assistant.

93
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:18,563
You are rehired.
Where are you going?

94
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:19,782
To find a nice street corner

95
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,610
where I can beg for change
and recyclables.

96
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,351
Come on.
It's not that bad of a gig.

97
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,613
Oh, no?
What happened to Dora?

98
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,615
- Dora quit.
- Oh, what happened to Adele?

99
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,573
- Adele died...
- What?

100
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:29,705
Of natural causes.

101
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,017
It had nothing to do
with this job.

102
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,011
Listen, I really need your help

103
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,868
putting together
a hospital blood drive.

104
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,580
It is an emergency situation.

105
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,234
It's got to be fast,
impactful, efficient,

106
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,542
and when I think efficient,
I think of Sandra... ow.

107
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,804
- Okay, just for the day?
- I gotta go.

108
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,806
Please, just for the good
of humanity?

109
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,549
How about for your cat's
nutritional autonomy?

110
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:48,898
- Fine.
- Really?

111
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:50,595
- I'll do it for Lilith. Okay?
- Yes, fantastic.

112
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,640
- Thank you...
- Okay, no hugging!

113
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,294
No, no, no.
Six feet apart.

114
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:55,600
And, surprisingly, I've turned
into a compulsive handwasher,

115
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,484
so if you can't find me,
that's where I'll be.

116
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,212
Right, good.

117
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,218
Great.
My office?

118
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,315
My spy craft is
really on point today.

119
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,403
You sleep okay?

120
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,069
Yeah.

121
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,018
Oh, wow.

122
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,064
Wow, I haven't seen
one of these in ages.

123
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,458
What's on a Leyla playlist?

124
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,113
I have to go.

125
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,637
You sure you don't wanna
leave that here?

126
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,335
<i>Mi casa es su casa,</i>

127
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,741
or a closet in this case.

128
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,731
No one's gonna touch it

129
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:42,485
or your ancient iPod.

130
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:53,888
Oh, that's gonna make
a huge difference.

131
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:07,162
Okay.
Good talk.

132
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,504
Operation Blood Flow is a go.

133
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,858
I should start knocking.

134
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:21,294
No, no.

135
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:22,600
I'll leave you guys to it.

136
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,576
Thank you, Dr. Shin.

137
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,528
Yes.

138
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,965
So you have an idea
for this Operation Blood Flow?

139
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,359
Yeah... no, uh...

140
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,839
It j...

141
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:45,984
Just needs some retooling.

142
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,584
Okay, do you want
to talk it over?

143
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,281
Talk about...

144
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,413
no.

145
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,849
Yeah... no.

146
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,329
Minor tweaks, little stuff.

147
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,201
It's... you know.

148
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,420
Yeah, I got it.

149
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,173
I got this.

150
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,256
As our new
associate trauma surgeon,

151
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,476
your primary job will be
backing up Cassian.

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,956
Understood.

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,610
You do realize that
that means a lot less surgery

154
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:16,915
than you're used to, right?

155
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,743
Not a problem.
Just put me to work.

156
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:20,005
Yeah, the ED is not
like the OR.

157
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,311
I can't just...

158
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,617
Anesthesia's tubing a patient
in bay six,

159
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,140
and we're out of Midazolam.

160
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,894
Midazolam. Midazolam...

161
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,407
What are you... whoa!
Hey!

162
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,899
Careful.

163
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,195
- Aha!
- What the hell?

164
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,546
Pharmacy is always running
out of the drugs that we need,

165
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,765
so we keep a secret stash
in the ceiling.

166
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,550
- Is that legal?
- Don't ask.

167
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,335
Like I was saying, the ED is
not structured like the OR.

168
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,641
It's like jazz.

169
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:47,816
You gotta go with the flow.

170
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,513
Get in the rhythm.
Improvise.

171
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:50,688
Okay.

172
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:52,908
I like jazz.

173
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:55,606
Elisa Barkley,
16-year-old restrained driver

174
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,390
of a car T-boned
by a speeding taxi.

175
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:58,827
Tachy, multiple hip fractures,

176
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,306
deep laceration
on the upper thigh.

177
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,917
Lost a large volume of blood
at the scene

178
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,571
and became hypotensive
in the field.

179
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,268
Please, help my daughter.

180
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,053
Ma'am, we're gonna take care
of both of you.

181
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,969
Unstable pelvis.
Book an OR.

182
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,754
I'll need at least two units
of trauma blood.

183
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:14,190
Two units is all we've got.

184
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:15,670
Then I guess
I'm taking it all.

185
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,542
- OR 2.
- All right.

186
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,370
Yeah.

187
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,939
We need to divert all
knife fights, GSWs, and MVAs.

188
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:26,202
And pray no one here has
a massive bleed.

189
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,725
Why?

190
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,293
New Amsterdam is officially
out of blood.

191
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,344
We need blood fast.

192
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:39,998
We gotta target non-sick people
coming into the hospital,

193
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,130
most of whom are parents

194
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,610
who often have their kids
with them,

195
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,264
and what is the one thing
that parents need right now

196
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,397
more than anything?

197
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,529
Time away from their kids.

198
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,835
So the puppies will babysit
the kids,

199
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,577
and we will give the parents
a quiet moment to come in

200
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,101
and give us
their life-saving blood.

201
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,625
Why not just get
human babysitters?

202
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,714
Because the puppies were
already on rotation

203
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:00,715
in the pediatric ward.

204
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,846
- Max.
- Yes?

205
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,065
Please tell me
you're done retooling

206
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,066
whatever it was
that you were retooling.

207
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,023
- Yeah.
- Hi, Sandra.

208
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,198
Got a lot done, too.

209
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:09,593
You were busy doing...
other stuff.

210
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,595
By other stuff, I assume
you mean finding out

211
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,728
that the one major accident
we were away from catastrophe

212
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:14,816
just came in?

213
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,034
That is not what I meant,

214
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,688
but I told you I got this.

215
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:20,082
So we probably have people
in every seat

216
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,866
lined up around the block.

217
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,215
Take a look for yourself.

218
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,495
Hmm.

219
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,878
You do know that puppy blood
won't work, right?

220
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,276
Okay, my veterans.

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,712
Everyone here tested negative.

222
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:42,844
Congrats.

223
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,889
Let's all take a seat
and get started.

224
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:46,717
All right?

225
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,067
Um...

226
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,026
Chance, hi.

227
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,723
Really glad you made it.

228
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,377
Everybody, I'd like
to introduce a new recruit.

229
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,770
This is PFC Chance Becker.

230
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,075
He is a cavalry scout

231
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,903
from the 101st Airborne, yes?

232
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:00,513
Yeah.

233
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,777
Chance, in our one-on-one's,
expressed a little reluctance

234
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,082
at joining this group,

235
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,606
but I assured him
that there's no safer place

236
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,998
than here with his sisters
and brothers,

237
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,174
and he's coming up
on a really tough anniversary.

238
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,046
I thought maybe he could use
a little support.

239
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,613
So welcome.

240
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,353
Good for you.

241
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:16,020
Thanks, guys.

242
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,444
Here for you, man.

243
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:19,750
Yeah, we've all
lost something,

244
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:22,200
so go ahead.

245
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,727
We were, um...

246
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,724
Our convoy, it was...

247
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:39,901
heading towards an OP
in Kandahar Province.

248
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:44,135
And we took direct contact
from an AQ element.

249
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,343
Four of my squad members,

250
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,127
they were in the lead vehicle

251
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,881
when it got slammed by RPGs.

252
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,828
It was...

253
00:10:57,045 --> 00:11:00,356
Our driver kinda ran us
off the road, and...

254
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,663
I jumped out.

255
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,765
We were taking small arms fire,
but I just...

256
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,190
But...

257
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:11,323
I just ran
towards the wreckage.

258
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,325
All I could think was to...

259
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,719
dig out my brothers
and sisters.

260
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,999
Flames, fuel.

261
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,426
I could barely hold it
together.

262
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,790
I called battalion
for a medevac, but...

263
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,317
They were already gone.

264
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:39,787
Wow.

265
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,623
- Hey, now. Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God. Rhonda!

266
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,495
- What are you doing?
- This guy's a fobbit!

267
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,931
- He's a what?
- I was there!

268
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,194
Then how'd you call it in?
The medevac.

269
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,762
I used...
I called HQ.

270
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,938
No way
this guy's seen combat.

271
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:03,245
What... okay,
what are you talking about?

272
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,160
He didn't return
suppressor fire

273
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,552
when they got hit.

274
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,264
And no one calls HQ
for a nine line medevac.

275
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,950
Okay.

276
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:14,560
There are protocols.

277
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,041
We all follow them,
or people die.

278
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,782
He's a fake.

279
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:25,006
Nothing has changed.

280
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,530
I... I just woke up blind.

281
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,979
Okay, let's take a look.

282
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,319
What about work?

283
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,029
It's not my job.

284
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,976
Ms. Castillo.

285
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,325
It's really important

286
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,296
that I have
all the information.

287
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,767
If they close the factory,

288
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:50,422
me and my friends will be
out of work again.

289
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,990
We already lost our jobs
during the shutdowns.

290
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,036
We can't lose this, too.

291
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,299
We're still paying off
our rent deferral.

292
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,910
HIPAA privacy laws prevent us

293
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,433
from disclosing
anything you tell us

294
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:03,827
without your consent.

295
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,176
Please.

296
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,191
This may help me treat you.

297
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:10,878
I work in a plastics factory.

298
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:11,922
Off the books.

299
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,893
It's the only work
I could find.

300
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,102
I think
you may have been exposed

301
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,496
to diboron tetrabromide.

302
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,412
It can trigger vasospasm
in the retinal artery,

303
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,196
which is probably what's
causing your blindness.

304
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,937
Probably?

305
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,417
Well, it's a theory.

306
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:29,810
Can you fix it?

307
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,159
I think so.

308
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,205
I mean, yes, definitely.

309
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,871
Maybe.

310
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,041
Am I going to look
like Frankenstein now?

311
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,564
Oh, not at all.

312
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:46,870
These are what you call

313
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:49,133
subcuticular continuous
sutures, all right?

314
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,787
By the time I'm done,

315
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,268
you won't even have a scar.

316
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,139
Dr. Reynolds.

317
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:56,880
A word?

318
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,372
Excuse me.

319
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,669
How long have you been
stitching for?

320
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,149
I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track...

321
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:06,194
Exactly.

322
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,456
Okay, this is not the place

323
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,197
where you can take your time
making sure

324
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,676
every suture is
textbook perfect.

325
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,027
We are a conveyor belt
that never stops moving.

326
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:15,507
So you want me to do
a less good job on my patients?

327
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,987
No, no, not less good.

328
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:18,380
Faster.
Jazz.

329
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,555
Look, you wanna talk jazz?

330
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,730
Miles Davis?

331
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,949
Following my own meter,

332
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,515
especially when it comes
to my patients.

333
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,996
Okay, Miles.
Well, look.

334
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,519
Here is what backed up

335
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:28,912
while you were inching your way

336
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:31,393
through that superficial
four-centimeter scalp lac.

337
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:33,090
Go ahead,
follow your own meter.

338
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,266
You should be done
by next Wednesday.

339
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:40,445
Thank you.

340
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,969
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?

341
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:42,926
Scheduled maintenance.

342
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,275
There was a backpack in here.

343
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,451
A puke-orange backpack.

344
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:47,539
Where is it?

345
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:48,714
Don't know.

346
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,151
Well, it was here
this morning.

347
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,555
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:58,302
No, no, no, no, no...

349
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,512
Thank you for letting me
do this.

350
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:04,992
Not at all.

351
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:08,430
Family members often donate
for a loved one's surgery.

352
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,345
Actually, you're doing us
a favor.

353
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,390
Blood's in short supply
right now.

354
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,610
Take as much as you need.

355
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,220
Take it all.

356
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,234
I'd do anything for my baby.

357
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:21,095
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,575
Elisa always says
I'm being melodramatic.

359
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,230
And teenagers never are.

360
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:28,145
I just need her to be okay.

361
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,032
What's wrong?

362
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,545
Was, um...

363
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,590
was Elisa adopted?

364
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:42,159
I was in labor with her
for 31 hours.

365
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,205
Did you use an egg donor?

366
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:47,251
No, her father and I did it
the old-fashioned way.

367
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,644
What's going on?

368
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,696
Were you able to stretch
the two units of blood?

369
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,350
Just about.

370
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,962
Why? Was her mom not a match?

371
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,093
No.

372
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,052
But it's more than that.

373
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,314
What do you mean?

374
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,968
With their blood types,

375
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,461
there's no way
she's Elisa's biological mum.

376
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,979
This is what we should've
been doing the whole time.

377
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,328
I mean, puppies are
a great incentive for kids,

378
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,982
but this is not
the right incentive for adults.

379
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,070
- What they need is...
- Money?

380
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:25,072
No, this is about
more than money.

381
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,378
It's about tapping in to what
people have really been missing

382
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,640
during this pandemic, you know?

383
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,338
Something that feeds
every New Yorker's soul.

384
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,687
Complaining
about subway delays?

385
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,297
Ye... no. Restaurants.

386
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,778
Eating out.
Experiencing something new.

387
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,607
Something you can only get
right here in New York.

388
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,784
So we are giving everyone
who donates blood a free meal.

389
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,394
And not just any meal.

390
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,266
A multi-course tasting menu

391
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,224
by a Michelin star chef.

392
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,704
First, we're gonna
bleed them.

393
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,445
- Then we're gonna feed them.
- That's actually good.

394
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,316
- So I called Elena Roca.
- Oh, love her.

395
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,492
Yeah, and she agreed
to donate her staff

396
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:55,667
and her food.

397
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,072
Who could resist?

398
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:00,107
Wow.

399
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:02,718
They seem to be resisting
just fine.

400
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,512
All I did was tell my story.

401
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:16,384
Okay, that's great.
Let's talk about that.

402
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,788
Sit down.

403
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:20,475
I have a feeling

404
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,086
that you have been telling
that story for quite some time,

405
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,522
and I think that you would
really like that

406
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:25,393
to be your story.

407
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,929
- I'm not lying.
- Chance.

408
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,311
I have a buddy at the VA
who told me

409
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,412
that you are not in the system.

410
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:34,924
You're not in
the Choice Program.

411
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,547
Nothing.

412
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,148
You are trying to fill a void
in you.

413
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:43,324
You are not alone in that.

414
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,556
But the way you're trying
to fill it...

415
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:50,592
It's called stolen valor.

416
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,432
It's not real.

417
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,556
You were never in Afghanistan,
were you?

418
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,515
There was no ambush.
There were no burned bodies.

419
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,040
Do you know the smell
of burning flesh?

420
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,651
It's sickening.

421
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:07,739
Never leaves you.

422
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:10,133
You smell it everywhere.

423
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:13,876
A match, a candle,
a grill in the park.

424
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,225
All of it brings it back.

425
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:18,502
I can't go anywhere
without them following me.

426
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:22,798
Don't tell me
the flames weren't real.

427
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,681
Push 2 milligrams
Ativan IV.

428
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,857
Pushing 2 milligrams
Ativan IV.

429
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:42,874
Diboron tetrabromide exposure
doesn't cause seizures.

430
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:47,139
I don't know what's wrong
with her.

431
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,104
There's a small anomaly here.

432
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,921
I don't see anything.

433
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,632
Right here.

434
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,234
Guess that could explain
Rose's symptoms.

435
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,670
It's really small.

436
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,628
Well, look, you asked
for my opinion?

437
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:13,762
This is why the Verapamil
didn't work.

438
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:16,112
So I should start her
on Phenytoin?

439
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,692
If you want her
to get better.

440
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,249
I don't know.

441
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,641
Dr. Kao?

442
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,034
Yes?

443
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,179
It's what
Dr. Kapoor would do.

444
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:34,130
Anita, the test results
were incompatible

445
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,958
with parental relation.

446
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,668
What does that even mean?

447
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,977
Are you...

448
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,853
Are... are you saying Elisa is
not my daughter?

449
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,756
I'm hoping it's a mistake
our end.

450
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,802
- A simple DNA test will clear...
- Clear what?

451
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:56,500
Do you think I hallucinated
giving birth to her?

452
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,459
Do you think I stole her?

453
00:19:58,543 --> 00:19:59,547
No one is saying that.

454
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,244
Then what are you saying?

455
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:04,042
How could my child not be
my child?

456
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:07,088
If she was switched at birth.

457
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:12,299
I honestly wish I didn't have
to bring this up,

458
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,909
but I am duty-bound
not just to you,

459
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,824
but if there is another family
out there...

460
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:16,955
Elisa's my child.

461
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,043
Emotionally, of course.

462
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,176
If the biological...

463
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,265
truth or whatever's different,

464
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,615
I don't want to know.

465
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,194
I do.

466
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,185
Elisa?

467
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,843
I want the test.

468
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:43,068
Whatcha looking for?

469
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,505
An orange backpack.

470
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:47,029
Very heavy,
incredibly important.

471
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,813
- Oh, no.
- What was in it?

472
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,380
I have no idea.

473
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:52,077
Kevin McGlynn, 65.

474
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,340
Complaining of nausea

475
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:55,211
and sudden abdominal
and lower back pain.

476
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,865
- Tachy?
- 140 BPM.

477
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,823
Thinking a leaking abdominal
aortic aneurism.

478
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,216
Well, then why'd you
bring him here?

479
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,783
We went on diversion
four hours ago.

480
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,132
You're not the only ones
diverting.

481
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,351
Blood shortage is citywide.

482
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:05,700
Yeah, that's
a pulsatile mass.

483
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:08,050
- Grab Reynolds.
- Oh, he took lunch.

484
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,530
He took lunch?

485
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:11,271
- You probably want me to go...
- Find him now.

486
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,142
With me, Trauma One.

487
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:19,714
Prepare to intubate.

488
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:21,542
Insert a Foley
and two large bore IVs.

489
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:22,499
On it.

490
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,674
Please tell me
you found blood.

491
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:24,806
No.

492
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,850
We've got to be ready
for open repair.

493
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:26,938
His AAA could blow
at any minute.

494
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:28,157
We're gonna do this
without blood?

495
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:31,378
You got a better idea?

496
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:32,770
- Nice lunch?
- Yeah.

497
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:35,033
- I usually take lunch at 1:00.
- Yeah, not anymore.

498
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:38,092
Here, we eat on the go
when you can if you can.

499
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,650
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

500
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,086
I don't know what to believe.

501
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,740
I know that I've lost the trust
of my vet's group.

502
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:49,396
I know that,
but now I feel like, um...

503
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,093
I feel like
I've missed something.

504
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,268
You know?

505
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,530
I do know
that Chance is suffering.

506
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:54,923
You think he's telling
the truth?

507
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,404
I think that he's telling
a truth, yeah.

508
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,101
- Did you Google him?
- Gladys.

509
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,407
I refuse to believe

510
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,886
that that is what
our profession has come to.

511
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,714
Okay?
And yeah, I did, obviously.

512
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,207
I couldn't find anything.

513
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,720
Chance?

514
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,287
No, no, no, no.
No, don't say that.

515
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,680
Listen to me.

516
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,725
No, listen, listen.
Just tell me where you are.

517
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,827
Chance, tell me where you are.

518
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,905
- Chance.
- You did this!

519
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:24,008
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, no, stop, stop!

520
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:27,434
- Chance, stop, stop, stop!
- Don't! Don't!

521
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:28,435
Oh, my God, stop!

522
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,001
- Don't!
- Chance.

523
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,842
Okay.

524
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,444
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Don't! Stay back!

525
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:40,925
You made me go
to that stupid group.

526
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,100
- I did.
- I know, I know.

527
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,406
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

528
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,799
Chance, I shouldn't have
done that, but I'm here.

529
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:45,843
Please, talk to me.

530
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,454
- Why?
- You don't believe me!

531
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:49,151
- Yes, I do!
- I believe... I believe...

532
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,282
I believe your burns are real.

533
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:52,589
I believe your pain
is very real.

534
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,330
Chance, look at me!

535
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,201
I believe you.

536
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,346
There was a fire, wasn't there?

537
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,858
There was a fire.

538
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:01,946
People lie.
People do that.

539
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,208
People lie to impress.

540
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,559
People lie to hide their shame.

541
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:07,038
I lie to hide my pain.

542
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:08,835
I do it every day.

543
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,087
Where was the fire?
Tell me where the fire was.

544
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,828
Tell me something.

545
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:16,439
Tell me one... one true thing.

546
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,836
It was upstate.

547
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,490
Okay, upstate.

548
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:25,970
There, we started.

549
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,202
That's where
your family's from, right?

550
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:31,585
That's why you contacted me,
isn't it?

551
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:33,151
Part of you wanted
to unburden yourself.

552
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:34,805
You want to tell me the truth.

553
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:36,241
I'm here.
Tell me.

554
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:37,733
I'm here.

555
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,638
I was...

556
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:43,957
I was drunk.

557
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:49,907
The farm, my family's farm.

558
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:51,822
What happened?

559
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:54,303
It was a... a cigarette.

560
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:56,479
It...

561
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:58,002
It lit up the barn

562
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,569
and then the house,

563
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:03,486
and then by the time
I heard them screaming...

564
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,805
I tried to stop it.

565
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,536
My brother,

566
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,667
my big sister,

567
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:12,681
my parents, gone.

568
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,543
An accident, an accident,
an accident!

569
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:17,892
An accident, Chance.

570
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:19,850
- Does it matter?
- Yes, it matters.

571
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:22,200
All of it matters
because it's real.

572
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,824
It is your truth.
Do you understand?

573
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:29,437
All the rest of it,
you need to let go.

574
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:32,080
You need to just let it go.

575
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,574
Rose, it's Dr. Kao.

576
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:50,707
I've got some new medication
for you.

577
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,536
This one will work.

578
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:56,365
Sorry, did I scare you?

579
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,410
No.

580
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:01,588
Then why did you pull away?

581
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:03,819
I don't know.

582
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:08,246
Did something happen?

583
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,553
Did someone hurt you?

584
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,399
When?

585
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:21,912
A month ago.

586
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:37,145
I was walking home one night.

587
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,103
These two white guys,

588
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,802
they jumped me.

589
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,630
Beat me to the ground.

590
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:47,689
Blamed me for bringing
the virus to America.

591
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,898
I'm Filipina,
but all they see is...

592
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,651
I know.

593
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,381
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:59,123
It was so long ago, and...

595
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,777
I protected my head.

596
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,488
What would that have to do
with blindness?

597
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,916
Did they hit
your abdominal area?

598
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,048
Yes.

599
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:12,976
Over and over.

600
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:15,792
Rose.

601
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:19,361
I think your liver was damaged
in the attack.

602
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,493
But because it happened
weeks ago,

603
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:24,627
your blood tests looked normal.

604
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,427
But most of your liver is
now not functioning.

605
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:35,899
It's okay.

606
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:38,206
We can treat it.

607
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,742
Without a doubt.

608
00:26:44,557 --> 00:26:46,823
We're not doing the test.

609
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:48,999
Why do you get to make
that decision for me?

610
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,089
Because I'm your mother.

611
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:53,700
Maybe.

612
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,049
What?

613
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,485
Maybe!

614
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,530
Okay, let's all just
take a breath.

615
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:00,489
You are not who I want
to hear from right now.

616
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:01,708
Why can't you understand?

617
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,710
I wanna know where I belong.

618
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:05,898
You belong with me.

619
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:11,164
Look at our hands.

620
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,125
Our skin.

621
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,780
You don't get it.

622
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,772
I've always felt different.

623
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:26,210
I've always looked different.

624
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,790
From the entire family.

625
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,173
I've always felt
like an outsider.

626
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,870
Baby, that's the world
saying that,

627
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,059
not me, not your family.

628
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,833
I've never treated you
different.

629
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:42,531
How could you even think
something so hurt...

630
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:44,794
Here comes the melodrama.

631
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:46,927
There is no way you're my...

632
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,028
We don't need a DNA test.

633
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,149
But I do need a biopsy.

634
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:53,237
Why?

635
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,861
Because you could both
be right.

636
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,417
Where's all this blood
coming from?

637
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:01,593
His AAA just ruptured.

638
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:03,726
Okay, I'm gonna stabilize
the arterial stump

639
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,555
while you cross-clamp
the aorta.

640
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:10,124
Okay, I have the arterial edge
with my forceps.

641
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,429
I... I can't see anything.

642
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:12,909
Just follow my forceps down.

643
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,085
Cross-clamp just above the tip.

644
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:16,304
There are no landmarks.

645
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:17,914
Go by feel.

646
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:27,097
Okay, I think I got it.

647
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:28,577
Suction.

648
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:30,579
ACC time is 100 minutes.

649
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:33,028
Bleeding has stopped.
You got it.

650
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:37,629
But now his liver, kidneys,
and intestines are toast.

651
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:39,022
Not yet.

652
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:40,545
We got three minutes to find
a replacement aorta.

653
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:42,069
You can prepare
a Dacron graft

654
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,157
in three minutes?

655
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:44,941
92.

656
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:46,464
Ah.

657
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,696
Give me some of that
suction tubing?

658
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,818
Scissors.

659
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:54,559
Sponge count?

660
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,574
Suture.

661
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:59,173
The hell you doing?

662
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:01,828
Say hello to Mr. McGlynn's...

663
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,481
replacement aorta.

664
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,570
Pared-back space looks clean.

665
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:08,573
Until we get him up to the OR
for a proper graft.

666
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:10,718
Are you sure about this?

667
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:14,026
Jazz, right?

668
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,062
The ED called.

669
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,282
I know, diversion is
diverting back to us.

670
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:22,849
We have got to make this work.

671
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,503
Max, no one wants fine dining
in the vicinity of nurses

672
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:27,636
with urine samples,
sick or dying people,

673
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,942
and sirens blaring
in the background.

674
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,421
I know, but I think
I've got something

675
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,162
that's gonna drown out
those sirens,

676
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,598
that's gonna lift
people's spirits,

677
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:35,339
and for the love of God,
it's gonna inspire them

678
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,427
to donate blood.

679
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,299
- Alcohol?
- Nope.

680
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:40,095
Broadway.

681
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:42,477
Jazz hands.

682
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:45,045
Too much. Desperation. Sorry.

683
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,656
The performers are
former patients,

684
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,962
and with all
the theaters closed,

685
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,485
they jumped at the opportunity
to perform

686
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,356
for a real-life audience.

687
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,010
<i>♪ Down by the riverside</i>

688
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,055

693
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:02,497
Really?

694

<i>♪ Down by the riverside</i>

695
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,543
Yeah, no, no, we're good
on the singing.

696
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:06,936
Stop with the singing, please.

697
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,602
Thank you.

698
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,377
Excuse me, can I ask you
a question?

699
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:14,683
- Me?
- Yeah.

700
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,685
All these people here are
donating their time,

701
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,513
their talents, their food,
their dogs

702
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,516
to get people like you
to donate their blood,

703
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,909
which is desperately needed.

704
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:24,693
I see you stopped in,
but not quite biting.

705
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:28,305
So I was just wondering,
what's it gonna take?

706
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,612
Do you have any idea

707
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,018
what people are going through
right now?

708
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:36,487
I'm homeschooling three kids

709
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,707
while taking care
of my ailing father.

710
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,969
I...

711
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:42,145
I've donated to every cause
under the sun.

712
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,843
I've marched
for social justice.

713
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,149
I've made meals
for the unhoused.

714
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,034
We're done.
Everyone is tapped.

715
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:50,762
I know, but... but...

716
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:52,939
People have given everything

717
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:56,290
this past year,
except their blood.

718
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,913
And I, for one, would like
to keep that.

719
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,254
- So that's it?
- People are just done giving?

720
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,957
All right, shut it down.
All of it.

721
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,959
You guys can go.
Get the food out of here.

722
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,668
It's over.

723
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:25,885
So...?

724
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:29,932
Anita, your biopsy revealed
something unusual.

725
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:33,414
The technical term for it is,
you're a chimera.

726
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:36,939
You have two different DNAs
in your body.

727
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,636
How is that possible?

728
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,899
It's a rare condition

729
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,813
that can happen in utero
in twin pregnancies.

730
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:43,641
But I'm not a twin.

731
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:46,079
You were.

732
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,558
When you were just an embryo,

733
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,909
you had a fraternal twin
who didn't come to term.

734
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,040
A sister.

735
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:52,868
In the womb, you absorbed her,

736
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,783
including her ovaries,

737
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,046
and that's the second DNA.

738
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,656
Which is why
the blood test said

739
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,962
you weren't Elisa's mother.

740
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:02,225
Elisa was born from your body

741
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,197
but from your sister's egg.

742
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,102
So I'm...

743
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:12,322
I'm not her daughter?

744
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:15,108
Elisa, you may
look different,

745
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,631
but what this proves

746
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:19,634
is you're actually more
than your mother's daughter.

747
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,518
Not less.

748
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,423
I'm sorry you felt different.

749
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,395
I should've made you
feel special.

750
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:32,647
I guess we both kind of are.

751
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,093
Well, I've seen a lot
of AAA open repairs in my time,

752
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:48,880
but none that used
suction tubing as an aorta.

753
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:51,971
I accept
your well-concealed apology.

754
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,363
Okay.

755
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:54,974
You've got your way
of doing things,

756
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,366
I've got mine.

757
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,673
Didn't work out
for us personally.

758
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:02,733
But professionally,
maybe we've got a future.

759
00:33:06,504 --> 00:33:10,741
Jazz.

760
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,470
You looking for this?

761
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:14,906
Oh, my God, yes!

762
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,343
Where did you find it?

763
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,648
I saw the painters
setting up,

764
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:19,041
and I knew you'd freak.

765
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,913
So I grabbed it and stashed it
in the break room.

766
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:24,090
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

767
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:25,700
Yeah, so...

768
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,354
just so I got this straight,

769
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,487
you're letting
a random homeless woman

770
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:32,185
live in a hospital closet

771
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:34,056
completely unsupervised.

772
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,666
Well, when you say it
like that,

773
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,886
it does kind of sound crazy.

774
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,627
Yeah, that's because it is.

775
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,498
I mean, what do you even know
about this woman?

776
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,196
Or what's in this bag?

777
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,849
I try to mind
my own business.

778
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,547
Since when?

779
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:49,985
Look, you are risking a lot
for a random stranger.

780
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,421
If it were me,

781
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:54,381
I'd wanna know
who I'm protecting.

782
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,916
They, uh...

783
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,266
they painted the closet today.

784
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,399
You went through my stuff,
didn't you?

785
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,878
Should I have?

786
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:15,806
Are you hiding something?

787
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:24,815
Wait, d...

788
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,983
It's nothing.

789
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:35,117
Why be so protective over it?

790
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:38,393
It's nothing to you,
but it's all I have.

791
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,212
I'm sorry.

792
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:46,128
It'd just be nice to...

793
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:49,000
know a little about you,
that's all.

794
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:06,627
I love Punjabi rap.

795
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,150
And...

796
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:11,110
Hawaiian pizza.

797
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,807
The kind with the pineapple.

798
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,245
But it's so tacky that I would
never tell anyone that.

799
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:19,422
It's totally tacky.

00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:36,586
I don't know any doctor
in this hospital

825
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,022
who could've made
that diagnosis.

826
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,645
I know I couldn't

827
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:43,475
How did you even think to ask
about her attack?

828
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,727
Something Dr. Kapoor
taught me.

829
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:48,859
To watch and listen.

830
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:53,093
When I touched Rose
to put in her IV, she flinched.

831
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:57,216
I used to do that, too.

832
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,784
Flinch at little movements
and sounds.

833
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,103
Sometimes, I still do.

834
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:09,315
When COVID was at its worst,

835
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:13,580
a man stopped me in the street.

836
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,799
He grabbed my arm

837
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:18,989
and spat in my face.

838
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,937
Then shoved me aside
like I was nothing.

839
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,554
Did you talk to anyone?

840
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:33,382
No.

841
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,558
It was happening
to so many of us,

842
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:38,953
and back then,
I just wanted to do my job

843
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,228
and help people.

844
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:46,134
Dr. Kao,
I shouldn't have made you

845
00:37:46,218 --> 00:37:47,527
interim, interim chair
of neurology.

846
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:50,312
That was foolish of me.

847
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:51,487
I should've made you
interim chair

848
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,837
and not taken no for an answer.

849
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,448
And I know that Dr. Kapoor
would agree

850
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:57,188

851
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:58,451

870
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,604

00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,676
No, you don't have to...

899
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,938
You're not supposed to tell me.

900
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:19,330
I just kinda thought
you might want to.

901
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,158
I see.

902
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:25,206
So you tell me everything.

903
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,742
There's no secrets between us.

904
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,735
- Well...
- Yeah, I knew it.

905
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:33,867
You don't know what I was
gonna say.

906
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:35,259
Oh, I know what you were
gonna say.

907
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,187
I highly doubt that.

908
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,974
You were seeing someone
last year.

909
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,617
Yeah.

910
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,979
That's exactly what
I was gonna say.

911
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,853
How'd you know that?

912
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,421
Why didn't you tell me?

913
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:58,979
I didn't tell anyone.

914
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:00,763
Why?

915
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:04,332
Because...

916
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,781
Be... I don't know.

917
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,559
It was...

918
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:16,649
It was fragile,
and I just thought...

919
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,969
that I should protect...

920
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:24,657
Protect what?

921
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:28,051
<i>♪ Beautiful dreamer</i>

922
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:29,226
<i>♪ Beam on my heart</i>

923
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,402
Excuse me.

924
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:33,013
M'lady.

925
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,884
May I have this dance?

926
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:37,539
I would be delighted,
kind sir.

927
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,541
Excuse me.

928
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,065
<i>♪ Then will all clouds</i>

929
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:46,548
<i>♪ Of sorrow depart</i>

930
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,681

932
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:59,256
