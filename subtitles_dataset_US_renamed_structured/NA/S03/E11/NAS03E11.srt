00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:07,632
Isn't that
why I'm here?

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,453
Because you feel guilty
for ignoring your brother

4
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:10,492
for all those years.

5
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:11,913
You're here
because you're my family.

6
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:14,297
That you ignored
for your whole life!

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,570
I was the one
who was ignored first!

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,328
<i>My mother's raised
three kids,</i>

9
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:20,565
<i>owns her own home,</i>

10
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,750
<i>prays harder than anyone I know
for everyone else,</i>

11
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,005
and now she needs
full-time care.

12
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:26,633
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

13
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,594
No, come on.
Don't do this.

14
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,038
Why not?

15
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,679
I'm transferring you
to another therapist.

16
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:33,796
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,836
I had
a tremendous breakthrough

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,366
with the new patient.

19
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:40,189

with great dignity.

out there?

00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:19,797
I think somebody needs
a little turbine cooldown.

- Max!
- No, she's fine.

37
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:24,258
She likes it.
God, it gets hotter every year.

38
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,438
I can't believe
it's not even June.

train wreck right now,

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,856
and nobody is doing anything...

42
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,320
Could you speak up?
I can't hear you

43
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:36,320
over the turbines

44
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:38,165
belching freon into the air.

45
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,899
Well, I make up for it,
all right?

46
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,047
I turn on the low flow nozzle
in the shower.

47
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,344
I compost.
I-I...

48
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,750
I turn off the faucet
whenever I'm brushing my teeth.

49
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:46,788
Okay?
Every time.

50
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:50,938
I have like 60 of those
reusable cloth shopping bags.

51
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:52,805
Yeah, so you won't mind
if I turn this off?

52
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,703
No, no, no,
just a second longer

53
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,874
'cause it's, you know,
making her comfortable.

54
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,250
Yeah, which makes you
comfortable.

Mina, the hospital
is the other way.

Look, I know you're not
thrilled

102
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,335
about the prospect of therapy,
but it helps to have someone

103
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,976
to talk to who can see things
that you might be missing.

104
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,311
- I'm not going to therapy.
- Mina, will you listen to me?

105
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,748
I mean, one of those
American therapists

106
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,162
with those questions:

107
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,197
How do you feel about this?
How does this make you feel?

108
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,913
I'm not going back
to that hospital.

109
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,577
You need someone
to talk to.

110
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,370

115
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:37,906
Mina, I'm not against
you coming here.

116
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,386
It's just that I booked you
an appointment.

117
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,319
So you take it

118
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,912

Was that why you wanted
to see me?

123
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,731
Man, I'm sorry.
I could have just come by.

124
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:08,940
Yeah, I know.

125
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,171
I should have told you
about Martin.

126
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,865
This needs to stop right now.

127
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,159
It was stupid.

128
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:20,287
I... I didn't mean
to freak anybody out, I swear.

129
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:22,007
It's only 'cause you wouldn't
see me.

130
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,835
You're not my patient
anymore.

131
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,857
You're not
my husband's patient.

132
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,780
Chance, you lied your way
into my home.

133
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,764
But you could help me

134
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,092
when no one else could.

135
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,904
I was getting better.

136
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:40,069
You know it's true.

137
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,624
I need you.

138
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,451
Just take the hat, please.

139
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:46,978
Don't do this to me.

140
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,326
I'm not doing anything
to you, Chance.

141
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:53,110
These are the consequences
for your actions,

142
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,967
your choices.

143
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,815
And if you continue
down this path,

144
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,856
I will get the police
involved.

145
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,187
What?

146
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:03,326
For your safety
and for mine,

147
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,568
you can no longer see me
or my husband.

148
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:07,959
Is that clear?

149
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:12,173
This behavior is dangerous.
It is obsessive.

150
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,253
And I don't want to do this,
but if you don't stop,

151
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:17,292
I will be forced to file a
restraining order against you.

152
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,437
Now show me
that you understand.

153
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:40,647
There's the boss!

154
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,425
Thought you decided you were
never gonna come back.

155
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,905
How was the week off?

156
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,771
It was fantastic, could not
have been more relaxing.

157
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,858
I'm glad you're rested

158
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:51,124
because your ED is a total,
complete train wreck right now.

159
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,393
Come on, we're always
in shambles during a heat wave.

160
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,147
I'm sure it's nothing
we can't handle.

161
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,657
You say that now.

162
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,905
Before you let it rip,
I'm aware that we're not

163
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:01,482
supposed to use the hallways
as overflow.

164
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:05,840
Casey, I appreciate you,

165
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,780
and I don't tell you that
enough.

166
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,256

167
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,149

- I'm working as fast as I can.

173

complaining
of mild dehydration.

174
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,311
He doesn't look dehydrated.

175
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,288
That's because
he's not the patient.

176
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,515
Hey, Javier.

177
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,560
Why don't you tell the doctor
what you can do?

178
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:33,670
I can control the weather
with my mind.

179
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,389
Okey dokey.
I am gonna be right back.

180
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,124
Let's ask him
to make it cooler,

181
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,046
and then get Iggy down here.

182
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,288
Dr. Bloom, I know you said
only bother you

183
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:46,507
when absolutely necessary...

184
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,890
Especially on a day
like today, but I...

185
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:50,952
- Hit me, my friend.
- Oh, okay.

186
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,321
We got an interesting case.

187
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,944
Sister Edith Pursey,
a cloistered nun

188
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,694
from the Monastery
of the Precious Blood.

189
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,132
Let me guess,
she's hot.

190
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,702
No, she's cold...
Freezing, actually.

191
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,093
We just can't seem
to get her warm.

192
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:02,157
Could be anemia.
She has a low hematocrit.

193
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,296
Okay, let's double up
the warming blankets,

194
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,960
page Sharpe, and Dr. Walsh...

195
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:07,991
- And here it comes.
- What?

196
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,513
No, no, I was just gonna
suggest that you move her

197
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:12,959
from the nurse's station
to a procedure room.

198
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:16,499
Geez, why does everyone think
I'm gonna bite their head off?

199
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,185
Who says you can't run an ED
and be nice to people?

200
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,654
You did.
You said that last week.

201
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:22,874
Dr. Bloom, we are officially
out of space,

202
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,919
at capacity,
and it's not even lunch.

203
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,327
No problem, okay?
I am gonna fix it.

204
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,445
It's easy-peasy, okay?

205
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,482
Great work, everybody!
Great work.

206
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:37,467
Maybe I need a vacation.

207
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:41,675
The man knows Mama has
diabetes, Courtney.

208
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,804
Every time I turn around,
boyfriend is showing up

209
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,554
with poundcake
or scrapple and eggs.

210
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,810
What can I say?
They're in love.

211
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,295
Look, no one is taking this
seriously.

212
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,075
I'm up three times a night
every week checking her levels

213
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,413
'cause this guy's got
her blood sugar all jacked up.

214
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,460
- I'm telling you...
<i>- Help, somebody help!</i>

215
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,101
<i>- He's trapped in the car!</i>
- I gotta go.

216
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,822
<i>- Must be boiling in there.</i>
- What's going on?

217
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,102
- There's a kid in the car.
- Let me see.

218
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,079
- How long?
- Don't know.

219
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:05,704
I already called 911.

220
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,088
Anybody got a knife,
a pocket knife?

221
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:11,052
Or a pen?
Like, a heavy-duty pen?

222
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,571
I have a pen.

223
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,537
All right, stand back.

224
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,415
Okay.

225
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,957
Hey, man,
there's a hospital...

226
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,389
I know, I know.

227
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:36,108
- Sorry, but we're at capacity.
- We're not staying.

228
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,311
- What happened?
- Kid was locked in a damn car.

229
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,647
He's got a core temp of 107.
Out of the way!

230
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,344
I'm gonna get him up to the OR

231
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:46,779
for sedation, intubation,
and cold water gastric lavage.

232
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:48,811
Your hand's bleeding.

233
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:51,215
Just a scratch.

234
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,091
Oh, Max!

235
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,412
- About this heat wave...
- Yeah, tell me about it.

236
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,936
Did you know that sea level
rise will nearly triple deaths

237
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,972
from contaminated
drinking water

238
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:03,191
by the end of the century?

239
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,354
Oh, and my ED is already
at capacity.

240
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,716
This is not sustainable.

241
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,824
Couldn't agree more,
and we are part of the problem.

242
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,713
Don't get me started

243
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,435
on New Amsterdam's
carbon footprint.

244
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,580
I wasn't planning on it.

245
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:15,961
So to my point, I need
more staff, overflow beds,

246
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,963
and a second
ambulance triage unit.

247
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,662
- I will do you one better.
- Overtime pay?

248
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,010
I'm gonna fix
global warming...

249
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,994
at New Amsterdam.

250
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,359
Melting polar ice caps,
deforestation,

251
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,225
temperatures are expected
to rise at least ten degrees

252
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,444
in the next century,

253
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,639
and the people in charge
of solving this

254
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:43,877
can't even agree
that it's real.

255
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:46,079
So now it's up to us.

256
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,838
The radiology department?

257
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:53,744
Because global warming
is a healthcare emergency.

258
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,204
Who do you think's gonna
bear the brunt

259
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:59,142
of unchecked wildfires,
mass migration,

260
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,928
toxic algae blooms?

261
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:03,574
- The radiology department?
- Hospitals.

262
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:06,708
So here, today, together,
the people in this room

263
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,182
are gonna take up the fight
against global warming.

264
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:13,925
Now, I would like to debut
my new flagship program...

265
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:17,533
"The Gloves Are Off."

266
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,963
- Wait, literally?
- Yeah, literally.

267
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,627
Single-use latex gloves account
for 20% of our medical waste.

268
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:25,026
Do you know where that waste
ends up, Mike?

269
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,684
We need to wear gloves,
Dr. Goodwin.

270
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,512
Wrong answer.
On a barge, Mike.

271
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,731
It ends up on a barge.

272
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,120
I also would have accepted
"in our oceans."

273
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:35,606
So we are all gonna try
something new.

274
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,059
We are only gonna get one box
of gloves per day.

275
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,003
- Per person?
- Wrong again.

276
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,700
For the entire department.

277
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,615
What about
infectious patients?

278
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,573
Well, that's why
I chose radiology.

279
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,184
Your patients
are already diagnosed.

280
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:50,229
Nobody needs gloves to simply
walk a patient into an MRI.

281
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:52,144
But gloves are
how we protect ourselves

282
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,146
- from, you know, germs.
- Uh-huh.

283
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,453
But handwashing is undeniably
more effective,

284
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,503
which is why every
scrubs station and bathroom

285
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,284
on this floor has been stocked
with extra biodegradable soap.

286
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:04,674
Now, who's ready to save
this planet?

287
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,549
Say it with me, guys.
The gloves are...

288
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,213
The gloves are...

289
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,103
Off.

290
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,448
Thank you, Jerry.

291
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,559
I'm not crazy.

292
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,957
No one said you were.

293
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,262
I didn't say you were crazy.

294
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:25,308
I just... you know,
it's rare to see someone

295
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,223
who can control the weather
with their mind.

296
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:29,442
I knew it.
You don't believe me.

297
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:30,661
- No, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no.

298
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,097
You know, it's my brother
who is sick.

299
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:34,604
I just agreed to take him
to the emergency room.

300
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:37,494
- I don't need any of this.
- That's cool.

301
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,931
We're just...
We're just talking here, okay?

302
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,107
Just me and you.
Your brother, he's downstairs.

303
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:45,146
He's getting his fluids
replenished, and...

304
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,201
Can I come clean with you?

305
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,681
Can we sit?

306
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,552
Confession time here.

307
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,119
The only reason
I brought you up here

308
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,818
is because I'm kind of
a weather nerd myself.

309
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,820
- You are?
- Just a touch.

310
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,778
I named my first pet El Niño.

311
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,825
So yeah, you be the judge.

312
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,827
I just... I have to ask you
a couple questions

313
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,917
about your, you know,
your powers.

314
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:12,137
This brutal heat wave outside,
is that...

315
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,009
is that you?

316
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,314
Yeah.

317
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:17,316
Whoa.

318
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,378
How do you... how do you do it?

319
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,148
I get this throbbing feeling.

320
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,933
Starts in my head.

321
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,370
Then it moves down
through my whole body.

322
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,241
Then everything goes black,

323
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,288
and that's when it got hot.

324
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:35,160
That's it?

325
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:37,467
Are we done here?

326
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,773
Wait, um, look.

327
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:42,428
This is really exciting for me,
like, beyond,

328
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:45,823
and I know it's a big ask,
but, um,

329
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:49,087
Javier, can I get a scan
of that brain of yours?

330
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,872
- A scan?
- Yeah, I just...

331
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,700
I need to see what makes you
so special.

332
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,964
I know that's a big ask,
like I said,

333
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,245
and if you wanna say no, I will
respect that and back away,

334
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,550
but... I have to ask.

335
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,526
Sure.

336
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,845
- I guess.
- Yeah?

337
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,003
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

338
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,925
That's awesome.

339
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,460
I am so sorry

340
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,767
to cancel Mina's session
last minute, Serena.

341
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,769
No, no, everything's fine,

342
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,423
except for the fact
that she doesn't listen,

343
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:21,315
she's completely
out of control,

344
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,940
and I don't know what more
I have to give her.

345
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,987
Sorry?

346
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:28,948
Me?

347
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,950
No, I don't need therapy.

348
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:33,988
I have to go, Serena.

349
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:45,796
Sister Pursey.
Hi, I'm Dr. Sharpe.

350
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,493
I hear you're the only person
in the city

351
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:49,565
not melting
from this heat wave.

352
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,780
It's not as promising
as it sounds.

353
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,892
Don't tell me I got this virus.

354
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:57,268
- Oh, no, no, it's not COVID.
- Okay.

355
00:14:57,761 --> 00:15:01,072
Although your temperature
is still only 94.5.

356
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,464
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No, please.

357
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,129
A little different from your
usual day-to-day, I imagine.

358
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:13,606
It's my first day outside
the convent in almost...

359
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,855
Oh, goodness... almost 30 years.

360
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:18,206
- Gosh!
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,878
Well, I'm sorry this is where
you have to spend it.

362
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:26,331
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

363
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,369
- No, of course.
- Thank you.

364
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,565
Dr. Walsh.

365
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,673
I ordered four tests.
Why did I just see one?

366
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:38,240
Oh, I just ordered
the thyroid test.

367
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:39,458
And why would you do that?

368
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,982
Well, the ED was so jammed,

369
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,272
and hypothyroidism seemed like
the obvious diagnosis.

370
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,769
So you thought
that you'd just ignore me

371
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,205
and do whatever you wanted?

372
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,860
Sorry, what year
of your residency are you in?

373
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,993
And let's all just
lower the temperature.

374
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,212
A little heat joke
to diffuse the tension.

375
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:57,662
When I order four tests,
it's not a suggestion.

376
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,198
- It's an order.
- Helen.

377
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,691
Walsh.

378
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:07,443
We're doing the best we can.
What's going on with you?

379
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:08,835
With me?

380
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,706
What's going on with you?

381
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,796
Actually, do you know what?
It's fine, it's fine!

382
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,886
I'll run the tests myself.

383
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,465
Fran, I need a full-body PET
scan on my incoming patient...

384
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:22,250
Not a half body,
not a quarter body,

385
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:25,052
a full-body PET scan,
and you're out of gloves.

386
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,766
Yeah, we've already used up
our daily allotment

387
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,940
of exam gloves.

388
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:30,640
There's a ladies' room
with some biodegradable soap,

389
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:34,179
or you can wipe your hands
on your pants.

390
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,046
Max is solving global warming.

391
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,258
BP's down to 90 over 40.

392
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:43,660
Hang a bag of normal saline
at 15 degrees Celsius.

393
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:45,628
Run it wide open
into his central line.

394
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,961
Repositioning the catheter.
Inflating manual cuff.

395
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,050
Core temps still elevated.

396
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,863
Then push .2 milligrams
of Ativan.

397
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:53,456
- I need a syringe.
- Drop the temp on the cooling blanket.

398
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,099
Give me tape and scissors.

399
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,319
Come on, we've got to make
some headway here.

400
00:16:57,403 --> 00:17:00,409
Much longer
and his brain's gonna fry.

401
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,063
Get me four by fours.

402
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,629
Gauze.

403
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:05,892
Core temp down to 38.2.

404
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,889
All right, lighten up
on the anesthesia.

405
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,001
Got it.

406
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,768
Oh, I didn't call
for a consult.

407
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,597
- How's he doing?
- Alive, barely.

408
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:16,816
Some idiot left him
locked in a car.

409
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,421
In this weather,
that's borderline criminal.

410
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,915
I'm sorry, why are you here?

411
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,584
He's my son.

412
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,955
Gretchen, what's
with the gloves?

413
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,746
Gloves, gloves.

414
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,524
Are you kidding me?

415
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,186
- Who restocked the closet?
- I did.

416
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,704
I'm sorry, let me get
this knife out of my back.

417
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,576
Your heart's
in the right place, Max.

418
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,752
It is, so why...

419
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:46,748
But your idealism
is ridiculous.

420
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,142
You know
what's not ridiculous?

421
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,978
Lung cancer, which is set
to increase exponentially

422
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:53,720
from pollution unless
we do something, anything,

423
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:56,240
about climate change,
like limiting exam gloves.

424
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,988
During a global pandemic,
Max?

425
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,729
- CDC recommends soap and...
- Listen.

426
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,383
If you want to battle
climate change,

427
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,124
then become a vegetarian,

428
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,430
buy an electric car,
invest in solar panels.

429
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,432
There are any number of things
that you could do

430
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:10,555
that we'd all be on board with,
but not like this.

431
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,770
The gloves are back on.

432
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,219
Max Begley Jr., come on!

433
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:19,962
Joining the climate fight,
I'm so proud.

434
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,707
Well, it's now
or, quite literally, never.

435
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,666
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in.
110% in.

436
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,537
When I think about the Earth
that our kids are inheriting,

437
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,973
it just... it breaks my heart,
so I really hope

438
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,019
this little glove debacle
doesn't slow you down any.

439
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:32,240
No, no way, I am committed
to ending global warming

440
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:33,676
- at New Amsterdam...
- Well, obviously.

441
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,894
Which by the way,
did you know,

442
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:36,461
is causing massive upticks

443
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,768
in vector diseases like
dengue fever, Zika, Lymes...

444
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,118
I'm already seeing increases
in stress, anxiety,

445
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,250
sleep disorders
in neighborhoods

446
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,338
- with poor air quality, right?
- Yeah.

447
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,991
I mean, sacrifices
need to be made.

448
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,298
Which is why I just came up
with an even bigger idea.

449
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:48,473
Even bigger?

450
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,432
Max Thunberg,
what have you done?

451
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:53,043
You eliminated red meat
from all patient meals?

452
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:54,958
Every rib, patty,
and sirloin.

453
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,220
But you can't do that.

454
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:58,135
I can, and I did

455
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,615
because New Amsterdam
is getting ready

456
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,486
for "turning down the meat
on global warming."

457
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,185
I'm not sure if that's
a slogan or an HR violation,

458
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,455
but we are not complying.

459
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,563
Do you hear me?

460
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:11,962
New Amsterdam buys 7,384 pounds
of red meat per week.

461
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:16,239
That is 13,291,000 gallons
of water,

462
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,423
and do you want to guess
how much methane

463
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,939
is produced by those cows?

464
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,227
No.

465
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,577
Good, 'cause that's the one
statistic I did not memorize,

466
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,438
but it is a lot.

467
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,883
Dr. Goodwin, I don't think
you quite understand

468
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,337
the effect this is going
to have...

469
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:27,512
No red meat?

470
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:28,618
My patients are going
to revolt.

471
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,186
- There will be violence.
- Over this?

472
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,710
Come on.
It's healthier.

473
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,649
Studies show that cutting out
red meat reduces the risk

474
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,433
of heart disease as well
as most cancers,

475
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:36,821
and we've been doing it
in cardio for years.

476
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,480
Well, I don't work in cardio,
Dr. Goodwin, I work in OB,

477
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,657
and when a patient's been
sucking ice chips for two days,

478
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,485
squeezing a bowling ball
out of their vagina

479
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,183
during an 18-hour labor,
believe me, they want blood.

480
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,602
- They want steak.
- Right, okay.

481
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,947
Well, if new mothers are
craving iron post childbirth,

482
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,928
you can lovingly
and instructively point them

483
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:53,313
toward legumes.

484
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,236
- You're gonna get me killed.
- Dr. Goodwin!

485
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,021
Every single patient in post-op
is complaining about our food.

486
00:19:58,105 --> 00:19:59,180
Yeah.

487
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,045
How exactly is that any
different from any other day?

488
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,330
But without any history
of mental illness

489
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,512
and his delusions,
it has to be one of two things:

490
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:11,817
One, neurological...

491
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,819
- My bet would be meningioma.
- Yeah.

492
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,647
A small tumor impeding
his limbic system

493
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,283
could explain his behavior.

494
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,423
Right, or two,

495
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,907
he's a Tempestarii.

496
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:25,892
- Just tell me.
- I'm glad you asked, Dr. Kao.

497
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,703
Tempestarii were medieval
magicians who believed

498
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:31,003
that they could control
the weather with their minds.

499
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,058
- That's odd.
- Well, not really.

500
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:37,713
People used to believe
in giants back then, elves...

501
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,192
- No, no, no.
- Wacky stuff.

502
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:41,020
- I meant his scan.
- Oh, why?

503
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,892
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

504
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,981
No meningioma, no tumors,

505
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,592
nothing that would explain
his delusional state.

506
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:50,726
- Well, what does that mean?
- It means you're right.

507
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,765
He must be
a medieval weather magician.

508
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:16,904
He's doing much better now.

509
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,071
Thank you.

510
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:26,370
I had six surgeries yesterday,

511
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,677
one scheduled
for early this morning.

512
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,017
The employee lot was full,
so I had to park on the street.

513
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:32,743
Hey, look,
I don't need to hear this.

514
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:35,393
I need you to understand.

515
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:37,729
So I'm raising him on my own,

516
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:40,028
and school's on, school's off.

517
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,344
Sometimes I drive him,
sometimes I don't,

518
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,607
and so this morning,

519
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:48,344
I drove to the hospital
instead of the school.

520
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:52,087
I got an emergency page,
and so I just ran,

521
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:55,169
and hey, I forgot.

522
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:02,058
I... I forgot he was there.

523
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,147
He was asleep.

524
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:06,751
It was a mistake.

525
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:10,414
He's your son.

526
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:11,981
He should have been
your priority.

527
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,280
He's m... he is.

528
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,205
He is.

529
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,207
Tell that to social services.

530
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,028
Maybe they'll understand.

531
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,479
- What happened?
- She's in V-tach.

532
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,395
Heart rate shot up to 150.

533
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,219
Clear.

534
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,663
She's back.

535
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,534
Okay, let's get her
on amiodarone,

536
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:45,101
150 milligram IV.

537
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,059
That happened
because she has endocarditis.

538
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:48,539
What?

539
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,019
According to the test results
I ordered initially,

540
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,890
she's fighting
a raging infection.

541
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:54,632
Walsh, let's get her
on triple antibiotic therapy,

542
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:55,764
amp, gent, and vanco.

543
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:57,374
On it.

544
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,897
If your staff had just done
the work-up I asked them to

545
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,856
in the first place, we would
have known this hours ago.

546
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,640
- Spared the woman a code...
- On your left.

547
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:05,556
- You need an overflow, Lauren.
- Your ED's a mess.

548
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,863
Yeah, well,
I spoke to Max this morning.

549
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,386
- He says he's on it.
- Ha!

550
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,650
By taking away gloves from
radiology and meat from OB?

551
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:14,260
All right, I'll remind him.

552
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:16,088
Remind him?
Remind him?

553
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,699
A week ago,
you would have demanded it,

554
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:19,657
and he would've opened up
a triage unit already.

555
00:23:19,741 --> 00:23:22,051
Whatever the hell you did
on vacation,

556
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,618
you need to shake it off.

557
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,051
You've gone soft, and it's
putting our patients at risk.

558
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,932
Max, hey, hi.
So, listen.

559
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,978
I just tried to order
a hamburger in the cafeteria...

560
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:37,370
I know, you can't.
Isn't that great?

561
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:38,763
Right.

562
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:39,982
I was under the impression
this was more

563
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:41,940
of a patient-centered
type program.

564
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:43,376
No, no, no.
It's gotta be hospital-wide.

565
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,204
Otherwise patients would just
have family members

566
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:47,555
go down to the cafeteria, and
they'd grab a burger for them,

567
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:48,686
and then we'd be wasting

568
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,427
all those perfectly good
vegetarian meals.

569
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:51,907
Right, yeah, uh-huh.

570
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:54,431
But do we really want
to dictate what people can eat?

571
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:55,737
- Is that our thing?
- Yeah.

572
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,347
I think that's exactly
what we want to dictate.

573
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,044
Well, what if a doctor just
wants a simple hamburger?

574
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:00,306
Then a doctor
can go off campus

575
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,612
and get a simple hamburger.

576
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,179
What if a doctor has patients
all afternoon,

577
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:04,572
and his 1:15 process meeting
got pushed back by half an...

578
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:05,834
Iggy, I thought
you were on board.

579
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:09,141
I am.
I am... oh, I so am.

580
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:12,928
I just... you know,
I'm on the keto diet,

581
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,930
and I'm not sure you know what
that does to a man, right?

582
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:17,759
I'm giving up cake, and bread,
and desserts, and French fries,

583
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:20,283
and every kind of sweet
you can imagine, you know?

584
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,068
And I'm down to wrapping my
burger patty in wilted lettuce,

585
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:26,463
and if we have it your way,
I'll just have, uh...

586
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:28,334
I just have the lettuce.

587
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:32,295
So you need to reinstate
the meat.

588
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,384
- Okay.
- Okay?

589
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:35,516
- Yeah.
- Really?

590
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,908
Sure, just answer me this:

591
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:39,302
How are we gonna
make a difference

592
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:42,740
when nobody is willing
to change a single thing?

593
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:44,960
No, no, no, no.
I am all for change.

594
00:24:45,044 --> 00:24:46,396
I'm all about change.
You know that.

595
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm here, I am down to change
the planet with you.

596
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:49,355
I'm right by your side.

597
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:52,746
Just, um... just not like this.

598
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:01,759
How are we feeling, Sister?

599
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:04,849
B...

600
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:06,547
B...

601
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,939
B... mm.

602
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,375
Okay, just relax.
Relax.

603
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,770
- Dr. Bloom!
- Yeah?

604
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,939
It's okay.

605
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:18,167
- What's going on?
- She's slurring her words.

606
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,865
- She's aphasic.
- This isn't endocarditis.

607
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:22,519
How did I get it so wrong?

608
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,303
Whatever it is,
it's moved up to her head.

609
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,479
- It's attacking her brain.
- Autoimmune disease.

610
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,996
But I would've seen signs
of inflammation.

611
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,311
What the...?

612
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:35,184
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

613
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,142
Swapping out all the
fluorescents in the hospital

614
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:38,579
with energy-efficient LEDs.

615
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,667
Why?

616
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,103
Because Dr. Goodwin's

617
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:42,931
"shedding light
on global warming."

618
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:45,673
And you're doing this now,
in the middle of the day,

619
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,283
when we're stuffed
to the gills?

620
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:50,068
It's a big hospital.
Lot of light bulbs.

621
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:53,289
And you're not supposed to be
wearing those gloves anymore.

622
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:55,798
- Kevin!
- That's it.

623
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:58,516
Get me Max down here 
now.

624
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:00,214
<i>Mom is having a problem.</i>

625
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,791
- What? What's up?
<i>- You were right.</i>

626
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,734
<i>Her blood sugar
is off the charts.</i>

627
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,127
See?

628
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:06,998
This is exactly what I was
talking about.

629
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:09,479
Okay, listen to me.
Go to the fridge.

630
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:11,046
Give her ten more units
of insulin.

631
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,524
It should be the last
of the bottle.

632
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,615
<i>This bottle's full, Floyd.</i>

633
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,790
It can't be.

634
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,226
<i>Wait, there's another one
in here.</i>

635
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,401
Another one?

636
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:19,750
<i>It's an old prescription.</i>

637
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,230
Wait, what?

638
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,774
<i>It's expired.</i>

639
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,297
No.

640
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:26,714
No, no, no.
That's not right.

641
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:28,454
<i>Yeah, it's in front
of the milk, right?</i>

642
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:31,022
<i>Expiration five weeks ago.</i>

643
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,110
Oh...

644
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:35,200
That's what I've been
giving her all week.

645
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:36,532
<i>Are you serious?</i>

646
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:38,013
<i>The whole reason
you're staying with her</i>

647
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,495
<i>is to monitor her meds...
You could have killed her!</i>

648
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,277
It was a mistake, I...

649
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,563
Okay, so first of all,
let me thank you again

650
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:52,217
for letting me take a look
at that brain of yours.

651
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:54,524
- What an honor.
- So you believe me?

652
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:58,746
You have quite the gift,
truly,

653
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,791
and your brother and I
were actually hoping

654
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,925
that maybe you would consider
staying on longer here

655
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,755
at the hospital with me,
so I could study you further.

656
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,540
Um...

657
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:11,846
no.

658
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,108
Just hear me out.

659
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:15,588
Your power is unusual,

660
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:19,070
and I would really like to know
what's actually happening here.

661
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:21,155
I'm fascinated.

662
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:25,816
I knew it.

663
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,297
I'm not making this up.

664
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,213
- We're trying to help you.
- By tricking me?

665
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,605
Lying to me?

666
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,999
Trying to lock me away
in some psych ward?

667
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,131
Because you're acting crazy!

668
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,654
Hey, now,
we don't use that term.

669
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:39,743
Javi, you're sick.
You need help.

670
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,136
We're trying to help.

671
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,877
There's nothing wrong
with me.

672
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,966
Your brother is just
concerned for you, okay?

673
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,309
He's worried.
We all just want what's best.

674
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,103
You want proof?

675
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,231
Here's proof.

676
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,761
You want more proof?

677
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:09,069
- Javier.
- How about this?

678
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:18,347
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Grab him, grab him.

679
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,479
Gently, gently, gently.
Get him on his side.

680
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:23,613
- Javi, open your eyes.
- Gladys!

681
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:25,738
Javi.

682
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,318
Yeah?

683
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,103
I asked you for help
this morning,

684
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:36,800
and you have done
absolutely nothing.

685
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,846
I've been trying
to make changes all day.

686
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,283
- To combat climate change.
- Exactly.

687
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,241
I asked you for help
in my ED, Max.

688
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:45,461
And my changes would
significantly reduce

689
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:46,636
your patient load.

690
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,291
Years from now, not today.

691
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,641
My ED is coding today.

692
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:56,124
Okay, so when do we make
changes?

693
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,517
You tell me.
We run 24/7.

694
00:28:58,601 --> 00:28:59,867
There's never gonna
be a good time

695
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,869
to change the lightbulbs,
or try a new policy,

696
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:04,697
or do anything
of any consequence.

697
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,962
We all say that we wanna fight
climate change,

698
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,398
just not like this.

699
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,878
Do you know what
"not like this" means?

700
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:12,880
It means never,

701
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:15,839
and never means
a lot of patients.

702
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,580
It means human suffering
on a scale

703
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:19,016
that we can't even imagine.

704
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,626
Max.

705
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,977
No, we can be a model for
other hospitals in New York,

706
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,326
for the country, the world

707
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,894
if we can cement
one single change...

708
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,418
Enough!

709
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:32,290
I am running
an emergency department,

710
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:34,597
not an environmental
think tank.

711
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,729
I don't care about
my carbon footprint,

712
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:38,688
or yours, or this hospital's.

713
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,429
I don't care
how many gloves I use,

714
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,345
or how many syringes I toss,
or my emissions.

715
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,913
I care about the patients
in this ED

716
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,524
lining these hallways
and waiting in ambulances

717
00:29:48,608 --> 00:29:50,569
halfway around the damn block.

718
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:53,224
So stop making changes
that are gonna help people

719
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:56,140
a hundred years in the future,
and get me more staff,

720
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,316
more beds,
and a second triage unit,

721
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,097
so we can start helping people
right now.

722
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:12,591
Javier, the surgery was
a success.

723
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:13,984
How'd you know
how to fix him?

724
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:15,768
Do you guys know
what barometric pressure is?

725
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:17,118
I heard of it,

726
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:18,989
but what's that got to do
with my brother's brain?

727
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,512
Excellent question.

728
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:22,819
So barometric pressure
is the weight of the atmosphere

729
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,647
all around us, and it can
affect the human body

730
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,040
in many, many ways.

731
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,869
Like, for example,
if the air pressure is lower,

732
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,435
it pushes against
the body less,

733
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,046
allowing tissues to expand.

734
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,699
And when the storm started,

735
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:37,051
the drop in pressure opened
a fistula in Javier's brain.

736
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,749
And that fistula was hiding
a small benign tumor,

737
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,925
hiding it even from the MRI.

738
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,964
And that's what was causing
Javier's delusions.

739
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,979
I know.
It's been that kind of day.

740
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:54,068
So I wasn't controlling
the weather?

741
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,158
No, no, the weather was
controlling you, in fact,

742
00:30:57,242 --> 00:30:58,986
which sadly is something
I think we're all gonna have

743
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,773
to get used to.

744
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,692
- How are you feeling, Sister?
- The same.

745
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:11,955
What's wrong with me?

746
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,478
We have run some more tests,

747
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:18,353
but at this stage,
we just don't know.

748
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:19,920
I have faith.

749
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,008
I'm not gonna lie.

750
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,879
I could use some of that
right about now.

751
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:25,534
Are there any spare rooms going
at your convent?

752
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:28,624
I'm not sure
that would be any help.

753
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,532
I found mine on a bender
in Panama.

754
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,285
Oh, you're serious?

755
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,722
You found your faith
on a bender in Central America?

756
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:41,158
Oh, yes.

757
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,944
At your age, I was what you'd
call a raging alcoholic.

758
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,424
- Sister Edith.
- It's true.

759
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:51,125
That summer backpacking...
Partying, really.

760
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,172
I think it took about six weeks
until I lost everything,

761
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:59,046
my backpack, my passport,
friends.

762
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:05,000
I managed to push everyone
and everything away.

763
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:08,969
I thought it would make me feel
more safe,

764
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:13,183
but I was never so alone.

765
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:18,456
And then suddenly, I wasn't.

766
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,625
I had faith.

767
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:25,550
It was all that was left,

768
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,510
and what I was missing,

769
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:31,070
and I never lost it again.

770
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:37,642
- In... in Panama.
- Yeah, that's right.

771
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:42,393
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

772
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,569
She has malaria.

773
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:46,919
What are you talking about?
She's a cloistered nun.

774
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:50,140
Yeah, now, but 30 years ago,
she was a party girl in Panama.

775
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,576
You can't be serious.

776
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,535
She had a whole life
before joining the convent.

777
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,972
So, what, it's been dormant
all this time?

778
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:58,496
And only now triggered
due to the heat wave.

779
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,846
Look, her body temp,
her blood smear.

780
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,066
Cerebral malaria.

781
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,156
Get her
on intravenous artesunate.

782
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,505
I just couldn't see it

783
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,551
because I only saw one part
of who she is.

784
00:33:09,635 --> 00:33:11,850
Apology accepted.

785
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:30,267
Dr. Reynolds.

786
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,790
What's gonna happen to him?

787
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:33,488
There's a lot
to unpack there,

788
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,012
but leaving a child locked
in a car in New York City

789
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:37,535
can constitute endangerment.

790
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,798
He could go to jail,
lose his son.

791
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,974
Is that...

792
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:45,065
is that too far?

793
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,718
The boy was five,
Dr. Reynolds,

794
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,155
abandoned in a car.

795
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,721
You found him.
You saw.

796
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:52,463
Right, right, right, right,
but you didn't...

797
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:54,204
you didn't see the look
on his face

798
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:57,077
when he came into my OR,
he had the...

799
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,513
His eyes.

800
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,776
I'm sure he felt awful,

801
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,734
but our concern must be
for the safety of the child.

802
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:05,085
Right, right,
that's why I called, but...

803
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,297
But what?

804
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:15,095
It was a mistake.

805
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,615
He made a mistake.

806
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,625
Is this a recommendation
for leniency?

807
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:26,797
It's a recommendation
for forgiveness.

808
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:51,653
- Coming through.
- Oop, sorry.

809
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:55,047
Hey, Jerry, you need some help
with that?

810
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:56,694
I won't say no.

811
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,357
I'm going to eight.

812
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,317
Yeah, or, and I'm really
gonna blow your mind

813
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,275
with this one, we could get off
at the next floor

814
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,842
and take the elevator?

815
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,017
- No can do.
- No?

816
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,888
Gotta get in my steps.

817
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:13,805
Heart issue, and I promised
my kids I'd stick around

818
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,764
to see 'em get married,
have kids of their own.

819
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,200
Well, that must feel good.

820
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:20,160
Don't get me wrong, man.
The exercise sucks.

821
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,075
I hate it, every step,

822
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,296
but someone's gotta make sure
the grandkids are Mets fans,

823
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,773
so I suck it up
and get it done.

824
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,953
What's the smile for?

825
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:39,266
I owe you an apology.

826
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,006
I came in here this morning
thinking

827
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,008
that I could make changes

828
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:45,794
without disrupting your lives.

829
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,318
Clearly, I was wrong.

830
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:52,627
So I'm gonna try
something else.

831
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:57,197
I'm gonna disrupt your lives
on purpose.

832
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,807
We're all
in favor of change

833
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,331
right up until the moment
it makes us uncomfortable.

834
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,507
So we're going
King Solomon here.

835
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,422
Since I can't implement
any changes

836
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:07,511
without upsetting someone,

837
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:10,079
I'm gonna implement
all of my changes at once

838
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:11,733
and upset everyone.

839
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:14,257
I didn't think
it could get any worse.

840
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,520
That's what they said
about climate change.

841
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:18,609
I'm asking everyone
to be annoyed,

842
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,525
inconvenienced, uncomfortable.

843
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,354
It will unquestionably suck,

844
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:27,357
but doing nothing is worse.

845
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:29,098
So we'll all put up
with the lightbulbs

846
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:30,491
and the fewer gloves.

847
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:31,753
And the surgeons
will say goodbye

848
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:33,015
to single-use scalpels,

849
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,886
and the anesthesiologists
will account

850
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,236
for their greenhouse gasses.

851
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,282
We will all dig
a little deeper,

852
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,502
and cope with a leafy salad

853
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:43,547
because if we want any chance

854
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,897
of a better future
for our kids,

855
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,943
there is only one move left:

856
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:52,121
Suck it up and get it done.

857
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:54,645
The only thing I can promise

858
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:57,692
is that we'll all hate it
together.

859
00:36:57,776 --> 00:37:00,477
Annoying, but inspired.

860
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:03,393
You know, I get that a lot.

861
00:37:03,477 --> 00:37:08,659
So what ridiculous name
are we calling this program?

862
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,462
Our last chance.

863
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:18,365
Ah, Ignatius, you are needed.

864
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:20,628
Oh, somebody knows
my core issues.

865
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:22,978
- Wine?
- Uh, yes, please.

866
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:26,547
Thank you,
and do we have children?

867
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:27,765
We do.

868
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:31,073
Saleem and Raffi
are mainlining "Fortnite,"

869
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,684
Harper is on a clothing strike,

870
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,687
Sameera will be back
from the park any minute,

871
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:40,212
and I chose the hottest day
of the year to bake a chicken.

872
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:42,476
Oh, my gosh.
I love my life.

873
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,217
I love you.
This is amazing, thank you.

874
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,481
Papa, Papa!

875
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,222
- I hit a ball!
- Ah, here's our slugger.

876
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:52,616
- I hit an overhand ball.
- Yes, Sameera, that's...

877
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,488
Sweetheart, why don't you go
tell your brothers and sisters?

878
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,403
Oh, hold on, kiddo.

879
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:59,920

okay?

902
