1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,975
In the 1800s,

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,661
one of the more common reasons

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:11,379
women visited the
doctor was "hysteria."

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,848
Granny, I don't know
where your nice shoes are,

5
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:15,850
but aren't you staying home?

6
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,485
Can't you just
wear your slippers?

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,987
Well, what about next weekend?

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,164
I'm in Miami

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,256
for a National Conference
on Neuroscience.

10
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,525
Miami is a six-hour
flight from Seattle.

11
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,194
I could get on the
redeye Friday night.

12
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,062
We'd have all of Saturday,

13
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,664
and then I could fly back
Sunday in time to pick up Scout.

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,782
Is that insane? A little.

15
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:34,999
I wish I could get on a
plane to Minnesota right now.

16
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,670
I'm not in Minnesota.

17
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,640
You're not? Where are you?

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,410
A now-defunct diagnosis...

19
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,847
"hysteria" was used to describe

20
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,385
a wide array of symptoms...
Chest pain, anxiety...

21
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,489
I wish I could kiss you
right now, but I'm at work.

22
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:56,757
A swollen abdomen...

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,326
Hi. Mood swings.

24
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,494
Hi.

25
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,496
They tried a variety of
treatments for hysteria,

26
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,333
ranging from rest to
psychosomatic therapy.

27
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,006
Please can I watch
your bowel resection?

28
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,414
You stay home from school,
you keep up with your work.

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,545
That was our deal.

30
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,967
I will never need to
know anything about

31
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,242
the French Revolution, ever.

32
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,843
If you only know about medicine,

33
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,254
what will you talk to
your patients about?

34
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,056
You talk to your patients
about European history?

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,115
But true relief for these
women didn't exist...

36
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,051
I have to catch up
with Maggie and Nick.

37
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,852
Go to my office. I'll
see you soon, okay?

38
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,254
Until physicians tried using

39
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,356
what they called pelvic massage.

40
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,458
Hey. Zola's skipping
school again today.

41
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,856
Well, she had
another panic attack,

42
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,561
so what was I supposed to do?

43
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,897
The cure was called a
"hysterical paroxysm"...

44
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,700
Wow. What are you doing here?

45
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,103
None of your business.
I'm a private citizen.

46
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,106
Which today has come to
be known as an orgasm.

47
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,642
Uh, yeah, I may have, uh, given
her and Dr. Wilson permission

48
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,279
to use the interns
for a special project.

49
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,547
You gave away our surgical
interns for the entire day?

50
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,085
Well, I mean, the
project's important, and...

51
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,752
do you really want
to tell Bailey no?

52
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,955
Modern medicine
continues to recognize

53
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,791
the stress-reducing benefits
of the female orgasm.

54
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,793
But doctors no longer
perform the cure.

55
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,395
Sign these.

56
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,130
What are they?

57
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,398
Release forms.

58
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,166
For what? Okay, new rule...

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,268
No questions before 8:00 a.m.

60
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,937
Well, we just want to know
what we... Save it for 8:01.

61
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,703
I'll be in the pit if
you desperately need me

62
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,399
and there is
absolutely no one else

63
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,443
in your general
vicinity who can help.

64
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,746
Okay, but where... People, it's
very simple... no questions.

65
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,515
You just didn't tell
us where we're going.

66
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,917
You're with Dr. Bailey.
Who's Dr. Bailey?

67
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,119
Wow, blasphemy.

68
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,486
I am Dr. Bailey.

69
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,125
What are you waiting
for? Let's go.

70
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,592
I'm so sorry.

71
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,194
I-I thought I met
all the attendings.

72
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,474
I'm Mika Yasuda.

73
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,340
No need to apologize.
I don't work here.

74
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,934
Dr. Bailey was chief of surgery
until about six months ago.

75
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,536
I left to spend
time with my family.

76
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,271
That's nice.

77
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,206
It was, and then the
Supreme Court went

78
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,708
and stripped women of
our reproductive rights.

79
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:58,012
Dr. Wilson has been helping
me with a sex-ed curriculum

80
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,847
to teach teenagers
about their bodies

81
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,782
because we now live in a country

82
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,384
where the only way to guarantee

83
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,020
you don't have to carry
an unwanted pregnancy

84
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,355
is to not get pregnant.

85
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,889
And statistically speaking,

86
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,559
teens need some
big help with that.

87
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,462
So we are making
sex-education videos

88
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,696
to put up on social media.

89
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,398
We want to go viral...

90
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,218
You know, like that cat
that plays the piano.

91
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:20,868
Oh, come on,
people, get with it.

92
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,303
Dr. Bailey, we're
surgical interns.

93
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,305
We have progress notes
and nurses paging us,

94
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,906
and we're behind on
discharge summaries.

95
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,517
I don't even have time
to look at my phone.

96
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,310
I've got like 600 unread texts.

97
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,312
Nurses love me. You
won't be bothered today.

98
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,881
And in exchange for
your cooperation,

99
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,084
you get the benefit of working

100
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:39,987
with yet another
world-class surgeon.

101
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,958
Dr. Montgomery.

102
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,399
Oh, don't look so miserable.

103
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,034
You're getting paid to
talk about sex today.

104
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,837
Sex is fun, and I need
you to look like it.

105
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,593
Okay.

106
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,730
Addie, you really pulled out
all the stops on this one.

107
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,598
And I am so grateful.

108
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,135
Well, I spend
every waking moment

109
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,912
obsessing about the state of
women's health in this country,

110
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,738
so this was an easy yes.

111
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,441
Yeah. How much fallout are you
experiencing in California?

112
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,144
Last week, I had five patients

113
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,646
asking for prophylactic
tubal ligations

114
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,080
before they go to college,

115
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,458
because they're afraid
of getting pregnant

116
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,983
in hostile states.

117
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,728
18-year-olds wanting to
get their tubes tied.

118
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,121
I mean, it's the
actual apocalypse.

119
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,790
18? I didn't even want
kids until I was 30.

120
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,660
Hi. I'm Jo Wilson.

121
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,595
We actually met during
your grand rounds

122
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,297
on uterine transplants.

123
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,966
And Dr. Schmitt is a g...
Is a good friend of mine.

124
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,801
Unless you didn't like
him. Then I hate him.

125
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,237
Dr. Wilson, I've
heard great things.

126
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,072
Uh...

127
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,985
Would you excuse me just
a minute? Mm-hmm. Sure.

128
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,512
I cannot believe it. Shep...

129
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,447
Dr. Montgomery.

130
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,450
It's a... an... an honor
to be working with you.

131
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,453
I'm... I'm a huge fan
of... Of... of fertility

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,189
and... and your work
in it, specifically.

133
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,758
Hi. I'm Dr. Montgomery.

134
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,970
Simone Griffith. Dr. Griffith.
Dr... Dr. Simone Griffith.

135
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,429
Sorry, I'm starstruck.

136
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:38,882
What do you mean, I
don't have any interns?

137
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,217
They're off on some
special assignment.

138
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,343
Well, what, did they enlist?
Bring them back, Owen.

139
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,478
I have a full pit,
one surgical resident,

140
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,280
and you, who's worse
than useless to me.

141
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,824
You know what? Talk
to someone who cares.

142
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,983
Oh, excuse me,
Dr. Altman. What?

143
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,853
Well, as much as I
respect the purpose

144
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,555
and intention of
Dr. Bailey's project,

145
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,358
I could really use some more
hands-on experience in the pit.

146
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,394
I'll do H&Ps, run labs,
suture, drain abscesses.

147
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,829
I'll do anything you need.

148
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,131
Mm. You happy now?
Don't answer that.

149
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,866
You're never happy.

150
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,135
I'm a very happy person.
He's just bitter and broken.

151
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,137
Let's go.

152
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,406
These are your
scripts. Stick to them.

153
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,910
STDs, menstrual cycle, anatomy,

154
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,546
and you're all on contraception.

155
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,548
Uh, Dr. Webber, there's
plenty to go around.

156
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,250
Would you like to
pick a topic? Richard?

157
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,753
Uh, when I was 15, I was
handed a sack of flour

158
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,256
to care and treat like a baby.

159
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,023
Do you have that?

160
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,092
I'll be in my office.

161
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,028
Alright, uh, any questions,
comments, concerns?

162
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,398
Um, yeah.

163
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,235
This is very important and
all, but I am not your guy.

164
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,371
Never had sex before?

165
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,106
This is your assignment
today, so you are our guy.

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,542
I think what Dr. Kwan
is trying to say is, uh,

167
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,244
we're not exactly
qualified for this.

168
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,079
Yeah. Okay, do you understand

169
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,348
that hundreds of
thousands of teenagers

170
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,683
will become pregnant this year?

171
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,718
And now a lot of those children

172
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,188
will be forced to carry
their babies to term,

173
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,625
or worse, give themselves
back-alley illegal abortions,

174
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,560
get septic, and die.

175
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,297
So if you all want to go
hold a retractor, go ahead.

176
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,032
The rest of us will
be here saving lives.

177
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,401
Hmm.

178
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,203
Oh, s-so, we just
talk into the camera?

179
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,105
Not quite. Come on in.

180
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,741
I've organized volunteers
at my son's high school.

181
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,109
Actual nightmare.

182
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,744
No.

183
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,145
Can't teach without students.

184
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,781
Hi. Hi, everybody.

185
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,550
Hi. There we go.

186
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,093
Excuse me, young man.

187
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,563
Where's labor and delivery?

188
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,065
Are you looking for
someone? Yes, my daughter.

189
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,900
Her name is Denise.
Have you seen her?

190
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,836
No. Um...

191
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,005
She's having my grandbaby
today. I brought sustenance.

192
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,775
Hey, Adams! Come here.

193
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,479
Um, this is, uh...

194
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,013
Joyce... Joyce Ward.

195
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,358
Can you help her
find her daughter?

196
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,417
She's in labor. Can't
an orderly do that?

197
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,519
You want to go
back to sex class?

198
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,623
Please follow me, ma'am.

199
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:12,326
Hey. Yeah?

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,028
Uh, is it true that you, uh,
gave away the surgical interns?

201
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,630
Yeah, it's just for
one day, though.

202
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,432
How much of the day?

203
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,109
'Cause I need them to
round on Maggie's patients.

204
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,445
Otherwise, I'll need to
round on her patients,

205
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,003
as well as my own
patients. Right.

206
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,505
What are they even doing?

207
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,175
Uh, sex videos to
prevent teen pregnancy.

208
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,677
Sex videos?

209
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,447
Uh, no. Uh,
sex-education videos.

210
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,882
Oh, okay, well, that...

211
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,025
That's an important
word in that sentence.

212
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,284
It is.

213
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,453
Okay, I guess I'll
start rounds, then.

214
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,988
Okay. Okay.

215
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,990
Dr. Seip, 4617.

216
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,892
Dr. Jen Seip, 4617.

217
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,398
Hey. What you doing down here?

218
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,566
Uh, just going to the bathroom.

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,067
Y-You're going to the bathroom?

220
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,203
You walked across a
pedestrian bridge,

221
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,805
you took an elevator
down three flights,

222
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,673
when there's a bathroom
in your mom's office?

223
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,643
That's what that door is?

224
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,512
What's up?

225
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,180
Okay, fine, I was looking for
a gallery to watch surgery.

226
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,516
Ah. Please don't tell my mom.

227
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,189
I can't do more history
homework. I can't.

228
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,753
Yeah, well, I never really
liked history either.

229
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,197
All the battles you
have to memorize,

230
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,689
the old dudes with the wigs.

231
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,425
Who thought that looked good?

232
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,694
Okay, well, I don't have to
be in surgery for a few hours.

233
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,397
You want to see something cool?

234
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,099
Okay, let's go.

235
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,102
Track your menstrual
cycle with pen and paper, no apps.

236
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,705
If you get an abortion,
hostile states might be able

237
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,908
to use your phone as evidence
against you in criminal court.

238
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,878
If your period is late,
take a pregnancy test.

239
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,681
Um, medical abortions
are still, uh,

240
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,283
legal and available
in many states.

241
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,519
But, um, uh...

242
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,688
But you have to know that
you're pregnant early

243
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,956
if you want to use it.

244
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,124
Take one birth
control pill by mouth

245
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,726
every day at the same time.

246
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,928
Or you can get an
IUD or an implant.

247
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:59,132
IUD goes into the uterus. An
implant goes into your arm.

248
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,970
Both are 99% effective
at preventing pregnancy.

249
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,272
Morning-after pill.

250
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:10,077
Uh, if the first layer
of contraception fails,

251
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,447
take this as soon as possible
to, um, prevent pregnancy.

252
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,717
Oh, look, see, that girl over
there is paying attention.

253
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,953
Oh, wait, no, I just
didn't see her phone.

254
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,589
"Get young people," you said.

255
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,557
"They'll be good
at this," you said.

256
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,265
I know. I am sorry.

257
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,802
I forgot. I've got
too much going on.

258
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,070
Well, I will do it tonight
when I can't sleep.

259
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,750
Look, can we talk about
this later, please?

260
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,776
Okay. Bye. I love you.

261
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,645
Hey.

262
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,447
Are you okay?

263
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,950
Do you remember when
the state fair was?

264
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,485
Was it three weeks ago?

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,287
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't.
I don't live here.

266
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,957
Doesn't matter.

267
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,458
Either way, it's late.

268
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,993
What's late?

269
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,833
Oh.

270
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:10,037
Okay, well, um, your
period can be late

271
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,439
for all sorts of reasons.

272
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,008
But if you want, I can
take you for a blood test,

273
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,010
just to be sure.

274
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,612
Are you a doctor?

275
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,380
Yes, I am a doctor.

276
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,015
And you won't tell my parents?

277
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,317
No, this is between you and me.

278
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,023
I... Okay, I get it.

279
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,358
Did you tell the coordinator

280
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,460
that the patient's
a rare HLA match?

281
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,463
Okay, well, call them back
and send the latest labs.

282
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,231
Thank you.

283
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,343
Okay, what you want to do
is you take the left grasper

284
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,037
and pass the peg to
the right grasper.

285
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,473
Huh.

286
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,808
Did I do it wrong?

287
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,243
No, you did it, uh, seamlessly.

288
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,021
You sure your mom's never
shown you this before?

289
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,246
No, I swear. No?

290
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,048
Okay, well, I'm
not gonna tell you

291
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,617
how long it took
for me to nail that.

292
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,422
Did you always know you
wanted to be a doctor?

293
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,524
Me? Wow.

294
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,059
Uh, no. Gosh, no.

295
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,196
Um, at first I wanted
to be the Flash.

296
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,864
I thought he was
underrated but cool.

297
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,333
Then I thought I was gonna
play professional baseball.

298
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,102
That did not work out.

299
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:19,607
And, uh, then I decided I was
gonna be a science teacher.

300
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,541
And then what happened?

301
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,778
Well, um... Well, my mom died.

302
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,516
You know, I forgot one.

303
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,685
At one point, I was
gonna be an astronaut.

304
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,087
You liked space?

305
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,056
Uh, no, I liked the ice cream.

306
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,126
What?

307
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,061
Where is your enthusiasm,

308
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,562
your... your
passion for science?

309
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,897
We're losing them.

310
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,865
We're reading all the
facts you gave us.

311
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,299
You've turned it into ASMR.

312
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,901
You need to modulate
your voices.

313
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,870
You know, connect!

314
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,915
If I wanted someone to just read
facts from a sheet of paper,

315
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,116
I could have done that myself.

316
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,075
Respectfully, we
are not the problem.

317
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,310
These are boring factoids
that you could look up online.

318
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,823
We need to teach these kids
something they want to learn about,

319
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,915
engage their sexual curiosity.

320
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,752
No. Dr. Wilson wrote
a thorough curriculum.

321
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,219
Just stick with the script.

322
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,321
Be better.

323
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,223
Aah!

324
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,792
Hey, hey, can you
tell us what hurts?

325
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,493
She's tachy.

326
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,096
And she feels warm. Uh,
get me a gurney right now.

327
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,129
Dr. Wilson...

328
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,572
Wow. It's basically
like a video game.

329
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,908
10 years of training,

330
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,910
and I could have just
been playing a video game.

331
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,478
I don't think they
made this back then.

332
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,948
Wow!
Ouch. Okay.

333
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,017
Mind if I use one
of these tables?

334
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,986
Oh, hey. I didn't... I
didn't know you were here.

335
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,921
Oh, I came up last
minute to see Amelia.

336
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,923
Thought I'd do
some data analysis

337
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:43,967
until she's finished with work.

338
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,358
How's the, uh...
How's the trial?

339
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,194
We are hoping to
start the next phase

340
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,029
in the next couple of months

341
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,498
if David doesn't fire this
latest research director.

342
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,133
Yes.

343
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,968
Meredith Grey is
not easy to replace.

344
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,205
No. No, she's not. She's not.

345
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,707
How's the new gig? I like it.

346
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,008
I think I'm pretty good at it.

347
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,110
Uh, Zola, what do you think?

348
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,378
Mom says you take big swings.

349
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,816
Did you do that just now?

350
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,418
Mm-hmm. Is it okay?

351
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,655
That's a cognitive puzzle.

352
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,791
Most adults can't
do it that fast.

353
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,827
Hmm.

354
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,395
You know, I have six
other grandchildren.

355
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,031
But Denise is my baby.

356
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,199
She needs me with her.

357
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,501
Uh, excuse me. We're
looking for Denise Ward.

358
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,003
This is her mother.

359
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,405
Griffith... Denise Griffith.

360
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,549
She took her husband's name.

361
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,475
I'm not an O.B. nurse.

362
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,377
And you have a tablet
in your armpit.

363
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,212
Just...

364
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,416
Are you sure Denise came here?

365
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,052
Uh, maybe she went
to Seattle Pres.

366
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,087
No, no, she said Seattle Grace.

367
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,590
Uh, okay, got it.

368
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,193
Just give me a minute to
find your daughter's chart.

369
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,063
You know, if they have a boy,
they're gonna name him Calvin.

370
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,866
I don't love it, but
I'm staying out of it.

371
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,770
I hope it's a girl, 'cause
if they have a girl,

372
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,537
they're gonna name her Simone.

373
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,605
Isn't that beautiful?

374
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,175
Simone.

375
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,279
Did we get ahold of her parents?

376
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,747
Mom's on the way.

377
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,949
She also said it could
just be bad cramps,

378
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,753
because Diamond has
"extremely traumatic periods."

379
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,254
"Traumatic" or "dramatic"?

380
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,890
It's unclear.

381
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,258
Diamond, are you on your period?

382
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,027
Did my mom tell you that?

383
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,529
She tells everyone when
I'm on my freaking period.

384
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,964
I get a bad grade
on a math quiz,

385
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,966
she tells my teacher
I'm on my period.

386
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,734
Like, we bleed.
Why does it matter?

387
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,072
I'm the virgin who likes
anime, who passed out

388
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,641
during sex-ed class.

389
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,110
Wow!

390
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,079
That's a giant cyst
on the left side.

391
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,381
Look, it's... it's displaced
her entire abdomen.

392
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,283
And look, whirlpool
sign on the right.

393
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:53,386
The vasculature is twisted,
suggesting ovarian torsion.

394
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,822
She'll need surgery right away.

395
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,089
Well, then let's go.

396
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,591
Book an O.R. and
call her parents.

397
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,393
Dr. DeLuca is still
in her hysterectomy.

398
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,395
I have never done one
of these on my own.

399
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,164
Well, good thing we
know someone who has.

400
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,500
Find Dr. Montgomery. She's
gonna need privileges.

401
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,635
So are you.

402
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,841
Double up to
protect against STDs.

403
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,776
The pill and a condom,
an IUD and a condom,

404
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,148
but never use two
condoms at the same time.

405
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,316
They'll break, and you...

406
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,585
Ooh! Could get pregnant.

407
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,455
What are you doing? Just
got paged to the pit. Bye!

408
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,459
You don't want me
demonstrating condoms.

409
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,261
I mostly have sex
with women. Mm.

410
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,163
Uh, and I don't want to.

411
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,098
Why did you even go
to medical school

412
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,109
if you don't want to help
people? Do want to help people.

413
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,145
When they're under anesthesia
and can't ask me questions.

414
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,037
Are you a Capricorn?
That's not a real thing.

415
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:47,040
Okay, no, that is
for the condoms.

416
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,153
Who wants to know
where the clitoris is?

417
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,525
The vaginal opening
is right around here.

418
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,961
And then you go up, up, up,

419
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:11,631
and this point at the
very top is the clitoris.

420
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,401
Now, it's a bundle of
extremely sensitive nerves.

421
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,071
So, if you touch it too
hard, you will cause pain.

422
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:21,708
You want to approach
gently with a flat hand.

423
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,011
Gently, no poking.

424
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,512
It's not a button.

425
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,347
Yeah, and for those
of you with vaginas,

426
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,550
getting to know this part
of your body on your own

427
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,652
is the easiest way to
avoid getting pregnant.

428
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,821
Have you ever tried to...

429
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,223
really hold on,

430
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,225
like you're riding
on a roller coaster,

431
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,094
and you're not allowed to scream
until you get off the ride?

432
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,729
That is the pull-out method.

433
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,231
It is truly an excellent way

434
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,732
to accidentally get
someone pregnant.

435
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,734
Dr. Millin? Thank you, Doctor.

436
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,237
Dr. Kwan? Thank you, Doctor.

437
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,839
Now, hold it at the
tip of an erect penis.

438
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,841
That part's very important.

439
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,010
And then you roll it down...

440
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,515
You out of practice?

441
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,052
Never had to put a condom on
anything as small as a banana.

442
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,020
You get a condom,
you get a condom,

443
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,888
you get a condom,
you get a condom!

444
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,891
Everybody gets a condom!

445
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,892
Whoo!

446
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,227
Any more questions?

447
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,100
Ah, Schmitt.

448
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,534
Just the person I
was looking for.

449
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,303
Oh, Dr. Montgomery,
please don't make me

450
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,804
teach sex ed to high schoolers.

451
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,140
I hated high school. I-I
can't go back. I can't.

452
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,475
This isn't about sex ed.

453
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,743
Oh, well, in that
case, hi. How are you?

454
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,380
I have a patient.

455
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,315
She's waiting on
a pregnancy test.

456
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,160
I have got to run into an
emergent ovarian torsion.

457
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,295
Can you keep an eye out for
the results and deliver them?

458
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,620
Of course.

459
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,122
And, Schmitt, she's scared.

460
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,257
Oh, I can relate to a
scared high schooler.

461
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,127
One of our students collapsed.
She has an ovarian torsion.

462
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,795
I want to get her in
the O.R. right away.

463
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,130
May I have privileges?

464
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,631
Uh, I-I didn't catch that.

465
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,000
Could you say that
again, louder?

466
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,602
I am requesting
privileges, please.

467
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,637
Do you have a résumé
with you? For real?

468
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,073
Standard operating
procedures. Any references?

469
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,742
Are you done?
Privileges granted.

470
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,943
What about the sex ed?

471
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,678
Oh, she needs experienced hands,

472
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,414
but if you want to
check on the interns...

473
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,083
No, thank you.

474
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,518
Dr. Teller, extension 2219.

475
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,186
Denise!

476
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,422
Where's my grandbaby?

477
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:19,259
Granny, uh, it's me...
Simone, your granddaughter.

478
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,927
Denise isn't here. Remember?

479
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,495
That's not funny, Denise.

480
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,997
I'm not Denise,
Granny. I'm Simone.

481
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,265
No, no, no, no.

482
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,534
Mom died. Remember? I'm sorry.

483
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,469
I'm so sorry.

484
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,841
I want to go home. Okay.

485
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,185
Well, I'm working right
now, but we can call Dad.

486
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,810
He'll be... No.
Get away from me.

487
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,312
I don't want you.
I want my daughter.

488
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,781
Granny, come on. I said no.

489
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:42,949
Mrs. Ward, it's okay.

490
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,617
Get away from me.
Granny, come on.

491
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,985
Somebody help! It's me.

492
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,188
Hi. Can I help?

493
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,123
It's okay, it's okay.
I got this, okay?

494
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:53,060
Ma'am, can I help
you? What do you need?

495
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,228
Should we take
some deep breaths?

496
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,634
Deep breaths. There we go.

497
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,142
How can I help you?

498
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:13,180
Can you
help me find my daughter?

499
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,249
I would love to help
you find your daughter.

500
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,194
Did he
page you too? Yeah.

501
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,995
What's going on?

502
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,697
Why isn't Zola
doing her homework?

503
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,865
Well, we got... We
got sidetracked.

504
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,833
And you called us because...?

505
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,068
Well, Meredith's in surgery,

506
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:37,003
and I needed someone
else to see this.

507
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,339
Look at this. Is she doing
neurocognitive puzzles?

508
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,417
No, she's not doing them, she's
killing them, one after the next.

509
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,343
I have never seen
anything like it. Watch.

510
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,846
Did she just...? Yeah.

511
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,891
I couldn't even understand
the instructions that fast.

512
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,184
Look at her. She's so relaxed,
like it's nothing. Yeah.

513
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,895
I mean, what do we do
with this? What is this?

514
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,097
"Guinness Book of
World Records"?

515
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,264
You skip high school,
go straight to college?

516
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,689
What am I looking at here?

517
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,092
Feel like I'm watching
the U.S. Open.

518
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,628
Uh, hey, could I steal
you for a half-hour?

519
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,929
It's for a sex-ed thing.

520
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,697
Uh, yeah, we talked about this.

521
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:05,898
I'm your superior. I...

522
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,534
No, it's for a
literal sex-ed thing.

523
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,069
I need help with a
literal sex video, Link.

524
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,439
Wow. Still very not-okay.

525
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,707
And, you know, I'd prefer
if you call me Dr. Lincoln.

526
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,942
Everyone calls you Link.

527
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,777
Everyone except
you, moving forward.

528
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,279
Okay, can you just do it?

529
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,157
I mean, we are flying by the
seat of our pants up there.

530
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:22,591
No. No, I don't want
to lose my job today.

531
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,284
It's teaching. Or harassment.

532
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,652
And I don't want to tempt fate.

533
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,387
Which one of us
is being harassed?

534
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,300
I don't think it matters.
Find an actual couple.

535
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,092
Ah, Dr. Ndugu, could
you and Dr. Pierce

536
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,727
please demonstrate
sexual consent

537
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,296
for a roomful of teenagers?

538
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,331
I...

539
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,601
No.

540
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,472
Consensual sex requires no
verbal persuasion or convincing.

541
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:48,841
If you have to beg for it or
force it, it is not consent,

542
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,810
and you're doing it wrong.

543
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,445
So...

544
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,081
let's learn how to do it right.

545
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:58,351
There are 11 erogenous
zones on the female body...

546
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,253
The ear, the neck, the armpit...

547
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,021
Wait, what, the armpits?

548
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,590
Yes. You wouldn't know that,

549
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,543
because like most men,
you go straight for the...

550
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,462
But the nipples on many women

551
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,664
can be as sensitive
as the clitoris,

552
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,300
so going straight for them

553
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,843
without any foreplay
to the erogenous zones,

554
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,103
can be painful and
overstimulating.

555
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,273
The other erogenous
zones can be the stomach,

556
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:23,310
the inner thighs, the feet,
the back of the knees...

557
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,946
Have you ever had someone lick
the back of your knees before?

558
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,015
Wouldn't you like to know?

559
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,359
The more obvious
erogenous zones.

560
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,985
The external vaginal region...

561
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,355
Wilson, tell me what you see.

562
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,658
You are draining the cyst to
get access to the torsed ovary.

563
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,027
And I've created a barrier
to prevent spillage

564
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,995
from the cyst's contents
into the abdomen,

565
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,964
in case of malignancy.

566
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,634
Torsion's a rare
complication of cysts,

567
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,236
and I used to
caution my patients

568
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,238
from imagining the
worst-case scenario,

569
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,340
but now, after the
stripping of Roe v. Wade,

570
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,842
everything feels like
the worst-case scenario.

571
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,043
Amen to that.

572
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,078
I have constant rage inside.

573
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,889
Yeah, I've thought about
going to one of those places

574
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,015
where you pay money
to destroy things.

575
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,484
Doesn't help.

576
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,885
I also have rage.

577
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,854
I moved to O.B. for joy.

578
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,490
I wanted joy, and now I'm
gonna watch teenage girls die

579
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,226
from sticking coat hangers
up inside of themselves.

580
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,003
I mean, what if it's like
the '70s all over again,

581
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,863
and there are septic wards?

582
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,598
Someone should make a video

583
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,267
about how dangerous
a coat hanger is.

584
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,269
That's an excellent idea.

585
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,512
There's bleeding here. I don't
know where it's coming from.

586
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,704
Lap pad.

587
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,943
Let's extend the incision.

588
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,713
That exponentially increases
her risk for complications.

589
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,549
She's 17 years old. What if she
wants to have a baby someday?

590
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,694
If the other ovary is torsed
and it doesn't re-perfuse,

591
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:39,719
this may be all she has.

592
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,787
So, come on, let's go.

593
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,455
Okay. Now.

594
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,061
Lucia? I'm Dr. Schmitt.

595
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,864
Dr. Montgomery is in surgery.

596
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,533
Do you have my results?

597
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:57,236
It's positive.
You're pregnant.

598
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,072
We did it one time.

599
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:05,712
Did you not think that you could
get pregnant the first time?

600
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,814
I-I'm not stupid.

601
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:12,319
I just didn't think I would
get pregnant the first time.

602
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:14,430
Do you think that you might
want to keep the pregnancy?

603
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,623
No! I'm sorry.
I-I have to ask.

604
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,724
I can't have a baby.

605
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,158
I'm a stupid high schooler

606
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,160
who hasn't fed her
fish since Tuesday.

607
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,995
All I have to do is put
in a pinch of flakes,

608
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,497
and I still haven't done it.

609
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,966
A kid needs food every
day... Real food.

610
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,101
I would be the mother who
forgets to feed her baby,

611
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,170
and I would get
arrested or something.

612
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,773
Oh, my God, I don't want
to be pregnant senior year.

613
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,308
Do you know how mean kids are?

614
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,176
I do.

615
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,479
I think my parents might
actually murder me.

616
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,481
Hey.

617
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,484
They don't have to know
if you don't want them to.

618
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,186
As long as the embryo
measures under 10 weeks,

619
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,288
you can have a medical abortion.

620
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,024
We'll give you pills so that
you can manage it at home.

621
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,827
They say it's like a...
Like a really bad period.

622
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,598
Yes, please, get me the pills.

623
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,500
Can we please just
get this over with?

624
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,734
I'll get the ultrasound.

625
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,451
She's calmed down
now. She's with Adams.

626
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,353
Thank you.

627
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:21,354
How long?

628
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,855
Uh, two years.

629
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,560
Gotten a lot worse
the last six months.

630
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,630
My mother had Alzheimer's.

631
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,732
When I was an intern,
she got brought in here

632
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,066
with diverticulitis.

633
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,310
She kept running out of her room

634
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,437
thinking she was
late for surgery.

635
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,911
My grandma keeps
thinking I'm my mom.

636
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,414
You must look a lot like her.

637
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,682
Look alike in some photos.

638
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:53,820
She died when I... was born.

639
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,722
I'm sorry.

640
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,692
Now you have to keep
telling your grandmother

641
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,361
over and over that her...
Ooh, I... I can't do this.

642
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:06,332
I can't watch this. I, um...

643
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:09,368
I-I put every effort I could
into matching across the country

644
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,903
so I wouldn't have
to watch this,

645
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,448
and that went to hell,
and now I'm here.

646
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,575
I'm stuck in that house, and...

647
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,210
I love her. She's
my grandmother.

648
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,614
She raised me. She's
why I made it this far.

649
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,286
It might be helpful if you don't
tell her that her daughter died.

650
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,522
I know it's not easy,
but living in her reality

651
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,591
is the most humane option.

652
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:34,794
I don't think I have it in me.

653
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,930
Nobody does. You'll find it.

654
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,303
Is it okay if I stay out here
a little longer? I just...

655
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,972
Of course.

656
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,540
I really feel your
pain, Griffith.

657
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,275
My door is always open.

658
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,895
What's going on? Is Zola okay?

659
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,773
Oh, yeah, she's okay.
She's in there with Amelia.

660
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,441
Okay. I thought she may have had
another panic attack. No, no.

661
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,267
But she did find
some of Kai's puzzles

662
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,436
that they use for
neurological evaluations.

663
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,239
The puzzles mainly focus
on visual-spatial skills.

664
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,075
Yeah, I'm familiar with them.
What... What's going on?

665
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,077
Meredith, she's aced
every single one

666
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,179
at a level far higher than
most of the adults I see.

667
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,081
I'm aware that she's smart.

668
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,460
My question is, why is she being
evaluated without my consent?

669
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,420
Right, well, it... Yeah,
it was an accident.

670
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,188
Zola discovered the
test when she and I

671
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,257
were in there practicing
on the simulators.

672
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,935
She's supposed to be in
my office doing homework.

673
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,028
Mer, based on Kai's
time with her,

674
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,797
Zola is extremely gifted,

675
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,365
which could explain
the panic attacks.

676
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,200
When giftedness is undiagnosed,

677
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,202
it can contribute to
behavioral issues...

678
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,839
Anxiety, a feeling
of being untethered,

679
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,374
a feeling that you don't belong.

680
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,053
Because you don't. Her brain does
not function like other kids her age.

681
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,517
She needs challenges
that they don't.

682
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,881
She needs to be around
peers who can relate to her

683
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,149
and the way she thinks.

684
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,152
I'm gonna go see my kid.

685
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,393
Penetration is not necessary
for mutual pleasure.

686
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,029
For starters, most women,
or people with vaginas,

687
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,899
can't achieve orgasm
through penetration.

688
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,035
Yes? How come
that's not in porn?

689
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26,472
Because porn is to
actual human sex

690
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,676
as the "Fast & Furious" is
to actual human driving.

691
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,244
That is to say, it
bears no resemblance.

692
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,880
If you are having sex
with your partner,

693
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,048
and you are trying to
make it look like porn,

694
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,518
your partner is experiencing
little to no pleasure.

695
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,320
I would disagree.

696
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,365
Well, you would disagree
because the girls you are with

697
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,391
are also making it look
and sound like porn.

698
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,226
But that is just an act.

699
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,062
A real man wants to give
a woman a real orgasm.

700
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,732
So you want to be a real
man or some candy-ass actor

701
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,525
for whom a woman has to
pretend to enjoy sex?

702
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,037
Guess they were right.

703
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,406
This is definitely going viral.

704
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,709
Oh, not yet. Need music.

705
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:03,810
And dancing.

706
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,047
Hot dog! Boston again.

707
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,282
Mrs. Ward,
you're killing me.

708
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,785
Well, I guess you're lucky
that you're handsome, huh?

709
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,221
Where are you from?

710
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,924
Uh, Connecticut, but
my dad's from Barbados.

711
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,234
Ah.

712
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,258
Denise!

713
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,832
Honey, you okay?

714
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,602
Hi, Mom.

715
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,403
Did you have the baby already?

716
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,373
It's a girl.

717
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,708
A girl?

718
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,109
Simone.

719
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,749
Simone.

720
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:43,950
Can I see her? Not yet.

721
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,384
The doctors are cleaning her up.

722
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,919
Oh.

723
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,788
You want to sit with
us while you wait?

724
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,990
Dr. Adams,
your pager is going off.

725
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,391
Let... Let me play
a couple hands.

726
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,463
Don't go easy on
her, Mrs. Ward.

727
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,197
Yeah. ♪ Remains

728
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,808
There was quite a bit of
damage to Diamond's ovaries,

729
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,677
but we were able
to salvage them,

730
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,345
hoping to preserve her
fertility as best we can.

731
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,957
So she's gonna be okay?

732
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,415
She will, yes.

733
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,818
I told her she just had
bad menstrual cramps

734
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,119
and that it runs in the family.

735
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,821
I gave her a hot water bottle.

736
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,656
I never even took her
to see the gynecologist.

737
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,291
Oh, this isn't your fault.

738
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,326
No, unless someone
specifically educates you

739
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,697
on what to look for, it's
hard to know what's normal

740
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,499
and what's an indication
of an underlying problem.

741
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,772
I'm just so grateful she was
with you when this happened.

742
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:47,979
Ready?

743
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,489
First, you'll take mifepristone.
It's just one pill.

744
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,125
It'll stop the
pregnancy from growing.

745
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:02,561
Then, after 24 hours,
you'll take misoprostol.

746
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,196
It's four pills.

747
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,665
Put all four pills under
your tongue for 30 minutes.

748
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,200
And then after 30 minutes,

749
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,145
swallow whatever is left
of the pills with water.

750
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,238
And then a few hours after
you take the misoprostol,

751
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,841
you'll experience some
cramping and bleeding,

752
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,809
like a very heavy period.

753
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:19,211
Then you'll pass the pregnancy,
and the pain will stop.

754
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,813
How do I know if
something's wrong?

755
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,049
It's extremely rare
to have complications

756
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,885
with a medical abortion, but
if something feels off...

757
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,021
Fever, no bleeding,
too much bleeding...

758
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,256
Then I want you to call me.

759
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,758
You'll be here?

760
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,927
Yes, I will be here
for the next few days.

761
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,763
So you call me, day or night.

762
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,902
Can I take it now?

763
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,604
You can take it
whenever you're ready.

764
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,683
We're making reels.
Just dance and point!

765
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,461
We need energy,
people. It's for the kids.

766
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,567
What are we pointing
at? Oh, the facts.

767
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,561
We'll put them on the
screen later. If you say so.

768
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:35,321
But why little videos?

769
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,057
Because I can't get Tuck to look
up from his phone long enough

770
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,092
to have an actual conversation.

771
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,461
And we have to
speak their language

772
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,096
if we want them to learn.

773
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,899
Are you sure we're not
gonna get sued over these?

774
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,301
If someone wants
to take me to court

775
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,938
for educating people
about their own bodies,

776
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,273
they better be prepared
for a big fight.

777
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,175
So, when do you think
we'll see you again?

778
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,813
How does tomorrow sound?

779
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:03,082
Oh, you ready to
come back to work?

780
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,017
Ohh.

781
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:08,855
Look, I just can't sit
idly by while my daughter

782
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:11,023
doesn't have the same
rights as her brothers.

783
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,758
This is a humanitarian crisis.

784
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:17,596
I would like to
reopen the clinic

785
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,932
and dedicate it to
reproductive health.

786
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,667
I-I would run it
20 hours a week,

787
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,671
and the rest of the time,
I will be an attending,

788
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,539
teaching the next
generation of surgeons

789
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,308
who we are depending on

790
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,978
to be in this fight
for the long haul.

791
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,614
Mm. Well, Meredith's
still interim chief.

792
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,825
She's just waiting on you to...

793
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,951
No, I-I don't want chief.

794
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,319
I'm telling you what I want.

795
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,489
I want to teach and
cut 40 hours a week,

796
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,658
and then go home to my family
without the added stress.

797
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,561
That's my best and final offer.

798
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,998
Take it or leave it.

799
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,469
Sold!

800
00:33:57,503 --> 00:34:00,172
Welcome back, Dr. Bailey.

801
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,948
Hi.

802
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,219
Thank you for staying
with my grandmother today.

803
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,888
Ah, she's incredible.

804
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,089
Doesn't remember her address,

805
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,500
but still seems to
be an ace at cards.

806
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,726
Yeah, it's always
been her thing.

807
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,062
Growing up, all the kids
played Scrabble and Monopoly.

808
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,131
I played bid whist with
Grandma's book club.

809
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,203
You sure you're okay?

810
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,538
Yeah, fine.

811
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,674
You're not gonna
tell everyone, right?

812
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,043
Is it a secret?

813
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,211
I don't want anyone's pity.

814
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,879
I don't want to be
the broken-home girl.

815
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,049
It's bad enough the chief knows.

816
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,292
I think people are
just trying to help.

817
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,784
I know you're a Shepherd.

818
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,953
What?

819
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,256
How... Something
was weird with you

820
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,093
and Dr. Montgomery this
morning, so I looked you up.

821
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,462
She's your Auntie Addie.

822
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,297
You tell anyone? Not yet.

823
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,767
I'll keep your secret
if you keep mine.

824
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,135
Okay.

825
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,636
Okay.

826
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,217
Hey.

827
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,986
Kai and I are about to head out.

828
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,391
You okay?

829
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:29,261
They used to make me do these
puzzles all the time as a kid.

830
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:32,098
They'd stand over my
shoulder with a stopwatch,

831
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,100
take notes on a clipboard.

832
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,102
I spent years of my
childhood thinking

833
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,779
that there was something
horribly wrong with me.

834
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,305
My mind would race.

835
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:42,174
I-I-I couldn't speak
in front of the class.

836
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,111
I sobbed at every
social interaction.

837
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,980
I... panicked.

838
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,518
And now you're living
it all again with Zola.

839
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,753
No, not reliving it.

840
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,488
I completely missed it.

841
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,291
I love Zola so much.
How did I miss it?

842
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,527
It's hard to see
ourselves in others,

843
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,462
especially when
it's a side of us

844
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,631
that we feel like
we've left behind.

845
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,276
And then when somebody
points it out,

846
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,136
it's suddenly all
that you can see.

847
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:14,273
Mine is downstairs in the
pit doing sutures right now.

848
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,874
I know that extreme intelligence

849
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,552
does not mean that there's
something wrong with you,

850
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:21,447
but my gift certainly
gave me some struggles.

851
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,450
What helped?

852
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,686
A kind child psychiatrist

853
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,222
who gave me tools that
helped along the way.

854
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:33,025
Zola will get her tools.

855
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:37,296
We'll make sure of it.

856
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,072
Have you got any
plans for dinner?

857
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,307
Well, you should come on over.

858
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,708
I mean, Catherine's home.

859
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,377
You know she makes
way too much food.

860
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,013
Oh, I really should
keep working.

861
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,249
Addie, you're gonna
run yourself ragged

862
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,985
trying to solve the world's
problems every waking hour.

863
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:03,021
You know, it's a
marathon, not a sprint.

864
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,823
I mean, you know me, Richard.

865
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,059
And what they've done,

866
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:10,529
what they're continuing to do,

867
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,265
it just...

868
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,334
I just feel...

869
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,702
Erased?

870
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,240
Yes.

871
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,041
Erased. I feel...

872
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,545
erased.

873
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,114
I do know.

874
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:31,550
And I also know that even
if you spend every day

875
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,119
fighting the good fight,

876
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:35,254
I mean, you have to live,
I mean, you have to eat.

877
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,888
So come on over.

878
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,725
Catch up with old
friends, get some rest.

879
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,860
And wake up and do it
all over again tomorrow.

880
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,099
Okay.

881
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,900
So, how long are you
gonna stay mad at me?

882
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,036
A day, a week?
What do you think?

883
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,471
Let me know.

884
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,707
I haven't decided yet. Okay.

885
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,911
I mean, I'm lost
with Zola right now.

886
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,881
And it just doesn't help
that all the people I love

887
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,951
go behind my back and
break all of my rules.

888
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,386
I mean, she's a great kid.

889
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,321
She is. And she's brilliant.

890
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,832
I mean, there's a lot
to figure out here.

891
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:13,425
But, uh, we got a big
piece of the puzzle.

892
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,170
I mean, it's got to feel
pretty good, doesn't it?

893
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:17,796
Yeah, it does.

894
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,598
Ah! Did I get a smile?

895
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,933
See? You can't stay mad
at me even when you try.

896
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,440
When done
properly and consensually,

897
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,975
sex can be medicine.

898
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,264
Okay.

899
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,994
We know it reduces stress and
strengthens the immune system.

900
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,811
It even rejuvenates
your brain activity.

901
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,779
You know what I find super sexy?

902
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,715
Me.

903
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,317
I was gonna say "surprises,"

904
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,653
but, yeah, you.

905
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,672
But sex without connection
can leave you feeling empty.

906
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,908
So I, um...

907
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:40,078
I learned about the
erogenous zones today.

908
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:46,985
Did you know that there are
spots on your feet that, um...

909
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,322
Should I... stop?

910
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,424
It's just a foot rub, right?

911
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:57,396
Friendship, laughter,
simple human touch...

912
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:00,599
Done. Aah!

913
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,701
Again!

914
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,035
You're good at this.

915
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,937
I'm good at a lot of things.

916
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,773
These are stress relievers, too.

917
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,245
Because truly, it's
about connection.

918
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:29,628
When you're physically
close to another person...

919
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,065
Mmm.

920
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,801
It's just this once.

921
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,536
Agreed.

922
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,070
It's not happening again.

923
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,309
No feelings.

924
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:45,210
I don't even like you.

925
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,045
I'm not for everyone.

926
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,716
The nervous system responds...

927
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,991
the body is flooded with
feel-good hormones...

928
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:48,607
You should have taken
sex ed much sooner.

929
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,648
Head upstairs.

930
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,679
And everything else
just fades away.

931
