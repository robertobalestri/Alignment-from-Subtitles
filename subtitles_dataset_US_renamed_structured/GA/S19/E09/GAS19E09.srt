1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:02,992
<i>Every disease
has its unique course</i>

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:05,323
<i>it takes in the body
when left untreated.</i>

3
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:08,333
<i>The process begins with
exposure to a root cause</i>

4
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,251
<i>that sends a ripple effect
throughout the body.</i>

5
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,837
Simone, I didn't know,
okay? - No, sorry.

6
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,422
I-I-I can't do
the "I don't know"

7
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:15,882
story anymore.

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,383
You knew exactly
what was happening.

9
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,130
You <i>chose</i> not to see it.

10
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,642
Yeah, I guess moving to
Seattle hasn't changed

11
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,693
how quick you are
to point a finger.

12
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,802
Excuse me?

13
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,027
Well, you constantly assume
that I'm trying to hurt you...

14
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:27,565
No, you saw me come home from work
every night in tears. Okay. Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,178
You saw me almost throw
in the towel on my career.

16
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:33,167
You were too scared of tarnishing
your sterling reputation

17
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,912
to speak up for me!
I was an intern.

18
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:36,392
<i>The
disease then progresses,</i>

19
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,091
<i>ultimately resolving in one
of three possible outcomes...</i>

20
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,716
<i>You get better, you
stay chronically ill,</i>

21
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,826
They
kicked me out, Trey!

22
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,381
Oh, they've been
fighting nonstop

23
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,349
since he arrived last night.

24
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,468
Yeah, I heard.

25
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,958
I almost fell asleep
during rounds.

26
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,292
Well, maybe we should cancel.

27
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,378
Uh, we have an empty house.

28
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,796
We are having a party.

29
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:57,507
I don't care if he's her
ex-fiancÃ© or whatever.

30
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,092
Trey is the competition.

31
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,760
If they're fighting, it
means you're still in this.

32
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,429
Team Skywalker.

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,348
You two were half a second
away from boning last night.

34
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,976
The sexual tension was,
frankly, oppressive.

35
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:10,812
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to about it?

36
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:13,606
Mm, stop sulking and
tell her how you feel

37
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,234
so I don't have to look at
your sad, sad face all night.

38
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,028
<i>Surgeons swoop in once
a diagnosis is made</i>

39
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,822
<i>and the patient
needs reinforcements.</i>

40
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,282
<i>We take decisive action</i>

41
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,992
<i>in order to give them
a fighting chance.</i>

42
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,661
Ohh. I spent the
first half of the day

43
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,037
fending off requests for
comment...

44
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,372
on the death of Jermaine Talbott

45
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:30,832
and the other half

46
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,001
trying to get a grasp
on our budget deficits,

47
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,420
which are substantial,
by the way.

48
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,754
Well, they always are.

49
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,756
Oh, I am kicking myself

50
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,342
for inviting Bailey and
Warren to dinner tonight.

51
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:42,844
Makes two of us

52
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,848
especially because Allison
bit Pru again. What?

53
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,725
I was told when I picked
her up from daycare.

54
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:49,726
Why didn't you tell me?

55
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,437
I am. This is me telling you.

56
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,063
Wait. So, what... Is
this becoming a thing?

57
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,815
I mean, should we cancel
dinner? You know what?

58
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't... Don't answer that.

59
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,360
I knew I should have
picked up more wine.

60
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,904
I think Tuck is
building a fort with Pru,

61
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,365
so we're set...

62
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,242
unless you want to cancel
and just go to bed early.

63
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,119
We will do no such thing.

64
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,912
Yeah.

65
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,414
What's that?

66
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,082
Well, we can't show
up empty-handed.

67
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,834
Yeah, but what if it
sends the wrong message?

68
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,627
What message?
That we like pie?

69
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,296
Their daughter has now
bitten our daughter.

70
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:20,006
<i>Twice.</i>

71
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,007
It's a problem.

72
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,300
Do you remember the last time

73
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,845
that you and I had a
civilized, adult dinner

74
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,639
without children present?

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,100
Let's get out of here while we
still can. Mm-hmm.

76
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,855
Mr. Simms needs
neurochecks q two hours,

77
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,441
and Natalia Asaki was
just admitted for pre-op,

78
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,069
so coordinate with
Webber and Pierce.

79
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,862
Are you going to the party
tonight?

80
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,447
You look nice.

81
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,700
In an appropriate,
respectful way.

82
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,577
Just
try not to kill anyone.

83
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,332
So... I guess we're the
only ones stuck here

84
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,667
while everyone else gets drunk
and makes poor decisions.

85
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,544
I <i>hate</i> the ICU.

86
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,712
Oh, there's nothing to it.

87
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,006
Just try not to kill anyone.

88
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,467
Everyone has to
stop saying that.

89
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,052
Well, have fun.

90
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,553
While you're running codes,
I'll be on Pierce's service,

91
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,138
scrubbing in on her
Ivor Lewis procedure

92
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,139
in the morning.

93
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,101
Natalia Asaki?

94
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,102
I hate you.

95
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,561
Don't hate the player,

96
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,687
hate the game.

97
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:18,231
Okay, now I hate both.

98
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,565
Ew.

99
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,317
Uh, you know, I
haven't had a chance

100
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,778
to congratulate you on your
partial heart transplant.

101
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,613
Now, there's some
groundbreaking stuff.

102
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,657
We worked hard on
it. Thank you. Yeah.

103
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,075
Well, you keep this
up, you'll be in line

104
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,369
for a Catherine Fox Award.

105
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,704
And you and Winston sure do
make a great team.

106
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,832
Dr. Pierce...

107
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,874
I just wanted to say thank you

108
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,501
for allowing me to
scrub in tomorrow...

109
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,002
Uh, Dr. Pierce, Dr. Webber,

110
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,296
I have studied the Ivor
Lewis procedure extensively.

111
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,006
I know that the
major complications

112
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,968
are respiratory and
atrial arrhythmias,

113
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,804
which can be controlled
by amiodarone.

114
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,597
Well, this is an 8-hour surgery,

115
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,934
so if you're not too tired
after your overnight in the ICU,

116
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,186
you may <i>also</i> scrub in.

117
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,818
Who's a player now?

118
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,405
Natalia, Elliot.
Welcome to Seattle.

119
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:08,489
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

120
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,615
I hope your trip
from Coeur d'Alene

121
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,992
wasn't too bad.

122
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,286
I slept through most
of it, thanks to him.

123
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,621
And I'm highly
caffeinated right now.

124
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,789
Well, we're glad you made it.

125
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,249
Dr. Kwan?

126
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,793
Natalia Asaki, 32, stage
II esophageal cancer,

127
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,629
status post neoadjuvant
therapy, admitted for pre-op

128
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,798
for an Ivor Lewis procedure
first thing in the morning.

129
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,009
Which is? Uh,
resecting the esophagus

130
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,219
through an abdominal incision
and a right thoracotomy,

131
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,888
then pulling the
stomach into the chest

132
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,848
to replace the esophagus.

133
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,811
I'm sorry.

134
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,606
Amor, my painting sold.

135
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,483
The landscape from
our camping trip.

136
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,901
I love that one. Yeah.

137
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,277
How much?

138
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:47,321
$500.

139
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,826
She's an art teacher at
an after-school program,

140
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,912
but she sells her own
pieces on the side.

141
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,080
I'm sorry, but the
past couple of months

142
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:01,000
of chemo and radiation were...

143
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,877
not the most fun I've ever had.

144
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,295
We're ready to put
this chapter behind us.

145
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,505
Well, let's get a move on.

146
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,923
Okay, Kwan, Millin,

147
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,966
let's start Natalia's
pre-op work-up...

148
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,469
Bloodwork, EKG, chest X-ray.

149
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,097
Um, I definitely need all
that before the surgery?

150
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,600
You do. We will
be back in a bit.

151
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,935
Babe, don't worry.

152
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,269
We'll figure out a
way to pay for it.

153
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,521
It's okay.

154
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,106
Oh, it's my fault?!

155
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,274
Look, I hate that
they kicked you out.

156
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,275
Alright? I really hate it.

157
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,485
I promise you, I hate it more.

158
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,445
Oh, still so competitive.

159
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,413
Ah.

160
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,500
Hey.

161
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,919
Come here.

162
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,513
Trey, I was broken.

163
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:59,893
I-I felt... broken.

164
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,107
But I am sorry that
I disappeared on you.

165
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,484
I'm sorry. I should
have chased after you.

166
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,611
I wanted to. I should have.

167
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,030
I mean, you kinda
did. You're here.

168
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,908
I feel like I waited too long.

169
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,370
Did I wait too long?

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,376
Can we just go to the
party and try to have fun?

171
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,346
I missed you.

172
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,390
I missed you.

173
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,504
Ben, Bailey. Enter at your
own risk.

174
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,215
Ooh, come on in. Oooh, look
at that. Mm-hmm. Apple pie.

175
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,134
My mother's recipe.

176
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,219
Maybe you can think of
it when you are approving

177
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,096
budget requests for the clinic.

178
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,639
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

179
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,141
Hey, I heard there were some
fires down in south Seattle.

180
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,185
You been on those?
Uh, no, no, no.

181
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:26,896
Uh, we have a little girl now,
so I sit the crazy stuff out.

182
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,939
That
never stopped Owen.

183
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,733
Ah, please excuse her.

184
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,443
She's exhausted after
one day of the job

185
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:33,779
that you and I did for years.

186
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,863
Wine?

187
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:36,864
Uh, by wine, can
you mean bourbon?

188
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:37,865
Good idea.

189
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,200
Yeah.

190
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,494
Cheese and crackers are
on the coffee table.

191
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,495
- Oh.
- Oh, fantastic.

192
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,913
I'd love a <i>bite.</i>

193
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,793
Chest X-ray is normal.

194
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,212
Coags, CBC, CMP all look good.

195
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,047
Oh, great. Let's start
her on her bowel prep...

196
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,090
Help!

197
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,676
I was just
finishing her EKG,

198
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,052
and she started seizing.

199
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,261
Okay, well, let's
get her on her side.

200
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,805
Blood glucose was normal,
so it can't be that.

201
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:02,223
And her sats are 92 on room air.

202
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,349
I checked her airway.
There's no vomit.

203
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,975
Let's get some suction
in here, anyway.

204
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,853
Elliot, does she have a history
of epilepsy or alcohol abuse?

205
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,313
No, never. What's going on?

206
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,023
We don't know, but we
are going to find out.

207
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,317
Let's load her up with
Keppra and lorazepam.

208
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,361
A-And, Kwan, take Elliot
out and page neuro.

209
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,779
- Let's hurry.
- I love you, Natalia.

210
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,114
It's okay.

211
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,493
Yeah, my place is definitely
a work in progress,

212
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:25,496
so you have to promise not to
judge me when you get here.

213
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:27,289
<i>Okay, is there a door?</i>

214
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,499
There is.

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,750
<i>Alright. A bed?</i>

216
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,960
Uh-huh. No duvet
cover, though.

217
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:34,046
<i>No! Well, that's
it. I'm canceling.</i>

218
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,172
Okay, uh, crap.

219
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,298
I got to go.

220
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,716
I'll see you tomorrow. <i>Okay.</i>

221
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,093
Oh, hey.

222
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,428
You are still here. Awesome.

223
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,430
Uh, would you take
Scout for a bit?

224
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,931
I was on my way home with him,

225
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,726
and I just got paged for a
consult on a grand mal seizure.

226
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,018
Well, I was on my way home,

227
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,895
and I got egged by a
couple of angry Tank fans.

228
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,021
Seriously?

229
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:52,440
Based on how tonight's going,

230
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,317
I could, uh, use some
time with my only fan.

231
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,777
Okay. It
should not take long.

232
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,237
You have fun with Daddy, okay?

233
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,741
Mwah! Bye.

234
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,368
Can anyone help me?! Gahhhh!

235
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:05,536
Uh... Please, I need help.

236
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,912
I-I-I'm a surgeon.

237
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,164
At least for now.

238
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,582
Here. Here. Here.

239
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,917
My stupid wife promised
she'd be back from trial

240
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,003
<i>before</i> I went into
labor.

241
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,171
I take it that didn't happen?

242
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,714
Aah! Oh, okay. Alright.

243
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:17,965
Just... Just breathe.

244
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,800
Uh, I'll... I'll page OB.

245
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,010
It... Oh, thank God.

246
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,678
Hi. So sorry.

247
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,721
Hi. You must be Whitney.

248
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,097
Okay, let's get you upstairs.

249
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,307
Thank you, Dr. Lincoln.

250
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:27,641
I can take it from here.

251
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,602
Okay. I can't let
go. I can't let go.

252
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,854
I'm sorry, but my anxiety
hovers around an 8

253
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:32,980
when I'm <i>not</i> in labor.

254
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,692
You mind if I bring a plus-one?

255
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:37,444
It... It's fine by me.

256
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,569
Sure. Yeah.

257
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,279
Okay, okay. Gahhhhh!

258
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,989
Okay.

259
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,949
Okay, let's do this.

260
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,996
âª I go to Mars in my head âª
[ Cheers and laughter ]

261
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:50,247
Levi.

262
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,041
Push one of... Levi!

263
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:55,044
One of epi and atropine. Hey!

264
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,629
Oh, sorry.

265
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,214
You need to get laid.

266
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,882
Like, badly.

267
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,175
And you cannot get laid

268
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,968
if you're the guy
sleeping at the party.

269
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,095
I just worked a 16-hour shift,

270
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:06,889
and alcohol is a
depressant.

271
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,974
You want to know what time
I got up this morning?

272
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,975
Noon.

273
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,393
I shouldn't even be here.

274
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,020
Like it or not, I
am a manager now,

275
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,522
and boundaries are important.

276
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,273
You're where fun goes to die.

277
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:17,775
âª So I'm gonna make
him proud in the end âª

278
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,377
Hey. You came.

279
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,028
Nice house.

280
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,404
Yeah, Levi and I
live in a studio.

281
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,906
This place has rooms.

282
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,616
A few weeks ago, I
was living in a van,

283
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,576
and I thought that
was nice.

284
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,537
Dr. Schmitt. Yasuda.

285
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,456
Good booze is over here.

286
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,457
Find someone to talk to.

287
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,251
Oh. Anyone.

288
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:36,211
âª And I start reverting back âª

289
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,628
H...

290
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,089
âª I start reverting
back now, honey âª

291
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,800
âª Swap my happiness
for checks âª

292
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:44,802
It's good out here.
Yeah, actually, it is.

293
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,262
You mind getting us some drinks?

294
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,429
Uh, your usual? Yeah.

295
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,390
Coming right up.

296
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,723
Hey.

297
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:52,101
âª Forget âª
Okay.

298
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:53,519
Can we talk?

299
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,981
I don't know if, uh,
now is the best time.

300
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,941
Look, I-I am sorry
about last night.

301
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:03,612
Trey showing up
was... unexpected.

302
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:04,947
Does he know about you and I?

303
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,699
No, of course not.

304
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,536
A whiskey
ginger.

305
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,080
You remember last
New Year's Eve?

306
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,916
Might have went a
little hard on the whiskey gingers.

307
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,543
Might not have made
it to midnight.

308
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,003
Rookie move.

309
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:21,088
Yeah, she kept giving the finger
to every stranger walking by,

310
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,882
saying, "Let's send
last year to hell."

311
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,258
At least I
had the right holiday.

312
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,345
âª Is going to die âª

313
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,600
So, new-onset grand mal
seizure? - Yep.

314
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,769
Stage II adenocarcinoma
of the esophagus,

315
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,897
had chemoradiation
two months ago,

316
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,356
scheduled for surgery tomorrow.

317
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:42,902
Kwan, what are the possible
causes of new-onset seizures?

318
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,195
Meningitis, encephalitis,
alcohol withdrawal,

319
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,197
stroke, hyponatremia, or...

320
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:48,824
Mm.

321
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,744
Natalia's esophageal cancer
metastasized to her brain.

322
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,414
Most likely a localized met
in the right temporal lobe.

323
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,916
And it's bleeding.

324
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,500
Damn it.

325
00:11:58,501 --> 00:11:59,836
<i>What happened?</i>

326
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,338
Am I okay?

327
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,450
Natalia, your CT scan shows

328
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,640
a possible metastasis
in your brain.

329
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,892
We'll need to excise
it immediately.

330
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:16,977
What about the surgery
we came here for?

331
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:19,355
I am so sorry that this is
not the news that you wanted,

332
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:22,566
but we have to do this
surgery as soon as possible.

333
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,569
I can't
believe this is happening.

334
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,612
Could you just give us a minute?

335
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,905
Of course.

336
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,574
We'll be back with
consent forms.

337
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:39,375
You know... you might as well
go home and get some rest.

338
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,585
I have no place better to be.

339
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,795
You sure? Yeah, yeah.

340
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,339
Give Catherine my best.

341
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,349
Okay, Whitney, you are
6 centimeters dilated.

342
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,976
You are having this baby.

343
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,519
No one really tells you
how much this hurts.

344
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,980
Mother... Oh, sorry.

345
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,815
I'll try not to... Holy crap!

346
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,941
He's heard worse. Trust me.

347
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,901
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are

348
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,028
that you didn't push your
son's watermelon body

349
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,447
out of your teeny tiny vagina?!

350
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,201
I-I don't have a
teeny tiny vagina.

351
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,161
But if it
makes you feel any better,

352
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,414
I am so hated by the city
of Seattle right now,

353
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:21,625
I can't walk outside without
getting literal egg on my face.

354
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,253
No. Yes, I'm
officially in hiding.

355
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,754
That actually does make
me feel a little better.

356
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,298
Gahhhhh. Okay,
Whitney. Just breathe.

357
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,299
Yeah.

358
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,262
What?

359
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,471
Well, when I first
heard you were living

360
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,432
with a bunch of interns in
a house with fire damage,

361
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,641
I was kinda scared for you.

362
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:38,726
Oh, hard same.

363
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:42,205
They seem cool.

364
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,939
Even though they're
not quite your caliber.

365
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,151
No. Don't judge my people.

366
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,652
Oh, they're your people now?

367
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,612
I mean... yeah.
They kinda are.

368
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:51,947
Come on.

369
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,102
Now, you were the
top of your class

370
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,533
in every class
you've ever been in.

371
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,285
And you're top tier.

372
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,454
I'm sorry, but these?

373
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,247
These are not your people.
Trey, I swear to God, we just...

374
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,124
No, no, no, you're only mad
because you know it's true.

375
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,293
Grey-Sloan isn't the
program it used to be,

376
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,627
and you don't belong here.

377
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,213
You belong with me, at the top.

378
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,923
And if you present your
case and you come back...

379
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,759
Present my case? and you
stay calm and collected...

380
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,511
Oh, wow. Look, we could
have it all back, Simone.

381
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,014
We could have us back. We
could have our future back.

382
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,098
These are not your people.

383
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,391
Baby, <i>I'm</i> your people.

384
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,517
I'm walking away, Trey.

385
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,227
And I promise if
you walk after me,

386
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,188
I won't remain
calm and collected.

387
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,355
- Come on.
- No!

388
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:26,149
Simone. No!

389
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,608
Sorry.

390
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,360
âª I've been dreaming âª

391
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,987
You think this is hard?

392
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:34,281
Tuck spent 45 minutes in the
bathroom the other morning. Mm.

393
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:35,604
45, alright?

394
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:36,701
You know what he was doing?

395
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,285
Do we want to know?

396
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,411
He was shaving.

397
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,871
Sorry. Sorry.

398
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,206
Manscaping.

399
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,332
His chest.

400
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,561
He's going out
for the swim team.

401
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,709
Ah.

402
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,169
I mean, Pru might
be a threenager,

403
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,796
but at least she doesn't
hog the bathroom.

404
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,088
She's been angling for a dog.

405
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,089
Aww.

406
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,382
Oh, that's all we need, right?

407
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,927
You know,
little puppy teeth

408
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,304
nipping at her fingers and toes.

409
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,808
Mm.
You know, here we are,

410
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,184
kid-free, finally,

411
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,936
and we're still talking
about kids.

412
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,395
Right, who wants to
talk about adult stuff?

413
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,814
I do. Okay.

414
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,482
Uh, Bailey, how's the clinic?

415
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,234
Mm, busy.

416
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,736
We can hardly keep
up with the demand.

417
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:16,114
Uh, how's the...
medical license?

418
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,617
Still suspended, but,
you know, getting there.

419
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,827
Is it?

420
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,247
Do you want to help
me in the kitchen?

421
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,642
I can't. No license, so...

422
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,584
I can help
you with something. Ah.

423
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:28,752
No, no, no, no,
no. Don't be silly.

424
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,087
Teddy's got it, right?

425
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:31,380
Right. Mm.

426
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,968
So, uh...

427
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,386
should we go back to
talking about kids?

428
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,643
It'll be okay. Babe.

429
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,303
It'll be okay.

430
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,105
I'll start driving on the
rideshare app. Babe.

431
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,940
And if you need another
surgery after that,

432
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,984
I'll take on more guitar
students or... Amor.

433
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,486
Stop!

434
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,616
Uh, Natalia, Elliot.

435
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:02,244
This is the consent form

436
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:05,706
identifying the risks
of the procedure.

437
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,584
They say I could die, right?

438
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,923
If I die...

439
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,270
How deep in the hole are you?

440
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,729
During the pandemic, they
made us both part-time.

441
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,982
We just got the only health
insurance we could afford,

442
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:34,526
and we thought we
were gonna be fine,

443
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:38,155
but now we're buried in
debt, and I'm gonna die

444
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:42,367
and leave the love of my
life poor and homeless.

445
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,286
You two should get a divorce.

446
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:46,831
That's not funny.

447
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,874
No, and it wasn't meant to be.

448
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,169
Dr. Kwan, please step outside. No,
medical divorce is a real thing.

449
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,463
It could help Elliot not get
saddled by Natalia's debt.

450
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:57,090
It could help Natalia to qualify
for more insurance or aid,

451
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:58,258
since they won't
have a joint income.

452
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,385
And if they have assets,
it could protect them.

453
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,763
Wait.

454
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,141
That's brilliant.

455
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,060
What? Babe.

456
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,686
No, you're my <i>wife.</i>

457
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:13,565
Dr. Kwan, I'd like a
word. Outside, please.

458
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,027
Now. I'm not divorcing
the woman I love.

459
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,824
I said do not follow me!

460
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,535
Are you okay?

461
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:26,995
Do I look okay?

462
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,790
Um, well, you
look...

463
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,960
Well, you look perfect.

464
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:36,005
What? To me, you kinda
always look perfect.

465
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,093
And maybe my timing isn't great,

466
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,762
but I need to say that
even when you're upset,

467
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,641
you are... pretty
damn perfect.

468
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,601
Lucas... You're so smart.

469
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,271
And when you get
mad, you get smarter.

470
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,814
Like, when you get mad 'cause
you can't figure out a case...

471
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,607
that's when you figure it out.

472
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,234
So, right now... Now
you look like a person

473
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:03,054
who's about to...
solve a big mystery.

474
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,994
Like a person who's gonna...

475
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,494
figure everything out.

476
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,959
âª I believe I've
seen a ghost âª

477
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,838
âª And I don't know who it is âª

478
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,217
âª It just follows me around âª

479
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:26,138
âª Pretending to exist âª

480
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:30,350
âª I've never related more âª

481
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:38,351
âª To anything or
anyone before âª

482
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:46,241
âª I can't explain it âª

483
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,626
Simone, can
I come in? No.

484
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:58,628
Baby, baby, I'm... I'm
sorry for what I said, okay?

485
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,213
I-I love you. I-I'm sorry.

486
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,631
I just... I'm trying
to get this right,

487
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:03,133
and I keep getting it wrong.

488
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:04,718
Baby. Baby, please.

489
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,054
Trey, can you just
give me a minute, okay?

490
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:08,347
Can we talk later? No.

491
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,724
I-I've never loved anyone
the way that I love you.

492
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,101
Look, I can't see my
life with anyone else.

493
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:14,603
I-I know I'm a snob.

494
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,854
I know I'm an ass.

495
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,607
But I'll... I'll be better.

496
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,525
'Cause you make me better.

497
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,653
Trey, I'm...

498
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,739
I'm tired. I just
need a few minutes.

499
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,907
Okay.

500
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:28,367
I'll come find you.

501
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,285
I love you.

502
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:35,874
âª To anything or
anyone before âª

503
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,959
Okay.

504
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,544
We were engaged. We
had a whole life.

505
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,254
He knows my family.

506
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:42,923
My dad loves him. My
grandmother loves him.

507
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,174
He's... Do you love him?

508
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:47,302
âª Politely, I asked,
"Are you real?" âª

509
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,390
Yeah, 'cause if you
love him, you should...

510
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,183
Yeah, you should go talk to him.

511
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,185
âª It said, "Here,
let me prove it" âª

512
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,728
Are you serious? Yeah, no.

513
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,105
If you love him, you should...

514
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:01,108
you
should fight for him.

515
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,530
Now you're...

516
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:08,740
pushing me toward him?

517
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,450
Hey, I'm not pushing you.

518
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:14,162
âª "Don't kill the
messenger," it begged âª

519
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,957
I'm saying, do you love him?

520
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,835
âª "You're alive" âª

521
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,503
Yeah, okay. I'm gonna go.

522
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:23,004
âª "Quit acting
like you're dead" âª

523
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,214
I'm... I'm so... I'm
so... Hey, hey, hey.

524
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:26,341
Don't say you're sorry.

525
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,343
âª Like a mirror... âª

526
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,719
We're good.

527
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,806
âª ...it spoke so clear âª

528
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,558
âª "Don't you recognize..." âª

529
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,934
Lucas, wait.

530
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,330
âª "...the reason
why you're here?" âª

531
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:41,356
Can y... Before
you open the door,

532
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,567
can I just make sure
he's not out there?

533
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,153
âª "To be enchanted" âª

534
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:55,287
Yeah, okay. Now you
can say you're sorry.

535
00:20:55,288 --> 00:21:00,333
âª "To be enchanted" âª

536
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,412
What happened in there? Do you have any
idea how crushing medical debt can be

537
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,553
for people who
aren't millionaires?

538
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:13,138
Of course I do.

539
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,474
But before you cross
a line with a patient,

540
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,809
you have to talk to
an attending first.

541
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,186
I could have called
financial services

542
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,730
or a social worker or
a pastor or a therapist

543
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:25,400
or someone who is trained to
have that kind of conversation.

544
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,818
Her brain is bleeding.

545
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:27,861
They don't have that kind
of time to go through...

546
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:30,947
You had time to talk to me.

547
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:33,492
Now her brain is bleeding and
she's fighting with her husband.

548
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,576
And that is not an improvement,

549
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:36,244
and it has not
saved us any time.

550
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:37,662
She is my patient.

551
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,664
You are here at my invitation.

552
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,607
Is that understood?

553
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,628
Okay, Dr. Kwan.

554
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,922
The invitation is rescinded.

555
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,007
And let's hope she
signs that consent form

556
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,843
that'll allow us
to save her life.

557
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:58,183
Alright, what
is that one, again?

558
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,435
I don't know. Let's see.

559
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,316
Bourbon. With...

560
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,525
Bourbon. Bourbon.

561
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,360
Uh, I might have
drank from that.

562
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,861
Don't care.

563
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:12,762
- Hey.
- Hey.

564
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:15,033
âª Maybe this will be the song I
hear, when it all goes wrong âª

565
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,159
This is Taryn.

566
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,827
She was a surgeon,
but followed sanity

567
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:19,162
and became a bartender.

568
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:23,124
And this is Trey.
He might like crabs.

569
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,126
- He's from Baltimore.
- Yeah.

570
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,878
Um, I'm visiting Simone.

571
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,296
So, uh, how'd you two meet?

572
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:29,297
Uh, med school.

573
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:30,549
Physiology class.

574
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,050
I'd sit on the opposite
side of the lecture hall

575
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,302
Yeah.

576
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:36,346
I hooked up with a girl in
my physiology class, too.

577
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:37,597
Oh, cool.

578
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,891
Not my story. Not my story.

579
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,352
Oh, you're not
getting off that easy.

580
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:44,980
Uh, I was home sick one day.
Didn't show up to class.

581
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:48,108
Trey spent the entire day
cooking his mom's famous soup,

582
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,527
brought it to my apartment
with notes from class,

583
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:52,737
told me he liked my smile.

584
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,573
I told him I'm not
really a soup person,

585
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,116
but clutch on the notes.

586
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:57,450
And just like that,
I was in love.

587
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,828
Wow, Griffith. You
missed a class?

588
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,083
You want to get some
air? Yeah, sure.

589
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,252
âª I'm not living, I'm
just killing time, time âª

590
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,422
Do you want to go see the
hole in the roof? Yes.

591
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,548
Yeah? Yeah.

592
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,049
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

593
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,634
âª Suffocating on
my own supply âª

594
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:27,772
âª Caught up in the tangle
of your lives, lives âª

595
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,357
âª Suffocating on
my own supply âª

596
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,609
Party that bad?

597
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,779
No, I'm just, uh,
bad at... at this.

598
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,448
At parties? Yes.

599
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,199
And people.

600
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,411
I'm not even that drunk,
so I'm also bad at alcohol?

601
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,123
I'm Carlos. Traveling nurse.

602
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,499
Uh, I'm only here
for a couple months,

603
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,251
but here's the thing...

604
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,753
Levi. Here's the thing, Levi.

605
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,380
If you leave, you won't
get to hang out with me.

606
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,634
You... You brought
your own drinks.

607
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,260
Oh, I work way too hard

608
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,471
to drink whatever surgical
interns can afford.

609
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,139
âª Get my mind in line âª

610
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,682
âª Submissive till the
day I die âª 

611
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,309
âª I'll detach... âª

612
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:13,109
Um, Altman, did you have a
chance to look at those rÃ©sumÃ©s?

613
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,695
Oh. Um, no. Not yet.

614
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:16,696
Which rÃ©sumÃ©s?

615
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,448
Uh, for chief of trauma.

616
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,867
There are some excellent
candidates in there.

617
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:23,453
Oh, um, I think you mean
"interim" chief of trauma.

618
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:24,788
No, she doesn't.

619
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,210
You literally just promised
me my job back yesterday.

620
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,629
I... didn't know that. Mm. Mm.

621
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,715
But it turns out hiring a
decent <i>interim</i> chief of trauma

622
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:38,134
is harder than hiring
a permanent one.

623
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:40,053
Seriously? Oh.

624
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:41,721
Look, if I have to
wait for your license,

625
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,515
I-I need to consider my options.

626
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,059
Okay, so
when were you gonna tell me?

627
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,727
This is me telling you. Mm.

628
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,312
Y... Now that I think about it,

629
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,314
the candidates weren't
that <i>great,</i> just...

630
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:52,524
You know what, Owen?

631
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,734
Maybe if you had asked
me how my day was,

632
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:56,152
this would've come up earlier.

633
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:57,862
Been there.

634
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,447
I don't think they were
asking our opinion.

635
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,116
You know, like it or
not, you can barely

636
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:02,701
practice medicine
right now, anyway.

637
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,787
Do you know who practices the
least amount of medicine, Teddy?

638
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:06,955
The chief of surgery.

639
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:09,207
This is a business decision.

640
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,877
Just grow up and deal with it.

641
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,601
My wife wants a divorce.

642
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:38,403
We said... "'til
death do us part."

643
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,196
I'm so sorry.

644
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:42,366
I can only imagine how
you're feeling right now.

645
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,371
Everything's been always so...

646
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:52,125
easy with her.

647
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,710
I still think the
biggest fight we ever had

648
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:56,129
was over refilling
the water pitcher.

649
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:06,015
Most of us can only dream
of having a love like that.

650
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,352
I'm just saying that,

651
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:13,129
if you trusted her
enough to marry her,

652
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:17,150
why not trust her
enough to un-marry her?

653
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,152
Don't make it mean
something it doesn't.

654
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:22,697
She loves you and she
wants to protect you.

655
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:27,285
So maybe just... let her.

656
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,685
I didn't
know what kind of flowers

657
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:53,604
to get for our divorce,

658
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,438
but turns out,

659
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,606
you can't have them in the ICU,

660
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,818
so fake ones it is.

661
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,737
This is Aaron, uh,

662
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:04,113
one of the hospital lawyers

663
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:05,907
who's nice enough
to help us pro bono.

664
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:07,700
Fortunately, the
divorce petition's

665
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,827
rather simple for you two.

666
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,037
No kids, no owned property,

667
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,038
no assets.

668
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,957
Once you sign, I
will file a copy

669
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,917
with the court in
Idaho immediately.

670
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,670
I just need you
both to sign there.

671
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,841
It feels like we're
getting married again.

672
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,620
Amor, I promise to love
you until my dying breath.

673
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:40,358
Whether
it's in a few minutes,

674
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,361
days, or years.

675
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,991
I promise that my love for you

676
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:49,909
will only grow in divorce

677
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,203
like it has in marriage.

678
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,499
And I promise you to keep trying

679
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,543
to refill the water pitcher.

680
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,465
I am the luckiest
girl in the world

681
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,967
to be divorcing you.

682
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:10,430
Natalia, as your ex-husband...

683
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,809
I promise to be there for you

684
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,438
in good times and in bad.

685
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:21,858
In sickness and in health.

686
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,653
I promise to treat
each day as a gift.

687
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:27,030
And
I promise to love you

688
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,449
for every moment of every day

689
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,159
for the rest of
our lives together.

690
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,481
I've
witnessed several weddings

691
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:02,982
in hospital rooms,

692
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:05,610
but this is definitely
the first divorce.

693
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:11,783
Okay.

694
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,035
Um, I'm ready.

695
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:18,039
It's okay.

696
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,346
Mnh. Unh-unh.

697
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,847
I changed my mind.
I can't do it.

698
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,848
Yes, you can, Whitney.

699
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,016
You are doing great.

700
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:39,060
I have a brother who's not well,

701
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,311
ruined my parents' lives.

702
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,562
So sorry to hear that.

703
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,356
I told my wife that
I was scared our kid

704
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:44,357
would get my brother's genes.

705
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,900
You know what she said?

706
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,944
"We don't have that
in our family."

707
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:49,362
And I just accepted that?!

708
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
You know what, Whitney?

709
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,909
Hey, you're right. Alright?

710
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,994
The world is a terrifying,
mostly awful place,

711
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,663
and you can't choose your kids.

712
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,665
Tell me something to
make me feel better.

713
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,792
When I look at my son
drooling in the corner,

714
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,335
he gives me hope.

715
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,047
Pure, blind, probably
irrational hope.

716
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,966
He gives me a reason
to put my fears aside

717
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,468
and believe that
everything might be okay.

718
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,642
So, traveling doesn't
get old for you?

719
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:22,353
No way. Uh, I'm a Sagittarius.

720
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,313
I'm, um...

721
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:25,314
Jewish.

722
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,694
Ah, smart, funny, and a doctor.

723
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,696
Mm.

724
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,823
The dying wish of
Hilda Narvaez Garcia.

725
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,491
My mother.

726
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,784
Oh, I'm so sorry.

727
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:37,994
Oh, no, she's still alive.

728
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:40,204
She's just very dramatic
about my love life.

729
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,498
Does she
cut out magazine articles

730
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:43,833
and comment on
your sock choices?

731
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,501
Yes! Yes!

732
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:49,297
Plus, a whole lot more
which I will not tell you

733
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,215
because I want you to
pick up my call one day.

734
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,598
That was me asking
for your number.

735
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,849
I... Oh, I...

736
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,850
Maybe we can go someplace

737
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,560
where they bring drinks to you.

738
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,103
Like, um, I know this
place downtown...

739
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:05,688
Yes.

740
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,025
You know, when I was chief,

741
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,151
at least I paid my co-workers

742
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,111
the respect of
full transparency.

743
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,529
Oh, please. When
you were chief,

744
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,364
the hospital almost went under.

745
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:16,741
Oh, wait. It kinda did.

746
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,493
That was not my fault.

747
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:21,120
When you're chief,
<i>everything</i> is your fault.

748
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:22,789
That's why I can't
have a chief of trauma

749
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,290
with a suspended
medical license!

750
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,792
Oh, just say it again, Teddy.

751
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,084
We having fun yet?

752
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,379
You wanna know why
Allison is biting kids?

753
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,298
Because her dad is a man-child

754
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,925
who can't control his tantrums!

755
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,384
Yeah, well, she's not
old enough to drink,

756
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:36,886
so she can't take after her mom!

757
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:40,181
Okay, enough! Ugh,
this won't work.

758
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:42,433
Altman, you are the
chief now, officially.

759
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,978
And this is just
poor leadership.

760
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,355
Okay, whatever happened
between the two of you

761
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:49,023
needs to be fixed

762
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:52,693
because, yes, now your child
is biting other people.

763
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,153
You said biting happens.

764
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,363
It does.

765
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,782
But you two constantly
biting each other

766
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,701
with your sharp
words and nasty looks

767
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,412
and rage at all
times isn't helping.

768
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,997
Pretty soon, that rage of yours

769
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,624
is going to infect
the entire hospital

770
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,376
and we'll all be
biting at each other

771
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:10,670
like zombies or cannibals!

772
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:14,048
So for all of our
sakes, get some help.

773
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,049
Ben, get the pie.

774
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,095
Okay.

775
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,145
Oh, maybe we should have
people over more often.

776
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,060
Bite me.

777
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,396
<i>Dr. Newton.
Dr. Erica Newton to trauma two.</i>

778
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,649
<i>Dr. Newton to trauma two.</i>

779
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,442
Thanks for pissing off Pierce.

780
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,403
I've never scrubbed in on
a craniotomy. Have fun.

781
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:37,822
She gave me like a week's worth
of progress notes to review.

782
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,073
Just apologize.

783
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,324
Tell her you screwed up.

784
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,909
I don't apologize
unless I'm wrong.

785
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,244
Now, can you go scrub
in on the surgery

786
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:46,622
that you basically
stole so I can focus?

787
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:55,381
Okay,
Whitney, it's time to push.

788
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:57,425
One, two, three.

789
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:58,634
Gahhhhhhh!

790
00:32:58,635 --> 00:33:05,141
âª You said some things
you didn't mean âª

791
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:10,688
âª I lost my nerve
in the disbelief âª

792
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:17,320
âª I'm gonna take my heart
out and wipe it clean âª

793
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,947
âª I hope it saves me âª

794
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:23,075
âª My hope is weak âª

795
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:26,329
âª And I have run
towards the cliff âª

796
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,916
âª I've fallen into the blue âª

797
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,877
âª But don't try to stop me âª

798
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,796
âª 'Cause I'm in recovery âª

799
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,716
âª Light me a fire,
I'll step too close âª

800
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,344
âª I'll learn to
let go of you âª

801
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,095
Okay, Whitney, one last push.

802
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,932
One, two, three.

803
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,725
Gahhhh!

804
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:50,937
âª And I
have run towards the cliff âª

805
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,690
âª I've fallen into the blue âª

806
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:57,777
âª But don't try to stop me âª

807
00:33:57,778 --> 00:33:59,987
âª 'Cause I'm in recovery âª

808
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:02,073
Hi, stranger.

809
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:06,744
Oh! Oh!

810
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:15,920
âª You're losing grip âª

811
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:19,924
âª I feel release âª

812
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,886
Simone, look, I
meant what I said...

813
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,429
I'll come here if
that's what it takes.

814
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,473
Your family would
never forgive you.

815
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,558
Maybe not. They're snobs.

816
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,352
They're such snobs.

817
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,649
I'll tell you what, though.

818
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,065
They get that I don't
want to lose you.

819
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,441
I have to fight for you.

820
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,852
Whatever it takes.

821
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,778
Our program treated
me like human garbage.

822
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,239
And tonight you suggested

823
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,992
that if I had just
stayed calm and collected

824
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:47,743
and continued to suck it
up, that I might have...

825
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,370
- No, I didn't say that.
- I-I didn't.

826
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:50,538
I hate the way they treated you.

827
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:51,706
I just miss you, okay?

828
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,791
I miss you.

829
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,793
I hate sleeping without you.

830
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,336
Nothing's fun without you.

831
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:59,255
âª Oh, baby, I
miss you so much âª

832
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:01,674
When I left, I was a mess,
and it was easier for me

833
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,551
to leave the whole
chapter behind me.

834
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,636
But I spent so many nights...

835
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,179
âª And I'll begin,
don't touch me now âª

836
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,141
wishing you'd show
up on my doorstep.

837
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,517
What changed?

838
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:14,145
âª And this is springtime âª

839
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,856
Nothing.

840
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:20,234
Nothing's changed.

841
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,617
Trey.

842
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,661
Simone Audrey Griffith,
I've loved you

843
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,247
since the day I met you and...
And every single day since.

844
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,749
âª I've fallen into the blue âª

845
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,792
You're
my favorite person.

846
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,336
You're my North Star.

847
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,629
Alright, you're my past
and you're my future.

848
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,090
Baby, put your ring
back on and marry me.

849
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:44,842
Marry
me for real this time.

850
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,261
âª I'll learn to
let go of you âª

851
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:49,764
âª But don't try to stop me âª

852
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:50,931
Yeah? Yeah.

853
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:52,600
Yeah? Yes, yes, yes.

854
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,686
âª Don't try to stop me âª

855
00:35:56,813 --> 00:36:02,778
âª 'Cause I'm in recovery âª

856
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:12,036
Your pie was the best thing
that happened tonight, hands down.

857
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,833
In fairness,
the bar was very low.

858
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,834
You gonna tell me
what this is about,

859
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:20,712
or are you gonna make
me drag it out of you?

860
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:24,759
The resentment.

861
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:28,636
I've been sensing it on
you for a while now and...

862
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:32,223
I can smell it
on you like cheap cologne.

863
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:34,433
Yeah, well, my cologne <i>is</i>
cheap, so maybe it's just that.

864
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:37,104
I do not want to end up
like Hunt and Altman.

865
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,735
Before you went to work,
we were doing so well.

866
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:48,197
Wait... I
know you're not saying

867
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,366
you resent me
going back to work.

868
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,701
I do.

869
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,787
I don't know what I expected,

870
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:56,205
but it wasn't that.

871
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,915
Look, I am aware that
I sound like an ass.

872
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,083
I'm working on it.

873
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,793
And I hate myself
for even saying it,

874
00:37:00,794 --> 00:37:02,962
but I-I've never done
this before, Miranda.

875
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,005
I've never parented
a little girl.

876
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,091
A-And Pru's lost so
much in her life.

877
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,260
I just... I worry, you know,

878
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,804
that... that I'm
not doing it right.

879
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:14,306
And I... I miss you.

880
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:16,517
Okay, I know starting
up this clinic

881
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,102
has been a big undertaking,

882
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,939
but I <i>am</i> prioritizing
our family...

883
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,525
I mean, I'm limiting
my hours in the OR,

884
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,485
I'm barely taking weekend calls,

885
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:28,112
I'm... I'm delegating
to Wilson...

886
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,324
But now you're saying
that isn't enough?

887
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:38,539
Can we please just go home now?

888
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,332
God, yes.

889
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,050
This is sad.

890
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:53,846
I can fix it.

917
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:01,914
It's kinda a weird
breakfast, but, uh...

918
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,209
Here.

919
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,336
Thank you.

920
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:09,338
For, um...

921
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,006
everything.

922
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,183
Kwan?

923
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,434
Kwan.

924
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:25,020
I explicitly took you
off of Natalia's case.

925
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:26,021
Okay, look.

926
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,565
You want me to pretend that

927
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,608
medical bills don't exist?

928
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,235
That the system
doesn't force people

929
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,778
to choose between
bankruptcy and death?

930
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,989
Dr. Kwan, that... If my
mom could've divorced me,

931
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,407
she would've done
it in a heartbeat,

932
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,742
but I opened up credit
cards to pay for her care,

933
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,578
and every time I get a bill,

934
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,122
it feels like a
noose around my neck.

935
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:44,957
Forgive me for not wanting

936
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,459
to put someone
else through that.

937
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:50,754
Dr. Kwan, I...

938
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:57,511
Um...

939
00:39:57,512 --> 00:39:58,930
How'd it go last night?

940
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:02,046
Is everything okay?

941
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,185
Nothing is okay.
Everyone is in pain.

942
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,145
Maggie, what's going on?

943
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,149
When you and Catherine were

944
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,150
going through your rough patch

945
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:12,985
where you couldn't, um,

946
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:15,154
speak to each other
without fighting,

947
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,989
how did you know that it
was just a rough patch

948
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,824
and it wasn't something more...

949
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,200
malignant?

950
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:26,332
Well, I think with...
With Catherine, uh,

951
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:31,170
we always still had the
love underneath it all.

952
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:32,171
When that dries up,

953
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:34,297
then it's time to reevaluate.

954
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:36,550
<i>Surgical intervention
doesn't always work.</i>

955
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:40,012
Look, Maggie,
whatever's going on,

956
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:44,016
you and Winston have so
much love between you

957
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:47,269
that whatever it is,
you'll work through it.

958
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,813
I know you will.

959
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,817
Thank you. Thank you.

968
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:14,630
I discovered I have a lot
of free time during the day

969
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,090

cancel on me.

970
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,925
Looks nice.

00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:24,848
Yeah, Scout and I
got board-certified

974
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,309
in OB-GYN last night and
delivered a baby. Mm.

975
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,687
Nope, not joking.

976
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,896
How was your surgery?

977
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:33,232
It was fine. It was
just a long night.

978
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,817
Yeah.

979
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:37,111
I'm gonna slip out the back

980
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:39,571
and try to get home
this time. Mm-hmm.

981
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:41,740
- Bye.
- Okay.

982
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:45,494
He just... held a laboring
mom's hand for hours

983
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:47,329
and took care of her
like it was his job,

984
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,792
all while in the midst of
a major personal crisis.

985

He's perfect.

986
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,504
How do you just let
someone like that go?

987
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,884
I've also had a long night.

988
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,512
He wasn't perfect for me.

989
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:05,639

00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:16,066

995
