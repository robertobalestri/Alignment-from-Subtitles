1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:02,992
<i>Every disease
has its unique course</i>

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:05,323
<i>it takes in the body
when left untreated.</i>

3
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:08,333
<i>The process begins with
exposure to a root cause</i>

4
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,251
<i>that sends a ripple effect
throughout the body.</i>

5
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,837
Simone, I didn't know,
okay? - No, sorry.

6
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,422
I-I-I can't do
the "I don't know"

7
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:15,882
story anymore.

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,383
You knew exactly
what was happening.

9
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,130
You <i>chose</i> not to see it.

10
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,642
Yeah, I guess moving to
Seattle hasn't changed

11
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,693
how quick you are
to point a finger.

12
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,802
Excuse me?

13
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,027
Well, you constantly assume
that I'm trying to hurt you...

14
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:27,565
No, you saw me come home from work
every night in tears. Okay. Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,178
You saw me almost throw
in the towel on my career.

16
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:33,167
You were too scared of tarnishing
your sterling reputation

17
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,912
to speak up for me!
I was an intern.

18
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:36,392
<i>The
disease then progresses,</i>

19
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,091
<i>ultimately resolving in one
of three possible outcomes...</i>

20
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,716
<i>You get better, you
stay chronically ill,</i>

21
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,826
They
kicked me out, Trey!

22
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,381
Oh, they've been
fighting nonstop

23
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,349
since he arrived last night.

24
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,468
Yeah, I heard.

25
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,958
I almost fell asleep
during rounds.

26
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,292
Well, maybe we should cancel.

27
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,378
Uh, we have an empty house.

28
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,796
We are having a party.

29
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:57,507
I don't care if he's her
ex-fiancé or whatever.

30
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,092
Trey is the competition.

31
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,760
If they're fighting, it
means you're still in this.

32
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,429
Team Skywalker.

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,348
You two were half a second
away from boning last night.

34
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,976
The sexual tension was,
frankly, oppressive.

35
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:10,812
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to about it?

36
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:13,606
Mm, stop sulking and
tell her how you feel

37
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,234
so I don't have to look at
your sad, sad face all night.

38
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,028
<i>Surgeons swoop in once
a diagnosis is made</i>

39
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,822
<i>and the patient
needs reinforcements.</i>

40
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,282
<i>We take decisive action</i>

41
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,992
<i>in order to give them
a fighting chance.</i>

42
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,661
Ohh. I spent the
first half of the day

43
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,037
fending off requests for
comment...

44
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,372
on the death of Jermaine Talbott

45
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:30,832
and the other half

46
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,001
trying to get a grasp
on our budget deficits,

47
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,420
which are substantial,
by the way.

48
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,754
Well, they always are.

49
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,756
Oh, I am kicking myself

50
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,342
for inviting Bailey and
Warren to dinner tonight.

51
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:42,844
Makes two of us

52
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,848
especially because Allison
bit Pru again. What?

53
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,725
I was told when I picked
her up from daycare.

54
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:49,726
Why didn't you tell me?

55
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,437
I am. This is me telling you.

56
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,063
Wait. So, what... Is
this becoming a thing?

57
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,815
I mean, should we cancel
dinner? You know what?

58
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't... Don't answer that.

59
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,360
I knew I should have
picked up more wine.

60
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,904
I think Tuck is
building a fort with Pru,

61
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,365
so we're set...

62
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,242
unless you want to cancel
and just go to bed early.

63
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,119
We will do no such thing.

64
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,912
Yeah.

65
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,414
What's that?

66
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,082
Well, we can't show
up empty-handed.

67
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,834
Yeah, but what if it
sends the wrong message?

68
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,627
What message?
That we like pie?

69
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,296
Their daughter has now
bitten our daughter.

70
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:20,006
<i>Twice.</i>

71
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,007
It's a problem.

72
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,300
Do you remember the last time

73
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,845
that you and I had a
civilized, adult dinner

74
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,639
without children present?

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,100
Let's get out of here while we
still can. Mm-hmm.

76
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,855
Mr. Simms needs
neurochecks q two hours,

77
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,441
and Natalia Asaki was
just admitted for pre-op,

78
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,069
so coordinate with
Webber and Pierce.

79
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,862
Are you going to the party
tonight?

80
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,447
You look nice.

81
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,700
In an appropriate,
respectful way.

82
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,577
Just
try not to kill anyone.

83
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,332
So... I guess we're the
only ones stuck here

84
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,667
while everyone else gets drunk
and makes poor decisions.

85
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,544
I <i>hate</i> the ICU.

86
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,712
Oh, there's nothing to it.

87
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,006
Just try not to kill anyone.

88
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,467
Everyone has to
stop saying that.

89
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,052
Well, have fun.

90
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,553
While you're running codes,
I'll be on Pierce's service,

91
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,138
scrubbing in on her
Ivor Lewis procedure

92
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,139
in the morning.

93
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,101
Natalia Asaki?

94
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,102
I hate you.

95
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,561
Don't hate the player,

96
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,687
hate the game.

97
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:18,231
Okay, now I hate both.

98
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,565
Ew.

99
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,317
Uh, you know, I
haven't had a chance

100
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,778
to congratulate you on your
partial heart transplant.

101
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,613
Now, there's some
groundbreaking stuff.

102
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,657
We worked hard on
it. Thank you. Yeah.

103
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,075
Well, you keep this
up, you'll be in line

104
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,369
for a Catherine Fox Award.

105
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,704
And you and Winston sure do
make a great team.

106
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,832
Dr. Pierce...

107
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,874
I just wanted to say thank you

108
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,501
for allowing me to
scrub in tomorrow...

109
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,002
Uh, Dr. Pierce, Dr. Webber,

110
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,296
I have studied the Ivor
Lewis procedure extensively.

111
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,006
I know that the
major complications

112
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,968
are respiratory and
atrial arrhythmias,

113
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,804
which can be controlled
by amiodarone.

114
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,597
Well, this is an 8-hour surgery,

115
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,934
so if you're not too tired
after your overnight in the ICU,

116
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,186
you may <i>also</i> scrub in.

117
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,818
Who's a player now?

118
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,405
Natalia, Elliot.
Welcome to Seattle.

119
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:08,489
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

120
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,615
I hope your trip
from Coeur d'Alene

121
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,992
wasn't too bad.

122
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,286
I slept through most
of it, thanks to him.

123
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,621
And I'm highly
caffeinated right now.

124
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,789
Well, we're glad you made it.

125
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,249
Dr. Kwan?

126
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,793
Natalia Asaki, 32, stage
II esophageal cancer,

127
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,629
status post neoadjuvant
therapy, admitted for pre-op

128
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,798
for an Ivor Lewis procedure
first thing in the morning.

129
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,009
Which is? Uh,
resecting the esophagus

130
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,219
through an abdominal incision
and a right thoracotomy,

131
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,888
then pulling the
stomach into the chest

132
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,848
to replace the esophagus.

133
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,811
I'm sorry.

134
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,606
Amor, my painting sold.

135
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,483
The landscape from
our camping trip.

136
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,901
I love that one. Yeah.

137
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,277
How much?

138
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:47,321
$500.

139
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,826
She's an art teacher at
an after-school program,

140
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,912
but she sells her own
pieces on the side.

141
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,080
I'm sorry, but the
past couple of months

142
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:01,000
of chemo and radiation were...

143
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,877
not the most fun I've ever had.

144
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,295
We're ready to put
this chapter behind us.

145
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,505
Well, let's get a move on.

146
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,923
Okay, Kwan, Millin,

147
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,966
let's start Natalia's
pre-op work-up...

148
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,469
Bloodwork, EKG, chest X-ray.

149
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,097
Um, I definitely need all
that before the surgery?

150
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,600
You do. We will
be back in a bit.

151
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,935
Babe, don't worry.

152
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,269
We'll figure out a
way to pay for it.

153
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,521
It's okay.

154
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,106
Oh, it's my fault?!

155
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,274
Look, I hate that
they kicked you out.

156
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,275
Alright? I really hate it.

157
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,485
I promise you, I hate it more.

158
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,445
Oh, still so competitive.

159
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,413
Ah.

160
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,500
Hey.

161
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,919
Come here.

162
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,513
Trey, I was broken.

163
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:59,893
I-I felt... broken.

164
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,107
But I am sorry that
I disappeared on you.

165
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,484
I'm sorry. I should
have chased after you.

166
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,611
I wanted to. I should have.

167
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,030
I mean, you kinda
did. You're here.

168
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,908
I feel like I waited too long.

169
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,370
Did I wait too long?

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,376
Can we just go to the
party and try to have fun?

171
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,346
I missed you.

172
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,390
I missed you.

173
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,504
Ben, Bailey. Enter at your
own risk.

174
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,215
Ooh, come on in. Oooh, look
at that. Mm-hmm. Apple pie.

175
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,134
My mother's recipe.

176
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,219
Maybe you can think of
it when you are approving

177
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,096

00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,253
No. Yes, I'm
officially in hiding.

355
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,754
That actually does make
me feel a little better.

356
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,298
Gahhhhh. Okay,
Whitney. Just breathe.

357
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,299
Yeah.

358
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,262
What?

359
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,471
Well, when I first
heard you were living

360
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,432
with a bunch of interns in
a house with fire damage,

361
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,641
I was kinda scared for you.

362
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:38,726
Oh, hard same.

363
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:42,205
They seem cool.

364
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,939
Even though they're
not quite your caliber.

365
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,151
No. Don't judge my people.

366
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,652
Oh, they're your people now?

367
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,612
I mean... yeah.
They kinda are.

368
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:51,947
Come on.

369
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,102
Now, you were the
top of your class

370
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,533
in every class
you've ever been in.

371
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,285
And you're top tier.

372
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,454
I'm sorry, but these?

373
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,247
These are not your people.
Trey, I swear to God, we just...

374
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,124
No, no, no, you're only mad
because you know it's true.

375
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,293
Grey-Sloan isn't the
program it used to be,

376
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,627
and you don't belong here.

377
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,213
You belong with me, at the top.

378
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,923
And if you present your
case and you come back...

379
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,759
Present my case? and you
stay calm and collected...

380
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,511
Oh, wow. Look, we could
have it all back, Simone.

381
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,014
We could have us back. We
could have our future back.

382
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,098
These are not your people.

383
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,391
Baby, <i>I'm</i> your people.

384
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,517
I'm walking away, Trey.

385
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,227
And I promise if
you walk after me,

386
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,188
I won't remain
calm and collected.

387
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,355
- Come on.
- No!

388
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:26,149
Simone. No!

389
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,608

Tuck spent 45 minutes in the

393
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:35,604
45, alright?

394
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:36,701
You know what he was doing?

395
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,285
Do we want to know?

396
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,411
He was shaving.

397
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,871
Sorry. Sorry.

398
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,206

399
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,332
His chest.

400
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,561
He's going out
for the swim team.

401
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,709
Ah.

402
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,169
I mean, Pru might
be a threenager,

403
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,796
but at least she doesn't
hog the bathroom.

404
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,088
She's been angling for a dog.

405
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,089
Aww.

406
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,382
Oh, that's all we need, right?

407
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,927
You know,
little puppy teeth

408
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,304
nipping at her fingers and toes.

409
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,808
Mm.
You know, here we are,

410
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,184
kid-free, finally,

411
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,936
and we're still talking
about kids.

412
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,395
Right, who wants to
talk about adult stuff?

413
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,814
I do. Okay.

414
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,482
Uh, Bailey, how's the clinic?

415
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,234
Mm, busy.

416
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,736
We can hardly keep
up with the demand.

417
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:16,114
Uh, how's the...
medical license?

418
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,617
Still suspended, but,
you know, getting there.

419
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,827
Is it?

420
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,247
Do you want to help
me in the kitchen?

421
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,642
I can't. No license, so...

422
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,584
I can help
you with something. Ah.

423
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:28,752
No, no, no, no,
no. Don't be silly.

424
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,087
Teddy's got it, right?

425
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:31,380
Right. Mm.

426
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,968
So, uh...

427
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,386
should we go back to
talking about kids?

428
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,643
It'll be okay. Babe.

429
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,303
It'll be okay.

430
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,105
I'll start driving on the
rideshare app. Babe.

431
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,940
And if you need another
surgery after that,

432
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,984
I'll take on more guitar
students or... Amor.

433
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,486
Stop!

434
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,616
Uh, Natalia, Elliot.

435
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:02,244
This is the consent form

436
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:05,706
identifying the risks
of the procedure.

437
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,584
They say I could die, right?

438
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,923
If I die...

439
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,270
How deep in the hole are you?

440
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,729
During the pandemic, they
made us both part-time.

441
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,982
We just got the only health
insurance we could afford,

442
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:34,526
and we thought we
were gonna be fine,

443
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:38,155
but now we're buried in
debt, and I'm gonna die

444
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:42,367
and leave the love of my
life poor and homeless.

445
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,286
You two should get a divorce.

446
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:46,831
That's not funny.

447
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,874
No, and it wasn't meant to be.

448
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,169
Dr. Kwan, please step outside. No,
medical divorce is a real thing.

449
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,463
It could help Elliot not get
saddled by Natalia's debt.

450
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:57,090
It could help Natalia to qualify
for more insurance or aid,

451
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:58,258
since they won't
have a joint income.

452
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,385
And if they have assets,
it could protect them.

453
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,763
Wait.

454
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,141
That's brilliant.

455
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,060
What? Babe.

456
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,686
No, you're my <i>wife.</i>

457
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:13,565
Dr. Kwan, I'd like a
word. Outside, please.

458
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,027
Now. I'm not divorcing
the woman I love.

459
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,824
I said do not follow me!

460
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,535
Are you okay?

461
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:26,995
Do I look okay?

462
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,790
Um, well, you
look...

463
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,960
Well, you look perfect.

464
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:36,005
What? To me, you kinda
always look perfect.

465
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,093
And maybe my timing isn't great,

466
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,762
but I need to say that
even when you're upset,

467
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,641

469

And when you get
mad, you get smarter.

00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,814

you can't figure out a case...

471

Of course I do.

But before you cross

540

you have to talk to
an attending first.

541
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,186

financial services

brought it to my apartment

told me he liked my smile.

not, you can barely

Most of us can only dream
of having a love like that.

650
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,352
I'm just saying that,

651
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:13,129
if you trusted her
enough to marry her,

652
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:17,150
why not trust her
enough to un-marry her?

653
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,152
Don't make it mean
something it doesn't.

654
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:22,697
She loves you and she
wants to protect you.

655
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:27,285
So maybe just... let her.

656
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,685

659
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,606
you can't have them in the ICU,

660
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,818

like it has in marriage.

678
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,499
And I promise you to keep trying

679
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,543

686
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,653
I promise to treat

690
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,481

witnessed several weddings

691

692
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:05,610

Mnh. Unh-unh.

697
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,847

I can't do it.

698
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,848

699
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,016

700
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:39,060

701
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,311
ruined my parents' lives.

702
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,562
So sorry to hear that.

703
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,356
I told my wife that
I was scared our kid

704
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:44,357
would get my brother's genes.

705
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,900
You know what she said?

706
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,944
"We don't have that
in our family."

707
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:49,362
And I just accepted that?!

708
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
You know what, Whitney?

709
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,909
Hey, you're right. Alright?

710
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,994
The world is a terrifying,
mostly awful place,

711
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,663
and you can't choose your kids.

712
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,665
Tell me something to
make me feel better.

713
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,792
When I look at my son
drooling in the corner,

714
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,335
he gives me hope.

715
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,047
Pure, blind, probably
irrational hope.

716
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,966
He gives me a reason
to put my fears aside

717
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,468
and believe that
everything might be okay.

718
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,642
So, traveling doesn't
get old for you?

719
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:22,353
No way. Uh, I'm a Sagittarius.

720
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,313
I'm, um...

721
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:25,314
Jewish.

722
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,694
Ah, smart, funny, and a doctor.

723
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,696
Mm.

724
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,823
The dying wish of
Hilda Narvaez Garcia.

725
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,491
My mother.

726
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,784
Oh, I'm so sorry.

727
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:37,994
Oh, no, she's still alive.

728
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:40,204
She's just very dramatic
about my love life.

729
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,498
Does she
cut out magazine articles

730
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:43,833
and comment on
your sock choices?

731
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,501
Yes! Yes!

732
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:49,297
Plus, a whole lot more
which I will not tell you

733
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,215
because I want you to
pick up my call one day.

734
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,598
That was me asking
for your number.

735
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,849
I... Oh, I...

736
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,850
Maybe we can go someplace

737
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,560
where they bring drinks to you.

738
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,103
Like, um, I know this
place downtown...

739
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:05,688
Yes.

740
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,025
You know, when I was chief,

741
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,151
at least I paid my co-workers

742
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,111
the respect of
full transparency.

743
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,529
Oh, please. When
you were chief,

744
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,364
the hospital almost went under.

745
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:16,741
Oh, wait. It kinda did.

746
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,493
That was not my fault.

747
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:21,120
When you're chief,
<i>everything</i> is your fault.

748
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:22,789
That's why I can't
have a chief of trauma

749
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,290
with a suspended
medical license!

750
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,792
Oh, just say it again, Teddy.

751
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,084
We having fun yet?

752
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,379
You wanna know why
Allison is biting kids?

753
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,298
Because her dad is a man-child

754
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,925
who can't control his tantrums!

755
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,384
Yeah, well, she's not
old enough to drink,

756
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:36,886
so she can't take after her mom!

757
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:40,181
Okay, enough! Ugh,
this won't work.

758
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:42,433
Altman, you are the
chief now, officially.

759
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,978
And this is just
poor leadership.

760
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,355
Okay, whatever happened
between the two of you

761
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:49,023
needs to be fixed

762
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:52,693
because, yes, now your child
is biting other people.

763
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,153
You said biting happens.

764
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,363
It does.

765
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,782
But you two constantly
biting each other

766
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,701
with your sharp
words and nasty looks

767
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,412
and rage at all
times isn't helping.

768
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,997
Pretty soon, that rage of yours

769
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,624
is going to infect
the entire hospital

770
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,376
and we'll all be
biting at each other

771
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:10,670
like zombies or cannibals!

772
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:14,048
So for all of our
sakes, get some help.

773
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,049
Ben, get the pie.

774
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,095
Okay.

775
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,145
Oh, maybe we should have
people over more often.

776
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,060
Bite me.

777
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,396
<i>Dr. Newton.
Dr. Erica Newton to trauma two.</i>

778
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,649
<i>Dr. Newton to trauma two.</i>

779
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,442
Thanks for pissing off Pierce.

780
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,403
I've never scrubbed in on
a craniotomy. Have fun.

781
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:37,822
She gave me like a week's worth
of progress notes to review.

782
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,073
Just apologize.

783
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,324
Tell her you screwed up.

784
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,909
I don't apologize
unless I'm wrong.

785
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,244
Now, can you go scrub
in on the surgery

786
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:46,622
that you basically
stole so I can focus?

787
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:55,381
Okay,

788
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:57,425

that if I had just
stayed calm and collected

The resentment.

861
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:28,636
I've been sensing it on
you for a while now and...

862
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:32,223

Wait... I
know you're not saying

867
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,366
you resent me
going back to work.

868
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,701
I do.

869
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,787
