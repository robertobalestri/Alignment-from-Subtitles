00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:37,517

Not until I see
the baby's tracing.

A-After my father-in-law.

75

Dr. Wilson, promise me that
you're not gonna deliver him.

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,857
It's too early. His lungs
are not mature enough yet.

77
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:46,658
He's not ready. He
needs more time.

78
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,755
You and I both
know he needs more time.

79
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,817
Please.

Okay, repetitive late decels.
The baby's in distress.

83

00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,807
Damn it, V-fib.

85
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:01,157
Let's get a crash cart.

86
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,912
Okay, let's turn her on her left
side and get ready to intubate.

87
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:06,491
Let's drop some
etomidate and succs.

88
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:09,445
Here's a cardiac
board. Good girl.

89
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,458

Again. Charge 200.

95
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,404
You didn't lose
consciousness, get dizzy,

96
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,982
notice any vision changes?

97
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,354
I'm fine. Left
shoulder's dislocated.

98
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,647
We need to reduce it under
sedation and get you an MRI.

99
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:32,845
I'm fine. I... Ow!

100
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,527

101
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,845

and she's got six

102
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,811
very capable doctors around her.

103
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:38,916
I'm gonna lift your
arm a little bit.

104
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,804
Ow!

105
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:43,165
What happened to you?

106
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,609
I was grazed with a brick.

107
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:45,943
The one thrown
through the window?

108
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,590
Has anyone ruled
out a head injury?

109
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,065
Let's go. I'm fine.

110
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,567
People need to stop saying that.

111
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,432
Ready for the ambu bag.

112
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,508
Ooh. Just pop it back in.

113
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,871
Not without some sedation.

114
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,864
Just pop it back in, damn it!

115
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,339
Griffith, stand behind her.

116
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,124
Stabilize her shoulder.

117
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:04,796
Charge to 300.

118
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,202
Okay. Clear!

What's happening?

125
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,042
No variability on fetal monitor.

126
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,395
It's category three tracing.

127
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,073
How long?

128
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:28,964
How long?!

129
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,583
Almost two minutes.

130
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:33,038
We tried multiple rounds
of shock, epi, and boluses.

131
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,780
She is bleeding out
through her abdomen.

132
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:36,172
CPR's not gonna work.

133
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,684
Go ahead and prep the
abdomen for a C-section.

134
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,195
Addison. Gown and glove me.

135
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,601
That baby is not gonna survive
in the uterus any longer.

136
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,115
We've got to get the baby out.

137
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,444
I'm not gonna let that
person behind the wheel

138
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,527
take two lives out
of this family.

139
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,557
Okay.

140
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:51,026

tray and some towels.

141
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,466
- Hang two units of blood.
- Page the NICU.

142
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,252
We need an incubator and a
resuscitation team down here.

143
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:58,624
Okay, I'll get gowned and
gloved. Adams, take over.

144
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,457
Alright, get the lap pads ready.

145
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:02,828
I'm so sorry.

146
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,721
Okay, we need to move faster.

147
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,610
Come on, come on.

148
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:10,981
Are we ready?

149
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,559
10-blade.

150
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,693
Stopping compressions.

151
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,591

extend the incision.

154
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,113
Suction. Let's
give another round of epi.

155
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,004
Dr. Yasuda,
break's over.

156
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,653
If they don't need you in
there, go do intake on bed 4.

157
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,140
I need more retraction.

158
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,831
Okay, there's bleeding
in the liver and spleen.

159
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,443
Lap pads. Isn't
she already gone?

160
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:58,730
Why are we packing her...
'Cause we don't stop

161
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,070
until we do everything
that we can, okay?

162
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:00,920
More lap pads.

163
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,066
How we doing, DeLuca?

164
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,177
I've got
him. He's out.

165
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:05,996
Wilson, cut the cord. Yep.

166
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,368
Oxygen mask and prepare
for suction and intubation.

167
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey, baby boy. Hang on for us.

168
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,547
Okay, restarting
chest compressions.

169
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,092
Okay, hang two units of blood and
push one of epi. Come on, Tia.

170
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,728
Come on.

171
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:19,581
Come on, Tia.

172
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:21,160
Come on.

173
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,230
There!
- Wow.

174
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,255
Okay.

175
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,492
Oh, thank God.

176
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,473
Let's get her to the O.R.
while she still has a pulse.

177
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,511
And can somebody get me
her husband's number?

178
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:32,464
I'm on it.

179
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,541
Okay, I'm
intubating the baby now.

180
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,794
Griffith, make sure
NICU knows we're coming.

181
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,273
Yes, Dr. Montgomery.

182
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,276
Essential personnel only.

183
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,578
We're first responders.

184
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:46,754
You guys got patients with you?

185
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:48,895
My wife runs the
clinic. Miranda Bailey.

186
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,209
Our daughter is
upstairs in the daycare.

187
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,248
This entrance is closed.

188
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:53,654
Dr. Altman! Teddy!

189
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,384
It's okay. They're with me.

190
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,390
Essential personnel only.

191
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:59,374
I'm chief of surgery.
They're essential.

192
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,212
Have you seen Carina?
She's in surgery.

193
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,170
Oh, my God. No, she...
she's doingsurgery.

194
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,431
She's okay and
Bailey's okay, too.

195
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:08,560
Oh, thank God.

196
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,685
If anyone else gives you
trouble, just have them page me.

197
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,069
Alright. Thanks,
Teddy. Thank you.

198
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,813
This process seems
to take a lot longer

199
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,150
when you're on the
other side of it.

200
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:19,487
Almost done.

201
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:22,918
Remember when being a doctor
was considered heroic?

202
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,359
Like firefighters and teachers?

203
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:26,566
Who does this?

204
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:29,527
I mean, who throws bricks
and runs cars into doctors?

205
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,623
Scans are up.

206
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,167
What do you see?

207
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,920
Uh, no bleeding, no fractures...

208
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:39,189
No traumatic brain injuries.

209
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,537
Then can someone
get me out of here

210
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,357
so I can go back to
work? Not so fast.

211
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:44,091
You could be concussed,
so you should go home.

212
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,115
I live alone.

213
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,393
If I go home and fall asleep,

214
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,971
I could die and
no one would know.

215
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,554
Okay, fine, but you
need to be supervised

216
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,267
and undergo regular
neuro checks.

217
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,753
Wha... I-I don't want
to supervise him.

218
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:54,906
Well, I don't care.

219
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,863
He can't do any
procedures or scrub in.

220
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,107
Only let him do notes
and patient intake.

221
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:02,313
And page if he has any
dizziness or headaches.

222
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,425
Hello?

223
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,450
Hello?

224
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,567
Hey. Hey.

225
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:11,926
Did you need something?

226
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,493
No, I just wanted to check in.

227
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:15,344
Dr. Pierce.

228
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:19,307
Well, Mr. Lingenfelser's post-op
cardiac index is improving.

229
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,575
I think we can discharge
in the morning.

230
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,568
Okay, that's good.

231
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:25,905
I was actually checking on you.

232
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,542
Uh...

233
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,007
Is everyone okay?

234
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:33,031
Uh, there's a pregnant
doctor who might not be.

235
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,927
I just...

236
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:39,543
I cannot process this, so I just
need to focus on my patients.

237
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,108
Like, if I keep telling myself
that everything is fine,

238
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,342
then eventually, that
will make it true, right?

239
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,956
Yeah. The world doesn't make a
whole lot of sense right now.

240
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,142
No, it doesn't.

241
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,204
Oh, uh, Sound Science
sent copies of the issue

242
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,036
for the partial heart
transplant feature.

243
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,343
So I left one for
you in the lounge.

244
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,541
Oh.

245
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:56,814
What did you think?

246
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,355
You didn't read it?

247
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,520
I got paged as soon
as I started it.

248
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,641
But I'm sure you did great.

249
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,591
Winston.

250
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:09,789
Yeah?

251
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,119
Thanks for checking in.

252
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:20,424
"M" as in "Mary", "I" as in
"Igloo", "L" as in "Larry."

253
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,449
Yes, Ms. Anderson.

254
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,811
I have paged Dr. Millin,

255
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,634
but Dr. Yasuda should
have done your intake.

256
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,737
Max? Where did she...

257
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:26,867
Jules!

258
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:27,808
What are you doing here?

259
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,214
Being paranoid.

260
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,172
Norma needs a knee replacement.

261
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,164
Maxine thinks she's a doctor.

262
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:35,586
Ms. Douglas, your
knee isvery swollen.

263
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,647
You see? I told you.

264
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,128
We heard some doctors
got hit by a car.

265
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:41,408
Was that you?

266
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:42,952
No, no.

267
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:45,002
Uh, I'm okay, but
thanks for your concern.

268
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:47,069
Ms. Douglas, have you
had a fall recently?

269
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:48,993
No. Any history of gout,

270
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:50,954
rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis?

271
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,187
Unh-unh. Okay.

272
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,525
Dr. Millin, page
ortho for her knee.

273
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,010
Wait. She won't tell
you, but I will.

274
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:58,968
It burns when she pees.

275
00:09:58,993 --> 00:09:59,862
Norma!

276
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,480
Max, you have to say something.

277
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,127
Remember what
happened last time?

278
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,671
Could be another UTI.

279
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,668
I'll get you a
cup for a urinalysis.

280
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,453
Anything else?

281
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,092
Orange spice tea?

282
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,276
You know the one I like.
I'll see what I can do.

283
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:16,840
Your grandma's a piece of work.

284
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,024
Oh, Max isn't my grandma.
She's my roommate.

285
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,807
How severe
are her injuries?

286
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:23,990
Uh, we won't know
until we get her into the O.R.,

287
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,844
but your wife has
lost a lot of blood.

288
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:28,296
Dr. Bailey, I've been married
to a doctor for five years.

289
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,116
I know when you're hedging.

290
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,178
Please just tell
me what's going on.

291
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:35,607
Okay, uh, Tia went into cardiac
arrest in the trauma bay,

292
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,946
which forced us to have to
perform an emergency C-section.

293
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,873
We have a team resuscitating
the baby as we speak.

294
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,693
The baby? That's our baby?

295
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,029
Yes. Your baby.
Your... Your son.

296
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:47,462
I will be on the first flight.

297
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,180
Do whatever you have
to do to save them.

298
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,045
Please. You have my word.

299
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,538
Thank you.

300
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:57,668
Okay, tell reception to keep
an eye out for Mr. Marwood,

301
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:58,938
and then scrub in.

302
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,065
Will do.

303
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,864
Thank you.

304
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,722
I'm okay.

305
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,883
Umbilical
lines are in.

306
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,033
First hurdle's cleared.

307
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,128
What's that?

308
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,714
Getting him here alive.

309
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:30,751
O2 is dropping.

310
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,333
Heart rate's in the
60s, falling fast.

311
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,359
Ambu him.

312
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:43,014
Yeah, breathing's
equal on both sides.

313
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,972
I'm gonna start
chest compressions.

314
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,649
Okay, little man.

315
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,357
When your mama gets
out of surgery,

316
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:50,695
she's gonna want to see
you on the other side.

317
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,360
She's been through way too much
for you to give up now, okay?

318
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,999
So I am not gonna
let you give up.

319
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,500
Not today.

320
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,112
Sats are improving.

321
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,401
He's back.

322
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,249
Oh, thank God.

323
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,737
You doing okay over there? Yeah.

324
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,902
I think I held my breath
for that entire time.

325
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,262
That was... Scary?

326
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,961
Abject terror is more like it.

327
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,402
Welcome to the NICU.

328
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,762
What's the best approach
for dural sutures?

329
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:34,107
Do youknow the best
approach for dural suturing?

330
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,991
Eh, you're fine. And
it's continuous sutures.

331
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,007
Okay.

332
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,846
I got a question for you. Hmm?

333
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:45,005
Why do you live
with a 90-year-old?

334
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,726
Uh, Maxine is 81,

335
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,031
and I was friends with her
grandson in med school.

336
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,473
She offered to sublet
me her extra room

337
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,707
for a third of what I
would pay anywhere else.

338
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,395
She also makes amazing
matzo ball soup

339
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,800
and I don't have to worry

340
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,135
about being quiet
when I come home late

341
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,692
because she takes her
hearing aids out at night.

342
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,234
It's a win-win.

343
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:03,890
Hi.

344
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,425
So, her knee's okay?

345
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,969
According to the X-ray, there
is no sign of a fracture.

346
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:11,135
Told ya. However, there
is a lot of fluid buildup.

347
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,860
I'd like to take a sample to
rule out septic arthritis.

348
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,197
Can I take a look?

349
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:17,293
You can look at
anything you want.

350
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,759
Hey, easy, Norma.

351
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,399
For God's sake, Norma.

352
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,811
Jules tells me all the time.

353
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:23,456
We can't talk like that anymore.

354
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:25,587
Have you seen him?

355
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,368
What do you think, Doc?

356
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,995
These popsicle sticks
got me all the way

357
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,781
to State Championship
back in my majorette days.

358
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,330
Norma's
worse than me.

359
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,103
Okay, you ready to learn
how to aspirate a knee?

360
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,785
Absolutely.Uh. I'll do it.

361
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,541
Concussions to the back.

362
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:48,262
Okay, we're gonna
tap the knee now.

363
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:50,967
I'd like to tap that.

364
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,203
Okay.

365
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:59,092
Oh. Chief Altman!
Can I walk with you?

366
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,636
If you can walk fast.

367
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,626
How are you holding up today?

368
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,307
Today must be a crazy
day to be chief.

369
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,585
I've got Seattle PD
and hospital security

370
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,887
briefing me every minute,

371
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:09,789
planning for every
possible threat.

372
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,023
You know, I am really
good in a crisis,

373
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,223
but no matter how many times
you've been in literal warfare,

374
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,662
it never gets easier.

375
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,561
Also, I haven't eaten in hours,

376
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,045
and if one more person mentions

377
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,583
"risk assessment"
or "liability,"

378
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,196
I might just walk out of
here and never come back.

379
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,845
Though, I'm kinda feeling
better. Thanks for asking.

380
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,383
Yeah, I was actually going to
ask your advice about something.

381
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:31,948
So, the Sound Sciencearticle
came out today

382
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:34,154
about the partial heart
transplant.Congratulations.

383
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,499
Yeah. I'm looking forward to
reading it once things calm down.

384
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,083
Maybe skip the part
where they quoted me

385
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,185
saying that I assembled a team
of highly skilled assistants,

386
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,346
including my husband,
Dr. Winston Ndugu.

387
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,555
Did you say that?

388
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,569
I also said that
he's a highly skilled surgeon

389
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,011
and that it was a 50/50 effort,

390
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,496
but they didn't print that.

391
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,336
Well, now it looks like
you're taking all the credit

392
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,220
and insulting your
husband.Exactly.

393
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,005
Alright, how can I
help you out with this?

394
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,186
Can the hospital ask
for a correction?

395
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,211
Please.

396
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,517
I-I wouldn't ask if
this wasn't urgent.

397
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,447
Okay, I will put a call
into the PR department

398
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,695
once I get through today,

399
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,082
but, Pierce, you really
should talk to your husband.

400
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:12,617
Owen and I didn't
talk for months,

401
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,230
and it nearly broke us.

402
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,201
Do not wait for the hospital
to issue a statement.

403
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:22,533
Okay, let's get
started. Sorry I'm late.

404
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,875
Excuse me.

405
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:32,468
All that chaos
outside, and look at her.

406
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,003
Not a care in the world. Just
putting ears on a potato.

407
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,928
Really shifts your
perspective, doesn't it?

408
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:49,801
How's she doing?

409
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,725
It's Addison.

410
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,890
She isn't listening to anyone,
including her own body,

411
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,469
so that she can take
care of a patient.

412
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,633
But I know she's in pain
because she's biting her lip,

413
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,710
which is something that she does

414
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,456
when she's trying to distract
herself from something.

415
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,647
Yeah, I know she means a lot to
you. "A lot" doesn't describe it.

416
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:07,559
I think the universe felt badly

417
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,276
when I got stuck with my
three biological sisters,

418
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:15,651
so eventually, it gave me
Addison and Meredith and Maggie.

419
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,746
Mm.

420
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,576
They need me in the ICU.

421
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,757
Go. I could stay.

422
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,001
I'll observe her range of motion

423
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,891
and keep an eye out
for that lip bite.

424
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,540
She still needs that
follow-up X-ray, MRI,

425
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,810
and another neurovascular exam.

426
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,181
Amelia...

427
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,363
I've got her.

428
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,766
Dr. Yasuda.

429
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,163
Yeah.

430
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:03,441
Yasuda, are you okay?

431
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,126
I don't think I am.

432
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,917
- She's decompensating.
- Her spleen's shattered.

433
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,621
Multiple lacerations
to the liver, as well.

434
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,270
Let's prep for a
splenectomy and give her cryo.

435
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,677
You know she was our very first
applicant for the fellowship?

436
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,611
I remember.

437
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,254
In the interview, we told her
we were concerned her pregnancy

438
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,901
could make the
timing challenging

439
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,421
because she was coming all
the way from Tennessee.

440
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,992
Then she said, "I'm
about to become a mother.

441
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,902
What could be more
challenging than that?"

442
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,331
No one could've seen
this coming, Bailey.

443
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,530
Coming here wasn't a
requirement of her program.

444
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,661
But she came anyway,
while pregnant,

445
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:36,762
because she wanted to
help other pregnant women.

446
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:38,720
And today, she became a mother.

447
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:40,896
That's our patient.
That's who we're saving.

448
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,318
She's coding. Hold on, Tia.

449
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:53,876
Hang more FFP.
Removing the spleen.

450
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,647
Dr. Bailey, it's yours.
It's Tia's husband.

451
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,289
Okay, we'll call
him when we can.

452
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,058
Ugh, she's still
bleeding everywhere.

453
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,292
Her body can't
clot or oxygenate.

454
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,368
Liver's still oozing.

455
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:06,988
I just need a little more time
to control these bleeders.

456
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,530
- Dr. Bailey.
- Silence it!

457
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,897
- I'm on it.
- How are we, Knox?

458
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,114
She's severely acidotic.
Base deficit is minus 10.

459
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:13,150
I'm giving TXA.

460
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,367
There's blood in her NG tube.

461
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,017
Her temperature's
dropping fast. Dr. Hunt?

462
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,904
She didn't give up downstairs.
I am not giving up in here.

463
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,811
If we continue operating, she
won't make it out of this O.R.

464
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:23,487
Look, she's acidotic,
hypothermic, and coagulopathic.

465
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,593
Let's take her to the
ICU and give her a break.

466
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,337
Fine.
Let's pack her.

467
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:30,685
Give me as much lap
pads as you have.

468
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,991
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

469
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:41,757
You're okay.

470
00:18:41,782 --> 00:18:43,985
I-I have a patient at
six centimeters, so I...

471
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah, you have to
go. I have to go.

472
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,851
Thank you for coming.

473
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:54,557
Hey, Jackie.

474
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:13,441
Um... the cold will help
ground you in the present...

475
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:14,858
break the shock.

476
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,913
Will you take a look
around this room

477
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:23,388
and name five
objects that you see?

478
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:25,375
A bedpan.

479
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,539
That's one.

480
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,261
Stool.

481
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:29,632
Two.

482
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,023
Lab coat.

483
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:33,326
Mm-hmm, three.

484
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,646
I am mortified.

485
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:38,433
I just froze.
Surgeons can't freeze.

486
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,939
You weren't in an O.R.

487
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:42,608
No, I can't get Tia out of
my head, just lying there.

488
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,360
And I-I just keep thinking that
it could have been any of us.

489
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,683
It could've been me. I'm
a monster for saying it.

490
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,165
You're not.

491
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:54,433
And do not apologize for your
reaction to a traumatic event.

492
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,055
Today was not normal.

493
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,186
It was violent.

494
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,667
The clinic was attacked.
Youwere attacked.

495
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,560
You didn't sign up for that,

496
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,509
and that is not what this
job is supposed to be.

497
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,614
So, look, take
whatever time you need.

498
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,365
Whatever space. Okay.

499
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,544
That's what makes you human.

500
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,845
What's 64 divided by 8?

501
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,907
Eight. I wasn't asking you.

502
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,428
Don't you have other
patients to bother?

503
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:33,147
Oh, Norma and Maxine's
prelim test results are in.

504
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,602
We have your initial results.

505
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:40,697
Uh, Max, would you
like to come with me?

506
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:41,640
Nonsense.

507
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,425
Whatever you have
to say to one of us,

508
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:45,002
you can say to both of us.

509
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:46,212
Are you comfortable with this?

510
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,392
Oh, you know me.

511
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,433
I haven't cared about
propriety since 1986.

512
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,579
You have gonorrhea.

513
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:59,531
Both of you, if that
wasn't... clear.

514
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:00,764
Yours settled in your knee.

515
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:03,328
It's called
gonococcal arthritis.

516
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:06,632
Uh, gonorrhea is contracted by
having sexual intercourse...

517
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:08,555
We know how you get it.

518
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:11,542
We have to ask you to call
all of your sexual partners.

519
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,744
Now?

520
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,206
I-It's advisable to, um, get
anyone who's been exposed

521
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,819
treated regardless of
their test results.

522
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,813
You didn't tell me
you were sleeping with someone.

523
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:24,771
You didn't tell me, either.

524
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:28,168
I wanted to, but it's not
exactly the conversation

525
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:30,153
for the Mahjong table.

526
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,810
Hi. This is Happy Hal.

527
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,552
I'm sorry I missed you.

528
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:37,406
I'm out on the town
doing my thing.

529
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,295
Please leave your
name and number

530
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,460
and I'll get back to you.

531
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,289
Well, this is awkward.

532
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,420
I thought we might
find you here.

533
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,057
Carina's delivering a baby.

534
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:55,185
She operated on the
doctor who got hit.

535
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,404
She delivered that
doctor's baby,

536
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:57,854
and now she's
delivering another baby

537
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,259
and she's a miracle worker.

538
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,947
I don't stop
to think about it enough,

539
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,007
but my wife is a
bringer of life.

540
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:04,712
I'm sorry, I just needed
to hear her voice.

541
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:07,602
No, I get it. I get
it. It's a scary day.

542
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,156
Guess this is what
it feels like.

543
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,789
What do you mean?
To be married to us.

544
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,424
When you and I found out
that something had happened

545
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,554
at the clinic, we both ran here.

546
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:18,468
We had to know that
they were okay.

547
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:20,702
We had to... Oh.

548
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,548
We had to see it. Yeah.

549
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:25,430
My stomach literally
went upside down.

550
00:22:25,455 --> 00:22:28,244
Like, I-I felt it turn, like,
I actually might need surgery.

551
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,133
Well, we do that to
them on a daily basis.

552
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:33,533
God, it feels awful.
We're awful people.

553
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,531
But they knew what they were
getting into, though, right?

554
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:39,039
I think Carina did.

555
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,652
Bailey married you when
you were still a doctor.

556
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:44,688
Okay, vitals look good.
He looks stable for now.

557
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:49,909
Griffith, you need a break?

558
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:53,015
I mean, I'm kinda the one who
got hit by a car over here.

559
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,469
Sorry. I just...

560
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:57,674
I was in here when I was born.

561
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,736
In the NICU? In thisNICU.

562
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:03,213
My mom was somewhere on another
floor, fighting for her life.

563
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:05,163
And I'm just...

564
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,851
amazed.

565
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,844
Amazed by what?

566
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:10,542
Someone like you
did this for me.

567
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,534
Someone like you saved my life.

568
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,328
He's bradycardic.

569
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,513
Start chest compressions
and keep 'em coming.

570
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,039
No breath sounds. Ambu him.

571
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:23,584
Sats are dropping.
Do we need an X-ray?

572
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,048
There's no time for that.
Give me your pen light.

573
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,533
Wh... Wh... Ask questions
later, Griffith.

574
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,486
Okay, and turn that
light off. Now.

575
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:37,515
See how this side lights
up and this side doesn't?

576
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,418
He's got a pneumothorax. I need
a 22-gauge needle and a syringe.

577
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:41,671
Hurry, please.

578
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:51,244
Go ahead.

579
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,708
10 cc's of air.

580
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,562
And I have breath sounds.

581
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:04,692
Heart rate's coming up.
Sats are normalizing.

582
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,512
Are you okay? I'm fine.

583
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,537
Can you get an oscillator
and prep for a chest tube

584
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:11,470
and give him another
dose of surfactant?

585
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:14,575
Okay.

586
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:18,280
No, I've got this, Wilson.

587
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:20,134
Y-You go check up on
your other patients.

588
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,072
Are you sure? Because
I-I know that she just...

589
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:23,254
I'm sure.

590
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:25,891
Okay.

591
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,848
Hi. You've
reached Brandon Marwood.

592
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,034
Please leave a message.

593
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,184
Uh, y... Mr. Marwood, uh, it's
Dr. Bailey from Grey-Sloan.

594
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:06,798
I know you're on a plane right
now, but I have an update.

595
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:10,793
Tia has been
transferred to the ICU.

596
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:13,290
We're gonna let her
rest for a few hours,

597
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:16,007
and then take her
back to the O.R.

598
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
and finish repairing
her injuries.

599
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,176
Um... we'll be right
here waiting for you.

600
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,697
I won't leave her side.

601
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:40,332
So, she'syour Tuesday night
"standing canasta game"? Oh!

602
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:42,667
And she's your "Well,
I'll just go take a nap

603
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:43,862
in the community room"?

604
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:44,867
Ladies, please.

605
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,756
You said you didn't
even like blondes!

606
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,257
She's not a natural blonde.

607
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,439
I am so!

608
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,043
Okay, Max, calm down, calm down.

609
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,310
Norma, you calm down, too.

610
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:55,757
Hal, if you could
just sit by Dr. Kwan.

611
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,473
Sir, your results
should be back soon,

612
00:25:57,498 --> 00:25:59,341
but we'd like to give
you the shot anyway

613
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,540
because you're
likely the... source.

614
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:04,781
That's impossible. I
am healthy as a horse!

615
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:07,431
The most common STD symptoms
are often no symptoms at all.

616
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:10,336
Oh, my God. You'll need to
contact your sexual partners.

617
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:11,579
All of 'em?

618
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,641
Yes. Hal.

619
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,306
Oh, geez.

620
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,124
Uh...

621
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:21,359
Hazel Rothman, Judy Booth...

622
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:24,389
Oh, yeah. Martha
from water aerobics.

623
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:25,518
Not Martha!

624
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,407
She's 98!

625
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:28,584
You're an ageist!

626
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,706
And you're a liar!
You son of a bitch!

627
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,221
And you're a filthy liar, and
you're not even that good in bed.

628
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,965
This is officially an outbreak.

629
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,033
Contact the housing
manager and let them know

630
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,130
that the residents are spreading
gonorrhea and need tests.

631
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:41,497
And condoms. But
Millin lives there.

632
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:42,883
Can't she just leave a note on
the social halls or something?

633
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,575
I don't care. Just
somebody let them know.

634
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,741
Sooner rather than later.

635
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,775
It's remarkable. Hmm.

636
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:53,920
It's the resilience,
the will to live.

637
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,801
Yeah. Never ceases
to amaze me.

638
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,175
Tia? Stable, for now.

639
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:07,497
And Dr. Lincoln is
waiting for you.

640
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:08,920
Yeah. Tell him
I'll be there soon.

641
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:11,701
Yeah, see, he said you'd say
that, and that I should say

642
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:15,592
if you want to operate again,
"soon" should be... now.

643
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:18,473
And then, he said that if I
couldn't get you to come out,

644
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:21,363
he'd make me pay for it.

645
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:22,690
Personally. Oh, my God.

646
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:25,131
Alright. I'm coming. Just...

647
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:28,331
page me if anything
changes, immediately.

648
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,477
Uh, mind if I stay with Connor?

649
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:42,529
I-I heard Tia tell Dr. Wilson
they were gonna name him Connor.

650
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,382
Hi, Connor.

651
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:59,296
What do you need, Yasuda?

652
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:00,806
Sorry I disappeared.

653
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:03,005
Did I miss anything?

654
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,843
Right.

655
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,559
Could I sit with
her for a minute?

656
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,862
Let you take a break,
grab some coffee?

657
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:11,412
No. Oh, um...

658
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,866
Okay. Then I'm... I'm...

659
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,743
No, she's hypotensive
and slightly tachy.

660
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,942
She's still bleeding
from her abdomen.

661
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:21,204
Oh, look at the wound vac.

662
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:22,503
Okay, uh, call the O.R.

663
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:24,394
Get the team up
here. Get over here.

664
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,179
S-Shouldn't we be taking
her back to the O.R.?

665
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:27,429
No time.

666
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:30,032
Y-Yasuda.

667
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,300
If I'm going to open this
woman up, I need your hands.

668
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,475
We're opening her up here?
We need to move, right now!

669
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,457
You'll have to wear the
sling for about four weeks,

670
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:43,202
but keep your elbow,
wrist, and hand moving.

671
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:44,619
It'll help.

672
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,752
And don't ignore
the PT exercises

673
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:48,729
no matter how exhausted you get.

674
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,380
Honestly, it...

675
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:55,783
it wouldn't be a terrible idea

676
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:58,101
to take a break from the
road for a couple of weeks.

677
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,181
Thank you.

678
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,082
It's me.

679
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:14,664
Talk to me.

680
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,139
You know, the irony...

681
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:20,361
of all of this is
that these people

682
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,976
are targeting me for
the abortion care

683
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,141
that I provide

684
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:28,101
when that is actually the
least common procedure

685
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:30,662
I am doing in the PRT.Mm.

686
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,871
I'm mostly providing
wellness checks,

687
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:38,605
prenatal care, annual...
pelvic exams, pap smears.

688
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,839
Since so many
clinics have closed

689
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,492
in the last several months,
I'm the only option they have.

690
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,109
It's exhausting.

691
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,239
It's a disaster.

692
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:54,369
Hmm.

693
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,355
And I can't take a break.

694
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,316
If I take a break, I mean,
who... who's gonna do the work?

695
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,090
When he suggested
that you take a break,

696
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:05,035
I thought you were gonna
throw the tablet at him.

697
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:06,304
Oh, I almost did.

698
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:09,134
What happened?

699
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,764
Wound vac was
soaked with blood.

700
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,928
She's still bleeding out.

701
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,718
I found it. It's the liver.

702
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:14,778
What do you want to do?

703
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,387
Uh, Pringle maneuver. Bedside?

704
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:18,023
Atraumatic clamps, please.

705
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,359
Yasuda, put your hand
where my hand is.

706
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,036
You're gonna hold
the bleeding here

707
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:24,511
while Wilson clamps the
blood flow to the liver.

708
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,793
Then I will try and
control the bleeding.

709
00:30:26,818 --> 00:30:28,031
Come on, come on.
Follow my hand.

710
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:30,092
Okay. Yeah. Here, I'll help.

711
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:31,888
Alright, alright. Like that?

712
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,018
Exactly like that.

713
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:34,320
Okay, go, Wilson.Okay.

714
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:36,278
Hepatoduodenal
ligament is clamped.

715
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:38,295
Okay, good. O-chromic
liver suture.

716
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,184
Great. Okay, alright.

717
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,998
Alright, I'm going deep.

718
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:44,772
I see it.

719
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,192
Okay, pressure's climbing.

720
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:52,188
Okay, scissors.

721
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:59,627
Okay, let's pack her and
get a new wound vac.Okay.

722
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:01,445
Not yet, Tia.

723
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,043
Too many people need you.

724
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,378
No sexual activity for a week.

725
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,785
We want to give the antibiotics
time to do their job.

726
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,984
You already told me, dear.

727
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:21,087
And I heard it when
you told Norma and Hal.

728
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,974
Just making sure. Can't
have a sick roomie.

729
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,647
Who else is gonna make me
the world's best French toast

730
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,039
when I work the night shift?

731
00:31:28,064 --> 00:31:30,619
It's all about a
drop of vanilla.

732
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:33,425
And I'm sorry that Hal
turned out to be such a jerk.

733
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,746
Me too. Guys can be pigs.

734
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,048
Gay ones, too.

735
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,282
Women can be...

736
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:45,268
At first, they tell us
not to have sex at all

737
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,986
and that we're sluts
if we enjoy it.

738
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:50,896
And then they tell us
if we get pregnant,

739
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,854
we must carry the
baby no matter what.

740
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:57,095
And once we're mothers,
whether by force or by choice,

741
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,156
they judge us for that, too.

742
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:02,422
Because there's certainly no
way to be a perfect mother.

743
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:06,340
So, as women, we get
judged and attacked

744
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:09,057
for every single
decision we ever make.

745
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:11,884
You want to know the
upside of this misogyny,

746
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:13,738
this patriarchy?

747
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:17,183
Women become invisible
around the age of 60,

748
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,073
and then you can do
whatever the hell you like,

749
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:25,354
including having a lot of great
sex, because no one cares.

750
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:30,643
And now, I have an
antibiotic and no regrets.

751
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:34,555
Except, perhaps, for waiting
so long to live my best life.

752
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:37,309
See you at home, dear.

753
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,688
Winston, I...

754
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,167
They cherry-picked my quotes,

755
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:00,679
took everything out of context.

756
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:03,361
But I'm making them change
it, and Teddy will help.

757
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,158
But you said it, so...

758
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,226
I also said that you were one
of the most brilliant surgeons

759
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,705
I have ever worked with, and
that we were equal partners.

760
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,939
We came up with that
procedure together.

761
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:15,254
I-I didn't even get
a mention.

762
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:16,935
Just one of the "assistants."

763
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,942
Journalists always
want to characterize me

764
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,887
as some kind of wunderkind
in a league of my own.

765
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,570
And it's just
clickbait. That's it.

766
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,265
Okay, so it's the
journalist's fault.

767
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,773
Winston, I... Take
some responsibility.

768
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,351
For once!

769
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,040
I can't control what other
people write about me.

770
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:36,699
Alright.

771
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:39,561
When did we stop giving each
other the benefit of the doubt?

772
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:45,444
I think it's when you
said you don't respect me.

773
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,332
And this article
reallydrives that home.

774
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,252
I want to fix this.

775
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,159
Tell me what to do to fix this.

776
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:04,049
I want to fix us.
Maggie, there's no fix.

777
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:07,012
T-There's just...
There's feelings.

778
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,775
Like, my God, say you're sorry.

779
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,596
Say you
got some things wrong.

780
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,876
Say you didn't mean to hurt me.

781
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,626
Say you understand how I feel.

782
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:18,516
Say you love me and mean it.

783
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:21,170
Say you respect me and mean it.

784
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:24,727
I respect you, Winston.

785
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,757
I don't believe you.

786
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:38,846
Dr. Sellers, 4619.

787
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,080
Dr. Mari Sellers, 4619

788
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,067
Hey.

789
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,475
They caught the driver.

790
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,395
They lifted the
hospital lockdown,

791
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,791
and if you want to
keep the clinic closed

792
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:51,370
for a couple days,
everyone would understand.

793
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,924
It'll be open tomorrow morning.

794
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:55,592
Dr. Bailey.

795
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:58,401
This is Brandon
Marwood, Tia's husband.

796
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,781
Sh... Is she, uh...

797
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:05,394
Is she gonna live?

798
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,460
Well, she's stable, for now.

799
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:11,236
We are giving her fluid and
putting her on sedation breaks

800
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:13,228
to monitor her brain function.

801
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,134
After all that she's been
through, there's no guarantees,

802
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,817
but we are hopeful
that she will wake up.

803
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:21,289
Okay. If Tia has shown
us anything today,

804
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:23,746
it's she's strong
and determined.

805
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:25,842
Yeah. She always has been.

806
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,421
Wanna go in and sit with her?

807
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:29,774
Yeah. Okay.
