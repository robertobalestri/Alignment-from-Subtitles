number-one draft pick,

59
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,420
and he's got his whole
career ahead of him.

60
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,630
And now the key
to saving his knee

61
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,091
and his entire NFL
future is in my hands.

62
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,885
Yeah. The most capable
hands in the whole state.

63
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,845
You're the one and
only ortho surgeon

64
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,848
to the Seattle Mariners!

65
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,643
That's the baseball
team. There it is!

66
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,687
And, you know, I wish Nico wasn't
traveling with them right now,

67
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,022
because I could really
use him as an assist.

68
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,691
You don't need him.

69
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,402
Think of all the people who
can walk and play sports

70
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,863
and enjoy their life
because of your hands.

71
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,324
That last part sounded
dirty, and I recognize it.

72
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,160
But you are a uniquely
gifted surgeon.

73
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,788
Oh, this is disgusting.

74
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:43,997
Your words.

75
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,834
Thank you!

76
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,837
Thank you.

77
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,130
Oh, hey, Altman.
Altman, hold up.

78
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,006
Um, is everything okay?

79
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,676
I mean, I haven't heard from
you since I submitted your offer

80
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,803
for chief of surgery,
which expires...

81
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:00,180
at 6:00 p. m. today.

82
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,849
Well, I still have
a few hours, then.

83
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,184
Look, since Marsh
left for a few days,

84
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,728
I'm filling in as
chief of surgery

85
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,189
<i>and</i> residency director,
on top of chief of chiefs,

86
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,693
which at my age is about
two chiefs too many.

87
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,695
I took a look at the offer.

88
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,072
And?

89
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,242
Owen has never had a kind
word to say about being chief,

90
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,202
Bailey quit, Meredith left,

91
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,954
and you didn't
exactly sell the idea

92
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,539
when I first inquired about it.

93
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,249
I just... I-I don't know
if I want it anymore.

94
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,667
It's a good offer, Altman.

95
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,252
You need this.

96
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,546
The hospital needs this.

97
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,636
I've got till,
uh, 6:00, right?

98
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:43,432
Oh, look at her.
Oh, she looks so happy.

99
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,558
Oh, audio.

100
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,564
She just started.

101
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,357
I am not laughing at Zola.

102
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,818
I am thinking about Meredith
living with a beginning cellist.

103
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,035
Morning.

104
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,703
Hi. Morning.

105
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,800
Whoa.

106
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,137
I would rather listen to a
squeaky cello than that silence.

107
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:23,931
How's therapy going?

108
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:27,184
Oh, every therapist in
Seattle is booked solid.

109
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,436
Our first appointment
is in three weeks.

110
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:33,148
So we've instituted a
ceasefire until then.

111
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,442
That silence was a ceasefire?

112
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,362
Silence is better
than every single word

113
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,738
that comes out of
either of our mouths.

114
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,832
Morning, Lincoln!

115
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,874
Dr. Bailey.

116
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,292
How's it going?

117
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,502
Good. You?

118
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,170
I'm great. Yeah. Hunt?

119
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,172
Oh, yeah, same, yeah.

120
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,258
You all want to meet the Tank.

121
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,759
Well, I may have,
uh, some free time.

122
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,803
Yeah. I've worked on
a lot of busted knees,

123
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,012
and I love the Seahawks.

124
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,430
Not as much as me. Wh...

125
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,890
You want to say
something? Say it.

126
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,475
Dr. Lincoln.

127
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,143
Do you need an assist?

128
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,521
Oh, you're a Seahawks fan, too?

129
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,314
Oh, well, the Tank and I
went to the same high school.

130
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,358
Listen, I-I
appreciate the offers,

131
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,360
but the Tank doesn't need
a room full of doctors

132
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:21,072
making his procedure seem
like a bigger deal than it is.

133
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,827
Now, were you surprised
at all by the draft pick?

134
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,328
Nah. Nah, not really.

135
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,454
Good morning.

136
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,331
Dr. Lincoln. Man of the hour.

137
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,209
I think that's you, the Tank.

138
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,129
Man of the year, according
to our Sunday feature.

139
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,505
Ken Bendix, <i>Seattle Times.</i>

140
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,008
Oh, yeah. I heard
you were coming.

141
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,260
And how are you feeling, hmm?

142
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,304
Any jitters? Come on, now.

143
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,764
The only jitters I get is waiting
for the football to be snapped.

144
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,475
Then folks better
watch out, because I'm coming.

145
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,519
Preach now. Yeah, we're
all rooting for you.

146
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,897
Half the hospital lobbied
me to be on your case.

147
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:56,064
The other half is...

148
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,441
in this room.

149
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,526
Yasuda, you want to present?

150
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,445
Jermaine Talbott, 22.

151
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,114
Tear to the left ACL
due to football injury.

152
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:04,991
History of multiple injuries,

153
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,408
including MCL repair

154
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,993
and meniscal cadaver transplant.

155
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,828
Today, he will receive

156
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,998
a bridge-enhanced anterior
cruciate ligament repair,

157
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,042
also known as the BEAR.

158
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,543
And why is this his best option?

159
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,503
It uses a collagen graft
soaked in the patient's blood,

160
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,922
instead of donor tissue,

161
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:20,964
which allows the
body to heal itself

162
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,090
and yields better results

163
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,342
than traditional ACL repairs.

164
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,093
Excellent. You're
scrubbing in.

165
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:29,890
Okay, yeah, but how else is the
BEAR important to my career?

166
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,892
It's less invasive.
Because it heals faster.

167
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,353
True, but not the
answer he's looking for.

168
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,563
It will allow him to ambulate
and return to play sooner.

169
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:39,942
Also yes, but no. Come on,
guys. I know someone's got this.

170
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,985
The Belser Bears. Played
as a true freshman.

171
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,655
Led the team in sacks and
tackles all four years.

172
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,782
Congratulations, Kwan.
You're scrubbing in, too.

173
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,909
The three of you will
report to Dr. Schmitt,

174
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,704
who I believe is,
conveniently, right outside.

175
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,834
It's every person
for themselves now.

176
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,461
I am <i>not</i> losing another surgery.

177
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,921
We don't have to
compete over everything.

178
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,381
First person to do
an actual procedure

179
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,965
gets the bedroom to
the left of the stairs.

180
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,092
What? I already
drew that room.

181
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,386
And I'm appealing
the draw. What?

182
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,056
Help! Please!

183
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,557
- I'm on it!
- Mine! Paws off!

184
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,310
Hi, I'm Dr. Adams. Can
you tell us what happened?

185
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,812
I failed, doc. I
couldn't do it.

186
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,355
You couldn't do what?

187
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,607
The Pho-Nomenal
Challenge. What is that?

188
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,609
The Pho-Nomenal Challenge
is three pounds of meat,

189
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,403
three pounds of noodles,
three liters of broth.

190
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,780
If you finish in an hour
and a half, you win $250.

191
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,073
Did you just come from there?

192
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,200
No, I tried it five days ago,

193
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,786
and I have not been able
to take a crap since.

194
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,037
Please help me.

195
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh, God.

196
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,727
What do you got?

197
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,854
A 23-year-old male, 5 days
without a bowel movement

198
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,272
after participating
in an eating contest.

199
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,356
Eating challenge.

200
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,899
Severe abdominal pain,

201
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,359
bloating, difficulty sitting.

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,486
Hey, I'm Dr. Schmitt.

203
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,905
Have you tried increasing
your water intake,

204
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,365
eating adequate
sources of fiber?

205
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,451
Exercise helps, reducing stress.

206
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,952
How am I supposed
to reduce stress

207
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,663
when my entire body
is full of pho?

208
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,165
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

209
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,292
I'm just... I'm
very uncomfortable.

210
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,877
Excuse me. Um...

211
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,128
Can I borrow one of you?

212
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:23,880
Me! Is it surgical?

213
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,046
Go, Millin.

214
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,134
Get a KUB and then do
a digital rectal exam.

215
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,260
Wait, I'm sorry. Digital?

216
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,636
Yeah, a finger. It helps us...

217
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,764
Okay, d... Never mind.

218
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,307
After ruling everything out,

219
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,184
you can try a stool
softener or an enema.

220
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,771
If none of that works, then we
can consider doing a procedure.

221
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,899
Ow! God!

222
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Still want that room?

223
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,738
Oh! God!

224
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,617
Lupe. Lupe, I'm on
the phone, amor, okay?

225
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,744
Okay.

226
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,037
Uh, Sierra Deleon?

227
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,288
She can cover?

228
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,999
Great. Thank you.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,375
Okay, sorry.

230
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,419
I needed to make sure
my shift was covered.

231
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,506
Um, I'm pregnant with my
third, and I'm spotting.

232
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:09,216
Uh, here,
sweetie. Come here.

233
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,635
Yeah. It's a plane.
You can play here.

234
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,719
Okay, so how long have
you been spotting?

235
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,387
A few days.

236
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,514
At first, I didn't
think too much of it,

237
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,390
but now I'm starting
to get a bit stressed.

238
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,600
Oh! Lupe.

239
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,893
Okay.

240
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,311
Sorry about that.

241
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,729
Here, go
sit down. Go sit down.

242
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,272
Go sit.

243
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,233
Have you experienced
any clotting or noticed

244
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,567
an increase in the
amount of blood?

245
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,361
Maybe.

246
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,821
I'm not really sure.

247
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,781
Lupe's dad drives
cross-country rigs,

248
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,866
which means I'm lucky if
I get out the front door

249
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,159
with deodorant on.

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Alright, I'm going to page OB.

251
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,870
We're gonna get
you an ultrasound

252
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,372
to see if we can find the
cause of the bleeding.

253
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,998
Okay.

254
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,959
Alright, I'll see you in a bit.

255
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,919
Eeh!

256
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,130
Thanks.

257
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:49,589
Oh, now, I'm texting
this to my husband.

258
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,674
He's gonna be jealous.

259
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,050
He's a Tank fan?

260
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:54,344
Ah, saw you play at Royer High

261
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,720
before you were even the Tank.

262
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,430
He predicted you
were gonna be a star.

263
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,890
Oh, okay. So I guess
he's gonna be jealous

264
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,642
and smug. Mm.

265
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,687
I was on a nighttime ER
rotation in the Caribbean

266
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,690
when you had that pick
six to win the Rose Bowl.

267
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,608
First time I tore my meniscus.

268
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,528
But we won the championship,
so... worth it.

269
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,071
Storm took out the
hospital Wi-Fi,

270
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,781
and I had the only hot spot.

271
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,284
Everyone... patients, doctors...

272
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,161
They all had opinions
on how to treat you.

273
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,620
Oh. One of their own.

274
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,539
And now you're my patient.

275
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,457
Mm, that's an interesting angle.

276
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,792
Do you have a few minutes?

277
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,793
Could I ask you some questions?

278
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,211
Uh...

279
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,296
Bring it on.

280
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,338
How about we step outside?

281
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,798
Eh... hold on.

282
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,008
Oh, daycare.

283
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,384
Oh.

284
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,052
I'd better see what that is.

285
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,637
Um, thank you for
the photo, Tank.

286
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,431
No problem.

287
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:40,765
Bye.

288
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,144
<i>Dr. Azzi to Oncology.</i>

289
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,229
<i>Dr. Yasmin Azzi to Oncology.</i>

290
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,898
This one?

291
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,150
You know, I had a couple
ACL repairs in college.

292
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,318
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

293
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,069
Busted my knee ice skating.

294
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,030
Used to be pretty
competitive. Used to?

295
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,615
Your recovery didn't
go well or something?

296
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:59,034
No, no, it went great.
But you couldn't skate?

297
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,869
Oh, I didn't have time.
I got into med school.

298
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,787
Then it's on and popping.

299
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:03,747
Ayyy! I feel that.

300
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,125
I know you do, now.

301
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,085
Hey, the kids
okay? I just got paged.

302
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,670
Yeah, me, too.

303
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,422
They probably threw
blocks at each other again

304
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,258
and file some sort of
injury report or something.

305
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,594
Huh. Hey, there is another
plus about being chief.

306
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,054
They usually bring
that paperwork to you.

307
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,847
Okay.

308
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,308
And you get a part-time
administrative assistant,

309
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,310
which is essential for
such an important job.

310
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,646
Richard told you that
if I took the job,

311
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:28,813
that you'd be chief of
trauma again, didn't he?

312
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,732
No.

313
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,942
Oh, my God.

314
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,152
He briefly floated it.

315
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,403
Once again, it's all about you.

316
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,738
No, it's about us.

317
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,033
Yeah, when it's
convenient for <i>you.</i>

318
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,081
Were all the parents paged?

319
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,041
Just the parents
involved in the bite.

320
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,626
Your kid bit my kid.

321
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,336
Which? Allison. Bit Pru.

322
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,837
That seems like
a one-parent job.

323
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,673
Let's make this one about you.

324
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,930
We are so sorry.

325
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:07,769
Okay, Sierra, you're
about 11 weeks along.

326
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,187
Hit the nail on the head.

327
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,399
There is a strong
fetal heart beat,

328
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,192
and your cervix
was closed on exam,

329
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,819
so everything looks good.

330
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,821
Your pregnancy is
right on track.

331
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:22,534
You just need to rest and
avoid strenuous activity.

332
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,661
Her BMP came back.
She's dehydrated.

333
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,913
So just make sure she gets some
fluids before you discharge.

334
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,164
Yeah, absolutely.

335
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,458
Okay, so we'll get you that IV,

336
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,668
and you'll be out
of here in no time.

337
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,378
Oh. Great.

338
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,171
Mommy, the phone.

339
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,215
Thank you.

340
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,509
Hey. What? She can't come in?

341
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,386
But she told me she was
gonna come in at 10:00.

342
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,846
Excuse me. No.
I'll... I'll call her.

343
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:43,972
I'll call her.

344
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,265
Is everything all right?

345
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,266
Not really.

346
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,311
Yes.

347
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:50,312
Everything's okay.

348
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,813
Thank you.

349
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,690
Well, I'll get you
those IV fluids,

350
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,651
and, um, you just
sit tight. Okay.

351
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,403
<i>Dr. Kurtz to Oncology.</i>

352
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,448
<i>Dr. Fritz to oncology.</i>

353
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,491
I didn't know colleges
had ice skating teams.

354
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,993
Of course you didn't.

355
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:07,120
Because we were hitting
the ice at 5:00 a. m.,

356
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,997
and the football team was still
getting their beauty sleep.

357
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,834
I had to stay focused
so I could go pro.

358
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,419
But now I gotta
kick it up a notch.

359
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,670
For the team?

360
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,005
For my family.

361
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,298
Playing ball is what will let me

362
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,341
bring them over
from Port-au-Prince.

363
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,259
Haiti? My real hometown.

364
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,053
Yeah.

365
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,555
A scout saw me play when
I was in the sixth grade.

366
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,767
He asked my uncle, would
he let me train in Seattle?

367
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,602
Guess what he
told the guy? Hm?

368
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:33,021
"Why
the hell not?"

369
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,689
So I moved by myself.

370
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,358
I was 11.

371
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,401
I get to go home and see my mom

372
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,195
and my little brothers
every Christmas,

373
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,489
but that's about it.

374
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,408
This is my chance to finally
get everyone back together.

375
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,243
So I gotta get back
on that field ASAP.

376
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,787
You want to succeed
so it means something.

377
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:49,747
Sit up for me.

378
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:50,789
And deep breath.

379
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,837
What if it doesn't work?

380
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,550
What if he can't repair it and
I'm stuck bagging groceries?

381
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,553
What if I can't play ball again?

382
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,681
But what if you <i>can?</i>

383
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,905
That is a
lot of fecal matter.

384
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,865
It's really good pho.

385
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,367
It's a hole-in-the-wall
in the CID.

386
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,701
You should try it.

387
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,203
Well, since you like it so much,

388
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,080
why don't you go in
and give the enema?

389
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,539
Are you offering the bedroom?

390
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,748
If you throw in two
weeks' groceries.

391
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,083
No deal. I know
how much you eat.

392
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,001
Not as much as this guy.

393
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,213
Oh, you know what?
Screw it. Gimme that.

394
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,633
Okay, bye. Mwah. Mwah.

395
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,638
Again, I am so, so
sorry. Oh, please.

396
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,848
I spoke to her.

397
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,474
It was a one-time thing.

398
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,976
Allison had something to say,

399
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,102
and she couldn't
get the words out.

400
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,520
Kids bite. It happens.

401
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,896
Thanks.

402
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,274
So, have you thought
more about chief?

403
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,068
Well, it's a great
title and a pay bump,

404
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,111
but is that really enough to...

405
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,237
No. No?

406
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,446
No, it's not a pay bump.

407
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,408
It's more like a
nudge, a small tap.

408
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,286
It certainly
isn't enough to justify

409
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,664
the relentless paperwork
and protocols and meetings

410
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,957
and complaints.

411
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,001
So... many... complaints.

412
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,962
That's why Webber
doesn't have any takers.

413
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,132
But <i>you</i> are in a
very interesting

414
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,884
negotiating position, Altman,

415
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:27,385
'cause they need you.

416
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,556
And if I were you,
I'd ask for the moon.

417
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:32,807
And the planets.

418
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,976
And Pluto.

419
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,777
What exactly do you think
that all looks like?

420
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,232
Well, if it were me...

421
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,651
A full-time
administrative assistant

422
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,404
who will be the point person
for any staff complaints.

423
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,657
And this person will also attend
budget meetings in my place

424
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,826
if I am unavailable and
take notes for my review.

425
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,579
I will need an additional
three weeks off

426
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,541
and double the pay increase
that you're currently offering.

427
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,211
And a... a stipend for research.

428
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:04,214
Oh. Well, this is
a lot to consider.

429
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,716
These are my terms... Sir.

430
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,428
Um, I-I'm gonna need some
time to think this over.

431
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,096
I'm sure you understand.

432
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,598
Of course.

433
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,319
Hey. Hey.

434
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,820
I thought you were
clipping an aneurysm.

435
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,656
Yeah, I finished.

436
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,449
What are you working on?

437
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,077
My case report for my
partial heart transplant.

438
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,412
The one on the
baby? Arlo Fischer.

439
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,249
Why would I write "socks"?

440
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,710
I have no idea. But
you know who might?

441
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,421
I'm not breaking the ceasefire.

442
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,632
And I need to get this done
in less than three weeks.

443
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,884
You're worried another cardio
surgeon might beat you to it?

444
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,014
I need a win.

445
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,268
I need a victory, because I feel
like I'm failing at my marriage,

446
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,644
and I do not fail.

447
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,437
I hate failing.

448
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,691
Hiding from the hard parts
won't make it less hard.

449
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,403
It'll just make it last longer.

450
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,906
Trust me.

451
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,037
It's not a durag,
Mommy, it's for surgery.

452
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,956
I wore it for the last
two, you remember?

453
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,666
<i>You look so adorable.</i>

454
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,502
<i>Now, let me meet
everyone in that room.</i>

455
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,337
This is Dr. Kwan.

456
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,588
Hi.

457
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,715
And this is Dr. Griffith.

458
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,882
Very nice to meet you.

459
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,925
<i>Where's Dr. Lincoln?</i>

460
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,427
He's already in the OR.

461
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,304
We're about to take
Jermaine there now.

462
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,971
<i>Both of you look at me.</i>

463
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,141
<i>My son has broken
records with his talent.</i>

464
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,892
Yes, ma'am. <i>And noses.</i>

465
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,519
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,729
<i>You know where he
got that strength?</i>

467
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,980
His mama.

468
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,107
<i>Take care of my baby.</i>

469
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,526
<i>I love you.</i>

470
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,527
<i>Eyes forward.</i>

471
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,737
<i>You hear me?</i>

472
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,614
<i>Eyes forward.</i>

473
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:54,574
Eyes forward.

474
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,159
Na pale pita.

475
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,745
<i>Na pale pita,
chéri. Je t'aime.</i>

476
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,876
I'm ready. Mm-hmm.

477
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,141
Hey. I just wanted to
wish you good luck.

478
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,726
Not that you need it.

479
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,645
I'll take it.

480
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,980
After everything Jermaine's
sacrificed to play,

481
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,621
he doesn't deserve to
be riding the bench.

482
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,028
I just
gotta stay sharp.

483
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,571
It's been a while since I've
been in the pressure cooker,

484
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,156
you know? Well...

485
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,158
you've never folded before.

486
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,077
You're not gonna start now.

487
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,787
I know it.

488
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,551
Oh. Thank you.

489
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,387
So, uh, I have
considered your offer.

490
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,222
Ready to shake
on it? You know,

491
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:03,851
Grey-Sloan is a place where...

492
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,979
Where legacies are built,
history is written.

493
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,359
Working here, for me, I mean,
evokes a feeling of... duty.

494
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,486
It's an honor to serve.

495
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:18,449
And often, service
requires sacrifice.

496
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,201
It's a little weird
to put it that way,

497
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,078
especially to someone who
actually served, but...

498
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,246
Uh, I'm... I'm not done yet.

499
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,789
Oh. Thank you.

500
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,085
When I see these
doctors, these patients,

501
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,753
it brings me joy.

502
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,714
It makes me happy,

503
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,674
um, fulfilled.

504
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,092
Oh.

505
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,511
And thinking about all of this,

506
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,723
well, Altman, I've decided
to take the job myself.

507
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,475
I-I
love being here.

508
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,185
I even love the building itself.

509
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,062
And, um, I'm... I'm happy

510
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,981
with the money that's
already on the table.

511
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,275
It's not about that for me.

512
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,110
So, um...

513
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,653
thank you for your
time, Dr. Altman.

514
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,826
Fine. We can lose the stipend.

515
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,037
Oh. Okay.

516
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,876
We will... lose the... stipend.

517
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,965
Excuse me.

518
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,552
Excuse me. Hey.

519
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,345
Hey. What'd I miss?

520
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,181
They sutured the ACL and
are making the tunnels.

521
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,182
They're about to prepare
the implant for placement.

522
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,685
He wasn't asking me, was he?

523
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,145
Very much not.

524
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,272
Man, I hope this goes well.

525
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,733
The Tank has suffered
enough setbacks.

526
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,068
Are, uh, things better at home?

527
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,570
You know, all due...
All due respect,

528
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,363
the last time we talked,
you gave me some advice

529
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,450
that kinda blew up in my face.

530
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,243
Maggie's been
staying with Amelia.

531
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,746
Wh... Oh. Um...

532
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:47,830
I'm sorry.

533
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,582
It's... It's my fault.

534
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,669
I should have thought twice
before I took advice from you.

535
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,963
What's that supposed to mean?

536
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,257
I mean, how are
things with Teddy?

537
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,259
Fair point. Yeah.

538
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,803
The tunnels are made.

539
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,013
He's ready for the scaffold.

540
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,725
As amazing as I am, the Tank
weighs close to 320 pounds,

541
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,144
and he can run 40 yards
in less than 5 seconds,

542
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,437
which means he can
take down a quarterback

543
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,398
with roughly 1,700
pounds of force.

544
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,775
Never mind what that's
doing to his brain.

545
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,151
That's a whole
other conversation.

546
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,862
But it takes a
toll on the knees.

547
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,303
How long
can he sustain that?

548
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,368
Oh, on average, these defensive
players get about six years.

549
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,745
So it's only one year longer
than residency and he's done?

550
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,206
Let's hope he's
better than average.

551
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,667
<i>Third
floor nurses' station.</i>

552
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,337
<i>O. T. Morell to the third
floor nurses' station.</i>

553
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,723
Is everything okay?

554
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,267
Sorry.

555
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,434
Lupe threw my
things on the floor

556
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,603
and I-I haven't
picked them up yet.

557
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,106
Well, your IV is almost done.

558
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,907
Are you experiencing any
pain in your abdomen?

559
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,153
Sierra?

560
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,906
I can't help but
notice you seem...

561
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,658
I just have a lot on my mind.

562
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,493
Sorry, I-I know you're busy.

563
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,620
Hey, don't apologize.

564
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,209
I know what it feels
like to be overwhelmed,

565
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,795
and I only have myself
to take care of.

566
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,380
If there's something
on your mind,

567
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,008
you can talk to me
about it if you want.

568
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,303
The condom broke.

569
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,849
My husband and I use condoms
because I hate the way

570
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,018
birth control
pills make me feel.

571
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,311
And it broke.

572
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,772
I wasn't trying to get pregnant.

573
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,566
Especially after my other two.

574
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,903
And, don't get me wrong, I
love the hell out of them.

575
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:42,946
I do.

576
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,282
But I'm scared it's
gonna come back.

577
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:49,368
What's going to
come back, Sierra?

578
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,704
After I gave birth
to my two kids,

579
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:56,792
I just felt this huge
wave rushing towards me.

580
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,961
I would look at them,

581
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,630
and I know I love them,

582
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:04,675
but I was so exhausted
and so defeated.

583
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,885
Depressed?

584
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,095
It was really dark.

585
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,349
<i>I</i> was really dark.

586
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,392
Both times.

587
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,103
Both babies.

588
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,522
And the doctor called it
postpartum depression,

589
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,816
and he prescribed me
a few medications,

590
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,236
talk therapy, but
nothing worked.

591
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,323
And it lasted for
months and months.

592
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,576
So when I saw that I
was spotting, I felt...

593
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,955
like I could breathe.

594
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:38,834
Sierra, did you... do anything

595
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,712
to try and terminate
this pregnancy?

596
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,298
No. Okay.

597
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,593
But when I thought I was
having a miscarriage,

598
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,472
I wasn't so terrified about
having to go through that again.

599
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:56,352
I wasn't so terrified that I
wouldn't be here for my babies.

600
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,278
How much is an abortion?

601
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,489
Our reproductive clinic
provides counseling

602
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,992
and abortion services
on a sliding scale.

603
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,953
Would you like me to call
someone from down there?

604
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,830
Okay.

605
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,167
That's the smallest
incision I've seen

606
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,294
for a procedure so complex.

607
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,839
When I was training, they used
to flay open the entire joint

608
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,258
and staple it back together
Frankenstein-style.

609
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,634
Mm. These days...

610
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,635
art.

611
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,234
Alright, okay. Well
done, everybody.

612
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,777
Now let's bandage
up the Tank's knee

613
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,696
and roll him back to
recovery and let him rest.

614
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,322
No gawkers in the hallways

615
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,907
waiting around awkwardly
for autographs.

616
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:55,202
And absolutely no selfies.

617
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:00,708
What are you doing?

618
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,959
Can't rush the rectum.

619
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,919
Wh... Uh, you're a surgeon.

620
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,337
<i>We</i> are surgeons.

621
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,714
Yeah, and general surgery's

622
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,758
all about poop in
the pipes, Skywalker.

623
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,093
Curtains or shades?

624
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,511
My room gets a lot of light.

625
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,930
Eh, it's not your room
until you have success.

626
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,685
Yes!

627
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,520
Jared, how are you feeling?

628
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,689
I feel like I just
lost 10 pounds.

629
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,066
Pho-tastic!

630
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,734
It's another dish on the menu.

631
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,361
I want to say thank you
so much for your help.

632
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,488
Now I can go back.

633
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,114
Uh, um, I'm sorry?

634
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,075
To the restaurant. I
need to win that $250.

635
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,951
Uh, sir, I really think

636
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,495
you should let your digestive
system... Am I free to go?

637
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,497
Yeah, you are free to go.

638
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:42,458
Uh, yeah, you just have to
sign some forms at the... desk.

639
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,959
Good luck!

640
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,256
Curtains it is.

641
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,218
Oh, wait. Stop scrolling.

642
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,761
His mom's phone number.

643
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,763
You think Dr. Lincoln
will let me call Nadine,

644
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,515
let her know Jermaine's
out of surgery?

645
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:00,392
Nadine? What, are we on a
first-name basis with his mom?

646
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,812
Yeah, it's called
listening to your patient.

647
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,355
You know, compassion,

648
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,440
bedside manner,
that kind of thing.

649
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,150
Okay, so you're saying I
don't have any of that?

650
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,443
Oh, you said it, not me.

651
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,154
Sats dropped to the 70s.

652
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,948
Heart rate in the 140s.

653
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,658
So in terms of
physical therapy...

654
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,159
Dr. Lincoln!

655
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,577
What's going on?

656
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,037
His vitals just
started plummeting.

657
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,248
BP is now below 90/70.

658
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,874
Damn it. He was fine
two minutes ago.

659
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,167
Alright, start him on pressors.

660
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,752
We need to
re-intubate him. Now!

661
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,504
Get Ndugu and get me an
intubation tray. Yeah.

662
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:42,226
I don't see anything.
His D-dimer's elevated,

663
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,227
his sats are failing, he
has right heart strain.

664
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,520
There's a clot.
Then where is it?

665
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,272
Dr. Lincoln. I'm
sorry, I'm just...

666
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,860
Kwan, get him away from there.

667
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,236
Found it.

668
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,571
Large saddle PE
at the bifurcation

669
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:54,864
of his pulmonary artery.

670
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,448
He needs an emergent
embolectomy.

671
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,242
Alright, he needs a heparin
infusion immediately.

672
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,326
Alright, let's get to
the IR suite right now.

673
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,619
Let's move.

674
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,417
Half your assistant's salary
is gonna come off your side.

675
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,127
Now, I can't double your pay,

676
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,797
but I am ready to offer you
25% above your initial offer.

677
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,299
Which is insulting.

678
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,509
75% over, and you pay
for the assistant.

679
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,094
You know, when I look
at these halls...

680
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,596
Oh, please.

681
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,140
Tell me about how
you <i>served</i> again.

682
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,475
Dr. Webber. Dr. Altman.

683
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,852
Uh, Shepherd?

684
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,562
I hope I'm not too late.

685
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,403
I would like to be
considered for the position.

686
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,151
Chief of surgery.

687
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,819
You have got to be kidding me.

688
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,450
At 11 weeks, we can
do an in-office procedure

689
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,076
to terminate the pregnancy.

690
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,536
Do you use a knife?

691
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,122
No. We use suction. No blades.

692
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,665
Will you put me to sleep?

693
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,875
Because I have to pick up Manny,

694
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:48,835
and I have to cook them dinner.

695
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,210
No, you'll be awake.

696
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,588
We can even have a
volunteer take Lupe

697
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,949
for ice cream during
the procedure.

698
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,509
Will it hurt?

699
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,637
You'll feel discomfort at times,

700
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,890
but we use an anesthetic
to numb the area.

701
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,107
I love my kids.

702
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,902
I want to stay alive for them.

703
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,197
I want to be okay for them.

704
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,241
I can't do this again.

705
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,411
Okay.

706
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,789
Do you want to assist?

707
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,960
I'll see you in a bit.

708
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,216
He's young, the
surgery went perfectly.

709
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,551
I don't understand how a clot
this size formed this quickly.

710
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,971
It shouldn't. But it can.

711
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,472
You're saying I should
have seen this coming?

712
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,932
I'm saying there's nothing
you could have done

713
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,350
to prevent this from happening.

714
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,185
Is that a V-Fib?

715
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,312
Get me a crash cart.
I'm pulling the wire.

716
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,774
Paddles.

717
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,901
Charge to 150.

718
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,488
Clear.

719
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,449
Push another epi.
Charge to 200.

720
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,034
Clear.

721
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,411
Again.

722
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,162
Come on, Tank. Come on.

723
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,456
Clear!

724
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,254
Come on.

725
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,672
Eyes forward, Jermaine.

726
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,133
Eyes forward.

727
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,553
Yes, I love you, too.

728
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,138
If you have to leave, it's okay.

729
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,180
I'll be fine.

730
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,807
He wants to stay on.

731
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,850
Is it okay if I'm on the phone?

732
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,394
Of course. Yes.

733
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,187
Okay, are you ready?

734
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,856
Okay.

735
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,609
I'm going to use my hands
to do a bimanual exam

736
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,696
to determine the shape and
location of your cervix.

737
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,240
Okay. I wish you
were here, too.

738
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,284
Now we're going to
insert the speculum,

739
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,618
just like a routine pap smear.

740
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,495
Okay.

741
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,416
And we will hold it still
with this instrument.

742
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,667
Okay.

743
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,794
Alright.

744
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,422
Now, Sierra, you may
feel some discomfort

745
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,966
as we administer two
shots to numb the area.

746
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,176
Okay, ready?

747
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,471
You're doing great.

748
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,681
Okay.

749
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,017
Millin, we'll wait a few minutes
for the paracervical block

750
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,227
to take effect before
we dilate the cervix.

751
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,353
How are you doing, Sierra?

752
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,855
I'm okay. Okay.

753
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,398
Yes, I'm still here.

754
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,816
No, no, no. I'm fine.

755
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,652
Okay, let's follow
along via ultrasound.

756
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,489
It's just an ultrasound.

757
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,157
It doesn't hurt.

758
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,450
Gel's just cold.

759
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,702
We'll measure the
length of her uterus

760
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,370
before we dilate the cervix.

761
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,790
Okay, Sierra, you ready?

762
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,917
Okay, Dr. Millin,
what do you see?

763
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,043
The uterus is 10 centimeters.

764
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,336
Okay, great.

765
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,671
We're going to
dilate the cervix.

766
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:40,839
Here we go.

767
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,259
Okay.

768
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,179
Doing great, Sierra.

769
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,056
Okay, last one.

770
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,432
Okay.

771
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:54,186
Now, Sierra, I'm going
to use this catheter

772
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,146
along the walls of your uterus.

773
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,231
Okay, are you ready?

774
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,275
Yes. Okay, here we go.

775
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,944
Doing great.

776
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,781
And, okay, removing
the catheter.

777
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,034
Dr. Millin will use ultrasound
to verify completion.

778
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,497
Uterus is clear.

779
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,873
Okay.

780
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:18,043
Removing the forceps.

781
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:21,046
And removing the speculum.

782
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,548
That's it?

783
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,757
And that's it.

784
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,676
It's over.

785
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:29,680
Yes, I'm okay.

786
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:30,722
I'm okay.

787
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,513
Charge again.

788
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,557
Link. Charge again!

789
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,309
We've been doing this
for two hours, man.

790
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,727
He's gone.

791
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,617
Time of death...

792
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,118
15:45.

793
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,874
Okay.

794
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,209
I'll walk out first.

795
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,501
Maybe I can stall the press.

796
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,046
No. No.

797
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,881
All they see is a
football player.

798
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,549
Stats and dollar signs.

799
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,344
He was just a kid
doing what he loved.

800
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,012
Now he's gone.

801
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,225
That's on me.

802
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,834
- Mommy.
- Oh.

803
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,795
Hey!

804
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,128
You got that?

805
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,005
Yeah. Okay, so, you, um,

806
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,465
you may experience some cramping

807
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,217
and some spotting over
the next few days.

808
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,261
It's totally normal.

809
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,806
If you feel uncomfortable,
ibuprofen will help. Okay.

810
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,850
Uh, if you feel any dizziness
or experience heavy bleeding,

811
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,435
please call us.

812
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,062
Thank you both.

813
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,523
You're an incredible mom.

814
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,942
Come on. Let's go.

815
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,610
Hey.

816
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,570
<i>Dr. Wagner in Radiology.</i>

817
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:54,157
Great work today, Millin.

818
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,660
A lot of interns can
regurgitate a textbook,

819
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,578
but not many can talk
to a patient like you.

820
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,582
What?

821
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,213
I-I've just never had someone
compliment my work before.

822
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,010
It's safe to say I-I grew
up a little left of normal.

823
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,512
My parents taught me
to clear energy fields

824
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,472
and roll a joint at 10.

825
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,974
That kind of reputation

826
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:22,019
didn't exactly pave
the way for success.

827
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,563
Well, coming from
someone who didn't have

828
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:27,566
the most conventional
upbringing, either...

829
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,568
you saved that
woman's life today.

830
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,987
You could've walked
away, but you didn't.

831
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,239
You stayed and listened,

832
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,907
and Sierra is better off for it.

833
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,163
Excuse me.

834
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,169
And not to mention,
I've just come off

835
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,004
an award-winning research
project on Parkinson's,

836
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,464
which will boost the
profile of this hospital

837
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,215
if I'm the new chief.

838
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:55,385
Are you asking for anything
specific in the offer?

839
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,304
Well, I would need
twice the existing rate

840
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,891
and full flexibility to
travel to visiting labs.

841
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:03,644
Also, I found out what they're
paying at Seattle Pres.

842
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,813
You should be a
little embarrassed.

843
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,279
Why do you have to
visit other labs

844
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,697
when we have a lab
right here for you?

845
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:16,818
I don't need to go anywhere.

846
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,499
I'm sorry, Dr. Shepherd.

847
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,668
I'm unable to consider
your application.

848
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,795
I've already offered
the job to Dr. Altman.

849
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,674
75% above your existing rate,

850
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,967
a full-time administrative
assistant, and a stipend.

851
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,135
A <i>small</i> stipend.

852
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,387
Deal.

853
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,606
You're welcome.

854
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:52,234
What? Bailey sent me in here.

855
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,444
