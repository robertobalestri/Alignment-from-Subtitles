00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,095

Oh, it's so good to see you.

108
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,268
So, how long has this
clinic been open?

109
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,737
45 years.

110
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,905
Last year, we provided
more than 2,000 patients

111
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,007

prenatal care,

112
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,276

117
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,285
Well, it seems like
there's plenty of demand.

118
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,021
Yeah, we added a construction
trailer when Roe was overturned,

119
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,791
and I moved our staff
offices and break room

120
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,661
so we could convert more
space for these exam rooms.

121
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,162
Smart. Okay.

122
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,599

fit a full-size couch

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,334

and a mini fridge.

124
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,370
Yeah, well, I can
figure out space,

125
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,472
but without volunteers like you,

126
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:09,141
coming from Seattle and
Spokane, I'd be sunk.

127
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,810
Alright. Put us to work.

128
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,146

who are ready to be seen.

129
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,215
These are the patients
who have not been seen.

130
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,385
It's a low-tech operation,

131
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,786
but somehow it
gets the job done.

132
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,053
Okay. Okay.

reunion is happening?

136
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,466

mean my #workfamily.

00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,802
You want a photo? Let's
get one. I don't, actually.

138
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,904
Good morning, Tom. I
see you haven't changed.

139
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,373
Well, you might want to stop by
ophthalmology, seventh floor,

140
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,575
east wing, because I've
toned the glutes and the abs.

141
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,411
Wow. No, Bostonians
are noticing.

142
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,645
I haven't heard that.

143
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,879

Oh, it's not your business.

149
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,722
Well, I run the foundation,
so actually it is.

Tell me everything.

156
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,370
Can we go up to your office

157
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,442
so that I can have my
nervous breakdown in private?

158
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,852
Okay, Jessica, uh, do you
have enough prenatal vitamins?

159
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,186
They're still free.

160
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,456
I could use more. Okay.

161
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,691
Okay, come back in
two weeks, yeah?

162
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,025
Um, great.

163
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,293
I made all my
appointments weeks ago.

164
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,228
It's too hard to get
in here otherwise.

165
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,563
Alright, take good care.

166
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,631
I loved my "measure and
listen" appointments

167
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,899
when I was pregnant with Tuck.

168
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,768
My favorite part
about being an OB.

169
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,436
Mm-hmm. So, what
have you had so far?

170
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,439
Um, I did consults
with six women

171
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,441
who wanted medication abortions.

172
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,611
I gave pills to five.
Did someone need a D&C?

173
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,613
They changed their mind.

174
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,683
We are making progress. Mm.

175
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,422
Progress is neither
swift nor easy.

176
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,291
Marie Curie.

177
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,126
First woman to win
the Nobel Prize.

178
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,062
Think she knew what she
was talking about. Mm.

179
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,664
Dad-o.

180
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,399
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got
him, I got him, I got him.

181
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,267
He's in there somewhere.

182
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,504
Dad-o. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm looking for him,

183
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,605
I'm looking for him.

184
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,939
Ah, here's Dad-o, here's Dad-o.

185
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,007
Aw, damn it.

186
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,441
C-Crap.

187
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,076
I mean, u-uh... Uh,
whatever, whatever.

188
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,078
Sorry.

189
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,954
You getting out?

190
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,657
No. You?

191
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,127
Going down.

192
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,673
Wow. He's Lincoln's.

193
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,374
And Shepherd's.
We know what's up.

194
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,476
I'm just dropping
him off at daycare.

195
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,879
Shepherd had an emergency
and needed a favor.

196
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,981
Wonder what other kinds
of favors he does for her.

197
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,050
What's that?

198
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,885
You going to the
lunch-and-learn today?

199
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,119
Dad-o.

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,155
Oh, my God, he just
called you Dad.

201
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,723
No, no, no.

202
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,391
It's h-his dino.

203
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,495
He... He... He
can't say "dino."

204
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,799
Alright. Isn't the
daycare two floors up?

205
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,636
Uh, stairs are good exercise.

206
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,643
I miss paper.

207
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,178
Same.

208
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,682
Except, at least with e-records,
I can read my own notes.

209
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,919
I've got a 39-year-old with a
cesarean-scar ectopic pregnancy.

210
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,654
C-section scar?

211
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,324
Yes, the fetus can attach to
the scar on the uterine wall.

212
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,093
Her OB found it on an
ultrasound this morning.

213
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,395
He wouldn't remove
it. They're in Idaho.

214
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,764
It's a life-threatening case,
so there should be an exception.

215
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,767
There's cardiac activity. He
didn't want to take the risk.

216
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,603
The law is confusing.

217
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,771
Nobody wants to be the first
one to lose their license

218
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,439
or be charged with a felony.

219
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,441
Alright. I'll see
her. Which room?

220
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,077
Across the border in Moscow.

221
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,346
She called from the
OB's parking lot.

222
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,216
Also, her car won't start.

223
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,884
You wanted to help.

224
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,754
I'll get the keys.

225
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,058
What do you mean
"panic attacks"?

226
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,595
You know, she gets
dizzy, her body shakes,

227
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,196
she has trouble breathing.

228
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,365
How often is this happening?

229
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,634
Often enough.

230
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,435
I mean, her grades are slipping.

231
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,137
She can't relate to her friends.

232
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,640
Because she's scared
of Alzheimer's?

233
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,043
I-I mean, she's very bright,

234
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,312
and she's under-stimulated
at school, and her mind

235
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,582
goes in 17 different
directions at one time.

236
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,419
And she's very aware that Ellis
died of early-onset Alzheimer's.

237
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,656
And so of course
her mind goes there.

238
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:52,759
She's afraid that I will get
it, that Maggie will get it.

239
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,226
Alright. So, how
you handling it all?

240
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,394
Therapy or...

241
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,829
We go to therapy once a week.

242
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,665
But it's not enough.

243
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,067
I mean, she has severe anxiety,
and I completely missed it.

244
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,502
She was always my
cheerful child.

245
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,004
I never had to worry about her.

246
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,173
Right. So you didn't.

247
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,009
I just want to help her.

248
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,944
I just want to comfort her.

249
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,280
I don't know what to
do. I am so exhausted.

250
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,916
I stay up every
night, just reading

251
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,252
pages and pages and pages
about Alzheimer's, thinking,

252
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,421
"Oh, if I cure Alzheimer's,
I can help Zola."

253
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,622
Ridiculous.

254
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,191
Makes absolutely no sense.

255
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:30,163
It's ridiculous, I know, but
I just feel powerless and...

256
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,665
I hate that feeling.

257
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,867
What if it wasn't ridiculous?

258
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,168
What?

259
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,505
What if you try to
cure Alzheimer's?

260
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,344
Henry.

261
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,047
Baseball emoji, smiley
face, sunflower.

262
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,349
I'm going to interpret
that as affection.

263
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,318
Wait 'til he's a teenager

264
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,485
and you just get letters...

265
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,487
B-R-B... Mm.

266
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,390
I-D-K, and the enigmatic K-K.

267
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,192
Why the two K's?

268
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,560
Tuck claims it's
more respectful.

269
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,895
But, you know, what do I know?

270
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,731
I'm just his chauffeur.

271
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,066
Speaking of which, I-I
can take over driving.

272
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,234
I like to drive.

273
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,737
It's 20 minutes to Moscow.

274
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:14,741
Never thought I'd have to
drive across state lines

275
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,475
to pick up a patient.

276
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,311
Hm. Feels like
we're on the lam.

277
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,647
The medical Thelma and Louise.

278
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,249
Didn't they drive off a cliff?

279
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,817
Bonnie and Clyde.

280
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,885
Shot to death.

281
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:29,722
Bailey and Addison?

282
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,392
American heroes.

283
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,732
Is it okay if Kyle
picks her up after five?

284
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,600
I really appreciate it.

285
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,902
No, no, no, no.

286
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,203
I'll be fine.

287
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,873
Yeah. You're doing plenty.

288
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,074
Oh, uh, they're here.

289
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,408
I gotta go. Susan?

290
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,943
Dr. Montgomery?
Yes. That's me.

291
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,279
Thanks so much for the ride.

292
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,782
I didn't realize the clinic was
such a full-service operation.

293
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,084
Well, Dr. Bailey
is also a surgeon.

294
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,119
Yeah, this is just
our side hustle.

295
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,288
Water? Ah, yes. Thank you.

296
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,623
Seat belts.

297
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,625
Are you sure no one needs
an assist in the O.R.?

298
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,294
Or... pit?

299
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,463
The square knot is the
foundation for all knots.

300
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,167
15 minutes a day is a
good investment in time.

301
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,137
Damn it. Too loose. Ahhhh.

302
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,606
Yeah, your guy's still bleeding.

303
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,808
Oh, I hope that's not his face.

304
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,309
Or his liver. Or his heart.

305
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,444
9-1-1.

306
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,047
Oh, God forbid it's someone who
needs stitches. Something good?

307
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,449
I-I don't know yet. The pit?

308
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,719
Uh, yeah, something like that.

309
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,389
You sure your son hasn't
got us figured out?

310
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,892
Did he seem suspicious of
you? How could he not be?

311
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,061
I'm a Greek sculptor's
dream, and you're only human.

312
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,395
Oh, please. No.

313
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,964
Sneaking around
with the boss's mom

314
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,799
is not gonna help my
performance review.

315
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,167
This is between you and me.

316
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,002
Don't let Jackson get
all up in your head.

317
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,139
Oh, so, what you're saying is
we're gonna have to kill him.

318
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,406
Be serious, Tom.

319
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,908
Okay, fine. I'll
kill him myself.

320
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,277
But you... you got to
deal with your husband.

321
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,449
Tom, could you just please
tell me about my scans?

322
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,118
It's not the news we wanted.

323
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,287
So, the tumor is bigger?

324
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,521
Two millimeters.

325
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,457
Two millimeters?
That's nothing.

326
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,994
It's not "nothing."
It's growing.

327
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,864
How you feeling? The same.

328
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,498
Mostly well. Occasional pain.

329
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,800
Two millimeters isn't
worth this conversation.

330
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,136
Catherine, two months
ago, we did a scan

331
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,138
and we noted your
tumor had grown.

332
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,940
And?

333
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,641
And you said if it grew further,
you'd consider more treatment.

334
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,477
I know what I
said. And it grew.

335
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,012
Two millimeters.

336
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,813
Your son thinks you're
still in remission.

337
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,150
It's two millimeters!
It's not remission.

338
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,785
You need more treatment.

339
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,121
And you need to talk to
your husband and your son

340
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,722
and let them know
what's going on.

341
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,225
And you need to remember that
my name is on this building.

342
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,396
So I'll be the one to
decide what I need.

343
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,141
I-I got a text
about Scout Lincoln.

344
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,842
Something about an
accident? Is he okay?

345
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,177
He's fine. He's just wet.

346
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,678
Oh.

347
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,180
We used his backup
clothes last week,

348
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,016
and we never got
new ones. Okay...

349
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,018
We tried his parents, but
they're both in surgery.

350
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,852
We had your information
from this morning.

351
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,421
What? So I'm supposed to...

352
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,856
A few parents have found
clothes at the gift shop.

353
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,360
I'm sure you don't want
him to be uncomfortable.

354
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,433
Tina's bringing Emily
home with Colette,

355
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,568
so you can pick her
up there after work.

356
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,938
I canceled the piano lesson,

357
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,241
and can you pick up fruit
snacks and Pirate's Booty?

358
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,109
It's our week to bring
the snacks to soccer.

359
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,078
Martha said she'll come
get me when I'm done.

360
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,412
I'll be fine.

361
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,149
Love you, too. Bye.

362
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,018
What'd I do with my keys?

363
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,786
I had them when you
picked me up, right?

364
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,421
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

365
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,589
Don't be.

366
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,458
I'm usually ready for anything,

367
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,962
but ectopic pregnancy
wasn't on my calendar.

368
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,196
It kinda threw me.

369
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,831
Totally understandable.

370
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,236
Bracelets.

371
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,571
My daughter makes them.

372
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,073
Take one. Heck...

373
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,241
Take two, please. Aww!

374
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,578
She's made enough for everyone
this side of the Mississippi.

375
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,747
But it keeps her busy when I'm
trying to get ready for work.

376
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,749
We get it. We have kids.

377
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,784
How old's your daughter?

378
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,086
Five. Aww.

379
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,421
She turns six next week.

380
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,789
Ooh, sweet. Ahh.

381
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,392
She only asked for,
um, one present...

382
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,727
A sister.

383
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,063
She's been calling
the baby Sundae

384
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,133
'cause she loves ice cream.

385
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,037
I can still get pregnant
after this, right?

386
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,508
It's hard for me to know without
doing further imaging tests.

387
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,377
But it is possible.

388
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,614
Ohh!

389
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,318
Dr. Montgomery?

390
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,686
This is bad, right?

391
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,991
Ahh! Ahh! Ah!

392
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,629
IDH inhibitors, CDK inhibitors,
immune checkpoint inhibitors...

393
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,464
Please. I'm not
one for inhibition.

394
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,133
And historically I've
been grateful for that.

395
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,467
But these trials have really...

396
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,801
I've already done one of these.

397
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,637
And it helped. It helped.

398
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,872
But it made me feel
like absolute hell.

399
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,142
I said I would consider
more treatment.

400
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,809
I did. It's not what I want.

401
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,811
Okay, so don't do it for
you, hmm? Do it for me.

402
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,480
If you think about it,
you really owe me one.

403
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,815
I'm getting help, if that
makes you feel any better.

404
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,318
Mm? I met a medicine
man in Bali.

405
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,120
I met a shaman in Peru.

406
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,390
I learned all about energy
medicine and frequency medicine,

407
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,293
medicines that don't make
me feel like I'm suffering.

408
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,961
T-That's because
they don't work.

409
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,629
According to you.

410
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,965
I have an acupuncturist
who's done more for my pain

411
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,633
than any pill you
ever prescribed.

412
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,136
And studies show that
Reiki will reduce pain

413
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,638
and it can improve
post-op recovery.

414
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,141
Catherine, please...
Tom, Tom, Tom.

415
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,810
I know you mean well.

416
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,214
And you've been
carrying my secret.

417
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,249
But this is <i>my</i> cancer.

418
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,650
Mm.

419
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,554
This is my choice.

420
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,990
Ah. Got it.

421
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,992
This group of neuroscientists
from Brussels...

422
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,695
They applied for a grant
to expand their research

423
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,030
on the connection between
Alzheimer's and...

424
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,101
Gut microbial composition.
I've read studies on it.

425
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:18,003
There are also some
that link gut integrity

426
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,506
with brain plaque production
and neuro-inflammation.

427
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,941
I-I saw this all in the
Parkinson's research.

428
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,710
Of course.

429
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,278
You already know more than the
group who applied for the grant.

430
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,047
It's your areas of
specialty... Gut and brain.

431
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,616
Yeah. It's all theoretical.

432
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,118
Like you didn't just do
a record-breaking study

433
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,619
on Parkinson's based
on something that was

434
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,786
initially theoretical?

435
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,555
Come on. You should do this.

436
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,956
We could help fund it.

437
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,226
And we got facilities,
equipment, tech.

438
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,460
We have this amazing partnership

439
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,028
with MIT's brain
science program.

440
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,463
They could be a resource.

441
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,798
You should just fund the
people from Brussels.

442
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,567
They're not you!

443
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,968
Meredith Grey studying the
disease that killed her mother?

444
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,037
That's a story that
would get funding,

445
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,705
and funding is what
cures diseases.

446
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,141
This is exciting.

447
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,209
What's... What's going
on? Where'd you go?

448
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,944
Zola was miserable this morning.

449
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,149
And I could never move to
Boston if she didn't want to.

450
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,884
I mean, she's been
through so much.

451
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,719
So much trauma.

452
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,789
She lost her birth
family, her birth country,

453
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,426
her father died, I almost died.

454
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,895
You know, all of
that stuff is...

455
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,299
Is just now coming
to the surface.

456
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,169
I really need to focus on her.

457
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,670
Okay. I hear you.

458
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,605
I love you both.

459
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,807
Not exactly gonna give up
on this entirely, okay?

460
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,108
Not just yet.

461
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,977
When did you become
so relentless?

462
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,946
When I took this job.

463
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,317
<i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>

464
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,252
Yes, this is
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

465
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,621
I have a 39-year-old female

466
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,623
with a ruptured
ectopic pregnancy

467
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,425
on a cesarean scar.

468
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,428
She's alert and oriented,
but hemorrhaging.

469
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,464
Pulse is weak. Abdomen
is rigid and distended.

470
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,368
We are in a blue Grey-Sloan
van on Highway 270.

471
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,703
Can you send an ambulance?

472
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,205
<i>On its way.</i> Thank you.

473
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,306
How's it going back there?

474
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,973
We're okay.

475
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,476
Doing okay, Susan.

476
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,477
What are you looking for?

477
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,145
Uterine balloon tamponade?

478
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,480
Not gonna find one in there.

479
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,148
My OB just said I was okay.

480
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,650
Well, it's difficult to predict

481
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,786
if or when an ectopic
pregnancy will rupture, Susan.

482
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,121
This looks like a lot of blood.

483
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,456
Is... Is this a lot of blood?

484
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,725
The pregnancy invaded
the muscle layers

485
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,228
and likely tore open
the uterine incision,

486
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,962
which is why we have to... Ha!

487
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,631
What is that? A
Foley catheter.

488
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,634
If I insert this into your
vagina and inflate it,

489
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,237
the pressure against your
uterus will slow the bleeding.

490
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,638
Is that okay? Is it safe?

491
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,340
It's safer than letting
you keep bleeding.

492
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,674
Y-Yeah. Okay, do it.

493
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,343
Just... ohh! Make it stop.

494
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,344
Okay. I'm inserting it.

495
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,478
Okay. Try to hold still.

496
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,247
Bailey, no sudden moves.

497
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,815
Could I have prevented this
if I didn't get the C-section?

498
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,752
You didn't do anything
wrong. C-sections are safe.

499
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,188
This kind of ectopic
pregnancy is extremely rare.

500
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,523
You doing okay? Uh-huh.

501
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,525
Okay, I'm gonna inflate
the balloon now.

502
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,694
You're gonna feel a
little bit of pressure.

503
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,430
Hold still. You got it.

504
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,399
Okay.

505
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,101
That should buy us a
little bit of time.

506
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,737
And how much time?

507
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,409
It's okay.

508
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,951
Do you want a
bag? No, I'm good.

509
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,287
Oh, good luck with that. I
asked Schmitt for a day off.

510
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,854
He looked at me like
I killed his dog.

511
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,189
Uh, a bag, bag... I need
a bag. Oh, hey, Skywalker!

512
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,625
Hey. W-What are
you, uh, doing here?

513
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,360
Getting snacks.

514
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,929
Apparently the vending machine
is too lowbrow for Dr. Kwan.

515
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,031
Yogurt-covered pretzels?
I need brain food.

516
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,466
Cashews and almonds.

517
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,035
Ah, is that what
powers that ego?

518
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,203
What are you doing?

519
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,138
Uh, s-same. $32.75.

520
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,573
Wow. That is a lot of snacks.

521
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,609
I, uh... Geez.

522
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,277
I forgot my wallet in my locker.

523
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:49,147
I'll spot you, but I
get your next appy.

524
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,950
Hey, that's my... Ooh, ooh, ooh.

525
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,585
Wow.

526
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,455
I may be wrong, but I think
these are a little too small.

527
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,290
They're not for me.
They're for the...

528
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,925
Let me guess.

529
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,593
Daddy Daycare?

530
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,963
Oh, Schmitt. Oh, Schmitt.

531
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,666
It's okay.

532
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,136
I'll let him know that you
have child care issues.

533
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,274
Should I get another bag, or...

534
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,444
Yeah, and you were
interested in neuro,

535
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,145
and you set that
aside for Derek.

536
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,814
Oh, it was a bit more
complicated than that.

537
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,083
Like how hard it was to
choose general surgery

538
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,485
because of Ellis?

539
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,320
I wish I could make
one decision in my life

540
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,356
where people didn't
bring Ellis into it.

541
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,157
A couple years ago,

542
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,860
I actually got to spend
some time with my father.

543
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,663
Realized my entire life
he had loomed so large.

544
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,998
He was this...
mountain of a man.

545
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,167
And I spend some time with him,
I realize he's just some guy.

546
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,371
With wasted potential
and regrets and flaws.

547
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:46,772
You didn't want to be like him.

548
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,640
The scary part is, I
wasn't that different.

549
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,509
I mean, I was living in
cruise control, you know?

550
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,711
I wasn't fulfilling
my potential.

551
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,980
Feeling that similarity
to him was painful.

552
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,314
But it also
propelled me forward.

553
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,683
I mean, I'm happier here,

554
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,818
doing something I'm
passionate about.

555
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,353
Maybe it's not an accident
that you're up all night

556
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,121
researching Alzheimer's.

557
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,056
Or you're feeling so
much pain about Zola.

558
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,226
Maybe it's all these pieces
of your life coming together.

559
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,228
I kinda think you're
having a breakthrough

560
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,364
rather than a breakdown.

561
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,532
Relentless. No.

562
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,967
I'm just being a
friend, alright?

563
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,303
I've seen you push through
so many things before

564
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,738
and ignore them.

565
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,972
I'm just saying that
this might be something

566
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,408
you don't want to push through.

567
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,811
I think you should
let it help you grow.

568
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:28,647
Once upon a time, I did
want to cure Alzheimer's.

569
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,649
Exactly. But what if it fails?

570
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,818
Oh, it's probably
gonna fail. Right.

571
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,653
But, I mean, you could
definitely move the needle.

572
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,321
That means something.

573
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,823
Zola sees that her mom is
doing everything she can

574
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,491
to cure Alzheimer's.

575
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,160
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

576
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,034
Do you see an accident?

577
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,368
An ambulance?

578
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,270
No. Nothing.

579
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,739
How much longer will
the catheter hold?

580
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,707
Not sure.

581
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,242
Susan?

582
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,910
Susan, stay with me, hey?

583
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,211
Okay? Talk to me.

584
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,747
Tell me, um...

585
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,949
Tell me about Emily's
birthday party.

586
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,217
It's a spa party.

587
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,386
I don't know where
she got the idea.

588
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,622
But her teenaged
cousins are coming to...

589
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,290
To paint the kids' nails.

590
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,694
And she... She
wants a coffee cake.

591
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,696
Like the kind from school.

592
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:22,133
Ah. I... I haven't
baked it yet.

593
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,470
I need to be okay.

594
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,938
I need to bake her cake.

595
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,141
I want to see her turn six.

596
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,612
I want to see her
lose her front teeth

597
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,482
and learn how to read.

598
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:40,652
I... I want to teach
her how to drive

599
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,789
and send her off to prom.

600
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,792
I want to drop
her off at college

601
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:51,963
and miss her every day 'til
she comes home for summer.

602
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,633
I... I want to...

603
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,636
I want to... want to
watch her f-fall in love.

604
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:04,109
I w... I want to see her
start her first real job.

605
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,078
I want to be there
for all of it.

606
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,681
Okay?

607
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,987
I'm not ready to
go. I'm not...

608
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,157
Susan?

609
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,727
Susan!

610
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,662
What? I can't feel a pulse.

611
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,196
I'm starting CPR.

612
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,132
I'm pulling over.

Herbal tea. No caffeine.

648
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,054
Ah, I meant consistently lying
to your friends and family.

649
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:32,223
Tom, I thought we were done
with this conversation.

650
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,592
Well, persistence
is part of my charm.

651
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,262
Y-You can't fault me for trying.

652
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,265
My friend's life is at stake.

653
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,168
I spent the last six
months traveling abroad.

654
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,671
And everywhere I went,
all I thought was,

655
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,674
"Thank God I'm not
in an oncology ward."

656
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,009
If I stay the course
without chemo,

657
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,679
I'll have a few good years left.

658
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,614
I want to spend them living.

659
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,650
If the cancer gets
more aggressive,

660
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,618
if there's some
promising new option,

661
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,621
maybe I'll change my mind.

662
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,123
But if I'm gonna be
stuck in a hospital,

663
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,626
I want it to be as a
doctor, not as a patient.

664
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,796
At some point,

665
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,798
everyone's gonna
know you lied, hmm?

666
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,866
How... How about we just
let Jackson in on it...

667
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,601
No. Okay, Richard?

668
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:20,305
Tom, this conversation with
you is exhausting enough.

669
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm not gonna have
it with anyone else.

670
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,477
I am lying to protect my
privacy and to protect my peace.

671
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,047
I'm happy with this decision.

672
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,717
You know what? I'm not
even gonna ask. Oh.

673
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,218
Nothing to know.

674
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,986
How about if you're ready
to go? Can I ask that?

675
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,722
What, you... you cutting out
early? Harriet has ballet.

676
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,189
I told her she could just
wait for the recital, but...

677
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,958
Wait? Child, please.

678
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,292
I'm here. Let's go.

679
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,562
I don't want to miss anything.

680
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,538
Dr. Kwan, have you seen Adams?

681
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,307
Uh, last I saw him, he
was at the gift shop...

682
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,010
buying clothes for your son.

683
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,813
Don't worry. Your
secret's safe.

684
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,715
Oh. You know?

685
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,484
About you two? It's
pretty obvious.

686
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:09,654
Is it? Yeah, when
you see you together.

687
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,322
You know, it might
be less obvious

688
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,659
if you gave the rest of
us some more neuro cases.

689
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,697
Do you have a special
interest in neuro, Dr. Kwan?

690
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,200
I have a special
interest in gaining

691
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,534
as much experience as I can

692
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,436
before I declare an area
of special interest.

693
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,873
I also have steady hands.

694
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,707
And many skills in other areas

695
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,944
if your interests
are... expansive.

696
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,881
You think I'm playing favorites
with Lucas because he's...

697
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,250
Dr. Shepherd, I
need a consult.

698
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,454
Is there supposed
to be a patient?

699
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,456
I got to tell you
something. Okay.

700
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,225
Oh, hey, I'm glad
you finally told

701
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,559
the other interns

husband he's lost his wife.

787
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,583

You know, I've always
supported the right to choose.

791
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,497
But I... just, you
know, personally,

792
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,867
I... believed it wasn't
the choice for me.

793
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,369
But then I got pregnant.

794
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,371
A girl.

795
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,006
Then I miscarried.

796
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,142
Oh, Miranda. I'm so sorry.

797
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:00,278
And to add insult to injury,
the miscarriage was incomplete.

798
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,948
So I needed a procedure
to prevent infection.

799
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:07,152
Now, I did not
choose an abortion.

800
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,054
But I've had a D&C.

801
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,556
It is the same procedure.

802
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,725
And I'm worried doctors
are afraid to use it.

803
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,294
I'm... I'm worried
the next generation

804
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,895
won't get enough training on it.

805
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:21,066
I'm... I'm worried
that <i>is</i> our future.

806
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,633
I want to offer
it at Grey-Sloan.

807
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,136
Train anyone who
wants it. I-I...

808
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:29,074
I want to prepare health
care professionals to help.

809
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,642
That's an excellent
plan. Yeah, I know.

810
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,245
And it won't be nearly enough.

811
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,090

812
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,324

816
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,399
Y-Y-You follow me
into on-call rooms.

817
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,235
You hover over me with
apartment listings.

818
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,604
You got me on Daddy
Daycare with Scout.

819
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,673
I asked you for help
with one thing...

820
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,542
Don't blow my cover at work.

821
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,177
And you've refused to do it.

822
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,713
So...

823
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,781
that makes it okay
to tell people

824
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,450
that we're sleeping together?

825
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,452
I didn't tell anybody anything.

826
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,787
It is not my job to correct
people's misconceptions.

827
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,290
Yes, it is. You are an intern.

828
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,725
I am an attending.

829
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,194
There are rules about
these things for a reason.

830
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,795
We're not actually together!

831
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,797
They don't know that.

832
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,033
You know, all my life,
everyone's always assumed

833
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:32,303
I only get anywhere because
of my family connections.

834
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,971
And all my life,

835
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,807
I've been my family's
biggest disappointment.

836
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,309
I hav... I haven't lived up

837
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,877
to anybody's expectations
as a Shepherd.

838
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,447
So I thought I'd see what
happens when I'm not one.

839
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,882
But now, thanks to your
lack of discretion,

840
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,217
everyone believes
we're connected,

841
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,818
just in a-a different way...

842
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,454
A way that is
admittedly disturbing,

843
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,789
but for this particular purpose,

844
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,425
better.

845
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,263
You have three days.

846
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,634
And then if you haven't
told them, I will.

847
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,684
So, when does the clinic open?

848
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,519
A couple of days.

849
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,323
I'm already thinking
of how to expand.

850
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,325
I want to do more, too.

851
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,826
I, uh...

852
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,195
I have to do more.

853
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,029
You will. From L.A.

854
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,664
No. No.

855
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,802
I want to... I want to go to
places where people need me.

856
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,971
Places like Pullman, you know?

857
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,641
I mean, I can't just sit.

858
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,043
I have a unique set of skills.
I know I can make a difference.

859
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,213
I...

860
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,548

to look at a map.

861

Tennessee, Kentucky,
Mississippi...

864
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,192
All states that
have abortion bans.

865
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,561
They're expecting
up to 14,000 women

866
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,630
to cross state lines for care.

867
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,997
Yeah? How do you know that?

868
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,634
'Cause I thought
about doing it, too.

869
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:14,138
But I got the baby girl who
recently lost her father.

870
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,407
So, she needs me at home.

871
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,577
But you, though, you... you go.

872
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,314
You go and give more
women access to care.

873

875
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,354
Wh... N... Okay. Stop.

876
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,822
You know you did everything
you could for her

877
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,691

879
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:39,029
You needed the right
tools, the right supplies.

880
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,531
You needed an ultrasound.

881
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,933
You needed...

882
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,603
What?

883
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,771
The PRT.

884
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,439
Huh?

885
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,107
No. Okay. So, my husband...

886
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,609
He... he convinced
the fire department

887
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:56,013
that he needed this O.R.
on wheels, but it...

888
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,782
Okay, the city sidelined it.

889
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,950
So we helped fund
it, and now it...

890
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,521
It just sits in the motor
pool collecting dust.

891
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,923
Oh, I can think of a
much better use for it.

892

it, the lobster roll?

897
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,306
Mm-hmm.

898
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,108
Did you know lobsters
can be yellow or blue?

899
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,110
It just depends on
their pigment protein.

900
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,412
Mm.

901
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,079

at the aquarium?

902
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,981

still have panic attacks?

910
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,797
