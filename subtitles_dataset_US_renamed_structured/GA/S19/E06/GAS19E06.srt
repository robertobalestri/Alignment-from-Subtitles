00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,461

Here's one more.

Hi!

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,002
How are you this morning?

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,238
Uh, great.

27
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,873
I wasn't asking you.

28
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,675

00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,459
What's the point
in even going in?

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,495
There's a massive storm on
the clinic's opening day,

36
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,231
I just got Meredith's
e-mail that she's leaving,

37
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,699
and, oh, right, none
of Luna's clothes

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,634
fit her any more.

39
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,338
So those are three omens,
all telling me to stay home.

00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,074
Luckily, women only need
abortions in pleasant weather.

41
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,077
I could put up a sign...

00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,680
"Come back when
the sun's out."

43
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,349
Okay, you eat.

44
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,719
I'll go find some of
Scout's clothes for Luna.

45
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,123
Get a plate.

00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,126
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,361
I took the day off
work to help you pack.

48
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,163
Where are your plate protectors?

49
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,564
I mean, I don't know
what those things are.

50
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,633
But I have movers and
packers coming this weekend.

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,967
I have said this.

52
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,369
Yes, but will they
treat your things

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,005
with as much love and
respect as I will?

54
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,374
I just... Let me
do this, please.

55
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,909
Fine.

56
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,912
Hey, uh, your e-mail was
good, short and sweet.

57
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:26,913
Efficient.

58
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,515
It needed to be.

59
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,350
I don't have a whole lot
of time this morning,

60
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,353
so if you want to come, I
have a whipple with Nick.

61
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,721
How's he taking the news?

62
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,556
Uh, we're not talking about it.

63
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,191
I'm avoiding Winston so
that we don't have to talk

64
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,626
about his whole switching
specialties thing.

65
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,160
So maybe you could stay
home and we could avoid

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,495
and pack together.

67
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,498
That actually sounds
amazing, but no.

68
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,335
Bye.

69
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,972
It's fine.

70
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,975
Oh, everything's fine.

71
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,381
Hey, sorry I'm late. I
brought sparkling cider.

72
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,416
I figured this called
for a celebration.

73
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,018
Or not. Yeah, no,
this is serious work.

74
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,820
Forget the cider.

75
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,222
You should've brought
something stronger. Right.

76
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,657
Wilson, we're not opening yet.

77
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,725
Accreditation
hasn't come through.

78
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,461
Bureaucracy.

79
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,629
This red ribbon might
as well be red tape,

80
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,565
and neither one of 'em
is getting cut today.

81
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,301
It's a national crisis.
We scheduled patients.

82
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,470
I can try to take them
upstairs, pro-bono.

83
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,671
Bless you.

84
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,473
Happy opening day, everybody!

85
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,041
I brought some almond
croissants to celebrate.

86
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,710
Opening's postponed.

87
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,878
Uh, bureaucracy?

88
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,080
How do you know? It always is.

89
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,882
There may be a silver lining.

90
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,318
Bailey, I could use your help
with a sigmoid resection.

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,620
And with this storm, the
ER's gonna be packed.

92
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,391
Oh, shut up!

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,062
Good morning, Lucas.

94
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,631
I can tell from your face

95
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,866
that you have not
told anyone the truth.

96
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,502
Actually, yes, I have.

97
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,836
Hmm? Griffith knows.

98
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,871
How about Kwan
and everyone else?

99
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,208
I... Well, I've been busy, uh,
studying for this whipple...

100
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,011
so I... It's just
been this whole...

101
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,314
And anyway, Dr. Shepherd,

102
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:11,584
I'll, uh... I'll get right
on that thing for you.

103
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,953
I'll let Dr. Marsh know he
can reassign the whipple

104
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,724
because you have a... thing.

105
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,565
Stop.

106
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,133
This is over.

107
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,735
Follow me.

108
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,604
Now.

109
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,675
Geez, come on, people.

110
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,915
I'm not really a
to-the-minute guy,

111
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,817
but there is something
called on time here.

112
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,719
Sorry, the storm backed up
traffic from First and Columbia.

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,288
I know, I know, but everyone
else got here except for Adams.

114
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,323
Where's Adams?

115
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,658
My fault, Dr. Marsh.

116
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,192
I'm sure you're swamped,

117
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:57,196
but Dr. Adams has an
announcement to make.

118
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,666
Okay. Okay, make it fast.

119
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,140
Some of you have gotten
the wrong idea about me,

120
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,578
so I need to clear things up.

121
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:18,050
Uh, the truth is,
D-Dr. Shepherd is...

122
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,354
Her sister's my mom,
so she's my aunt.

123
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,256
I'm a Shepherd.

124
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,161
And yeah, that's it.

125
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,464
Disturbing on so many levels.

126
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,733
Just to be very
clear, we are not now

127
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,004
and have never been having
sex with each other.

128
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,040
Yeah, that would be really
weird if he's your nephew.

129
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,241
Mm-hmm.

130
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,044
Thank you, Dr. Adams.

131
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,047
Okay, so if you're related
to half the hospital,

132
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,982
do you know why Grey
is deserting us?

133
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,684
She's the reason this
program is running.

134
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,219
I ju... Should we be
looking for other options?

135
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,855
Okay, hold on, hold
on. Take a seat.

136
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:59,826
Okay. About Dr. Grey's news,

137
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,628
you're scared, that's
understandable.

138
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,663
And I want to answer every
question you might have.

139
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,165
But right now, there are
patients about to go into

140
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,834
O.R.s who are far
more concerned

141
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,802
with whether they're
living or dying.

142
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,338
They don't care about the career
moves of individual surgeons.

143
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,341
They don't. So today we're
gonna save lives, okay?

144
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,143
Griffith, Adams,
you're scrubbing in

145
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,711
with me and Grey on the whipple.

146
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,212
Yasuda, Kwan, Millin,
you're in the pit

147
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,514
with Altman and Schmitt.

148
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,882
Let's go.

149
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,351
Okay.

150
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,655
Okay, hold up, hold
up, hold up, hold up.

151
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,491
Take a seat, please, sit.

152
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,527
Surgical excellence, it
takes more than one person.

153
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,030
This program is more
than one person.

154
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,066
<i>You</i> are the program.

155
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,401
It ain't going anywhere.

156
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
Okay?

157
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,305
Let's go.

158
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,378
God help us all.

159
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,549
Here I am! Sorry,
weird meeting.

160
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,084
Apparently, even more
people in this place

161
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,351
are related than I thought.

162
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,953
Let's focus, Yasuda.

163
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,822
Alright, Ben Warren called ahead

164
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,791
and said we're gonna need a
lot of extra hands on this one.

165
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,559
That's cryptic. He say why?

166
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,329
Jonathan Bright, 42-year-old
male, local TV reporter.

167
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,731
Survived a crash while
reporting on the storm,

168
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,800
and the helicopter was
struck by lightning.

169
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,135
Third-degree burns, possible
spinal injury and neuro deficits.

170
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,403
The bottom of the seat
fractured upon impact

171
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,005
and impaled him through
the right thigh.

172
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,540
We couldn't safely
extricate him from the chair

173
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,074
without risking further injury.

174
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,010
Is my wife here?
If I'm gonna die,

175
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,177
I really want to see my wife.

176
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,379
Hi Jonathan. I'm Dr. Altman.

177
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,581
We are gonna work
very hard to see to it

178
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,016
that you don't die.
Where do you want him?

179
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,884
Altman? Alright, Trauma three.

180
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,085
Go get us some help.

181
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,021
Okay.

182
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,625
Alright, slowly,
slowly. Nice and easy.

183
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,074
Hey.

184
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,408
Wh... Uh, why
aren't you at work?

185
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,910
I'm not on until tonight.

186
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,178
I thought I'd join
you and lend a hand.

187
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,147
Also, I think
you're avoiding me,

188
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:01,514
so I thought I'd ruin that plan.

189
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,250
I'm not avoiding you. I...

190
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,687
Um, I-I mean... I
am a little bit.

191
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,357
Um, also, I want to spend
time with the children

192
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,125
who are moving across country.

193
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,796
I can leave, but I'd
rather stay and talk.

194
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,230
Or, you know, we
don't have to talk.

195
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,733
I can just, uh, help.

196
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,168
I brought peanuts.

197
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,671
Yeah, help me upstairs.

198
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,039
Alright. Um,
Meredith is purging,

199
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,908
and she is not one
for sentimentality.

200
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,476
Oh, hey, save what you want now

201
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,878
before she chucks it
all into a dumpster.

202
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,680
Yeah. Hey, Zola.

203
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,481
Uh, yeah?

204
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,349
Zola, we're gonna go start
upstairs in the attic.

205
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,718
Can you keep an eye
on those maniacs?

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,052
And, um, stay inside.

207
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,187
The odds of being
struck by lightning

208
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,989
are only 1 in 15,000.

209
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,056
Exactly.

210
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,058
Don't give it a chance.

211
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,829
Okay, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis.

212
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,163
Is that all of them?

213
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,464
Yes, thank you, Ms. Hobbes.

214
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,701
Thank you. No,
it's Tessa, please.

215
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,804
Wait, uh, you don't
want an inscription?

216
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,539
I already have some. We've
met before, actually.

217
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,674
My mother used to take
me to see you read

218
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,175
at the Seattle library.

219
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,677
The character of
Tessa is the reason

220
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,579
I wore red sneakers all
through third grade.

221
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,814
Oh.

222
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,016
Uh, Dr. Griffith, please.

223
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,184
Tessa Hobbes, 68,
diagnosed 12 months ago

224
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,786
with chronic pancreatitis.

225
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,387
All medical and endoscopic

226
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,789
attempts at treatment
have been ineffective.

227
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,290
Today, she will undergo
a whipple procedure

228
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,292
to resect the damaged
parts of the pancreas,

229
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,360
and I'm a huge fan, too.

230
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,995
Oh.

231
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,997
Tessa, I do feel it
necessary to reiterate,

232
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,498
this is a very risky surgery.

233
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,667
Well, I have to live through it.

234
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,169
I still have a story to tell.

235
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,173
It's tickling my fingers
and the back of my throat.

236
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:39,979
I even have a title for it...
"Tessa and the Rising Sun."

237
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,313
Sure you don't want to postpone

238
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,082
the surgery and write the book?

239
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,549
Oh, gosh no.

240
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,818
I am so sick.

241
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,820
I can't write.
I sleep all day.

242
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,188
I can barely think.

243
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,489
We just want to make sure

244
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,325
that you're prepared
for every outcome here.

245
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,729
Yeah, I'm prepared
for every outcome.

246
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,465
But my readers are not.

247
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,733
Every year, for over 40 years,

248
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,334
I've written a Tessa book.

249
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:08,174
My readers deserve
an end to her story.

250
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:12,078
You and your kids deserve
an end to her story,

251
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,582
so do your best to
save my life, okay?

252
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,454
I hate this new board.

253
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,990
Ah, Webber. I'm
getting rid of this.

254
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:28,060
So I hear this hospital
is in need of a new chief.

255
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,362
Oh, why? Have someone in mind?

256
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,630
Oh, yeah.

257
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,166
Me.

258
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,868
I need this.

259
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,536
I need to be useful again.

260
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,138
I was chief for five years.

261
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,572
I-I have the experience
and the skills,

262
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,875
and I will move
mountains for you.

263
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,677
Who could be better?

264
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,014
Someone who doesn't have
a suspended license.

265
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,083
Hunt, this program has
gone through a lot.

266
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,919
We're just now finding
our footing again.

267
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,154
I mean, promoting you...

268
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,656
Hey, you're a great
teacher, Hunt.

269
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,558
Uh, if you need something to do,

270
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,194
I've been asking all of the
attendings to help Schmitt.

271
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,997
Okay? Okay.

272
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,866
We need him out of this chair

273
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,835
in order to assess
his spine fully.

274
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,837
Wait, he's hypotensive. We
need to put in another line.

275
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,172
He may be in neurogenic shock.

276
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,074
Alright, collapsed
lungs on both sides.

277
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,009
He needs bilateral chest tubes.

278
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,811
Okay, it's hard to
see, but it looks like

279
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,880
there's a deformity
in the mid cervical

280
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,381
and high thoracic spine.

281
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,250
The impalement is near
his femoral fracture.

282
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,752
We're gonna need a CT.

283
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,486
Jonathan? Paola.

284
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,388
Yasuda, I need you
to put in an IO line.

285
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,521
On it.

286
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,023
I'm so sorry I went up there.

287
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,460
It was awful and gorgeous and...

288
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,864
then I just fell straight down.

289
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,365
Why aren't you getting him out?

290
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,666
We're working on it.
I'm so glad you came.

291
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,034
I didn't know if you'd
make it before I...

292
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,003
Wait! Wait, is he dying?

293
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,372
We need to cut him out of this
thing. Please don't let him die.

294
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,474
Hang on. Hang on. I need
everyone to let me ensure

295
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,076
he's getting oxygen
into his lungs

296
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,477
because without it,
he's gonna go into

297
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,413
respiratory arrest before
we can even turn a saw on.

298
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,548
I need a chest tube
tray and someone to page

299
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,317
Dr. Owen Hunt right now!

300
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,553
We are a level one trauma
center in a lightning storm.

301
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,690
You will see gnarly injuries.
You do not have time to gawk.

302
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,691
Well, we probably
won't see anyone

303
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,692
struck by lightning today.

304
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,360
Check your tablet, Kwan.

305
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,896
The patient intake
log disagrees.

306
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,864
Most people who are
struck by lightning

307
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:12,298
aren't actually hit.

308
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,732
They're standing next
to something that is.

309
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,135
Current enters wires,
pipes, the ground

310
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,370
until a body, and then boom.

311
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,907
You also don't have time
for random lightning facts.

312
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,541
Hey, Doctor, are you
here for us, the Smiths?

313
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,876
Uh, Heather, Logan, and Paige?

314
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,344
Yeah, my wife and kids.

315
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,478
Uh, they were in our backyard,

316
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,980
and, uh, lightning struck

317
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,415
the basketball hoop,
and... And they got zapped.

318
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,883
Did anyone lose consciousness?

319
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,484
No, but they were
very disoriented.

320
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,486
I once got a concussion
when a volleyball

321
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,122
hit me in the face, and
it was just like that!

322
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,289
I think the shock did something

323
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,490
to her hearing.

324
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,292
So now she's even more annoying.

325
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,327
Um, I have to, um...

326
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,694
Go, Dr. Schmitt.

327
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,130
We've got this. Excuse me.

328
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:44,998
Uh, page me if you need me.

329
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,466
Uh-huh.

330
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,135
Uh, let's get a
full set of labs...

331
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,303
CBC, troponins, a
comprehensive metabolic panel.

332
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,906
Also 12-lead EKGs to
check for arrhythmias.

333
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,674
Wait, wait, what?

334
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,343
Um, most complications happen
within an hour of injury,

335
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,145
but we just want to be safe.

336
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,512
Okay. Alright,
thank you, Doctor.

337
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,981
Mm-hmm.

338
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,349
Hey, I was gonna say all that.

339
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,885
Then why didn't you?

340
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,027
Antioxidants for the
pancreas, sugar for energy,

341
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,498
and it's a long surgery,
so we should eat.

342
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,000
Just one second.

343
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,302
What's that?

344
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,637
I made it up to organize
the whipple steps.

345
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,007
It's anatomical designed,
so you start clockwise

346
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,408
with 8:00 with the events...

347
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,543
SMV, Kocher, portal
dissection, bah, bah, bah.

348
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,713
And then counterclockwise
for anastomosis.

349
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,849
Oh. Tessa's like
Seattle royalty.

350
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,350
Man, I grew up on her stories.

351
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,886
I used to go to her
midnight book releases

352
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,553
with my dad and grandma.

353
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,159
Now I'm part of her story
in a tiny way, but still...

354
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,065
You feel better now
that the secret's out?

355
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,801
Uh...

356
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,537
different, not better.

357
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,442
So... Shepherd, Shep
is your nickname?

358
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,476
Yeah, it's my middle name.

359
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,577
You want us to call you that?

360
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,313
No. No.

361
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:11,650
You know, most people go to
work to avoid their families.

362
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,953
Heard.

363
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,692
Uh, oof, I-I-I should
check in with Marsh.

364
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,561
It's almost time.

365
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,794
Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,496
You okay?

367
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,366
Oh, yeah, it's just my childhood
on the operating table.

368
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,401
No pressure or anything.

369
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,538
Yeah.

370
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,640
Uh, I'll see you up there.

371
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,377
Alright. Alright.

372
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,288
There's a small amount of fluid
in the upper left quadrant.

373
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,057
The CT will give us
a better picture.

374
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,691
Sats back in the 90s. Alright,
let's go over the plan.

375
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,293
I'll hold his head to
keep the cervical spine

376
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,494
in a neutral position.
Link and I will hold

377
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,196
his legs until after the
chair's been detached

378
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,630
to prevent any shift in
the spinal fractures.

379
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,333
Yasuda, help Altman
steady the chest tubes.

380
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,801
Why does it sound like
you've all done this before?

381
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,070
We have. Yep.

382
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,737
I haven't.

383
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,239
Paola, we're gonna need
you to step outside

384
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,340
while we cut him out.

385
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,211
Wait, just one second.

386
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,679
I've been an ass.

387
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,982
I love you.

388
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:20,819
I gave up my dream for you,
and then I blamed you for it.

389
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,222
And if I live through this,

390
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,726
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

391
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,363
Paola, I love you.
Please forgive me.

392
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,068
Alright, yep.
We're good to go.

393
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,070
Okay. Ready? Let's do this.

394
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,471
Very, very slowly.

395
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,975
We got you.

396
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,747
Hey, uh, have you
seen Dr. Altman?

397
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,382
I'm jumping in down here.

398
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,084
Trauma 3, but she's not
handing out assignments.

399
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,320
Who is?

400
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,954
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

401
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,289
Are you here stealing supplies?

402
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,324
'Cause the clinic can have them.

403
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,159
No, I'm here to help.

404
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,994
No, I-I said that I
don't need supplies.

405
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,895
Well, you do if you're gonna
see the head lac in bed 6

406
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,665
and the ankle injury in 9.

407
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,800
Okay, uh, well, thank
you, Dr. Wilson.

408
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,136
I really appreciate your help.

409
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,637
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

410
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,405
Is that supposed to be sincere?

411
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,009
Yes, but for the rest of the
day, gratitude is implied.

412
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,812
Her pancreatitis formed a
pseudoaneurysm of the GDA.

413
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,049
See? Right there.

414
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,183
So you're gonna have
to be very careful

415
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,517
with the Kocher maneuver.

416
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,619
Right.

417
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,321
You okay?

418
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,856
Yeah.

419
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,225
There's nothing you
can do we can't fix.

420
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,994
Alright? And you
did the work, yeah?

421
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,563
Yeah. Yeah, so
you did the work.

422
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,730
You trust your instincts.

423
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,999
You trust your work.

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,534
Okay?

425
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,036
And, Adams,

426
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,572
you're good enough to
make your own name.

427
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,041
Believe me.

428
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,176
Uh, Marsh, can I have a word?

429
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,079
Yes, please, come in.

430
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,581
If this is about Meredith,
I've already informed

431
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,816
the interns that their
program is in good hands here.

432
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,385
No, it's not about them.

433
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,888
Uh, to put it directly,
should I anticipate

434
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,856
any goodbye e-mails from you?

435
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,292
Ah. No.

436
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,827
Uh, well

437
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,296
I don't know.

438
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,131
I mean, to be honest,
I've been so busy

439
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,665
with the residency
and my caseload,

440
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,334
I haven't had time
to think about it.

441
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,835
And if I had, I wouldn't
have thought for very long

442
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,637
because trying to
think the right way

443
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,706
to the right answer
with Meredith is...

444
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,541
She's not easy, I know,

445
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,511
but there's also
no one like her.

446
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,513
And when she leaves,
this place will feel it,

447
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,681
so I just need to make sure that

448
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,350
I'm prepared across the board.

449
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,484
Understood.

450
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,052
Okay.

451
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,189
Please keep me posted.

452
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,333
Ms. Hobbes, it's time.

453
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,835
Ready?

454
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,670
Sure am. Mm.

455
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,639
Are you?

456
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,873
We all are.

457
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,509
But before I take you...

458
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,146
Oh!

459
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,047
This is a real collector's item.

460
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,982
Meant a lot to me growing up.

461
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,385
My childhood was... I-I
grew up without a mom.

462
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,887
And this helped me to...

463
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,557
Helped me to see Tessa's
life wasn't perfect either.

464
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,362
Kids need messy stories.

465
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,197
That should be my epitaph.

466
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,365
Except you're not dying today.

467
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,300
I might. Let's be honest.

468
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,702
I don't want to, but I might.

469
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,204
You have another story to tell.

470
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,972
Dr. Griffith, don't do that.

471
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,508
I don't do fairy
tales, never have,

472
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,211
so let's not start now.

473
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,648
I tell children the truth

474
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,584
in a way that
helps them hear it.

475
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,186
Mm-hmm.

476
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,487
And I expect them
to do the same,

477
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:44,190
even when they're
no longer children.

478
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,725
I do have another story to tell.

479
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,560
I don't want to die.

480
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:54,700
I have asked my surgeons
to do their very best.

481
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,836
But I might not make it.

482
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,538
That's the truth.

483
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,340
So...

484
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,908
since this might be
my last signature,

485
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,577
let's make it a good one.

486
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,113
They're ready for you, Tessa.

487
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,017
Okay.

488
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,554
Here I come.

489
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,393
Hey.

490
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,994
Did you tell Lucas about
the pseudoaneurysm?

491
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,631
Mm-hmm. He's seen the scans.

492
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,633
I need him to appreciate
everything that could go wrong.

493
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,436
Why? Because he's
Derek's nephew?

494
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,405
Glad I could find out
when everyone else did.

495
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,407
He asked me to keep his
family connection private.

496
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,409
I respected that. Great.

497
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,844
And he knows about
the pseudoaneurysm.

498
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,213
I wasn't gonna blindside him.

499
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,987
I don't know what to do
either. I want to fight for us.

500
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,890
I want to try, but
every answer feels bad.

501
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,191
Yeah, because there
isn't a good one.

502
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,227
If I ask you to stay,
I'm being a jerk.

503
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,296
And if I follow you, I'm
deserting this class...

504
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,897
Your class.

505
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,499
But I haven't asked you to do

506
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,867
either one of those
things. Yeah, exactly.

507
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,702
You... You haven't asked
me to do anything. Nothing.

508
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,170
You don't consider
me part of your life.

509
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,872
Of course you're
part of my life.

510
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,307
You took the Boston job
without even talking...

511
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,409
Without even thinking
of talking to me.

512
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,210
And I get it. I do, I get it.

513
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,013
Your family needs
it, but it sucks.

514
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,715
It sucks, and I'm
being supportive

515
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,384
because there is
no other answer.

516
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,286
Well, maybe there
is. What do you want?

517
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,620
I just... I want
to do this surgery.

518
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,054
It's one thing we can fix.

519
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,392
That's all I want
from you right now.

520
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,162
Yeah, she has a perforated
eardrum which explains

521
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,664
the hearing loss.

522
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,032
Uh, it's common in
lightning strike victims.

523
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,634
It should heal on its own.

524
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,636
Am I okay?!

525
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,671
Can I keep reading?!

526
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,474
Will he be able to walk?

527
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,543
Uh, it's important he does.

528
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,979
This might hurt, but it helps
prevent infections, no crutches.

529
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,516
I just got new Jordans.

530
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,183
It's like the lightning
wanted my sneakers.

531
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,819
It wanted your sweat.

532
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,354
That's why you've got
burns in your armpits

533
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,788
and the backs of your knees,

534
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,357
on your elbows,
and on your feet.

535
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,058
It turned it to steam.

536
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,227
So his feet were sweating
so much his shoes exploded?

537
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,663
Mom! Will that happen to me?!

538
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,734
No, no, no, no. You have
something different!

539
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,205
Jonathan, you okay?

540
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,741
The noise... We're
almost there.

541
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,543
Once he's detached, we
need to use the board

542
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,010
to keep him flat and level.

543
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,746
And everyone moves at
the same time, okay?

544
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,415
Hold him tight, and we
move at the same time.

545
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,284
Remember, any movement of
his spine could paralyze him.

546
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,954
Let's get ready.
He's almost through.

547
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,157
Get in here, Julius. Let's go.

548
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:36,862
Alright, on my count...
One, two, three.

549
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,196
Wait, watch the lines.

550
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,733
Slow, slow, keep it straight.

551
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,535
Get this out of here.
Okay, nice work.

552
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,903
Let's get him up to CT.

553
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,372
Damn it. He's lost his airway.

554
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,341
Someone get me an
intubation tray right now!

555
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,076
Come on, Jonathan.

556
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,918
Alright.

557
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,190
Oh, wow!

558
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,559
I haven't seen this in years.

559
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,661
Remember I told you about this?

560
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,530
This is the Post-It note
that Meredith and Derek

561
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,664
wrote their vows on.

562
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,999
Oh, yeah.

563
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,168
Ugh, it's one of my
favorite stories.

564
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,971
Ugh. I'm going to
hold on to this.

565
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,074
No way I'm letting her
accidentally throw it away.

566
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,311
I feel weird.

567
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,981
It's like... I know that
I'm going to miss Meredith,

568
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,618
and I'll probably be diving
into a pint of Rum Raisin

569
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,321
very soon, but right
now, I'm just excited.

570
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:40,559
For Meredith's next
chapter and for Zola.

571
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,795
Yeah, well, um, as long
as we're on new chapters,

572
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,363
I did some research.

573
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,132
Turns out Grey-Sloan
has a fellowship

574
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,367
for vascular surgery.

575
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,202
And I don't want this
to turn into a fight...

576
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,804
Me neither. Maybe
we can revisit it

577
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,240
after Meredith has moved
and things calm down.

578
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,642
I'm filling out the application.

579
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,010
Nick and Teddy
gave me references,

580
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,514
and, actually, it
looks really promising.

581
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,484
Okay, sure.

582
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,118
For now. For now?

583
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,687
What is that supposed to
mean? It means, honestly,

584
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,321
I think you're going
to change your mind.

585
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,625
You've worked extremely
hard in cardio,

586
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,627
and I know that the last few
months have been rough...

587
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,529
Maggie, would you stop
for one second, please?

588
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,465
We just got the program
back up and running,

589
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,332
and it's really not an ideal
time to find a replacement.

590
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,002
For you. It's not an
ideal time for <i>you.</i>

591
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,403
What about me?

592
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,874
What about us?

593
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,410
Woman over P.A.: <i>Dr. Dahanne to the
ER. Dr. Colette Dahanne to the ER.</i>

594
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,079
Is he...

595
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,547
He's on his way to surgery.

596
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:38,485
We had to put in a breathing
tube, but he is stable.

597
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:43,455
God, that man is not capable
of letting me rest easy.

598
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,691
He turned down being a
war correspondent for me.

599
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:49,360
That was his dream.

600
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:54,466
He wanted to risk his life
every day in a literal war zone,

601
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,669
and I wanted him to not
do that because I just...

602
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,905
I just want to be
able to breathe.

603
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:03,408
And then he goes up
in a lightning storm.

604
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,545
I don't know what I'll
do if he doesn't make it.

605
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,515
And if he does make it, I
think I'm gonna kill him.

606
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,650
Paola, we are gonna
do everything we can.

607
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,351
And we'll keep you updated.

608
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,154
Okay.

609
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,627
Okay, I'm going to
start mobilizing

610
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,994
the ligament of Treitz.

611
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,129
I can take it. It's
okay, I got it.

612
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,231
I'm right here.

613
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,299
Adams, why don't you
mobilize it for us?

614
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,569
Right angle. W... Is
he ready for that?

615
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,539
Dissect right in
between my right angle.

616
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,141
Don't go deeper than
what I show you, yes.

617
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,343
And, Griffith, why do
we dissect the ligament?

618
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,911
To give better mobility
to the duodenum.

619
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,913
Correct. Okay.

620
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,182
Okay, what's next?

621
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,518
The Kocher maneuver. You keep
this up, you can do the chole.

622
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,053
Okay, well, when we get to that.

623
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,722
Yes. Not yet. Obviously.

624
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,792
Okay.

625
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,698
Hey. Can you see if
Mr. Vizcaino's scans are...

626
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,332
Are you shopping?

627
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,168
Yeah. Luna's
outgrown everything.

628
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,171
Oh, you should see
her. She is huge!

629
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,073
Yeah. She's gigantic.

630
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,508
Just like our backlog
of patients in the ER.

631
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,977
I just need five minutes.

632
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,079
Is Luna cold? No.

633
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,081
Is she naked? No.

634
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,183
Is she suffering? No.

635
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,551
But you know who is?

636
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,352
Ms. McGregor in bed four.

637
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,022
No. No, what?

638
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,692
No, you're not gonna let
the tiny bit of power

639
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,394
you've had for five
minutes go to your head.

640
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,297
You're chief resident?
Ooh, congratulations.

641
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,000
Guess what? You're
still a resident.

642
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:39,571
And in the world of general
surgery, I'm still an attending.

643
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:43,809
I can do surgeries
by myself. Can you?

644
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,144
Didn't think so.

645
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,046
I'm down here helping
you out of the kindness

646
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,081
of my warm, fuzzy little heart.

647
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,751
Mm. So you can say it.

648
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,186
Thank you.

649
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,056
Gratitude is implied
for the rest of the day.

650
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,898
Woman over P.A.: <i>Dr. Williams to Peds
ICU. Dr. Cody Williams to Peds ICU.</i>

651
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,566
Uh, I need to show you
something on a patient.

652
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,168
Can you take a look?

653
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,504
Dr. Kwan, are you
asking me for a consult?

654
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,007
No.

655
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
I already told him it's jewelry.

656
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,213
Thank you, Heather,
I know it's jewelry,

657
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,982
but we just need some more
details on why it's...

658
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,551
Well, that's bronze.

659
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,356
It's copper now, but
the jewelry was bronze.

660
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,291
Bronze is just copper
and tin together,

661
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,227
and tin has a lower
burning temperature.

662
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,963
So the tin vaporized,
and the copper

663
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,865
embedded itself in your skin,

664
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,735
so you just clean with
chlorhexidine and then debride.

665
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,571
Good consult.

666
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,642
I'll be right over there
if you get stumped again.

667
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,049
What did the CT find?

668
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,185
Unilateral facet fracture at C3

669
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,153
and a compression
fracture at T5.

670
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,155
There's also an
epidural hematoma.

671
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,624
I will decompress the
spinal cord and stabilize

672
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,459
the spine as fast as I can.

673
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,461
I saw extrav from the femoral
artery on the imaging.

674
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,530
Alright, I'll help you
with the vascular repair,

675
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,800
and stand by in case
there's abdominal bleeding.

676
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,567
Dr. Shepherd, um,
can I assist you

677
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,869
on the decompression and fusion?

678
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,005
Sure. Stand over there.

679
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,639
But I-I can't reach
the field from here.

680
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,308
I know.

681
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,843
Jonathan needs an
extremely delicate

682
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,511
and complicated procedure.

683
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,080
You're most useful if
you don't touch anything.

684
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,482
It's been a dramatic case,
Yasuda. You're doing great.

685
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,919
Ten blade.

686
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,989
Adams?

687
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,190
Uh, what'd I do?

688
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,026
Nothing. That's
just the problem.

689
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,627
You have to follow me.

690
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,562
I cannot work if I cannot
visualize the field.

691
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,564
Okay, on it. Don't worry about

692
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,999
what happened this morning.
None of that matters in here.

693
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,168
In here, it's perfect. Okay?

694
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,169
Okay.

695
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,871
Where are we?

696
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,406
Uh, 10 o'clock. Still
on the Kocher maneuver.

697
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,475
Kocher maneuver.
Which is what?

698
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,045
Mobilizing the duodenum and
pancreatic head off of the IVC.

699
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,180
Good.

700
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,150
Okay. Focus it where
I'm dissecting.

Okay, your turn.

902
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,645
Well, I spent a few
years in Saint Kitts,

903
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,914
where lightning
is a fact of life.

904
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,616
You grew up there? No.

905
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:01,051
I went there for...

906
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,288
I went there for medical school.

907
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:07,157
Because I didn't get into
medical school in the U.S.

908
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,461
But your nickname
is Blue Ribbon,

909
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:13,030
so I'm a little confused.

910
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:16,000
My nickname is just Blue

911
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,837
because I was a
valedictorian in high school,

912
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,574
all state track and field,
and a national chess champion.

913
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,910
But then in college,
my mother got sick,

914
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,478
my grades took a nosedive,

915
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:31,716
and Saint Kitts
became my only option.

916
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,518
And your mom, is she okay?

917
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,685
No.

918
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,688
She got really sick,

919
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,991
and then she died.

920
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,863
But on a brighter note,

921
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,833
we'd make a hell
of a trivia team.

922
