Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:05,602
What if it wasn't
ridiculous? What?

3
00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:07,938
What if you try to
cure Alzheimer's?

4
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:09,916
Should I anticipate any goodbye
e-mails from you? I don't know.

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,218
Tessa's like Seattle royalty.

6
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:12,667
Man, I grew up on her stories.

7
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,059
I do have
another story to tell.

8
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,222
"Tessa and the Rising Sun."

9
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:18,811
I'm sorry. I can't.

10
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,204
You don't consider
me part of your life.

11
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:23,057
Of course you're
part of my life.

12
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,138
You took the Boston job
without even talking to me.

13
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,060
I love cardio. But
I love you more.

14
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,751
Guess I'm not sure
that I respect that.

15

♪ I'm up, I'm here,
I'm out the door ♪

16
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:42,732
One of the greatest
frustrations surgeons have

17
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:45,148
are the unrealistic
expectations of our patients.

18
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,563
Whoa.

19
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:47,771
♪ Don't you wanna go with me

20
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,083
Whoa!

21
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:50,602
Whoa! Whoa!

22
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,017
No!

23
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,675
No. No, no, no!

24
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,678
Whether they're acutely ill or
they've been sick for years...

25
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,059
No, no, no, no, no.

26
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,750
No, no.

27
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,063
Oh, my God. No.

28
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,730
By the time they're
on the surgical table,

29
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,135
they're hoping for a miracle.

30
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:07,515
Thanks for the ride. Get out.

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,897
I'm late. So am I.

32
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:13,245
But often, surgery is just
the beginning of the healing,

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,902
rather than an end.

34
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:16,328
Because for weeks
or months post-op,

35
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,319
people have to learn how to live

36
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:20,263
without the part of their
body we've just removed.

37
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,668
- You're late.
- Not as late as you.

38
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:26,120
And that's not always easy
and it's never painless.

39
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:28,226
So, surgery is not
the happily ever after

40
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,228
our patients hope it will be.

41
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:32,713
Like everything else in
life, it's an evolution.

42
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:34,059
Now, remember what
I said to you.

43
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,209
You're going to take these gifts

44
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,545
and go visit your
old daycare teachers.

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,892
They're gonna be very
excited to see you.

46
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:41,042
Do you remember
where you're going?

47
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,137
Mom, I'm not a baby. Same, Mom.

48
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:45,657
Okay.

49
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,521
Hey!
Look who's here!

50
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,695
Hi. Big last day.

51
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,007
Yeah, we're trying to forget

52
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,088
all that and act like everything

53
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,664
is super normal.
How are we doing?

54
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,322
Not great.

55
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:57,116
- How's the new place?
- It is great.

56
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,464
It is weird to live alone
when I don't have Scout,

57
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,742
but I feel very grown up.

58
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:04,158
Do you have any surgeries
I can watch today? Zola...

59
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,987
I might have a
very excellent one

60
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:08,507
with Uncle Winston in O.R. two,
if your mom says it's okay.

61
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,544
Mom, please?

62
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,498
Okay, if anyone asks, I
don't know where you are.

63
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,998
Link! Hi. Hey.

64
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,518
Do you, uh... Do you have a busy
schedule today? Actually, no.

65
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,762
I've carved out my whole
day to catch up on charting.

66
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,385
I am buried in... I need you
to pick up a cake by noon.

67
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,077
This bakery's across
town. It's for Meredith.

68
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,527
Does she like faraway cake?

69
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,184
It's her favorite.

70
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,368
It's the triple berry
with the buttercream.

71
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:32,704
I would do it myself,

72
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,050
but the baby that I delivered

73
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:35,579
two weeks ago with
the malformed heart,

74
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,191
he's having heart surgery today,

75
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,400
and his parents are very
attached to me, and...

76
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:41,816
And... and you love
me, so please help.

77
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,370
That is true.

78
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,614
I do love you. Thank you.

79
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,345
You're all rounding with
Doctors Ndugu and Pierce.

80
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,382
They are breaking
new surgical ground,

81
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,178
and it is a privilege
that they have invited...

82
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,524
Sorry. My car broke down.

83
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,215
Had to get a ride
with my sister.

84
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,744
Yeah, my car got towed
and it's also my house.

85
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,701
Do you know who else
wasn't punctual?

86
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,462
Taryn Helm wasn't punctual,

87
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,291
despite being an
excellent surgeon,

88
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:11,087
and now you can find her
throwing her life away

89
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,813
bartending across the street.

90
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,367
There's a surgeon
bartending at Joe's?

91
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,713
Why?

92
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,543
Because she burnt
out, that's why.

93
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:22,823
So, hydrate and sleep
and lean on your friends,

94
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:26,033
and take a break and
get a good therapist.

95
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,931
And be on time,

96
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,588
unless you want to
wind up like Helm,

97
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,107
wasting your talents,

98
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,178
your family's investment,
and your futures.

99
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,253
Does she know you're throwing
shade behind her back?

100
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,876
Dr. Joseph to L&D.

101
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:44,120
Dr. Earl Joseph to L&D.

102
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,262
Meadow, Will.

103
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:49,815
Um, we're a teaching hospital,

104
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,196
and these are our first years.

105
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,473
Is it okay if they stay?

106
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,819
You can say no.

107
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,545
Uh, i-it should be okay.

108
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,202
Baby?

109
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,761
Dr. Kwan.

110
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,697
Arlo Fischer, delivered by
Dr. Wilson two weeks ago,

111
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,528
and diagnosed with truncus
arteriosus and VSD.

112
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:14,875
He's been listed for a
transplant for heart failure,

113
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,291
and he was placed
on ECMO a week ago.

114
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,983
Arlo's deterioration is
sending him into organ failure.

115
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,365
We got a call from UNOS last
night that there is a match,

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,471
but the procurement
team reported

117
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,576
that the donor
heart muscle is weak

118
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,682
and not suitable
for transplantation.

119
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,200
But Dr. Pierce
and I believe

120
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,592
that we can still
make use of the heart

121
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:33,825
if we transplant only
the two major arteries.

122
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,216
So, it's a partial
heart transplant?

123
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,759
Has that ever been done before?

124
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,209
No, this will be the first.

125
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,419
I don't understand.

126
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,041
Why can't we just
wait on another heart?

127
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,802
Meadow, it could take months
to find another match.

128
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:47,977
Arlo cannot stay on
ECMO for that long.

129
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,186
Baby, she's saying partial
is better than nothing.

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,188
We know this is frightening,
but if this works,

131
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,534
these valves will grow with
him for the rest of his life,

132
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,226
and he won't need
a heart transplant

133
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,090
or any other
additional surgeries.

134
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,577
Ifthis works. What
if it doesn't work?

135
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:04,234
He dies? My baby dies?

136
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:08,998
We're gonna give you some
time to think about it.

137
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,655
We really do
believe that this is

138
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,898
Arlo's best option
at this point.

139
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,629
I can stay.

140
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:21,079
Yes, Of course.

141
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,183
Thank you, Doctor.Yeah.

142
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:34,023
Come in.

143
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,200
Hey. Hi.

144
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,134
Heard it's your
last day. It is.

145
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,206
Thanks for coming.

146
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,207
I went by the house.

147
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,831
It's nice to see
it's still standing.

148
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,040
There's a giant hole where
the attic used to be.

149
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,225
They've spent the last two
weeks stabilizing the place,

150
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:55,216
but everything still
reeks of smoke.

151
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,357
It's... How are the kids?

152
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,462
Zola's excited to start
at her new school.

153
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:02,016
I think Bailey and
Ellis are sad to leave.

154
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,328
I called, you know?

155
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,433
I know.

156
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,539
This has been a lot.

157
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:11,163
A fire, living in
a hotel, moving.

158
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,934
No, I know it's been a lot,
but what... what was your plan?

159
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,350
You were just gonna leave
and not call me back?

160
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,661
And you're gonna move
across the country

161
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:16,928
without a conversation?

162
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,379
I-I-I-I don't get
that. I don't.

163
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,690
I didn't know what to say.

164
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,071
I moved here to be with you.

165
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,289
Yes, I took a job,
but I moved here

166
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:25,246
to be with you.

167
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,283
You didn't say it back.

168
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:29,975
I didn't say what back?

169
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,874
You s...

170
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,876
What?

171
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,325
I said, "I love you."

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,327
You were standing
exactly in that spot

173
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,639
where you are right now.

174
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:39,916
I said, "I love you."

175
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,504
You didn't say it back.

176
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,507
You had just taken a
job at my hospital.

177
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,647
I thought... I had hoped

178
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,373
that we were gonna pick it up

179
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,375
right where we left off.

180
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,342
But you seemed to
want to take it slow.

181
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:55,173
So, it did not occur to me

182
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,624
to confer with you
about me moving.

183
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,256
Okay, so wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, whoa.

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,868
This... So, this is on me?

185
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,183
This whole thing, it's my fault?

186
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,492
That is not what I just said.

187
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,528
I-I didn't do and say
exactly what you thought

188
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,496
I should do and say on
exactly your timeline,

189
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,567
so this whole mess is my fault.

190
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,027
That's what you're saying?
That is not what I said.

191
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,811
No, no. Nope.

192
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:13,881
I can't.

193
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,193
I can't.

194
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,556
So essentially, we will
take out the truncus

195
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,144
and the malformed artery,

196
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,984
replace it with the donor
aorta and pulmonary trunk,

197
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,389
and then use their
walls to close the VSD.

198
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,712
So it's like gutting
the inside of a house

199
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,185
without disturbing the frames.

200
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,577
Can you not use the word
"gutting" when talking

201
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:44,705
about a tiny baby heart?

202
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,569
Mm, cosign.

203
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,167
I don't like the verbiage, but
it is a pretty apt metaphor.

204
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,986
Do we get to scrub in?

205
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,195
There will only be room for
one of you at the table.

206
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,370
We are operating on a heart
the size of a strawberry.

207
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,406
The vessels are half
a centimeter wide.

208
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,167
My hands are the smallest!

209
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,869
You will not be stitching.
You will be observing.

210
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,689
But whoever does the
best vascular anastomosis

211
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:05,381
in the skills lab wins the spot.

212
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,177
Dr. Kwan.

213
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,627
Yeah?

214
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,387
Uh, don't do your
finger agility exercises

215
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,906
in front of the
patients, alright?

216
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,908
Oh, it's a technique
I use to disengage

217
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,081
from the emotionality.

218
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,326
To stay neutral.

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,648
Y-You know, when...
When the mother

220
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,363
started crying, I was...

221
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,642
It's smart. You just can't
let them see it, Kwan.

222
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,229
Understood.

223
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,511
Richard!

224
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,063
Just curious how it's going.

225
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,582
The search for the new chief.

226
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,376
It was easy a few years ago

227
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,138
when we were at the
top of our game. Right.

228
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:39,967
But we've got a lot of
interesting applicants

229
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,554
we're sorting through, yeah.

230
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,902
I mean, Grey-Sloan
is not an easy place

231
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,663
just to step right
into.

232
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,975
It's got its own history,
its... its own quirks,

233
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,252
its own personality.

234
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,909
Well, that it
does.

235
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:54,188
Yeah. I mean, it... it wouldn't
be the... the worst idea

236
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,845
to look closer to home.

237
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,226
Someone who's been here,

238
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,504
who... who understands
our history,

239
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,818
the issues, and... and
our past and our needs.

240
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:06,097
Altman, I think
you're onto something.

241
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,375
T-There's no extra pay involved,

242
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,525
but there's lots
of free pastries

243
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,378
and we could use your expertise.

244
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:13,863
I-I'm sorry, there's
no extra pay?

245
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,520
No, the search
committee is voluntary.

246
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,073
But we'd love to have you.

247
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,913
We're meeting in the second
floor conference room

248
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,491
from 4:00 to 6:00 on Monday.

249
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,183
Okay, got it. Thank you.

250
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,529
I will...

251
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,013
join. Great.

252
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,094
Yeah. Thank you.

253
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

254
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,641
Meadow, I got a page.
Is everything okay?

255
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,125
I can't do it.

256
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,887
I-I can't kiss him goodbye

257
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,751
for what might be forever.

258
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:41,201
She wants to wait.

259
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:45,585
W-We want to wait
for a whole heart.

260
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,311
An infant donor heart
could take up to six months

261
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:49,347
to find a match.

262
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,659
But we got this one.

263
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,153
This one was a match
and it came in days.

264
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,386
But it was damaged. I know.

265
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,561
But we could get another match

266
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,080
in the next couple of days.

267
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,978
It could happen.

268
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,602
I know that it's hard, and
I know that it's scary,

269
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,570
but Dr. Pierce is
as good as it gets

270
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,365
and she is not a risk taker.

271
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,574
She doesn't do
experimental surgeries

272
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,507
for practice or for glory.

273
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,992
She is suggesting this
because she believes

274
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:15,373
that she can save Arlo's life.

275
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:23,484
I don't know how to
love my son this much

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,728
and send him in for an
experimental surgery

277
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,212
that might kill him.

278
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,906
I-I can't do it.

279
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,324
If he
dies in that surgery,

280
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,327
I won't ever be okay again.

281
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,398
Tell Dr. Pierce
thank you, but no.

282
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,331
The surgery is off.

283
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:06,666
Ow! Damn it.

284
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,668
You know what?

285
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,048
Screw this.

286
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,674
What? Should I go
after her? - Shh.

287
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,399
Some of us are trying to win.

288
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,229
I hate this stitch.

289
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:21,439
Oh, you have to kinda twirl
your wrist like, um...

290
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,716
Here.

291
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,582
Right.

292
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,170
Yeah.

293
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,381
Oh, no. It's Tessa Hobbes.

294
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:33,727
Who?

295
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:35,177
I have no idea.

296
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:37,697
Done.

297
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,216
Tessa. What happened?

298
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,562
I'm so sorry.

299
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:43,219
She came in with
severe abdominal pain.

300
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,050
She's a bit hypotensive.
Take her to CT.

301
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,052
I-I picked up my groceries.

302
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,054
Tessa, we said no heavy
lifting, three months.

303
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,365
It was just a grocery bag,

304
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,265
and I was feeling so great.

305
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,025
And then there was
this sharp pain,

306
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,475
like something tore.

307
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,821
And then she drove herself here.

308
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,029
Wh... You drove yourself?

309
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:01,144
Well, in retrospect, I can see

310
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,514
that might have been a bad idea.

311
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:04,344
Tessa, which area hurts exactly?

312
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,208
All of it. The
entire abdomen hurts.

313
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,312
Here... touch right there.

314
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,762
Ow! She's tachycardic.

315
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,084
We should take her
straight to the O.R.

316
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,523
No, her blood
pressure's holding.

317
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:12,880
Get her to CT first
and then call the O.R.

318
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,216
to be on standby.

319
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,735
Skip the line.
I'll call ahead.

320
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,195
I really think we
should just take her

321
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,437
straight to the O.R.Go!
I'll call Marsh.

322
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,566
Someone page Chief Grey!

323
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:32,027
Are you Dr. Hellum?
Who's asking?

324
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:34,374
Mika Yasuda, first
year surgical resident.

325
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,238
It's Helm, and I'm
no longer a doctor.

326
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:37,653
Cool, 'cause I'm barely a doctor

327
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:38,930
and I'm desperate for a win.

328
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,347
Could you possibly teach me

329
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,902
how to do a perfect
microvascular anastomosis?

330
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,042
There's a contest and if
I win I get to scrub in

331
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,975
on a partial heart
transplant on a newborn.

332
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,700
A partial heart
transplant doesn't exist.

333
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:54,083
I know, but it is about
to, and I-I need this.

334
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,155
I need a win because I, uh...

335
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,374
I don't have anywhere
to sleep tonight,

336
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,780
and Seattle is
outrageously expensive,

337
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:04,576
and being a surgical
resident is exhausting...

338
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,647
to the point
of nearly impossible,

339
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,374
and I just really need to give
myself a reason to keep caring.

340
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,585
And if Blue wins, I
cannot take the gloating.

341
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,242
Blue? Like the ribbon.

342
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,968
And this is a nickname
he perpetuates.

343
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,556
Wow. That is arrogant.

344
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,937
Right?

345
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,526
20 bucks.

346
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,977
My house was towed this morning,
so I don't have 20 bucks.

347
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:27,496
But if I win this contest,

348
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,853
I will barback for you
on Friday night for free.

349
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,188
You've been a barback?

350
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,372
No, but I've been a cater waiter

351
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,846
and I'm excellent
at chopping limes.

352
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,576
Give me it.

353
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,374
♪ I love you far

354
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,410
♪ You know I'm never right

355
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,209
I was treating myself to
champagne and fruit salad

356
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,591
because that's
what I was craving,

357
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,076
and I had plenty to celebrate.

358
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,802
Now, okay, wait, wait.

359
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,392
And then
the groceries came.

360
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,394
They left them on
the front stoop.

361
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,085
It didn't even o-occur to me

362
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,260
not to bend over
and pick them up.

363
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:08,778
It's routine.

364
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,816
It's muscle memory.

365
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,508
Dr. Griffith, the ring
around your necklace...

366
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,889
Are you engaged?

367
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,477
I-I was. I was engaged.

368
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,065
Now I'm not.

369
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,033
Heartbreak is the worst.

370
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,724
It is.

371
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,692
If I die today, I might
even miss heartbreak.

372
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:26,900
Please try not to die today.

373
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,660
Yeah, I'll do my best.

374
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,524
Oh, wait. I need my purse.

375
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,147
Right now? Yes, where is it?

376
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,193
Uh, it's downstairs
with your clothes.

377
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,504
I can get it after
we're done here.

378
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,082
Okay.

379
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,911
Hey, what happened?

380
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,027
Schmitt said her abdomen is
distended and she's tachy.

381
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,604
She's getting more hypotensive.

382
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,710
Okay, well, you two
need to go book an O.R.

383
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,584
I don't care if you have to
kick someone out to do it.

384
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,472
Tessa takes priority.

385
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,992
I don't get it.

386
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,511
She did this for groceries?

387
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,685
Well, I don't think she
did it on purpose, Nick.

388
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,240
I think she probably lives
alone and is set in her ways,

389
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,759
and I'm sure it's a lot for
her to change and ask for help.

390
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,485
Hello?

391
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,763
We're here, Tessa.
Please stay very still.

392
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:05,559
I'm afraid. This is all wrong.

393
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,940
I-I don't want to die.

394
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,254
I still have something to say.

395
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,980
Tessa, you're not
going anywhere today.

396
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,188
We've got you.

397
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,568
She's bleeding out.

398
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,467
We're gonna need
some help in here.

399
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,745
We're gonna need
blood in the O.R.

400
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,712
Tessa, we're gonna
take you upstairs.

401
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,577
So on a scale
of one to better?

402
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:25,752
We're better. I think.
I think we're better.

403
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:28,134
But you're not sure?

404
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,377
I am sure that we
are both excited

405
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,932
about this partial heart
transplant on an infant,

406
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,554
which is a stroke-of-genius idea

407
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,211
that we came up with together.

408
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:39,214
And that is because in the
O.R., we're good together.

409
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:41,595
In our chosen field of
study, we are so good.

410
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,090
Are you rehearsing
a speech you plan on

411
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:44,702
giving him later?
Maybe a little.

412
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,783
So the two of you haven't
really spoken since the fire.

413
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh, we said some things.

414
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,328
We needed a cooling-off period.

415
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,537
It's best that we
haven't talked about it.

416
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:55,747
A-And, you know,
we'll talk again soon.

417
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:58,129
As soon as we change
medical history.

418
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:00,338
I have bad news.

419
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:01,305
Oh, no. The baby?

420
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,858
No, he's stable.

421
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,342
But his mom's too scared.

422
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,034
She wants to call it off.

423
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,381
I can't talk her into it.
That would be unethical.

424
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,659
But you think she's
got this one wrong?

425
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,696
Without this surgery, the
baby has days to live.

426
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,216
She had a 30-hour labor and
she did it without any meds.

427
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,011
Meaning? She's a warrior.

428
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,426
She's strong in her convictions,

429
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,428
and she seems sure
of what she wants.

430
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,328
Let me talk to her.

431
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:25,639
You can't.

432
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:26,778
I'm not her doctor.

433
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,264
Let me talk to her.

434
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:34,407
You're a neurosurgeon,
so do you think Arlo needs...

435
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,891
No, no, no. No.

436
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,651
No, I'm not here as
one of Arlo's doctors.

437
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,206
I'm sorry, but if you're here
to try to talk me into...

438
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,173
I'm here because I had a baby

439
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,038
who only lived for 43 minutes.

440
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,075
He had a condition
called anencephaly,

441
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,595
which is when the baby's brain
does not develop typically,

442
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,392
and, uh, we discovered it
when I was 6 months pregnant.

443
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,222
We didn't know.

444
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,536
We didn't know until he was born

445
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:59,052
that there was anything wrong.

446
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,329
I gave birth to Christopher

447
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,228
knowing that he would
be an organ donor,

448
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,230
uh, because there was
nothing that we could do.

449
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:07,301
There was no surgery
that we could try.

450
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:11,753
And, um, I think about
him a lot these days

451
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,069
because he has a brother
now, named Scout,

452
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:17,553
and as Scout grows up,

453
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,175
I cannot help but think about

454
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,694
who Christopher would have been.

455
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:24,560
And, um...

456
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:28,047
what I do know is

457
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,911
if there had been a chance

458
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,199
that Christopher
could have lived,

459
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:34,053
if there had been any hope,

460
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,331
if there had been any surgery

461
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:40,473
and it meant that
he might live...

462
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,164
I would take the shot.

463
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,183
I knew it.

464
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,712
I knew we should have taken
her straight to the O.R.

465
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,817
We needed the CT to see
if we could operate...

466
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,154
My gut doesn't lie.

467
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,845
And I should have fought for it.

468
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,743
We should have brought
her straight here.

469
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,647
Yeah, I'm number one.

470
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,062
Ew, someone likes himself.

471
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,030
No, my sample is
literally number one.

472
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,825
But yes, I intend to win.

473
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,414
What is that face?
Is that good?

474
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,209
It is if you want
to go home early.

475
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,842
I knew I shouldn't have
practiced on bananas.

476
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,386
What about fruit says
"baby veins" to you?

477
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,146
This is all good work.

478
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,769
Number one's sutures are
particularly precise.

479
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:41,154
But with perfect
alignment and tension,

480
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,639
the winner is number three.

481
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,745
That's me!

482
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,024
Guess we gotta call
you Red today, huh?

483
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:50,198
Hm.

484
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:17,570
Scalpel.

485
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,099
I thought you would win.

486
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,067
Your stitches are
typically excellent.

487
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,379
I know.

488
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,415
Better than Yasuda's.

489
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,176
I tanked the contest

490
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,523
because babies scare the
crap out of me.

491
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,225
Didn't want to be
anywhere near that table.

492
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,767
Why are you scared of babies?

493
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,229
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

494
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:46,219
You gotta tell me. Come on.

495
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:48,670
Okay, but you owe me one.

496
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:49,705
Owe you what?

497
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,982
Whatever I decide.

498
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,398
Fine.

499
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:57,644
When I was 5, my dad
took me into the backyard

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,097
where my mom had just
given birth to my brother

501
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:03,685
in a kiddie pool.

502
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,240
Now, you've done an OB rotation.

503
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,105
You're acquainted with
all the blood and placenta

504
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,901
and the literal horror movie
that is human child birth.

505
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,283
And I'm sure it's all very
beautiful in its own way,

506
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,008
but I was 5.

507
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:19,252
And before I could fully
process what I was seeing,

508
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:21,461
my dad handed me
a pair of scissors

509
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,636
and told me to cut
the umbilical cord.

510
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,878
Wait, you were 5?

511
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,225
Yeah.

512
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,677
What, you think this is funny?

513
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,921
This is trauma.

514
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,164
This is... This
is crystal-loving,

515
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,029
weed-smoking, latter-day
hippie-style trauma.

516
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,308
Shh!

517
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:42,102
Sorry to shush you, but my aunt

518
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,414
is making history right now,

519
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:45,451

all be paying attention.

694

695

my junior year, which
took me out for weeks,

696
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,233
but in med school, I was
back up to number one.

697
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:59,029

before coming here

699
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,139

00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:21,362

quite similar to yours.

707
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,881
I didn't consider
you for the job

708
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,813
because it is a flailing program

709
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,885
with a huge amount of stress.

710
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,646

no apology coming
