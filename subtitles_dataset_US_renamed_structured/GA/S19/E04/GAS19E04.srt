1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:03,523
Researchers
and patient safety experts

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,046
are still trying to answer
this important question --

3
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:09,656
How many people die every year
from medical mistakes?

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,605
Mistakes include misdiagnoses,

5
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,684
hospital-acquired infections,

6
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:18,645
medication errors,
patient falls,

7
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,689
and discharging patients
too early.

8
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,524
Happy Halloween.

9
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,485
Ugh.

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,614
As terrifying as it can be
for patients

11
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:32,075
to think they might die
from a medical error,

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,077
it's also terrifying
for doctors.

13
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,288
Oh, Schmitt,
Ms. Rose needs an N. G. tube.

14
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,540
I already put that in.
She pulled it out.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,875
That is the third time
she...

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,462
I will reinsert it
and bridle it this time.
Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,673
Um, you also need to get
the family's consent

18
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,800
for the PEG tube
in 1204.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,510
Uh, consent, right.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,595
Uh, is that it?
Is that it?

21
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,306
Schmitt.

22
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,683
Come on.
Princess Leia?

23
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,518
Also Senator
and General.

24
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,145
Pru is on her way

25
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,938
to go trick-or-treating
around the hospital.

26
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,815
She's gonna be an Ewok.

27
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,025
It's her third costume
of the day.

28
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:05,984
It's cute, right?

29
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,611
It's so cute.

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,740
Yes.
Oh, no. That's, um...

31
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,242
Yes.
Ah, better.

32
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,619
Hey, and don't forget

33
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,495
Webber's pumpkin-carving
contest, Dr. Schmitt.

34
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,247
I wasn't invited to that.

35
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,751
Even if our mistakes
are innocent,

36
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:25,712
they become etched
onto our souls like tombstones.

37
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,548
And if you never do anything
to process these memories,

38
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:30,675
they will come back to haunt
you when you least expect it.

39
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,135
What are y'all watching?

40
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,803
Oh, "First Year Scrub Room
Freak Out."

41
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,930
Someone posted it this morning.
It's all over the place.

42
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,349
Oh!
Ooh!
Ohhh!

43
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,559
Now Bamm-Bamm's
throwing stuff.

44
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,145
"The Flintstones."

45
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,605
What is she doing
with that box of --

46
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,065
Ah!

47
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:46,191
Out the window.
Nice.

48
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,484
Well, maybe she lost
a patient?

49
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,693
Well,
she lost something.

50
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:49,778
Her privacy.

51
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:52,864
Focus.

52
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,532
Creativity.

53
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,534
Surgical dexterity.

54
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,204
All qualities an amazing surgeon
must master

55
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:02,248
to be a success in the O. R.

56
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,084
Welcome to
the Grey-Sloan Memorial

57
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,044
Pumpkin Carving Contest.

58
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,254
I already hate this.
Do we get a prize?

59
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,632
Pumpkin carving is
an excellent way

60
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,009
to practice delicacy
and precision.

61
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,969
The more elaborate the vision,
the better.

62
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:19,349
Uh, Dr. Pierce needs an intern
in the pit.

63
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,352
Griffith, you go.

64
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,270
We'll save you one.

65
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,482
All right, who's ready
to choose a gourd?

66
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,820
Dr. Wagner to radiology.

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,406
Oh, hey, uh, Mr. Jancy's
chest X-rays looked clear,

68
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:36,241
so I just
discharged him.

69
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,076
I think he wanted to get home
for trick-or-treating.

70
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:41,329
I see you're scheduled for
vascular procedures tomorrow.

71
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,623
Yeah, Dr. Param is still out
on paternity leave,

72
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,251
so I just offered
to help out.

73
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,836
Is that a problem?
No.

74
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,046
No, I just...
Hey.

75
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,631
Hey.
I'm headed out.

76
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,633
I'm gonna take the kids
trick-or-treating.

77
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,844
Do not bring them candy from
the lounge. They have enough.

78
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,887
How am I supposed to maintain
my favorite-auntie status?

79
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,057
Okay. Boom.
We got 'em. Bodies.

80
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,016
You got 'em?
Yeah, we got 'em.

81
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,143
Bodies?
Yes.

82
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:05,061
Freshly deceased,
releases signed,

83
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,479
ready to get hooked up
to the machines and everything.

84
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,356
Okay, so we're
doing this tonight?

85
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,358
Yes. Fresh tissue decomposes
quickly. We have to.

86
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,776
Okay, so you go
find the interns.

87
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,153
Okay.
I will find Owen.

88
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,320
Hey, can one of you
stay and help?

89
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,656
I find
this conversation disturbing.

90
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,116
Are you in?
Yeah.

91
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,868
Let's go.
Okay.

92
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,288
Dr. Andorka to the NICU.

93
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,374
Dr. Mary Andorka
to the NICU.

94
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,460
Ta-da!

95
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,128
Hey.

96
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,172
Ooh.
We get anything good?

97
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,258
No, oh, we are all waiting
until after dinner, Uncle Link.

98
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,887
What are you doing
for your cancerversary tonight?

99
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:43,141
I was thinking...you, me,
dinner, foot rub...

100
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,559
Okay.

101
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,852
Or just dinner.

102
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,481
Or...nothing?

103
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,858
They asked me to take
an extra shift. I'm sorry.

104
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,902
Yeah.
No problem.

105
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,528
No, really,
don't feel bad.

106
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,365
These are the exact moments
for...Tinder.

107
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,535
Tinder? On Halloween?
What's your costume?

108
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,204
Businessman?

109
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,457
Sexy doctor.
Ha! Okay.

110
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,001
Oh, perfect for this
sexy nurse, huh?

111
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,211
That's sexist.

112
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,546
We could start
a sexy practice.

113
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,839
What is wrong with you?

114
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,175
Oh.
Oh, there's a lot of them.

115
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,344
No.

116
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,512
Bye.

117
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,848
How far out?

118
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,433
Any minute.

119
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,186
Please say that Webber sent me
more than one intern

120
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,854
for Halloween night.

121
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,439
I'm actually
with Dr. Pierce.

122
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,609
You remember how this night is
for cardio.

123
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,153
A lot of jump scares,
a lot of heart attacks.

124
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,201
What do we got?

125
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,036
16-year-old male,
fall from 30 feet

126
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,955
with blunt trauma to chest,
negative LOC,

127
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:49,207
possible left upper extremity
fractures.

128
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,209
Hypotensive.
Tachy in the 130s.

129
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,461
Sats 92%.
Do we know
what happened?

130
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,380
He and his buddy took
a flying leap off a roof

131
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,590
trying to land
in a swimming pool.

132
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,133
This one missed.
Friend's in the other rig.

133
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,343
All right,
take him to trauma one.

134
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,013
What do we got?

135
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,181
16-year-old male,
fall from height,

136
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,516
no loss
of consciousness.

137
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,892
He landed in water.

138
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,727
No visible injuries,
heart rate's 130.

139
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,105
Jarah?
We flew!

140
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,731
We flew, man.

141
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,941
They both took LSD.

142
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,317
All right, trauma one.

143
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,820
Why do they always think
that they can fly?

144
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,050
Oh, nice job, Adams.

145
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,886
Classic.

146
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,848
They ate too much.

147
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,602
What?
I'm scared of pumpkins.

148
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,104
The smell, the texture,
everything.

149
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,815
Pumpkin spice?
Bread?

150
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,275
Candles?

151
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,444
What did
I ever do to you?

152
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,907
It's Dr. Marsh.
Trauma alert.

153
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,366
It just says
"Sim Lab."

154
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,743
There's a trauma
in the sim lab?

155
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,330
You'd better go.

156
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,214
It shouldn't take you
five minutes

157
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,967
to respond
to a trauma page.

158
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,969
Where's the trauma?

159
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,263
Ever since we moved towards more
minimally invasive techniques

160
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,015
in nonsurgical management,

161
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,725
interns have had less
and less opportunity

162
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,894
to train
on open traumas.

163
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:36,522
Right, that's blunt trauma,
penetrating trauma, open wounds.

164
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,857
Every hospital may not
see them everyday,

165
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,150
but you still need
to learn them.

166
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,152
And you will.
Starting tonight.

167
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:44,614
Every year, Dr. Hunt runs
a trauma training session,

168
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,741
usually in the parking lot
with dummies.

169
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,992
This year...

170
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,831
Fresh tissue cadaver.

171
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,500
Real body, fake blood.

172
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,752
You're welcome.
Happy Halloween.

173
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,797
Okay, 32-year-old male,
stab wound to the left chest,

174
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:04,884
B.P. is 90/40, tachy in the
120s, sats in the high 80s.

175
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,594
Oh, w-what are
we supposed to do?

176
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,057
Save him.

177
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,809
Come on.
Uh, okay.

178
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,268
Sorry.
That's mine.

179
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,645
Ow!
Sorry, sorry.

180
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,742
He has a hemothorax.
Prep for a chest tube.

181
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,456
Dr. Pierce.

182
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,458
Flail chest.
Tell me why.

183
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,460
Because he has five broken
and displaced ribs,

184
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,170
which disrupted the stability
of the chest wall.

185
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,631
After we stabilize him,
we have to get him to C. T.

186
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,925
Jarah!
Oh, God, that's my son!

187
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,885
What happened to him?

188
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,430
Mr. Al-Hasan, I'm Dr. Pierce.
This is Dr. Griffith.

189
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,265
Your son has had
a serious fall

190
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,684
and sustained severe injures
to his chest.

191
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:57,854
He went to a friend's house to
study and watch a scary movie.

192
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,272
The EMTs said
they found evidence

193
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,857
that they may have
taken LSD.

194
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,316
No.
That's -- That's not possible.

195
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,318
Jarah and River,
they're A. P. students.

196
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,945
They're lab partners.
They don't do drugs.

197
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,782
Oh, God!

198
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,617
Jarah!
Please, do something!

199
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,995
His sats are dropping.
I need an intubation tray!

200
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,371
Get that chest tube ready!

201
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,581
Get him out of here.

202
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,374
Sir, if you could just
come with me.

203
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,251
We'll keep you updated.

204
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,922
Deep breaths.

205
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,090
Good.

206
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,968
Did they take Jarah?
They did.

207
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,762
That's why we jumped off
the roof.

208
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,388
The bats
were looking for us.

209
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,640
The paramedics took him
for medical treatment.

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,058
He's my best friend.

211
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,643
I couldn't let the bats
take him.

212
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,854
River,
you are extremely lucky.

213
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,022
You only hit water.

214
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,065
He's severely injured.

215
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,442
I told him it was safe.

216
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,527
Well, you're a teenager.

217
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,654
Your prefrontal cortex
isn't fully formed.

218
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,574
And you combine that with LSD,
and nothing is safe.

219
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,077
Someone's gonna come
take your blood.

220
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,913
Don't move, okay?

221
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,122
Okay, we need access
to give him blood.

222
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,540
Okay, let's prep
for an I. J.

223
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,209
No, that's where
he's cannulated!

224
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,002
He needs a femoral line.
Consider an airway secure.

225
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,420
Femoral line has been placed.

226
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,130
Move on.
What about the entry wound?

227
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,548
B.P.'s 60/40 now.

228
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,842
Beep. Beep.
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

229
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,469
- Come on!
- Got it.

230
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,596
Fully intact
fresh tissue cadavers are rare.

231
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,808
Be mindful.
They can cost up to $10,000.

232
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,226
That's more than my house!
You live in a van.

233
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,644
Exactly!
Okay, what's his name?

234
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,312
He's a cadaver.
He's a patient!

235
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,647
Knowing their names
humanizes them.

236
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,357
Oh, my God,
just call him Chris.

237
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,359
Whoever uses the best
critical-thinking skills

238
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,320
on Chris will scrub in with me
on an ax-fem bypass tomorrow.

239
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,239
BP's 60/40 still.

240
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,407
Scalpel. Scalpel. I'm gonna do
an emergency thoracotomy!

241
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,408
Not if I do it first!

242
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,368
No, no!

243
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,746
Ah.

244
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:40,957
Boo!

245
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,166
Hi, Nick.
Oh, okay.

246
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,376
That's funny.
All right.

247
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,419
Okay, everyone pee.

248
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,213
But I'm really looking at you,
Ellis.

249
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,589
I'm gonna go
get my bag.

250
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,382
Okay.

251
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,426
What?

252
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,761
You need to work
on your scare game.

253
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,221
What, you don't -- you don't
think I'm scary?

254
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,014
I -- You know,
it's not about me.

255
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,432
Well,
maybe it's the sheet.

256
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,725
I'm a lot scarier
without the sheet.

257
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:00,977
Mm-hmm.

258
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,689
Okay, you're sure you don't mind
if we go?

259
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,775
Bailey and Ellis will crash
from all that sugar in minutes.

260
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,319
You guys just drop Zola off
at her slumber party

261
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,029
and then go have
a night.

262
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,531
Yeah.
Are you okay?

263
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,074
I mean, we can stay.

264
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,034
No, she just hasn't spent
the night out, you know,

265
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,953
since the episodes
started, so...

266
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,038
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, she seems like
she wants to go.

267
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,415
All her friends
will be there,

268
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,209
and you will be
a phone call away.

269
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,711
Exactly.
I'm ready.

270
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,504
Okay, great.
Do you have your phone?

271
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,672
Mm-hmm.
Okay, let's go.

272
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,132
Let's go.

273
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,593
See ya.
Okay. Bye!

274
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,304
Dr. Williams
to labor and delivery.

275
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,972
Hey!

276
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,140
Baby girl!

277
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,975
Are you ready to be an Ewok?

278
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,602
Yeah!
Yeah, let's go
get changed.

279
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:44,020
Miranda, she --
she's really tired.

280
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,813
Oh, we won't be out late.

281
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,065
I heard Nurse Stacy

282
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,235
has a bowl
full of real goblin guts!

283
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,403
Uhh!

284
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,405
No,
it's just cold spaghetti.

285
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,282
Oh.
You sure you can't stay
for a bit?

286
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:59,577
It's a busy night, you know,
but I-I'll see you at home.

287
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,537
Okay.
Hey, be safe.

288
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,873
Yeah.

289
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,335
All right, let's go
get some candy!

290
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,462
Yeah!
Yes.

291
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,842
All right,
beds 1, 2, and 5

292
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,385
are all kids
with abdominal pain.

293
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,222
The interns should be done
pumpkin carving by now.

294
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,224
They moved
to trauma training.

295
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,475
What about
the real traumas?

296
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,435
It was a time-sensitive
exercise. Go.

297
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,190
Oh, e-excuse me, my son, River.
Someone brought him in.

298
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,858
Oh, uh, yes,
um, follow me.

299
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,235
Is River hurt?

300
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,028
S-Someone said that they jumped
off my roof?

301
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,864
Well, apparently they were
aiming for the pool,

302
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,243
but you should know that River
and his friend were both --

303
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,995
Where the hell is my son?

304
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,542
Hey, Lucinda, it's Link.

305
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,961
I'll see you over at Joe's bar
in a few.

306
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,171
This way, Isla.
Just sit right here.

307
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,423
Oh!
Do you need a hand?

308
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,218
Just find
my jerk of a husband.

309
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,803
Look, I'm just like
the bat.

310
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,554
I can do it.
I can do it.

311
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,640
Oh, hey, hey, buddy, that --
that's not a good place to be.

312
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,183
Watch me fly.

313
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,309
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

314
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,520
Whoo!
No!

315
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,562
Damn it.

316
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,650
Jo, are you okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah.

317
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,068
Hey! We need some help out here!
Get a gurney!

318
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,951
I am fine. My patient barely
made it to the elevator

319
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,744
before giving birth,

320
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,372
but mom and baby boy
are doing good.

321
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,666
Are you wearing cologne?

322
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,334
Aftershave.

323
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,378
And that's what
you're worried about?

324
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,879
You're a surgeon
who might have a broken wrist.

325
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,673
I will get an X-ray.

326
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,300
Please just --
just go take care

327
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,176
of the tripping teen
with the shattered leg.

328
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,187
A.P. lateral left wrist
for Jo Wilson. Thanks.

329
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,066
Hey, excuse me,
a-are you one of the doctors

330
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,193
who's working on
River Epley?

331
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,946
Can -- Can you just tell me
if he's gonna be okay?

332
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,406
Sir, just go back
to the waiting room.

333
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:02,658
No one
is telling me anything.

334
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,785
All right, we'll give you
an update as soon as we can.

335
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,290
Negative LOC, alert
but disoriented,

336
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,001
head lac,
films show a tibial fracture.

337
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,377
Oh, and he's on LSD.

338
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,754
That tracks.

339
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:15,629
Did you enjoy the flight,
River?

340
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,048
Uhh...

341
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,382
You know,
half a foot further,

342
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,009
he could have killed
Jo and Jo's patient.

343
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,218
And Jo's patient's baby.

344
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,512
Who has a baby?
What baby?

345
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,430
Yeah, you're not gonna be
feeling so good

346
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,806
once those drugs
wear off.

347
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,683
Was it worth it?
You okay?

348
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,019
Is the baby okay?
Who has a baby?

349
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,979
Look, I don't know
if he's still tripping

350
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,981
or he's got a brain injury
from the fall.

351
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,192
You mean the jump?

352
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,985
Good signal.
Blood flow's intact.

353
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,237
Okay, great.
Let's bring him up to C. T.

354
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,990
Oh, crap.
I got to cancel a date.

355
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,450
How long ago were you
supposed to meet her?

356
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,368
45 minutes.
Oh, she already hates you.

357
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,578
Let's go.

358
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,247
Okay.

359
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,582
Got to get --
get in...

360
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,000
Ugh, just open it.

361
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,169
And trick-or-treat!
Trick-or-treat.

362
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:59,757
Ah...
Ah, we'll go to dermatology.

363
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,509
Yes.

364
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,553
Okay, Chris is losing
a lot of blood!

365
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,472
Retractor!
I'm not your scrub nurse.

366
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,432
If we want a chance at actually
seeing the bleeder...

367
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,809
Here!
Thank you.

368
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,851
Geez!

369
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,688
Oh, man.
This is fun.

370
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,774
What,
watching interns fail?

371
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,860
It's just kind of nice to step
off the cardiothoracic floor

372
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,695
and not check in
with the chief.

373
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,489
Your wife?

374
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,658
Listen, Ndugu,
this is a safe space.

375
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,660
I could not work for Teddy
for more than one day.

376
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,578
Okay, hold this.
Hold this.
Go, go.

377
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,080
I mean, I'm not a resident,
you know?

378
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,498
I-I paid my dues
at Tufts.

379
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,792
I paid a lot of those dues
while working under Maggie.

380
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,544
And for the past
six months,

381
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,546
it feels like
I'm right there again.

382
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,882
Except now she's not just
my smart, beautiful attending,

383
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,008
she's my wife.

384
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,761
My wife who not only
has comments

385
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,056
on my surgical technique,
but every aspect of my life.

386
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,892
Y-Yesterday she told me
that I put something

387
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,810
in the microwave wrong.

388
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,145
W-Was it metal?

389
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,771
It was water.

390
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,983
Yeah, I heated up a mug of water
for 45 seconds.

391
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,651
She told me it should be
44 seconds,

392
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,571
because at 44 seconds you don't
have to move your finger over.

393
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,490
Right.
Yeah, so, one second doesn't
make a difference heatwise.

394
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,785
So 44 seconds is, in fact,
more efficient.

395
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,203
Hmm.
Yeah.

396
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,872
This is happening
at my home, all right.

397
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,456
Yeah. Wow.
Mm-hmm.

398
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,000
I let you go in.
Just don't --

399
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,544
Hey, want to go
boss them around?

400
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,796
Yes.

401
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,548
Okay, Chris is getting
more hypotensive.

402
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,924
Come on, let's go.

403
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,343
There!
Lac in the lower left lobe!

404
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,345
Um, lobectomy?
Looks like he's coding.

405
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,513
No, he's not.
We found the bleed.

406
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,265
Okay, do we use
a-a patch?

407
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,184
On his lung?
Uh, I mean, is that a thing?

408
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:35,060
- No!
- Your patient is coding!

409
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,729
He's flat-lining.
Do something!

410
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,105
Get in there!
Soak up the blood?
I told you...

411
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,401
Beeeeeeeep!

412
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,944
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

413
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,196
Starting cardiac massage,
okay?

414
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,993
Mnh-mnh.

415
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,787
Time of death -- 23:45.

416
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,540
We're sorry, Chris.

417
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,465
Oh, uh, Dr. Lawson
was looking for you.
No.

418
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,883
No...what?

419
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,385
I can't insert
another line or tube

420
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,721
into any more
attendings' patients.

421
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:14,350
I-I-I physically can't.
No one can.

422
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,518
Uh, Dr. Altman
and Dr. Pierce both --

423
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,020
Find someone else!

424
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,606
I have been called into
two surgical consults,

425
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,317
three wound checks,
and a chest tube removal,

426
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,819
all in the last
15 minutes

427
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,405
because the interns
are constantly at lunch

428
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,991
or -- or sex ed
or pumpkin carving

429
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,160
or in the lab with Hunt.

430
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,621
And who does all the work,
Stacy?

431
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,289
Me!

432
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,250
So, if you could put
a little bit more effort

433
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,709
into finding
someone else --

434
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,002
Dr. Schmitt.

435
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,049
You better come
with me.

436
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,847
Yeah, I mean, look,
we already knew

437
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,891
Griffith had the most clinical
experience and it shows,

438
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,270
but Kwan's suturing techniques,
they're precise, they're quick.

439
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,522
It's -- It's almost comparable
to a second year.

440
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,107
How's Adams?

441
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,025
Uh, Adams?

442
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,695
Yeah, I mean, is he the next
Catherine Fox Award winner?

443
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:10,197
No, he's not.
But he's got time.

444
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,907
You really want to know
about the interns,

445
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,701
or are you just
distracting yourself

446
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,328
so you don't have to text Zola
at her slumber party?

447
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,164
Can't both things be true?
I guess.

448
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,043
It's very nice.
Yeah.

449
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,753
Yeah, it is nice.
It is.

450
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,588
I mean, I was happy to just go
to your new place.

451
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,091
Aw, no, no, it's all open boxes,
and there's not furniture,

452
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,718
no bathtub,
it smells like new paint,

453
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:33,095
and I wanted you to have
something special for tonight.

454
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,724
What do you say?

455
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,726
Uh, very expensive but
totally worth-it room service?

456
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,893
What do you think?

457
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,231
Where you going?

458
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,567
I'm going to take a bath.

459
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,360
You coming or not?

460
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:53,907
Griffith.

461
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,371
Jarah? W-Where is he?
Is -- Is he...

462
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,789
All right, he's losing

463
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,499
too much blood
through his chest tube,

464
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,210
so we are taking him
to the O. R. right now.

465
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,546
I'll send Dr. Griffith down
with some updates soon.

466
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,589
He should be arrested.

467
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,550
His kid
gave my kid drugs,

468
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,843
and now -- and now he's got
a broken leg

469
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,219
and God knows what else.

470
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,388
My kid?
They were at your house.

471
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,182
Jarah doesn't know
the first thing about drugs!

472
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,558
And River does?

473
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,519
Jarah brought a backpack.
Yeah, for books!

474
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,979
Okay, guys, let's just take some
deep breaths and maybe go to
separate rooms right now, okay?

475
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,439
Were you even home?
Were you even watching them?

476
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,441
They're 16!
Hey.

477
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,526
My son would never do
something like this!
Get security.

478
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,236
Your son brought drugs
into my house!
Your son
gave my son drugs!

479
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,280
Where'd he get them?
Guys, hey! Hey!

480
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,490
He's on his death bed
right now!
Hey!

481
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,283
My name
is Dr. Miranda Bailey!

482
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,994
And d-despite how I look,
I do work here.

483
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm also a mother,
and, look, parenting is hard.

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,043
Teenagers are hard.
And parenting a teenager?

485
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:50,756
I mean, one minute they're
little babies in Ewok costumes

486
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,383
and you can control them,

487
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:54,385
and -- and the next minute
they --

488
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,429
they have impulses
and access and phones

489
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,391
and they're doing all the things
that we worked so damn hard

490
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,267
to keep them
from ever doing.

491
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,395
Look, last week,
I took my son's phone

492
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:07,606
when he wasn't looking me
in the eye.

493
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,943
And he finally admitted
that there are emojis

494
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:15,322
that the dealers use now to
tell kids where to get drugs.

495
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,659
So, look, it doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

496
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,121
It only matters that
we keep our kids alive.

497
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,081
We cannot turn on
each other.

498
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,084
'Cause we -- look, we -- we need
all the help we can get.

499
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,212
Thank you.

500
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,630
You good?

501
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,842
Please save my son.

502
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,803
Would you...please?

503
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,055
Please just save my son.

504
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,891
I can't lose him.

505
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,865
Who put in this stitch?

506
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,032
I did.

507
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,951
You left an air knot.

508
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,911
You also didn't take the time
to do a proper assessment.

509
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,705
You all just zoomed in
on the obvious injury.

510
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,540
It's kind of hard to ignore
a knife in the chest.

511
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,916
In the real world,
you would be on your way

512
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,084
to inform the family.

513
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,461
It would be done.
No do-overs.

514
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,004
But this is trauma training.
Ndugu?

515
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,547
- Huh?
- What?

516
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,300
Is there someone
walking around Seattle today

517
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,219
stabbing hot guys
in the chest?

518
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,597
Yasuda,
it's a training exercise.

519
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,140
Oh.

520
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,683
Wow, that's dark.

521
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,186
Wait, you stabbed them?

522
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:30,189
This is -- This is what happens?
You stab them?

523
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,607
Both of my parents
and my uncle,

524
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,609
who lives with us
when he's not in jail,

525
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,402
decided that they wanted to
donate their bodies to science.

526
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,488
And, yes, they were high when
they came up with this idea,

527
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:40,949
but it was a beautiful
and -- and generous idea,

528
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,743
so I got all
the paperwork together

529
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,161
and I filed it for them.

530
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,747
And my family,
who is not known

531
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,583
for ever doing anything
beautiful or generous,

532
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,045
is planning to give this
very generous gift in death,

533
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,464
and -- and if I had known
that you would just stab them

534
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,090
in the chest,
I would never --

535
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,134
Millin, we are not monsters,
we are doctors.

536
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,969
Penetrating injuries
were simulated

537
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,971
using ultrasound guidance.

538
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,641
That came after release forms
were signed.

539
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,768
Prayers were said.

540
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,103
Moments of silence
were given.

541
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,231
There is
no more generous gift

542
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:15,025
than someone donating
their body to doctors

543
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,109
so that lives
can be saved.

544
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,986
Understood?

545
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,783
Ndugu?

546
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,579
What's happening?

547
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,831
Round two.
Let's go.

548
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,374
Oh, my...

549
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,625
Can someone get me
some gauze?

550
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,918
Okay, let's, uh...

551
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,755
All right,
suction, please.

552
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,967
Third rib punctured
right through the lung.

553
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,096
Dr. Griffith,
it's yours.

554
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,138
I'll check it later.
Thank you.

555
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,601
Still yours.

556
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,936
Do you have somewhere else
to be, Griffith?

557
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,397
Damn it.

558
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,566
The pulmonary artery
is lacerated.

559
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,985
I need exposure!

560
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,695
Someone silence
that damn phone!

561
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,114
Dr. Pierce, I'm sorry.
I don't need you to be sorry.

562
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,074
I need your finger.
Right here.

563
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,535
I am holding
the pulmonary artery

564
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,953
of a 16-year-old
in my hand,

565
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,788
and I can feel
the blood pumping out.

566
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,874
So whatever's going on with you,
I need you to put is aside.

567
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,543
This kid made a stupid call.
It's gonna ruin his life.

568
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,503
But it doesn't have to end
his life if we can help it.

569
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,588
I'm here, Dr. Pierce.

570
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,214
All right, right angle.

571
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,885
Hang two more units.

572
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,268
Chevron incision on the top,
Pfannenstiel on the bottom.

573
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,229
Uh, i-is the one on the right
a Lanz?

574
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,481
Yes.
Are -- Are we done now?

575
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,733
Um...

576
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,735
This one.

577
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,236
Just for fun.

578
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,322
Respectfully,
Dr. Webber, I --

579
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,282
I-I don't have time
for this.

580
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,617
You know,
Catherine and I

581
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,744
visited several museums
on our trip.

582
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,247
I mean, we saw thousands of
paintings and -- and sculptures,

583
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,833
classics
and modern works.

584
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:59,296
And thinking of the techniques
and the choice of colors was --

585
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,298
you know,
that was restorative for me.

586
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,008
And necessary.

587
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,927
Could you just say the thing
I need to hear?

588
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,470
You need to take a break,
Schmitt.

589
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,513
I mean, leave the hospital.
Take a walk.

590
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,682
Because if you continue
to scream at nurses,

591
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,810
your chief resident job
will be short-lived.

592
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,357
If I take a break, things won't
get done and patients will die.

593
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,025
And if I lose someone

594
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:23,612
that I could have saved --
again -- I...

595
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,909
I don't think that
I could come back from that.

596
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,579
I need
to go back to work.

597
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,177
Stay still, River.

598
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,137
Do you remember
being a teen?

599
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,764
Do I have to?

600
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,309
I remember older guys
buying beer and cigarettes.

601
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,560
I remember a joint
being passed around.

602
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,482
I do not remember LSD
in high school.

603
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,275
Did the whole world change
without me knowing?

604
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,068
Yes.

605
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,657
Did something change
between you and Jo?

606
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,033
Why?

607
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,660
- Well...
- Jarah?

608
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,828
Where's Jarah?

609
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,454
River...

610
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,415
Jarah's being treated
for his injuries.

611
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:18,208
As soon as we know something,
we'll let you know, okay?

612
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,962
Did I kill him?
I'm sorry.

613
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm so sorry.

614
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,674
I'm so stupid.

615
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,050
He was supposed to play
on the finals

616
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,468
with his soccer team
next week.

617
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,846
And take his ACT.

618
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,973
Is he gonna be okay?

619
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,392
Hey, River, you -- you need
to try to calm down, okay?

620
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,021
Is my dad here?
I really want my dad.

621
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,731
We need him
to stay still.

622
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,982
Otherwise, we're not gonna
get an accurate scan.

623
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,443
Yeah, I'm on it.

624
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,989
Please.
I need my dad.

625
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,742
Hey.
Hey, River.

626
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,786
Hey, buddy, listen,
we're gonna get your dad, okay?

627
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,789
But we need you to stay still
so we can run this scan, okay?

628
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,458
I don't think I can.

629
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,834
Y-- N-No, you can.

630
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,002
You can, all right?
Hey, listen...

631
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:08,050
I got you, buddy. Okay?
I'm right here.

632
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,767
Okay, I found the laceration.
Uh, forceps? On sutures.

633
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,393
No, we sutured last time.

634
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,686
Clamping the pulmonary hilum
to control the bleeding.

635
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,188
It's like watching children

636
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,398
stick their fingers
into electrical sockets.

637
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,358
Patient's still hypotensive.
Why?

638
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,694
'Cause he's bleeding
from a four-centimeter
laceration to his lung.

639
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,946
But would that make him
that hypotensive?

640
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,448
Look, we already failed.

641
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,116
We just got to work harder,
push through,

642
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,493
a-and open up our minds
before we lose him.

643
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:35,994
Did you dad teach you
to side coach like that

644
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,788
so you'd take
the winning shot every time?

645
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,915
Never had a dad, but thank you
for bringing my personal pain

646
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,750
into this
training exercise.

647
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,126
Wait, wait wait.
Found it!

648
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,211
Pinprick hole
in the pericardium.

649
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,464
We need to do
a pericardial window.

650
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,341
Metz.
No, you screwed up
the repair last time.

651
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,094
Can someone just do it
before the patient dies?!

652
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,929
Kwan, how fast
can you do it?

653
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,347
Already on it.

654
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,515
Okay.

655
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,067
You suffered
a minor concussion,

656
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,653
and we'd like
to observe you overnight.

657
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:13,031
Dr. Lincoln will operate
on your leg fracture tomorrow.

658
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,160
Your friend made it
through the surgery.

659
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,621
Oh, thank God.
Thank you, God.

660
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,373
Can I see him?

661
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,543
Not for a while.
No, his injuries are extensive.

662
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,336
He has a long road
to recovery ahead of him.

663
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,381
His dad's gonna be so mad.

664
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,383
He's not gonna let us
be friends anymore.

665
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,426
His dad is here.

666
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,388
His dad loves him
just like I love you.

667
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,223
It's okay.

668
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,851
You both are all right,
and we will, uh --

669
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,519
we'll find
a way through this, okay?

670
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,408
What happened?
I've seen your work.

671
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:59,828
I know that you are the intern
to watch.

672
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:03,248
I also know that you were asked
to leave your last program.

673
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,376
I was on the, uh --
the intern selection committee.

674
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,253
Dr. Pierce, I --
What I'm saying is,

675
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,714
I know that the stakes
are really high for you here,

676
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,800
and I know that you wouldn't get
that distracted or preoccupied

677
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,011
unless
something happened.

678
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,726
I w-- I was a model resident
all the time,

679
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,729
even when...

680
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,356
I made a point on a case
and was told I was wrong,

681
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,358
and then a white colleague
made that same point,

682
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,235
and that white colleague
got to scrub in.

683
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,864
Or how I was the only one
denied requested rotations,

684
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,617
or how I had to endure
a certain faculty member

685
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,243
regularly making
hostile comments

686
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:41,620
about patients of color.

687
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,663
Or how,
when I finally raised concern

688
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,958
about how a Black patient
was being treated,

689
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,921
I was told maybe I would be
happier at a different program.

690
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,340
Apparently I was
perceived as --
Aggressive?

691
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,926
Aggressive, angry,
all the things, yeah.

692
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,929
So, after you were asked
to leave, did you contest it?

693
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,931
Did you file
an official complaint?

694
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,475
I didn't get the chance.
Why not?

695
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:07,103
Because after they told me
to leave, I did get angry.

696
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,648
And I was sleep deprived
and I...

697
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,694
...kind of broke.

698
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,530
I acted inappropriately,

699
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,949
and I just found out
this morning

700
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,617
that security footage
of it got leaked,

701
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,202
so I've been trying to get it
taken down all day,

702
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,204
which is why my phone
has been going off.

703
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,501
I'm so--

704
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,685
Dr. Webber.

705
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,104
Should you be drinking
while on shift?

706
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,564
Oh, I'm not here
for a drink.

707
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,358
Mm.
Mm.

708
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,776
Is that the aorta?

709
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,987
Yeah, I --
I did that.

710
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,114
Look.
It beats.

711
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:05,704
Helm, you -- y-you don't
belong here.

712
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,039
800.
Excuse me?

713
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,666
$800.
That's how much cash

714
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,418
I will be walking out
of here with tonight.

715
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:12,961
And I won't be stuck
with severed tendons

716
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,089
or kids vomiting or chemical
burns from cheap makeup.

717
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,759
I know Levi is drowning.
I live with him.

718
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,511
But when
the program closed,

719
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,013
no one found me a residency
in another department.

720
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,598
I walked out
and...nothing.

721
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,475
I appreciate you coming here,
Dr. Webber,

722
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,643
but it's gonna take
a lot more than that

723
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,353
to convince me
to come back.

724
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,980
And not just money.

725
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,232
But money would help.

726
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,567
We do need you.

727
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,444
So do all these people.

728
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,904
Happy Halloween,
Dr. Webber.

729
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,874
Maybe she's having
too much fun to text.

730
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,960
I hope so.
Yeah.

731
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,213
How -- How'd your meeting with
the principal go the other day?

732
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,592
Oh, he wants her
to skip two grades.

733
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,427
Mm.
Which Maggie did and hated.

734
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,596
And the prep school
by the marina, how was that?

735
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:08,266
Well, they focus on kids
who are excelling academically.

736
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,976
Right.
And she is so much more.

737
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:13,438
She's empathetic, imaginative,
intensely curious.

738
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,940
Yeah, she needs
a whole-human approach.

739
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,609
I don't want to cause her
more anxiety.

740
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,236
Mm. You know, when I was 12,
my dad left us.

741
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,572
I told you that, yes?
Mm-hmm.

742
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,908
Up to that point, my --
my parents,

743
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,785
our neighborhood,
had been my whole world,

744
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,287
and it felt like the whole world
fell apart

745
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,456
just like that.

746
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:35,126
But then one day my mom
came home with this ancient R. V.

747
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,836
she bought off
one of her coworkers.

748
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,090
And, uh, it was huge and beige
and it smelled weird,

749
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,466
and, uh --
but over that spring break

750
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,676
we drove it all the way down
to the Grand Canyon.

751
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,679
And up until then, I'd never
been outside of Minnesota.

752
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,683
And it made me realize
there was this really big,

753
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,977
this really beautiful world
where no one knew,

754
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:56,481
and no one cared that I was
a kid whose dad left him.

755
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,484
And I never
would have learned that

756
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,278
if it weren't for my mom
showing it to me.

757
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,948
Oh, look out.

758
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,283
Oh.

759
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,119
Zola.
Mom.

760
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,537
Hi.
Mom.

761
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,704
What happened?

762
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,331
I'm sorry.

763
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,749
It's okay.
It's okay.

764
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,127
I can't breathe.
Take a deep breath.

765
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,920
Okay.
I will come
and pick you up.

766
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,464
Okay.
Don't get off the phone.

767
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,757
Okay, I will stay
on the phone with you.

768
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,676
Okay.
Okay, I'll drive.

769
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,219
I'm sorry.

770
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,437
I used to love Halloween,
but tonight was enough

771
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,606
to make me dread
letting my kids grow up.

772
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,942
Same.

773
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:44,195
Only, you know,
it's not just Halloween.

774
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:47,282
Like, the whole world
is stupid and cruel.

775
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,658
Those kids,
those are good kids.

776
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,160
Mm.
Smart kids.

777
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,121
But one bad night,
one stupid impulse...

778
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,500
It never stops.

779
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,003
Hm?

780
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,797
It's not just teenagers.

781
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,426
One stupid impulse can ruin your
life at any stage of the game.

782
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,269
I'm kind of crazy
about Jo.

783
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,812
Yeah, I ki--
I kinda caught on to that.

784
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:20,815
Okay.

785
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,609
She was my best friend.

786
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,735
Right?
Oh.

787
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,320
Like,
it wasn't an option,

788
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,738
and then, suddenly,
it was.

789
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:30,158
And I was hung up
on Amelia.

790
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:34,204
And I was confused,
and I was scared,

791
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,456
and, like, I didn't want to ruin
the friendship,

792
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,834
so I...I blew it.

793
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,336
I missed my moment,
and now --

794
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,130
It's -- It's for the best.
I'm sorry, what?

795
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,799
Just keep sleeping with other
women till those feelings pass.

796
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,510
Wh--
Wait, you're -- you're serious?

797
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,096
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm serious.

798
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,432
Owen and I
were best friends.

799
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,516
I mean, I-I would have been
the person

800
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:56,976
that he would have called
for advice

801
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,561
when he ruined his life,
and now we're married,

802
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,772
so when he ruins his life,
he also ruins mine.

803
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,857
And there's nothing like
ruining each other's lives

804
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,860
to ruin a friendship.

805
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,111
Have a good night.

806
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,826
B. P.'s steady, strong heart
rate, responsive to stimuli.

807
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,286
He's a cadaver.

808
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,079
Do you want your good news,
or not?

809
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,499
Your patient is stable.

810
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,752
So, who will be scrubbing in
with Dr. Ndugu?

811
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,712
I did
a pericardial window.

812
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,673
Yeah, and I did
the chest tube.

813
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:29,801
After I gave you appropriate
visual field with my retraction.

814
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:34,138
What about you, Adams?
You saw the hole in the heart.

815
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,725
Right,
but I only saw it

816
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,228
because Millin was such a beast
with the suction.

817
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,939
Which Kwan was constantly
reminding her about

818
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,483
after Yasuda
widened the incision.

819
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:48,444
So, without any of that, I
wouldn't have had a clear view.

820
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,239
You used all the hands
around you.

821
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,241
Congratulations,
you will be scrubbing in

822
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,867
on an ax-fem bypass.

823
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,413
Uh...can't we all do it?

824
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,963
Sure.
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:10,174
I'll e-mail you the case details
in a few hours.

826
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,759
Go get some sleep,
all right?

827
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,016
All right,
I'm gonna do a lap

828
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,934
around the CCU for Maggie
before we take off.

829
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,811
Sure.

830
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,772
Hey, do you still,
uh, love her?

831
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,399
My wife?
Yeah.

832
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,900
Yeah, of course.

833
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,196
Don't reach the point
where the resentment takes over.

834
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,373
Oh, ooh.

835
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,087
Are you trying to rip
the whole sink off the wall?

836
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,631
I don't know
what I was doing.

837
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,216
Oh, no.

838
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,260
Okay.
All right, all right.

839
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,263
Look, I get it.
I get it.

840
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:00,516
We are held
to a different standard.

841
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,936
Right? We are expected to always
be on exemplary behavior.

842
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,397
And you had a bad day.

843
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,066
After many bad days.

844
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,277
Now my bad day lives
on the Internet forever.

845
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,988
Oh, please. Tomorrow it will be
somebody else's meltdown.

846
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:17,867
Look,
this is a great program.

847
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,495
And you deserve a great program
because you're a great doctor.

848
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:22,121
We see you.

849
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,208
You don't have to let that
haunt you anymore.

850
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,044
Excuse me.
Hi.

851
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,254
Um, my son would like
to apologize

852
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,255
to his friend's father.

853
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:32,757
Is that okay?

854
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:35,385
Of course. We just --
we can't let you inside.

855
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,636
I'll help you.

856
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,235
I'm so sorry.

857
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,945
I-I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

858
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:55,279
I know you didn't.

859
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,572
And I appreciate
you saying that.

860
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,699
I'm glad you're okay.

861
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:08,710
This is my last patient,
then I'll sleep.

862
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,253
We failed you, Schmitt.

863
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,131
You're carrying the workload
for your whole class.

864
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:16,300
A class
this program failed.

865
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,430
We failed your class and we are
serving these new interns,

866
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,181
but we failed you again.

867
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,475
And no amount of me telling you
to rest is gonna fix that.

868
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,477
Dr. Webber,
I'm chief resident.

869
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,062
I was expecting
a heavier workload, so...

870
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,939
This is a new program,
Schmitt.

871
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,525
We're still working out
the kinks.

872
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:35,486
And we have to own it
when we get it wrong.

873
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,196
We got this wrong.

874
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:41,367
Starting now, I'm going to ask
all attendings

875
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:45,121
to pick up the slack left
by our senior residents.

876
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,082
And I'm first. Give me half of
the patients on your shift.

877
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:51,085
Dr. Webber --
Watching that program fail once
was enough for me.

878
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,712
I'm not about to
do it again.

879
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:55,256
I mean, technically,
this is my last patient.

880
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,467
Just give me the tablet,
Schmitt.

881
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,514
Now, get out of here.

882
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,025
Hey.
Mm.

883
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,318
Oh, hey.

884
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,407
I-I checked on all of our
patients, and, um, changed.

885
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,535
Then I packed my bag
and then I sat down.

886
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,580
Yeah, I could sleep for
like three days straight.

887
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,832
Yeah.

888
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,335
Shall we?
Yes.

889
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,170
But, um...

890
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,131
What's wrong?

891
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,803
Well, I've been doing
more vascular procedures

892
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,555
because I'm considering
changing specialties.

893
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:51,562
I love you, Maggie.
And I love being married to you.

894
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,482
But if I want it to stay
that way,

895
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,442
I think I need
to leave cardio.

896
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,742
Doesn't even hurt.

897
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,745
Oh, wait,
of course it hurts,

898
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,330
but it's nothing compared

899
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,123
to my three patients
in labor right now.

900
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,417
Rest, ice,
compression, elevation.

901
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,211
Please!
Dr. Lincoln,

902
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:18,673
tell me how to take care
of a sprained wrist.

903
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,466
Oh, I, um --
I have something for you.

904
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:25,012
I already threw out
everything with raisins.

905
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,389
It's just the good stuff.

906
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:29,016
Happy cancerversary.

907
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,768
This...

908
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,728
Thank you.

909
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,147
Thank you
for worrying about me.

910
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,111
I'll see you at home?
Yeah!

911
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,904
Yeah, save me
a sour gummy.

912
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,051
Mm.

913
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,555
Hey.

914
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,350
What?

915
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,645
Do you remember that year
in Baghdad

916
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,356
we had that nine-month stretch
where we missed

917
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,318
Valentine's Day, Easter,
the Fourth of July?

918
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,446
Mm-hmm.
I remember you complaining

919
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,407
that you missed those holidays
more that Christmas.

920
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,326
Yeah. I did.

921
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:32,038
And then on Halloween
you gave me an Easter egg hunt.

922
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,206
Red, white, and blue
plastic eggs.
Yeah.

923
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,500
With Valentine's
conversation hearts.

924
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,753
Mm-hmm.
All the holidays in one.

925
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:40,880
Mm-hmm.

926
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,798
I mean, how did you get
all that stuff?

927
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,592
I don't know, but I remember
it being hard.

928
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,765
That was
my favorite Halloween.

929
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,067
It's never easy
to face our demons.

930
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,694
Huh? What?
What...

931
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,493
There it is.

932
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,119
Okay, so we got your suit.

933
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,956
All your candy.

934
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,959
And then we're gonna...

935
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,919
Most of us would prefer
to focus on the light.

936
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,466
But when
we own our shadows,

937
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,594
when we name our secrets,

938
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,096
when we claim
all of who we are...

939
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,389
That's you?

940
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,391
Yes.
You're Bamm-Bamm.

941
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:36,560
I could think of better names,
but yes.

942
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,146
I would have taken
the whole sink off the wall.

943
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,147
I bet you
you couldn't.

944
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,358
I would have busted
that window.

945
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,734
Or ripped
the whole shelf down.

946
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,487
Oh, I did.
The video cuts out that part.

947
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,822
Nice.

948
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,490
Does anyone want
to grab breakfast?

949
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,742
Ooh.
Like, together?

950
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:54,745
No, the four of us at a booth
and you at the counter.

951
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,622
Ha ha, funny.

952
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,592
...it sets us free.

953
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,052
When we lean into
what scares us...

954
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,053
I'm sorry.

955
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:13,097
Oh.
For what?

956
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,974
That you and Nick
had to come pick me up.

957
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:17,643
And it's so late.

958
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:20,646
Zola, I'll pick you up
anytime from anywhere.

959
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:21,814
Always.

960
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,319
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

961
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:33,367
Layla and Hannah and everyone
were just...I don't know.

962
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,620
Were you feeling
left out?

963
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,457
It was okay.

964
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:43,252
We got into our sleeping bags.
I just laid there.

965
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:46,881
I was thinking about you,
Aunt Maggie, Alzheimer's,

966
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,592
and I couldn't sleep.

967
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,469
And I couldn't breathe.

968
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,429
Why is this happening
to me?

969
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,139
When is it
gonna get better?

970
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:58,350
It will get better.
It will.

971
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,144
We just need to find you
the right school,

972
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,146
the right teachers.

973
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:05,316
Even if we have to look a little
further than Seattle, okay?

974
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:08,444
Come here.
Give me a hug.

975
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,697
It's okay.

976
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,491
...light comes in.

977
