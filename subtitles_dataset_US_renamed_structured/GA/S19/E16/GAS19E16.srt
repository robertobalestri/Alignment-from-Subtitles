00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:03,578
<i>Throughout history,

00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,374

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,716

<i>racing heart, pupil dilation,

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,383
How do you have so much energy?

6
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:17,248
Didn't you get home
at, like, 3:00 a.m.?

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,455
Exhaustion is a construct.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,939
Mind over matter.

9
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,372
Stethoscopes or diplomas?

10
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,535
No.

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,460
Are those clip-ons?

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,848
You cannot wear those to
stand up in my wedding.

13
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:33,565
My dad likes to
commemorate accomplishments

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,058
with formalwear.

15
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,759
Your dad has questionable taste.

16
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:38,302
That's what my mom says.

17
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:39,278
We're going shopping.

18
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,392
My treat.

19
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,041
Oh, since you're
treating us to things,

20
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,185
can toilet paper be a treat?

21
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:44,627
Because we're out.

22
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,458
<i>Mesopotamian soldiers depicted</i>

00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:50,901

27
00:00:58,771 --> 00:00:59,910
Doing anything tonight?

28
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,492
Why?

29
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,303
Well, there's a new bar that
opened in my neighborhood.

30
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:04,751
It looks pretty cool.

31
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:07,307
I give it about a week before
the tech bros take it over.

32
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,092
Want to check it out?

33
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,567
Sounds like a date.

34
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,001
Nope, not a date.

35
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:15,926
Just two coworkers
getting a drink.

36
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,030
No, thanks.

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,653
Hey, look.

38
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:20,448
Would you really
rather be hanging out

39
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:22,381
with your 80-year-old
roommate and her friends

40
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,614
than get one drink with me?

41
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,637
Yeah.

42
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,044
<i>It's a lesson we
learn in medicine</i>

43
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:32,136
<i>time and time again...</i>

44
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,945
<i>Just because we
don't have the words</i>

45
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,766
<i>doesn't mean the
symptoms aren't real.</i>

46
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,586
Hey, Scout.

47
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:43,342
Should we show Jo and Luna what
we've been working on, huh?

48
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,265
Let's do it.

49
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,290
Ready?

50
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:49,008
A, B, C, D...

51
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,616
You've been learning
sign language?

52
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,990
I... I found an app that
teaches the ASL alphabet.

53
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:57,036
Now your face is telling
me that I screwed up.

54
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,279
Did I screw up?

55
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,523
I told you that I
needed more time.

56
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,248
We don't even have
her MRI results back,

57
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,010
her genetic testing.

58
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:07,085
You're... you're
learning sign language?

59
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,573
Ben, now, first you
save this man in a fire.

60
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:18,481
Now you're sitting
at his bedside?

61
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,154
You want me to sit with you?

62
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:24,946
No, you... you've got a crisis
of your own to deal with.

63
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,234
We're going to get through this.

64
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,122
All of it.

65
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:32,873
Yeah.

66
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,834
Mm.

67
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:43,151
What the...

68
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,348
Well, who let you in here?

69
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,686
Well, I had to restock the PRT,

70
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,999
so I thought I'd swing
by and say hi to you...

71
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:56,855
Hi... and my favorite patient.

72
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,944
You're so adorable, huh?

73
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,419
Yes, you are.

74
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,816
You couldn't get
supplies in Illinois?

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,732
Well, I could.

76
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,738
But Illinois just doesn't
have Connor, so...

77
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:05,666
No, they don't.

78
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:06,801
All right, you've had your fun.

79
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:07,910
My turn.

80
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,143
Come on, up, up, up.

81
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,941
Aw.

82
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,839
How is his mom doing?

83
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,772
Better every day.

84
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,060
OK. Up now.

85
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,411
Any pain there?

86
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:22,407
No.

87
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:23,587
Is there any way
to speed this up?

88
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:24,479
There's somewhere I have to be.

89
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm going as fast as I can.

90
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:27,933
Oh, Dr. Adams, Dr. Millin.

91
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,163
This is Matt.

92
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,381
I just cleared his
C-spine, and I just need

93
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,793
you to get him up to CT.

94
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:32,792
How'd you hurt yourself?

95
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:33,852
Took a sword to the neck.

96
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:35,196
A foam sword.

97
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:36,973
It has a plywood core.

98
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,552
LARPing accident.

99
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,220
Why do you think I
would know what that is?

100
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,384
Live-action roleplaying.

101
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,326
The guys in the park
with the swords?

102
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,353
Now I see why you think
I would know that.

103
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:50,773
If his CT is negative, just
keep him here for observation,

104
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,558
to make sure that the
swelling in his trachea

105
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,999
doesn't compromise his airway.

106
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,406
Page me if you need anything.

107
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,615
Can I please just go now?

108
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,503
I feel fine, and
this is my only shot

109
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,160
to usurp the game master.

110
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,213
If I don't get back to the
park before sunset, that's it.

111
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,071
Well, if your trachea swells up

112
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:10,004
enough that air doesn't reach
your lungs, that is also it.

113
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,817
Statistically, what are the
chances of that happening?

114
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,529
Look, no disrespect, but
this game is make-believe.

115
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,521
Is it worth risking
actual death?

116
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,214
Depending on the
statistics, maybe.

117
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,354
Oh, I get it now.

118
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,779
This is about a girl.

119
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:26,116
Oh my god, not
everything is about love.

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,945
Princess Astrid of Dungeness.

121
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,464
See?

122
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:30,880
Unbelievable.

123
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,349
It was love at first sight.

124
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,351
For six years, I've loved her.

125
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,792
Today I shall declare it.

126
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,283
She is my destiny.

127
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,858
Good morning, Mr. Porter.

128
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,214
I'm Dr. Webber.

129
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,654
This is Dr. Yasuda.

130
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,434
We're going to be doing
your colonoscopy today.

131
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,977
Yasuda?

132
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:51,659
Russell Porter, 31.

133
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,050
Experiencing unintentional
weight loss and anemia.

134
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,570
Has a family history
of colon cancer.

135
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,666
Referred by his PCP for
a diagnostic colonoscopy.

136
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,210
Are you doing OK?

137
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,603
He doesn't like hospitals.

138
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,555
I'm fine.

139
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,708
Well, in about 15
minutes, you're not

140
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,062
going to know where you are.

141
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:07,581
It will be the best
nap of your life.

142
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:08,789
Sounds great.

143
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,177
Can I get a colonoscopy too?

144
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Where are we?

145
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,303
We're in the hospital, baby.

146
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:17,406
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,731
Get this off of me.
- Look, Russell...

148
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,115
- Get it off!
- Russell, you're OK.

149
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,309
Who are you?

150
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,448
What... what's happening?

151
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,727
Why doesn't he
remember who I am?

152
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,189
Let's forget about
the colonoscopy.

153
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:26,521
And let's get a head CT.

154
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:27,878
And page Dr. Shepherd, OK?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:29,189
Hi, I'm Dr. Yasuda.

156
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:30,359
Do you want to just
come with me...

157
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:32,010
Get away from me.
Don't come near me!

158
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,781
OK. Oh my god.

159
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,857
Get away from me.

160
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,507
Get away from me.

161
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,932
Any nausea?

162
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,693
Oh, yeah.

163
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,670
And the pain on your side
on a scale of 1 to 10?

164
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:58,560
7 most days, 9 on a bad day.

165
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:01,287
It's got to be stones, right?

166
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,014
I've always had trouble
with my kidneys.

167
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,165
What kind of trouble?

168
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,924
Had the right one removed
several years back.

169
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,674
But the pain is
currently on the right?

170
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:09,916
Left.

171
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,839
I had the left one removed.

172
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,368
Oh, I'm getting old.

173
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,900
Let's take a look.

174
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,131
Hey, is Dr. Bailey
working today?

175
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,578
I was looking on the internet.

176
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:22,180
It says she's the best doctor
here for kidney problems.

177
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:23,550
Think I could see her?

178
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:26,183
She's busy, but
I'll put in a page.

179
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,116
In the meantime,
we'll take some urine

180
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,878
samples and some images,
and we'll know more.

181
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:31,139
Oh, thanks.

182
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:32,846
I just don't want to mess
around with the only kidney

183
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,749
I have left, you know?

184
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,334
What are you doing?

185
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:50,205
Exercise.

186
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,416
Tox screen is negative.

187
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:55,824
Bloodwork only shows anemia
and mild renal impairment.

188
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,249
Hmm.

189
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,172
Grace said Russell's
been experiencing

190
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:00,468
some brain fog lately.

191
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,686
Pretty mild, until today.

192
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,783
She chalked it up
to a stress at work.

193
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:06,904
Ah.

194
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:11,322
Well, head scans are negative.

195
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,229
Are those what I think they are?

196
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:21,053
Russell, we see some
bullets in your scan.

197
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:22,194
When did you get shot?

198
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,395
11 years ago.

199
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,078
Went to the grocery
store for taco seasoning,

200
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,166
came out with three
gunshot wounds.

201
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,757
Can you imagine?

202
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,226
Surviving a shooting
and then having

203
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,701
to walk around with
metal inside you

204
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,253
for the rest of your life?

205
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,866
What were his symptoms, again?

206
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,652
Anemia, fatigue, weight loss.

207
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:44,952
And now he's exhibiting
brain fog, confusion.

208
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,633
I'll... I'll go test
his lead levels.

209
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:47,903
Put a rush on it.

210
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,193
He's been off the oscillator
for three days now,

211
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,336
and they're minimizing
the vent settings.

212
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,002
You're still getting calls?

213
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,517
You know, someone's
heart stops on my table,

214
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,726
I'm cool as a cucumber.

215
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,649
But the phone rings, and I...

216
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,362
Shake. I... I shake.

217
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:16,630
Because it's terrifying.

218
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:19,149
They're harassing you,
and it's relentless.

219
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,934
Ben almost died on duty
the other day, again.

220
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,167
So terrifying in
my life has layers.

221
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,768
Like, when the phone rings,
I don't know what I should

222
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,508
be panicking about first.

223
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:35,623
And it never stops ringing.

224
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,514
I just hope to
god these lunatics

225
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,977
will move on before I have
a second heart attack.

226
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,176
Wait a minute.

227
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,228
You had a heart attack?

228
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:45,829
How did I not know about this?

229
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:47,041
When?

230
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,866
Years ago.

231
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,031
It... look, it's... it's fine.

232
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,230
I'm fine.

233
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,874
Everything is fine.

234
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:57,341
If you're using
fine as a stand-in

235
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,384
for another four-letter
word, I can get

236
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,859
on board with that analysis.

237
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,258
OK. Nothing's fine.

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,263
This helps, though.

239
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:12,066
Yeah. Well, I find there's not
much that a roomful of babies

240
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,411
can't fix.

241
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:17,217
And old friends.

242
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,876
This is Dr. Hunt, our
head of trauma surgery

243
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,587
and an expert at
treating gunshot victims.

244
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,013
I don't understand.

245
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,376
What does this have
to do with his colon?

246
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,193
Nothing.

247
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:30,806
As it turns out, based
on his bloodwork,

248
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,154
Russell has lead poisoning.

249
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,110
The bullet fragments
in his chest

250
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,659
and his spine have
been leaching lead

251
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:39,135
into his bloodstream
and his spinal fluid.

252
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,093
That explains all
of your symptoms...

253
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,943
The intermittent confusion,
the forgetfulness.

254
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,909
Just like the episode
you had earlier today.

255
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,395
But the surgeon said it was
riskier to take the bullets

256
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,701
out than to leave them in.

257
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:50,872
Most of the time that is true.

258
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,967
The body forms scar
tissue around the bullets,

259
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,020
preventing lead from
getting into the blood

260
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:56,428
and the spinal fluid.

261
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:59,017
But in some cases, like
yours, that scar tissue

262
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:02,883
never forms and the best course
of action is to remove them.

263
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:05,506
So you remove the bullets
and my symptoms just go away?

264
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,070
Within a few days, your
lead levels will drop

265
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,388
and your symptoms will
gradually improve.

266
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,042
And what about his confusion?

267
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,241
There are no guarantees.

268
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,585
It could take weeks,
months, even years

269
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,943
for the encephalopathy
to subside, if at all.

270
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,590
So I can go through
all this and still

271
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,050
can't remember who my wife is?

272
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:23,837
Hey, it's OK.

273
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,595
I'm not going anywhere.

274
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,450
I'll just keep
reminding you, OK?

275
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:32,235
When I heard the gunshots,
I was in the cereal aisle.

276
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:36,226
I tried to find a place to hide,

277
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:37,736
but there was nowhere to go.

278
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,658
It was a grocery store.

279
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:41,375
I was totally exposed.

280
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,199
So I got down on my
knees, and I prayed

281
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:46,710
that I'd make it out alive.

282
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,920
But if I would have known
how much I'd suffer...

283
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,854
I know that feeling, Russell.

284
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,926
Listen, I am a survivor
of a shooting too.

285
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,540
Too many of us are.

286
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,187
It is a lifelong
struggle whether you

287
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,286
remove those bullets or not.

288
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,228
So in a way, you
have nothing to lose.

289
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,151
And who knows...
if we can take away

290
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,861
some of your physical
pain maybe that

291
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,406
could help take away some
of your other pain too.

292
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,947
OK.

293
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,304
Let's take them out.

294
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,624
- OK.
- OK.

295
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,143
Dr. Shepherd?

296
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:29,925
It's Mika Yasuda
from Grey Sloan.

297
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,517
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Webber
told me to come get you.

298
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,060
We need a neuro consult.

299
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:39,181
Also, I really have to pee.

300
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,989
Bathroom's over there.
- You know what?

301
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,771
It was a false
alarm. I'm good.

302
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:50,725
Should we get you dressed?

303
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,953
Because... wait, wait!

304
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,880
Ow!

305
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,857
Dr. Hunt says I can't
leave without you.

306
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,180
Call the backup
neurosurgeon on call.

307
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,552
We have a patient
with a bullet embedded

308
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:02,220
in his thoracic spine.

309
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,959
It has to come out.

310
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:06,154
Dr. Hunt says you're the
only one who can do it.

311
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,791
Please.

312
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,916
- Fine.
- Great.

313
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,287
Uh, my van is out front.

314
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,668
You have to kind of,
like, lift and kick

315
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:13,909
the door at the same
time. But you know what...

316
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,933
I'll drive myself.

317
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,585
I'll see you there!

318
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,854
What are you doing here?

320
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,087
You hate pregnant women.

321
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,251
Don't say that.

322
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,624
It makes me sound
like an awful person.

323
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,627
But I do feel hives coming on.
- Yeah.

324
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,940
Uh, I'm just checking on you.

325
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,239
Well, I am waiting for
Luna's test results

326
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,585
to determine whether
her hearing loss is due

327
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,005
to an underlying disease.

328
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,097
Yeah, I know.

329
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:45,178
At daycare this morning,
there was this mom,

330
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,377
and she was fighting
with her kid

331
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,827
about taking off
his bike helmet.

332
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,666
And I just... I just
wanted to scream,

333
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,073
"This is not a real problem."

334
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:57,292
And I know it's all relative.

335
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,217
And the truth is,
is, I would love it

336
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:02,520
if my biggest problem
right now was Luna refusing

337
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:03,960
to take off her bike helmet.

338
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:07,437
Yeah, and don't we want to
encourage helmet wearing?

339
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,747
I'm going to stop trying
to make you laugh.

340
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,777
I might have all of these
decisions to make...

341
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,493
Hearing aids, cochlear implants,

342
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,096
sign language, things
that will affect her

343
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,234
for the rest of her life.

344
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,409
And it's not like
I can just ask her

345
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:21,411
what she wants in 20 years.

346
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:24,552
My job as a mom just changed
in the blink of an eye,

347
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,737
and I don't know if I'm
going to be very good at it.

348
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,809
I'm not a parent, but
I do have to deal with

349
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,421
the parents of my
patients a lot.

350
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:33,724
So I'm kind of an expert.

351
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,831
And what I know is that you
are not only good at it,

352
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,255
you are great.

353
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,144
And you're going to
continue being great.

354
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,433
You are a great mom.

355
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:45,290
Thanks.

356
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,576
Oh, and um, if you need
help with sign language,

357
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,604
I do know happy birthday,

358
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:56,713
my name is Levi, and, um, butt.

359
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,848
There. I did it.

360
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,223
My work here is done.

361
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:12,133
Watch where you're going!

362
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,075
What?

363
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,549
What?

364
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,423
Hey.

365
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:20,655
Did Meredith tell you
to come check on me?

366
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,553
No.

367
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,542
I was actually
worried about Bailey.

368
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,070
Why do I need to check on you?

369
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,998
Uh, you know, I'm... it's fine.

370
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,271
Hey! Come on, Amelia.

371
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,296
It's me.

372
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,885
Spit it out.

373
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:35,372
Um, Mer moved, and
then Maggie moved,

374
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,607
and then Kai left me.

375
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:42,068
And so I've, um, pretty much
been abandoned by everyone.

376
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,312
And you know how well I
do with abandonment, so...

377
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,684
Amelia.

378
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:48,385
I have a consult.

379
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,871
We need to remove the
spinal bullet first

380
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:53,883
since it's most likely
causing the encephalopathy.

381
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,507
What about the scattered
fragments in the lung?

382
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,429
Can we do a
non-anatomic resection

383
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:58,781
of the affected lung tissue?

384
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,884
Yeah, good.

385
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,117
Please, go ahead.

386
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,315
Start without me.

387
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,272
We did.

388
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,849
Sorry, I got here
as fast as I could.

389
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,946
My van doesn't go
over 45, and I'll...

390
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,517
I'll stop talking now.

391
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,860
Assuming you can remove
the bullet in the spine...

392
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,369
Assuming I can?

393
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,835
You woke me up.

394
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,965
I assume that you
know that I can.

395
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,524
Amelia, we really don't have
time for whatever this is, OK?

396
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:20,826
You'll go first.

397
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,326
We'll remove the
bullet from the spine,

398
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,076
irrigate, close, and
flip the patient,

399
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:25,742
and then I'll start
the thoracotomy.

400
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,286
Anything else I should know?

401
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:31,005
Did you want to pick the
music for the OR as well?

402
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,923
Are there any other options
you would like to discuss,

403
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:33,844
Dr. Shepherd?

404
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,190
Nope.

405
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:38,045
Dr. Ndugu seems to
be in charge here.

406
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,367
Let's go with his plan.

407
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,029
OK.

408
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,055
Was that...

409
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,188
Definitely not about you.

410
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,283
All right.

411
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:50,471
OK.

412
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,372
Are you experiencing
an increase in pain?

413
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,045
Nope.

414
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,155
I feel great.

415
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,479
Whoa.

416
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,686
Whoa, where are you going?

417
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:57,691
To the park.

418
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,018
Do you know where my shoes are?
- Hey, no.

419
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,433
We need to keep you
a little longer,

420
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,565
just to make sure
you're out of the woods.

421
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:02,632
You're really going to
make me wait a full week

422
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,711
to tell Astrid I love her?

423
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:04,885
What's one more week?

424
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,704
Today when I almost died...

425
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:07,972
It was a foam sword.

426
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:09,062
I fought to keep breathing with

427
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,363
every molecule in my body.

428
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,858
I couldn't let myself
die without telling

429
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,021
Astrid how I feel.

430
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,660
You probably think
it's crazy, but I

431
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,009
don't even know her real name.

432
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:20,028
But I know her smile, and I
know what makes her laugh,

433
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,512
and I know her heart.

434
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,204
And I have to tell her.

435
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,921
Oh, you are full of
adrenaline right now.

436
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,665
You are not thinking clearly.

437
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,288
Or maybe he's thinking
clearly for the first time

438
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,227
in his entire life.

439
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:32,584
I mean, what if you go to
the park and Princess Astrid

440
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,864
doesn't feel the same way?

441
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,744
Or maybe she's been in love
with you this whole time too.

442
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,149
Yeah, I prefer his take.

443
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:39,590
Stop encouraging him.

444
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:43,362
This game is clearly your...

445
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,424
Your happy place.

446
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:49,663
Do you really want to trash
all of that for a girl whose

447
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,621
real name you don't even know?

448
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:55,581
You look like a princess, but
you have the heart of an ogre.

449
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:57,919
Correction... I
look like a goddess,

450
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,704
and I have the heart
of a person who

451
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,283
tells sad men the whole truth.

452
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,587
Or a troll.

453
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:05,854
She has the heart of a troll.

454
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:08,329
I'll give you your shoes
back when I discharge you.

455
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,466
The urinalysis and X-ray
both came back negative.

456
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,633
Next steps?

457
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,727
Run an ultrasound to fully
rule out kidney stones.

458
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:22,469
Good.

459
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:23,756
What do you need me for?

460
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,542
He said he only had one kidney,

461
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,130
but there are clearly
two in the films

462
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:28,969
and he doesn't have
any surgical scars.

463
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,755
Also, he asked for you.

464
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,574
I told him you were busy, but...

465
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:36,864
Is it... hello, sir.

466
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,339
I'm Dr. Bailey.

467
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:39,987
Go ahead, Kwan.

468
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,799
Been looking forward
to meeting you.

469
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,056
I'm, uh, flattered.

470
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,428
Dr. Kwan is one of
our finest interns.

471
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:46,973
He's going to be
doing an ultrasound...

472
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,171
How are the kids?

473
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:49,602
Oh.

474
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:50,521
Oh, I'm sorry.

475
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:51,819
Have I treated you before?

476
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:52,844
No, no, no, no, no.

477
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,433
Just a... just a fan.

478
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:01,440
How's the new place?

479
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:03,605
Boys settling in OK?

480
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,881
Excuse me?

481
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,665
Young Pruitt's been
through so much.

482
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,216
I mean, it would be a real,
real shame if something else

483
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:11,656
were to happen.

484
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,590
Ultrasound is negative.

485
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:17,603
Uh, you can discharge him now.

486
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,906
Oh, now, hang on.

487
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,228
Is that how you
treat your patients?

488
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:22,323
Sir, sit back... sit down.

489
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,428
Or do you only extend
common courtesy

490
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,779
to other murderers, huh?

491
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:27,880
Come back here.

492
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,941
I'm not finished with
you, Dr. Baby Killer!

493
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:33,999
Call security!

494
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,024
Hey!

495
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,131
This isn't over!

496
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,442
Just stay down.

497
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:55,041
You know, I thought
we were friends.

498
00:18:55,145 --> 00:19:00,667
Or at least colleagues
who respected each other.

499
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:03,014
Amelia, what is going on?

500
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:07,433
What's going on is, you
let one of the only people

501
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,651
in the world who cares
whether I eat a hot meal

502
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,402
or sleep for more than
four hours in a night

503
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,281
move to Chicago.

504
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:16,890
You know as well as I do
that no one let Maggie move.

505
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:19,696
You're her husband, and
you let your ego destroy

506
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,586
what was once true love.

507
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,311
OK.

508
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:25,658
I get that she's your sister,
so there are sides here.

509
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,497
But that is an
oversimplification.

510
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:31,526
Maggie will rise
and rise and rise,

511
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,149
and she will go on to
do even greater things,

512
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:37,221
and you will always
be in her shadow.

513
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,568
And she may go on to
forgive your smallness,

514
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:42,872
because that is how great
she is, but I'm not.

515
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:44,090
I won't.

516
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,281
If you need anything
to make sure

517
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,909
that Dr. Bailey is covered at
all times, just say the word.

518
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,857
Thank you.

519
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,249
Chief Altman, I
wanted to apologize

520
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:06,654
for attacking that patient.

521
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,470
I know there are protocols
in these situations...

522
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:09,771
The patient wasn't attacked.

523
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:12,180
He fell while he was
attacking Dr. Bailey.

524
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,059
Um...

525
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:14,716
That is the story as I heard it.

526
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,557
So this won't go in
my file somewhere?

527
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,921
I'm confused.

528
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,802
Did something happen between
you and the abusive patient?

529
00:20:20,826 --> 00:20:23,069
If so, I know nothing about it.

530
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,544
Is that him? Is that him?

531
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,291
Yes.

532
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,345
But, Warren, listen to me.

533
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,735
We both know that that won't
help either of you, OK?

534
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,910
That intern over
there, he's the one

535
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,547
who took the bastard down.

536
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,866
Why don't you put this manic
energy to better use and go

537
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,583
over there and thank him?

538
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:43,916
- Fine.
- OK, great.

539
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,541
But if you wouldn't
mind telling the bastard

540
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,853
that Dr. Bailey's husband
is a firefighter who breaks

541
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,570
into houses with
his ax for a living,

542
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,774
and I'm going to find out where
he lives, I'd appreciate it.

543
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:52,661
OK, I got it.

544
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:53,426
I got it.

545
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,222
Thank you.

546
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:00,194
Yasuda, slowly retract
to help expose the dura.

547
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:03,810
I need better visualization.

548
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:05,675
Retractor.

549
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,700
Yasuda.

550
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,864
I'm so sorry.

551
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:09,979
I don't know what happened.

552
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,202
I'll tell you what happened.

553
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:12,961
You were not paying attention,
and our last sterile retractor

554
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:14,293
is on the floor. Pick it up...

555
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:15,457
OK.

556
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,685
And get out of my OR.

557
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,883
Is that really necessary?

558
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,110
We can get a replacement
in one minute.

559
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,369
Do you want to be
kicked out too?

560
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,084
I really am so sorry.

561
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,164
It won't happen again.

562
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,363
Not with me, it won't.

563
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:26,287
You are no longer
welcome on my service.

564
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,573
Out!

565
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,348
Is he... He's doing great.

566
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:45,817
Dr. Shepherd
successfully removed

567
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,125
the bullet from his spine.

568
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,784
She's finishing up, and
then Dr. Ndugu will start

569
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,099
on the fragments in his lung.

570
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,606
OK.

571
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:52,770
That's good, right?

572
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:53,698
Very good.

573
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:55,380
OK.

574
00:21:55,635 --> 00:22:00,191
I'm sorry.

575
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,295
I'm sorry.

576
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,931
No. No apologies.

577
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,267
It'll be a few hours if you want

578
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,796
to go home and get some sleep.

579
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,686
You know, he never told
me what happened that day.

580
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:14,974
We were newlyweds, and he calls
me from the hospital saying

581
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,864
he was grocery shopping
and a guy comes in

582
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:20,028
and just opens fire.

583
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,422
And that's all he ever said.

584
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:28,427
He didn't want to talk about
it, he didn't want to feel it.

585
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:32,801
But I knew he did, because we
were planning on having kids.

586
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,290
And then after that
day, we weren't.

587
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:47,238
I've tried so many times
to talk to him about it,

588
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,388
because how can
somewhat live with all

589
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:52,071
that trauma inside of them?

590
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:56,731
I always worried that
it was eating away

591
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:59,276
at him emotionally, you know?

592
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,183
I never thought that
it could be killing him

593
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,761
slowly, physically.

594
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:06,307
We're going to make sure
that does not happen.

595
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,386
Sorry.

596
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,156
I know you're busy.

597
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,491
Go. Go, go.

598
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,282
It's OK.

599
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,134
I have a few minutes.

600
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,761
Thank you.

601
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,714
Hey.

602
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:26,855
Hot chocolate.

603
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,435
Figured you could
use some good juju.

604
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,859
If you wanted something else,
you could have just said so.

605
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,389
Thought that would
make me feel better.

606
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:44,503
OK.

607
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,470
Come on.

608
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:47,507
Yell at me.

609
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,362
Pretend I'm him or them.

610
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:51,237
All of them.

611
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,995
What do you want to
say? Yell it at me.

612
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,470
No, I'm not...

613
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,239
Miranda, he knew your
daughter's full name.

614
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:00,888
He knew my daughter's full name.

615
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:03,389
He threatened my child.

616
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:10,747
You... you would hurt
a four-year-old girl

617
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:13,186
in the name of life?

618
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:17,353
As if you give two craps
about life or about children

619
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,701
or about the welfare of
any other human other than

620
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,756
your own self-righteous...

621
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,097
I mean, as if you actually
cared about making

622
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,557
the world a better place.

623
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,066
As if... as if you
listen to anything

624
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,955
your own religion tells you.

625
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,725
But you would hurt a child...

626
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,288
My child... for what?

627
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:38,729
Just to prove a point?

628
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:41,017
And then you have the nerve
to call yourself pro-life?

629
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,962
Well, shame on you.

630
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:44,970
No, you are what is
wrong in this world.

631
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:49,896
Not me, not my family, not my
child, you sick son of a...

632
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,232
No. No.

633
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,651
Because my mother used to say,

634
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:57,472
"Kill 'em with
kindness, Miranda."

635
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,947
I just wish that I could

636
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:03,659
kill them with the truth.

637
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,958
Maybe there's a
way we can do both.

638
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:14,109
He was a huge guy, and I...

639
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,905
I should have been scared,
but all I could think about

640
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,414
was saving Bailey.

641
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,648
You're so brave.

642
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,161
Look at her.

643
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,794
She's practically salivating.

644
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:24,854
And over Kwan?

645
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:25,949
Yeesh.

646
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,551
- You jealous?
- No.

647
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:28,904
Hmm, kind of seems like you are.

648
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:29,934
I'm embarrassed for her.

649
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,127
It's not a character flaw
to want to be with somebody.

650
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:34,182
Are we still talking about me,

651
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,795
or are we talking about you now?

652
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,982
We lost his airway.

653
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,664
Code blue!
- We'll get him on oxygen.

654
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:52,895
Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

655
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,714
<i>Code blue. Code blue.</i>

656
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,644
No pulse.

657
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:58,602
We need to intubate
him now. Start CPR.

658
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,673
All right. Starting
cardiac compressions.

659
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:02,269
All right.

660
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:04,627
<i>Code blue.</i>

661
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:06,092
<i>Code blue.</i>

662
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,285
There's too much swelling.

663
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,518
I can't visualize the cords.

664
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:09,692
We need to crike him.

665
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:10,627
We're interns.

666
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,027
We have to wait
for Dr. Schmitt.

667
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,282
Page Dr. Schmitt.
Page everyone.

668
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,087
I can't do this. I
can't watch him die.

669
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:16,112
We'll be fired!

670
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:17,486
You can leave if you want to.

671
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,512
I'm saving his life.

672
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:19,366
<i>Code blue.</i>

673
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:20,570
<i>Code blue.</i>

674
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,392
There's a crike
tray in the drawer.

675
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:28,919
All right, but wait.
We should put an IV bag

676
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:30,576
underneath his shoulder blades.

677
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:31,679
I saw Dr. Hunt do it.

678
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:33,471
It'll open up his neck.

679
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,477
<i>Code blue.</i>

680
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,163
<i>Code blue.</i>

681
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,545
Does anybody see Dr. Schmitt?

682
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:46,788
OK, let's do it.

683
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:48,659
Just don't kill him.

684
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,524
Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.

685
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,517
We'll update you
when we're finished.

686
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:04,971
She's angry that
my wife left me.

687
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,430
Doesn't seem quite fair.

688
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:08,941
When Amelia is angry,
she is rarely fair.

689
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,044
Yeah.

690
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,273
All right, Griffith.

691
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,238
Talk me through this.
What's the move?

692
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:16,231
Use the cautery to
demarcate the line,

693
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,599
and then pass over it
with the GIA stapler.

694
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:19,728
Good.

695
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:20,883
Now show me.

696
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,301
You want me to do it?

697
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:23,655
With all due respect,
are you sure?

698
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,922
Dr. Pierce always said that...

699
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,324
Dr. Pierce doesn't
work here anymore,

700
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:27,348
and I think you're ready.

701
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,654
GIA stapler.

702
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:43,009
Position the
stapler, and fire it.

703
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:51,588
Uh, the edge is bleeding.

704
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,029
OK. How do you stop it?

705
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,137
Ndugu, there are
multiple bleeders.

706
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,242
Maybe you should take over now.

707
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,266
Hunt, kindly back off.

708
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,578
Griffith, listen to me.

709
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:02,073
If you stop now, the
next time this happens,

710
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,330
you'll panic even more.

711
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:04,983
You can do this, all
right? I know you can.

712
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,007
Just focus.

713
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,622
Take a deep breath and think.

714
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:11,263
2-0 vicryl on a pass, stat.

715
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,187
Forceps.

716
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:19,459
Come on.

717
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,629
Come on. Come on.

718
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:24,878
Sutures are holding.

719
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:26,027
Well done.

720
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,410
Let's proceed.

721
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:35,605
Is he going to be OK?

722
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:39,583
When something goes wrong,
your job is to page me and do

723
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:40,963
nothing until I get there.

724
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,493
I paged code blue, but
he was dying, so...

725
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:43,709
Is he OK?

726
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:46,408
I need to be sure that you
understand that if he doesn't

727
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,401
make it, your career is over.

728
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,387
All that training for nothing.

729
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,147
All you had to do
was wait two minutes.

730
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:53,414
He didn't have two minutes.

731
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,131
If Adams hadn't stepped
in he would be in a coma

732
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:56,398
right now or worse.

733
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:58,291
It's tough enough
to pay back student

734
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:00,939
loans when you are a doctor.

735
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,435
When they pull your
license because you sliced

736
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,945
a patient's neck with no
one there to supervise you,

737
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,875
it's way harder.

738
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:11,166
You did the crike well.

739
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,285
You saved his life.

740
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,117
I'm admitting him to the ICU.

741
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:15,904
Oh, thank god.

742
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,722
Oh my god.

743
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,391
That fear you're feeling?

744
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,231
Remember it next time and wait.

745
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:29,989
Um, thanks for
sticking up for me.

746
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:31,993
Well, we couldn't let him die
without declaring his love

747
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:33,950
for a fictional character.

748
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:35,363
What's your deal?

749
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:38,860
Are you really just,
like, anti-love?

750
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,023
I went to med
school in Colorado.

751
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,853
I had a crush on
a guy in O-chem,

752
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,165
and that's where he was going.

753
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,176
My mom encouraged me,
because according to her

754
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,729
love is not only everything,

755
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,447
it is the only thing.

756
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,474
And first semester, I
failed gross anatomy,

757
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,520
because I was at
his birthday party

758
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,409
instead of studying
for my final...

759
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:58,231
His birthday party
where he called me Jane

760
00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,801
and then made out
with my best friend

761
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:01,035
at the end of the night.

762
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,342
My grades recovered,
but surgical internships

763
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,989
are so competitive.

764
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:07,991
That's why I'm in the program
for rejects and losers.

765
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,156
Because my parents
taught me to value

766
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:13,445
an obsessive crush over
my grades and my medical

767
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,541
school aspirations.

768
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,301
Have you ever thought
that maybe there's

769
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:19,259
a difference between a
stupid, obsessive crush

770
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,906
and actual love?

771
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,098
You sound exactly
like my mother.

772
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:30,366
Oh, hey.

773
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:34,481
You will not believe what I
have been dealing with today.

774
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,433
You OK?

775
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:39,298
We removed, uh...

776
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,862
bullet fragments
from a mass shooting

777
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:43,039
survivor today.

778
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:46,131
And while we were in the OR,
there were two more shootings.

779
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:54,981
I... I don't recognize
our country anymore.

780
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:57,489
Weapons of war in
grocery stores,

781
00:30:57,514 --> 00:31:02,488
at parades and schools, active
shooter drills in third grade.

782
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,328
We used to be
horrified, you know?

783
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:07,585
We used to grieve as a nation.

784
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,647
But now... now it
happens so frequently,

785
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,260
we don't even blink.

786
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,082
And nothing changes.

787
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,604
And I feel hopeless.

788
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,405
Hey.

789
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:27,958
So I have an idea.

790
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,882
You're either going
to love it or hate it.

791
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:36,015
Dr. Shepherd, I just want
to reiterate how sorry I am.

792
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,525
You lost focus while I had
my hands inside a man's back.

793
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,553
He is the one that you
should be apologizing to.

794
00:31:41,578 --> 00:31:43,708
He is the one who trusted
you while he was unconscious

795
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:44,849
on an operating table.

796
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,201
You don't let yourself
get distracted when

797
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,539
people are depending on you.

798
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:48,975
When they are
vulnerable and scared,

799
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,140
that is when you give them
everything that you've got.

800
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,750
That is when you stay
alert long enough not

801
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:56,755
to drop a sharp metal
object while someone's

802
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,859
spine is exposed.

803
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,998
I... I didn't drop it in him...

804
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:01,485
I'm sorry, you're
defending yourself?

805
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:03,027
What is wrong with you?

806
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:04,131
I'm really asking.

807
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,292
Yasuda, what is wrong with you?

808
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,012
Do I really need to answer that?

809
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:09,100
No, you don't, Yasuda.

810
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:09,886
You can go.

811
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,572
You, come with me.

812
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,674
- Addie?

813
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,256
- Richard, Uh, yeah.

814
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,847
I'll find you later, OK?

815
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,980
Are you high?

816
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:25,077
No.

817
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:25,999
Is that the truth?

818
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,370
No, I'm not high.

819
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:28,614
Are you using again?

820
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:31,231
No. I can't sleep,
I... I can't eat.

821
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:32,159
I am a wreck.

822
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,528
I am not using. God.

823
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,473
OK, great.

824
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:36,765
Then I'm going to go ahead and
love you enough to tell you

825
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,723
to pull your head out of
your self-obsessed ass

826
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:42,653
and get to an AA meeting,
because the world

827
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:43,596
is already on fire.

828
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:45,873
We don't need you burning
anything else down, all right?

829
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,698
And I know you're in
pain, and I know that you

830
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,034
feel it more than most.

831
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:51,927
But get to a meeting,
say a damn prayer,

832
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:55,474
call your sponsor, then eat
something and figure out a way

833
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:59,538
to be of service to
this broken world,

834
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,438
instead of adding
to everyone's pain.

835
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,504
Because it starts with you
trashing everybody else,

836
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:08,776
and it ends with you back in
rehab again, if you're lucky.

837
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:12,204
No one has abandoned
you, Amelia, OK?

838
00:33:12,229 --> 00:33:15,737
Everyone is just doing
the best that they can.

839
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:19,594
I love you, and everyone else
is just barely surviving,

840
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:22,150
and it has nothing
to do with you.

841
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:24,633
I love you, and you need
to make the decision

842
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:25,878
to stop the spiral.

843
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,156
And if you can't do it,
you need to find someone,

844
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:29,952
get someone to help you stop it.

845
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,184
I love you, Amelia.

846
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,215

get off the damn ride

before it's too late.

848
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:51,308
I know that we've all been
worried about Dr. Bailey.

849
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:56,520
What she is going through
is frightening and invasive,

850
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:59,237
and how it's not against
the law is beyond me.

851
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,742
What I do know is that it
is easier to hurt a stranger

852
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,320
than someone you know.

853
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:08,414
Dr. Kwan is handing out
