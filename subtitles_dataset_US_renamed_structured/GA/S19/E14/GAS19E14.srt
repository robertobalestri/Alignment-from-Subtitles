- You don't like Ndugu?

- Don't like marriage.

72
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,037
- What's wrong with marriage?

73
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:49,383
- It's a distraction.

74
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,591
- From what?

75
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,972
- Meaningful career,

76
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,284
making an impactful
contribution to the world,

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,012
fully-realized
individual potential.

78
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,634
- Ready.

79
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,878
- Are you sure?

80
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,301
Sorry.

81
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,786
Are you going to get off
work on time tonight?

82
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:15,409
Because I made us
this reservation

83
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,042
at that pizza place
you keep talking about.

84
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,550
- Pizzageddon?
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:19,827
- It's impossible to get into.

86
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,484
- Well, I have an
in with the manager.

87
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,624
I delivered his baby.

88
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:26,247
- Did I forget?
Is it my birthday?

89
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,869
Is it your birthday?
- No, I just...

90
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,182
I figured that we
deserved a night out.

91
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:31,183
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

92
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,633
- All right.
- OK.

93
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,569
- Those two need to get a room.

94
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,088
- What, Link and Wilson?

95
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,780
- Yeah, they basically just
had sex in front of us.

96
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,954
You remember
what sex is, right?

97
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,612
- I'm just saying. Messy.

98
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,821
- I don't know.

99
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,790
Hey, you remember when you
and me used to be like that?

100
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,896
- Nope.

101
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,867
- Do you smell margaritas?

102
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,110
- It's me.

103
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:03,077
Joe's had a two-for-one
special last night.

104
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,010
- Oh, maybe you should
try soap next time.

105
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,677
- Oh, maybe you should try
being the maid of honor

106
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,816
for someone you have
feelings for who's

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,566
marrying someone
else... Oh, wait.

108
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,292
Mission accomplished.
- We're just friends.

109
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,742
- Don't care.

110
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,444
Oh, but can you bring leftovers
from the cake tasting?

111
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:15,952
- Ow. Ow!

112
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,480
- What do we got?
- William Hudson, 32.

113
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,093
GCS 14.

114
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,544
Left upper extremity deformity
and abdominal contusion.

115
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,477
Systolic's in the low 100s.
- Trauma three.

116
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,134
- OK. What happened?
- Am I bleeding?

117
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,826
- He, uh, tried to mail himself
to his girlfriend in Florida.

118
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,139
- Excuse me?
- It's her birthday tomorrow.

119
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,254
- Says he was trying
to surprise her.

120
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:32,831
- Wait, you put
yourself in a box?

121
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,143
- Ow!

122
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:35,396
- And the box fell
from the conveyor belt

123
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,742
while they were loading
it into the plane.

124
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,974
- Yeah, maybe for the best.

125
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,227
He could have died
in the cargo hold.

126
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,632
- He could still die here.

127
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,220
- What?

128
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,187
- I'll go page Hunt.

129
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:46,465
- You guys still use pagers?

130
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,128
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi, are you doctors?

131
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,820
- Uh, yes, we are.
How can we help you?

132
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:57,935
- We're here to speak
to Dr. Margaret Pierce.

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,040
- Do you have an appointment?

134
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,248
- Viv, this was not a good idea.

135
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,136
- Can you just call Dr. Pierce?

136
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,931
- Uh, her... Her
schedule is very busy.

137
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:05,736
But if you, um, give me
your information, I can...

138
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,555
- No, no, no, no. We
just drove 400 miles

139
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,557
in my 1994 roadie van,

140
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,363
without air conditioning,
so that my friend here

141
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,802
could be seen for
the giant tumor

142
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,700
that is crushing her heart.

143
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,427
So can you two baby doctors
just pick up the phone

144
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:18,773
and call Dr. Margaret Pierce?

145
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,845
Because we are not
leaving until you do.

146
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,473
- You packing up?
- Yeah.

147
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,451
I'm at that point where I'm
just throwing everything

148
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,142
into a bag because I don't
have time to decide whether

149
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,238
I want to keep it or not.

150
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:37,102
I know this is all
happening really fast.

151
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,140
Um, it's actually happening
a little quickly for me, too.

152
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,695
But this is just such
a huge opportunity.

153
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,800
- I guess I thought this
place meant more to you

154
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,468
than just a stepping stone
for something bigger.

155
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,149
- Richard, of course it does.

156
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,841
- I mean, we just revived
the residency program.

157
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,325
We just lost Meredith.
- I know.

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,878
And I told Teddy when I gave her

159
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,098
my resignation that I would
help interview new candidates

160
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,503
over video chat.

161
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:00,619
- In my day, you accepted a
job after your fellowship,

162
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,024
then you worked there
until you retired.

163
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,303
They taught you that
loyalty mattered.

164
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,375
- So out of loyalty, I should
not pursue research that would

165
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,031
save thousands of patients?

166
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:14,001
- You've already started
doing that here with Winston.

167
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:18,868
- I hate that you're upset, but
I'm not going to apologize...

168
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,801
- Dr. Margaret Pierce,

169
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,975
can you please come
to the nurses' station

170
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,150
on the first floor, please?

171
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,359
- I guess, um...

172
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,061
- Dr. Margaret Pierce...
- We'll talk later.

173
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:31,639
- Can you please come
to the nurses' station

174
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,813
on the first floor.

175
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:33,962
- Ma'am, you are not allowed...

176
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,541
- Dr. Margaret
Pierce, can you please

177
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,059
come to the nurses' station...

178
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:40,233
- Security is on their way,
and the longer we do this,

179
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,650
the longer it will...
- Oh, my God. I'm here.

180
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:44,100
- Second floor please!

181
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,240
- Why am I being paged
on repeat by someone

182
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,793
who doesn't even work here?

183
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,426
- We're so sorry, Dr. Pierce.
- She grabbed the phone.

184
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,876
- And we called security.
- Dr. Pierce!

185
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,350
Um, big fan.

186
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:53,696
This is Nola.

187
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,422
She has mediastinal
mass syndrome

188
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,183
due to the large
thymoma which has

189
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,117
completely taken over her heart.

190
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:04,500
- Uh, Dr. Griffith,

191
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:07,227
uh, get them upstairs in a room,

192
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,953
so I can do a proper
consult, but do not ever

193
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,507
come into a hospital
that way again,

194
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,095
or you'll be quickly
escorted out.

195
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,028
- Uh, I thought
you were leaving.

196
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:18,997
I'm going
to push my flight.

197
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,379
Next time, try listening
to the patients

198
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:24,451
before you call
security on them.

199
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,230
- I'm sorry.

200
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,543
I know it's uncomfortable.
- Uncomfortable?

201
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:49,027
It hurts like hell.

202
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,100
- Can't you give him
anything for the pain?

203
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,171
- We need to complete
the initial exam first.

204
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,666
- Can I just get back
to playing "Minecraft"?

205
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,381
- What mode are you playing?

206
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,003
- Survival.
- Mm.

207
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,212
- Just nailed an
enchanting table,

208
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,052
then you came in and
started trying to kill me.

209
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,319
Ow!
- Sorry.

210
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,458
- David.

211
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,666
Oh hey, Daisy.

212
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,012
- Dr. Webber.

213
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:11,394
- Well, look who we have here.

214
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,671
Dr. Kwan?

215
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:13,983
- Grayson Friedman, 13.

216
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,364
History of ulcerative colitis,

217
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:16,893
which has previously
been in clinical...

218
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,574
- He knows already.
He's my doctor.

219
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:19,954
- Hey. Sorry.

220
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,829
Dr. Webber diagnosed
Grayson when he was eight.

221
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,451
We've been managing his
condition with meds.

222
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,384
But this morning, the pain
was so bad he collapsed

223
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:26,454
on the floor in the bathroom.

224
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:27,731
- Do you think he needs surgery?

225
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:28,905
- No.
- Last time you mentioned

226
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:30,724
an ostomy.
- No, I know what that is.

227
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,863
It's not that bad. Don't
do surgery, please.

228
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:35,798
- We won't do anything until
we find out what's going on.

229
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,282
We'll run some tests,

230
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,810
and then we'll get you
something for your pain.

231
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:39,974
- Thank you.

232
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,769
- I don't want surgery.

233
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,253
I don't even think I need it.

234
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:47,913
- Order a CBC, CMP,
inflammatory markers with a CT.

235
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,984
Then put him on an IV steroid

236
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,159
with a PRN of morphine
to make him comfortable,

237
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,781
and page me when
you get the scans.

238
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,645
- Uh, Dr. Webber?

239
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,303
Do you think that maybe we
could find some time to talk?

240
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,064
- Seems like we're
doing that now, Schmitt.

241
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,964
- Well, I don't have
my notes with me.

242
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:05,206
Right.

243
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,208
I've been thinking
about fellowships

244
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:08,658
and attending positions,

245
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,980
and I would love to
pick your brain...

246
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,361
- You haven't applied
for your fellowships yet?

247
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,800
I submitted my recommendations

248
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,215
for most candidates months ago.

249
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,631
- I've been exploring options,

250
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:18,219
and I would love
your suggestions.

251
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:19,680
- You're a fourth-year
resident, Schmitt.

252
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:20,877
My suggestion would be,

253
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:24,191
get your act together
sooner than later.

254
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,540
- Nola, we're really here.

255
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,335
You're... you're
really being examined

256
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,509
by Dr. Margaret Pierce.

257
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:33,303
I mean, the
Dr. Margaret Pierce!

258
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:34,822
Meeting you in
person, it's like...

259
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,075
- That time we met Stevie Nicks.

260
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,342
- I'm digging this more.

261
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,826
- I am flattered.

262
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,207
Oh, keep her elevated.

263
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,209
If she's flat, the
tumor could further

264
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:46,316
compress the vasculature, which
could lead to more swelling.

265
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,490
Griffith?

266
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,389
- Uh, Nola Marquez, 42.

267
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,045
Developed a mediastinal mass

268
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,013
with a tissue
diagnosis of a thymoma.

269
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,739
The tumor grew
alongside her heart,

270
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,810
putting pressure on it
and the vasculature,

271
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,259
causing SVC syndrome.

272
00:09:58,294 --> 00:09:59,882
Symptoms include
shortness of breath

273
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,401
and mental acuity issues.

274
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,817
- It's not that bad.
- No one believes you.

275
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,508
- Sisters?
- Close.

276
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,614
We're, uh, friends
since elementary school.

277
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,410
We met in chorus, and been
rocking together ever since.

278
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,342
- You're in a band?
- We are a band.

279
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,896
Double Helix.

280
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,012
- Ever since Nola got diagnosed
she hasn't touched her guitar.

281
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:19,522
- I can barely sleep,
let alone perform.

282
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,282
Viv has dragged me to
every heart surgeon

283
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,215
in the Pacific Northwest.

284
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,596
No one will operate.

285
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,391
They all say it's too risky.

286
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,462
- Bunch of cowards. But
now we have the best.

287
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:31,534
Dr. Pierce, she's... she's not
pop rock, she's Led Zeppelin.

288
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,708
Double Helix is back.

289
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:33,961
- All right, well,
first things first.

290
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,194
Let's get some scans,
see where we are.

291
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:38,023
Griffith, Millin.

292
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,992
- Uh, she's been fasting, and
we've both been visualizing.

293
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,719
So she's ready for surgery
the minute you are.

294
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,585
- Why didn't you
show up with flowers?

295
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,034
That was all I'm saying.

296
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,037
- It was supposed to be
a grand romantic gesture.

297
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,039
- I surprised you in Germany.

298
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,327
- Yeah, but you came on a plane.

299
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,733
- Yeah, like a
regular human person.

300
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:01,288
- We need to check his upper
left extremity for a fracture.

301
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,221
Order some AP and lateral films.

302
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,257
- OK.

303
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,569
- What's the lesson here?

304
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,226
Romance can be fatal.

305
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,848
Wouldn't
be the first time.

306
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,963
- Or it can save lives and heal.

307
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,023
- Oh, please.

308
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,507
You're just trying
to prove me wrong

309
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,027
because you didn't even know
that Jo and Link were an item.

310
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,201
- No. No, Jo and I are...
We're just friends.

311
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:19,686
- Friends who have
slept together.

312
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,033
- Wait, you guys slept together?

313
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,493
- How do you know that?
- You know what?

314
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,968
Just, uh, page me when
the scans come in.

315
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:31,560
- How much longer do
I have to be in here?

316
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:32,733
- Not long.

317
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:34,839
Just think like you
have a health bar

318
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:37,186
that needs replenishing.

319
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,946
It's a video game reference.

320
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,155
- I'm aware.

321
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,228
How do you not know if you're
doing general or subspecialty?

322
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:47,127
It's a fellowship reference.

323
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,542
- Wow.

324
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,889
You're really begging
for a pile of scut, Kwan.

325
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,546
- No, I'm genuinely asking

326
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,479
how you got into your
fourth year of residency

327
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,136
without a clear direction.

328
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,276
- Well, let's see.

329
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,038
Maybe it was the worldwide
pandemic that happened

330
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:03,557
in the middle of my residency,

331
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,112
or the program being
shut down last year.

332
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,494
Take your pick.

333
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,531
- Well, I like to
track each subspecialty

334
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,498
I'm interested in
with a spreadsheet

335
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,258
and monitor trends in each area.

336
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,501
- I'm hot.

337
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,641
And it's really
dark in here, guys.

338
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:19,849
I really want to get out.

339
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:24,474
- Grayson, just, um,
hum a song or sing.

340
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,683
- Like what?

341
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:28,548
- Anything inside your head.

342
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,629
- You studying for
your bar mitzvah?

343
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:42,354
- Yeah. I sound terrible.

344
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,564
I've been practicing for
over 300 days in a row,

345
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,117
and I still sound awful, right?

346
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,808
- Yes.
- Keep chanting.

347
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:57,369
- It's acute severe colitis.

348
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:16,630
- That smells delicious.

349
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:19,599
- I was thinking after we
eat, we can go on a walk.

350
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,877
Um, I wanted to talk...

351
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:25,259
Hey, what's wrong?

352
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,204
- With Mer gone
and Maggie leaving,

353
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:30,506
there's not going to
be any Sunday dinners.

354
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,197
- Mm.

355
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,717
- On Sundays, Maggie cooks,

356
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:36,546
and she puts enough
leftovers in my fridge

357
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,755
to get me to Wednesday.

358
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,516
- So maybe it's time
to learn how to cook.

359
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,522
- I have a history of
spiraling when people leave me,

360
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:49,352
and a good old-fashioned
spiral does not leave

361
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:51,700
much time for cooking lessons.

362
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,667
- What does it leave time for?

363
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,842
- All kinds of fun things.

364
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,465
Uh, pulling away
from people you love,

365
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,021
starting fights, lack of sleep,

366
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:05,921
spilling your worst instincts
to someone who just flew

367
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:09,821
halfway across the
country to cook for you.

368
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,858
- You love your sisters.

369
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,516
This is a big change.
Anybody would be sad, Amelia.

370
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:21,661
- How could I be
sad with you here?

371
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,226
- Yasuda, I have a job for you.

372
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,780
- Oh, Dr. Bailey, thank you.

373
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:38,885
At your service.

374
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,820
- Hey, I need you
to hold on to this.

375
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:46,340
That is my lifeline, and
I'm entrusting it to you.

376
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,757
Do not answer it
unless caller ID says

377
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,587
it's my husband Ben Warren,
or a hospital number.

378
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,795
- Got it.

379
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,971
So Grey Sloan, your
husband, or Ben Warren?

380
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,593
- My husband is Ben Warren.

381
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:00,044
Do I need to entrust
this to someone else?

382
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,735
- Nope. I got this.

383
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,737
Entrust me.

384
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,707
- Hey, if you don't screw it up,

385
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,744
maybe she'll entrust you
to babysit her tablet next.

386
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,996
- Do I need to get surgery?

387
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,136
- We should really
wait for your parents.

388
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,620
- I can't get surgery.

389
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,691
My bar mitzvah's
to be in 36 hours.

390
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,382
- You haven't been
taking your medication.

391
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,383
- What?

392
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,731
No, I have. Every day.

393
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,387
My parents set this,
um, annoying alarm.

394
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:34,699
Um...

395
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,805
- Grayson, I have
your urine results.

396
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,118
The labs don't lie, but
sometimes patients do.

397
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,987
- Yeah, OK, I... I stopped.

398
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,782
But just for a little bit.

399
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,001
I've been in these
Hebrew classes,

400
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,623
and the pills and
infusions, they made me...

401
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,822
They made me really
tired, so tired that I...

402
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,824
I fainted one day,
and everyone saw.

403
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,240
And then the... the medications,
they dried my eyes out.

404
00:15:58,274 --> 00:15:59,897
And then the eye
drops, they burned.

405
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,106
And I got this gross-looking
rash on my neck

406
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,486
that Eloise Schurmann saw...

407
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,488
- Do you know how worried
your parents have been?

408
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,766
- Dr. Webber...

409
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,768
- How much money they've
spent on your treatments?

410
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,253
Now you need surgery.
- No. No surgery.

411
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,567
It doesn't even hurt that badly.

412
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,497
Just... just give me some
steroids or infusions.

413
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,741
The Torah portion
is only 25 minutes.

414
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,432
I can make 25 minutes.
- No, you can't.

415
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,917
- Please.
- If you don't get

416
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:21,826
the surgery immediately, the
inflammation in your intestine

417
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,472
will get worse, spread further,

418
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,474
and lead to an incredibly
serious infection.

419
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:28,270
You would be in excruciating
pain, and you would die.

420
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,271
- Kwan!
- You know what?

421
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,686
Dr. Kwan is right.

422
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,551
Grayson, you're not an adult,
and you're not a doctor.

423
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:35,287
I'm talking to your
parents, because clearly

424
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,279
you aren't mature enough
to understand how much

425
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,764
we care about you,
and how much harm

426
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,803
you could have done to yourself.

427
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:50,464
- OK, Hudson's X-rays are in.

428
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,121
Uh, sorry. One sec.

429
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,329
It's Jo.

430
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,094
Um, it looks like a simple

431
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:00,992
mildly displaced
humeral fracture.

432
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:03,305
- Yeah, and a shattered spleen
with decreasing responses

433
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,616
to fluids.

434
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,826
Teddy and I can take him
up for an ex-lap now.

435
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,010
- And I will set and reduce
the fracture when you're done.

436
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,691
Mm-hmm.

437
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:15,937
I know what you're thinking...

438
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,320
That I should tell Jo I
have feelings for her.

439
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,667
But listen, we built a
home together as friends.

440
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:21,989
Our kids are
practically siblings.

441
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,680
If I make a move and she
doesn't feel the same way,

442
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:24,773
it's over.

443
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,200
Saying something
is not a good idea.

444
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,088
- That is not at all
what I was thinking.

445
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:29,169
- So you think it's a good idea?

446
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:30,677
- I have no opinion.

447
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,931
Plus, the last person I talked
to about their relationship

448
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:35,440
was Ndugu, and his wife is
moving to another state.

449
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:36,755
- Not to mention him and Altman.

450
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,272
- What was that, Yasuda?

451
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:41,619
- Do you and Altman need
us to prep him for surgery?

452
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:42,792
- Yes.

453
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,002
And type and cross
two units of blood.

454
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,981
- And deep breath.

455
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:01,225
- My parents toured with
the band for a minute.

456
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,709
They were called Blessed Wolf.

457
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:05,712
- Well, I tried to name us
after our third grade teacher,

458
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:10,406
Mrs. Hatmaker, but
Nola here nixed it.

459
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,168
- Two women in a
folk rock duo called

460
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:16,171
the Hatmakers might as well
sew up their vaginas forever.

461
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:18,552
- Is Viv your only
emergency contact?

462
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:21,072
- My ride or die, since day one.

463
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:23,592
- And you repay me
by trying to die.

464
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,559
- Think about all
the songs you'll be

465
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:26,906
able to write about my death.

466
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,355
- Oh, you're better off.

467
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,944
I mean, who needs a spouse
when you have a bandmate?

468
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,947
- Well, we prefer the
term platonic soulmate.

469
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,397
- Another excellent band name.

470
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,753
- We're going to
talk to Dr. Pierce,

471
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,607
and we'll be back to update you.

472
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:48,375
Thank you.

473
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,308
OK, what is your problem?
- With what?

474
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,321
- You're hating on marriage
to anyone who will listen,

475
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,760
when I'm about to get married.

476
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:55,807
- Or I'm doing my job and
connecting with our patients.

477
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:56,877
- Yeah, but you don't know Trey.

478
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:57,947
You don't know our relationship.

479
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,214
- I know.

480
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,492
Get married, don't get
married. I don't care.

481
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:02,872
- But it's not a distraction.

482
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,264
I've been singularly focused
on becoming a surgeon

483
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,634
since I was eight.

484
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:08,602
- Griffith, I've already
said I don't care.

485
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:10,156
Who are you trying to convince?

486
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,330
- Doctors? It's Nola.
Something happened.

487
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,136
We were
talking and she gasped.

488
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,403
And then, um, this
machine started going off.

489
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:19,268
I don't know.
- Grab a crash cart.

490
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:21,270
How's her airway?

491
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:22,696
- Airway's patent
and she's breathing.

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,997
- She has JVD.

493
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,449
- OK, we need to get her
oxygen, and page Dr. Pierce!

494
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:30,693
- O2.

495
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:38,839
- What happened?

496
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:40,117
- Her BP dropped.

497
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:41,577
JVD, muffled heart sounds.
- What does it mean?

498
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,774
- Cardiac tamponade.

499
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,638
- Someone tell me
what that means.

500
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:47,987
- Nola's tumor has caused
fluid to accumulate

501
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,919
around her heart.

502
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,818
We need to relieve the
pressure by draining it,

503
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,889
by doing what's called
a pericardiocentesis.

504
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:56,374
18-gauge spinal needle.

505
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,307
Griffith?

506
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,313
Find your landmarks.

507
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,937
Find one centimeter inferior
to the left xiphocostal angle.

508
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,146
- Yep.

509
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,631
- Insert the needle
at a 30-degree angle.

510
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,908
Good.

511
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:16,187
And slowly advance it
toward the left shoulder,

512
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:18,983
while aspirating.

513
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,467
And you should
start to see fluid.

514
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,642
Good, there it is. Good.

515
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:26,956
She's stable, but we
don't have much time.

516
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,130
- Until what?

517
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:30,132
- Until the fluid
builds up again.

518
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:34,067
Let's get her to the CCU,
and page Dr. Ndugu right now.

519
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,660
- Do you hear something?

520
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,420
- Don't worry about it, William.

521
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,733
- Maybe it's Rose.
- Who's Rose?

522
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,079
- Oh, she's my girlfriend.

523
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,081
She's so pretty and smart.

524
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,910
Except for her teeth.

525
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:51,291
- Don't worry about it, William.

526
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:52,810
It's not Rose.

527
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:54,122
- Oh, my God.

528
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,606
- It's not my fault.

529
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,919
Stop calling, asshat!

530
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:00,197
You're not harassing
Dr. Bailey.

531
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:02,164
You are harassing me!
A poor, overworked,

532
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:05,167
tired intern who would really
appreciate it if you could...

533
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,548
Hello?

534
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:07,687
Hi.

535
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,826
Sorry.

536
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,931
I'll... I'll tell her.

537
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,556
That was Dr. Bailey's
optometrist.

538
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,075
Tuck's glasses are ready.

539
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,362
- Do you need me to hold
the phone for a while?

540
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:18,836
- No, thank you.

541
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,838
- Do you need me to hold
the phone for a while?

542
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:25,912
You in the Nether worlds now?

543
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,569
Do you play with friends, or...

544
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,743
- Do you think Dr. Webber will

545
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:31,469
still want to be my
doctor after this?

546
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:33,333
- Of course he will.

547
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:34,955
- I disappointed him.

548
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,891
- Well, if it makes you
feel any better, so have I.

549
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:42,135
- Kids at school
call me a defect,

550
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,448
because I'm always in the
nurse's office taking my meds.

551
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:48,210
I just wanted to be
normal, you know?

552
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:52,145
- You know, I tried
for a really long time

553
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,905
to be what I thought was normal,

554
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,668
and then I decided to see what
would happen if I stopped.

555
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:59,152
- What happened?

556
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:01,982
- I liked myself a lot more.

557
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,056
- OK.

558
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,886
I'm ready.

559
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,439
- OK.

560
00:22:13,787 --> 00:22:16,376
- You paged?

561
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,413
- I wasn't sure you'd answer it.

562
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:21,001
- You're still my boss
till the end of the day.

563
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:24,557
- Pushed my flight
till tomorrow.

564
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,836
Looks like a large thymoma
in the mediastinum.

565
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,149
It's already
starting to tamponade

566
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,152
with sympathetic fluid, so
I don't have a lot of time.

567
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,913
- Tumor is shaped like a heart.

568
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,363
You didn't notice?
- No.

569
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,123
I was more concerned
with how close it was

570
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,505
to the heart, not its shape.

571
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,748
- Have you considered doing
a reconstruction of the SVC?

572
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:44,956
- Yes.

573
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,717
But I'm concerned that
the tumor involves

574
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,339
the innominate artery.

575
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:51,618
- OK, what if you take the
entire SVC and left subclavian?

576
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,413
You'd have to
resect the sternum,

577
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,519
the SVC, and all
the pericardium,

578
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,521
but you'd get the entire tumor.

579
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,281
- That's if she doesn't
decompensate first.

580
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:01,214
If I go into the
wrong dissecting plane

581
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:05,391
even a tiny bit, she
bleeds out and dies.

582
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,360
- She'll die if she continues
to have fluid buildup.

583
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,538
- What if we use a
bovine pericardial patch

584
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:17,679
for the reconstruction?

585
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:23,547
- Maybe that would allow
us to have clear margins.

586
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,963
- No interns. There's
no margin for error.

587
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:29,725
Just you and me.
- Just you and me.

588
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,634
I'm sorry.

589
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:42,876
- It's OK.

590
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,199
- We hardly get
to see each other,

591
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,614
and I'm sitting here
crying like somebody died.

592
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,957
Even though I'm scaring you,
I'm so glad that you're here.

593
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:57,857
- Oh, it takes a lot
for this one to scare.

594
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,172
- I've hidden parts of
myself in every relationship

595
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,760
I've ever had,
except for this one.

596
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:06,314
It feels so freeing.

597
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:09,351
I just can be myself,

598
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:11,284
queen of spirals.

599
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,700
- You can't be the queen of
something that's only, like,

600
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,220
a tiny part of who you are.

601
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,846
You are sweet and kind.

602
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:25,125
But I also think that
you are underestimating

603
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,094
my ability to fall
off the deep end.

604
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:32,132
- I'm not
underestimating anything.

605
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:36,861
The Amelia I know is
a badass neurosurgeon,

606
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:39,830
an amazing mom.

607
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:43,730
She works hard on her sobriety.

608
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,907
She's a loving sister,
a devoted friend.

609
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:50,323
The Amelia I know is inspiring.

610
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,499
She is not the queen of spirals.

611
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,467
She is just a queen.

612
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:19,352
- Dr. Bailey,
Dr. Altman, Dr. Fox.

613
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:22,044
All married surgeons
with stellar careers.

614
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,985
- Careful.

615
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,849
The tissue is very friable.

616
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,645
- I'm aware, Dr. Pierce.

617
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,337
All right.

618
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,339
Specimen's coming out.

619
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:58,805
- Her blood pressure's soaring.

620
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:04,880
Uh, why aren't you
doing anything?

621
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,988
- Pressure is stabilized.

622
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:10,783
- Pseudo tamponade effect.

623
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:13,717
The heart isn't used to all
that space without the tumor.

624
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:16,720
Now it's alone and happy.

625
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,699
- Let's start the
reconstruction.

626
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:21,345
Put her on bypass.

627
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:26,937
- Dr. Hunt and I were able
to perform your splenectomy

628
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:28,317
without any complications.

629
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,665
You should heal nicely.
- Same with your shoulder.

630
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,184
You're going to need a couple
of months of rehabilitation,

631
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,808
but then you should be able
to regain normal function.

632
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,326
- Great.

633
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:40,399
Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:44,886
- William, this
is all good news.

635
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,508
- Yeah. No, sorry.

636
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:51,030
Um, Rose heard what I
did, and she dumped me.

637
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:53,239
You know...

638
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:54,965
I fell for her the
second I saw her

639
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,449
in line for Space Mountain.

640
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:58,520
Company retreat in Orlando.

641
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:02,213
I thought she was
the love of my life.

642
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:04,250
How could I have been so wrong?

643
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:06,459
- Listen, me and my wife,

644
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:09,220
we were friends for years
before we became a couple.

645
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,499
We met when we were
army surgeons together.

646
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,604
- So just to get this
right, are you judging me

647
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:15,710
for meeting Rose
at a theme park,

648
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:17,919
or for believing in
love at first sight?

649
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,921
Neither.

650
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:22,544
Listen, even though it took us
years to get together, I knew.

651
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,235
I knew from the
moment that I saw her

652
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,446
emerging from a surgical
tent in 100 degrees heat,

653
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,482
having just repaired
an aortic dissection

654
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,450
and saving a soldier's life.

655
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,487
I knew I wanted her in my life.
- Then what took you so long?

656
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,731
- Well, I was...

657
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,217
I was engaged, and then I
was married for a while,

658
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,390
and she was married.

659
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:43,323
Our timing was just
never quite right.

660
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,084
But those relationships,
they came and went.

661
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,604
And our friendship
outlasted them all,

662
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,882
even after she moved
out of the country.

663
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,918
Then one day, I...

664
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:53,886
I just realized that
she was the one person

665
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,484
that I wanted to talk to
at the end of a long day,

666
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,130
or a great day.

667
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,039
When I was reading a book or
watching a movie, I'd think,

668
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,686
man, she would love
this, you know?

669
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,172
She just kept... she would
constantly pop into my mind

670
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:05,587
until finally, I just...

671
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:09,488
I got on that plane
to Germany, and I...

672
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,456
I just told her.

673
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,147
So if you feel that
way about Rose,

674
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:17,530
if you know you want
her in your life,

675
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:20,188
you should just try again.

676
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,607
- Yeah.

677
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:28,541
I don't think Rose is it.

678
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,163
- Excuse me.

679
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:31,510
I got to be somewhere.

680
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,166
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:37,308
- I mean, I did mail myself
in a box, but she's not it.

682
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:40,208
Thank you for that story.

683
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:43,556
- Oh, look all of this
inflammation and necrosis.

684
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,972
I mean, this is almost
the entire colon.

685
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,250
- How long had Grayson's
symptoms been under control?

686
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,804
- Oh, years.

687
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:51,668
The medication protocol
worked wonders.

688
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,808
- And now he's completely
turned that around.

689
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:56,362
- Foolish to the
point of stupid.

690
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:01,885
- Dr. Kwan, do
you even remember

691
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,714
what being 13 is like?

692
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:05,509
Because I do.

693
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,028
It was really, really hard.

694
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,926
You think Grayson
doesn't already know

695
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:10,559
that he disappointed
everyone around him?

696
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,103
You think he doesn't
already feel stupid?

697
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:14,449
Believe me, he does.

698
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:17,107
Did you even hear him when
he was trying to tell us

699
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:19,454
that the medications
made him feel terrible,

700

feels to be 13?

701
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,839
Did you listen to your patient?

702
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,565
- Of course I did. But...

703
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,189
- Grayson has spent an entire
year working his butt off

704
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:32,536
on becoming a man, so
maybe stop chastising him

705
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:36,126
like a toddler and freaking
him out that he could die.

706
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,545
Sometimes being a good
doctor, or a parent,

707
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,030
or even a good mentor,

708
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:48,759
means listening to what
the other person needs.

709
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,798
Suction, Kwan.

710
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:58,424
- All right.

711
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,393
What is it?

712
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,568
- There's no back wall left
for the reconstruction.

713
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,226
I don't think the
patch is going to work.

Two incisions, end to

00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:19,169
- Yes.

721
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:23,449

have you considered
just turning it off?

741
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,769

considered being a wife,

a mother, and a
high-level professional?

743
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,048
Give me the phone.

00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:27,875
Viv, she's alive.

She's in the ICU.

remove the mass.

753
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,571

783
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,654
I was worried about
missing the ice cream cake.

784

00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,706
well, it's... it's frustrating.

790
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,054
But I'm not mad at you.

791
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,988
And if it came
off that way, I...

792
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:22,955
I'm sorry.

793
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,439

00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,538

whoa. What's wrong?

That there's a problem

866
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:26,138
I... I need...

867
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,140
I need to get her checked out.

868
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,383
- I'll be right there.

869
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:30,763
- No, no, no.

870
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:32,598
We're gonna... we're
gonna come straight home,

so you stay there, OK?

872
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,114
- OK.
- OK.

873
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:52,130
- When we don't feel
heard or validated,

874
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:57,065
it can be very easy to forget
that we aren't actually alone.

Hey, there are my girls.

880
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:18,432
Hey, you ready to
go home?

881
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:21,849
- Uh, we're not going
home. I got us a rental.

882
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:28,511
- What is this?

883
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:30,098
- It's a picture
of Tuck in school.

884
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:35,242
- I know it's a picture of
Tuck, but who sent it to you?

885
00:39:35,276 --> 00:39:38,245
- One of the numbers who's
called my phone over 40 times.

886
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,694
I know.

887
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:41,731
I just changed the number,
changed the emails.

888
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:45,666
We're taking the kids out
of school for a few days.

889
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,012
- And that there is a difference

890
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,394
between being alone,
and just feeling lonely.

891
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,223
Sometimes, being
alone is the only way

892
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:54,157
we can hear our own hearts
trying to communicate

893
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,228
what it is that we
actually want...

894
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,955
- I smell cake.

895
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:02,545
- What we need, and who we love.

896
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,720
- Oh, no fork.

897
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:07,205
- So we can move
through this world

898
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,345
with better communication
when we actually have

899
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:11,278
something important to say...

900
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,245
- Hey.

901
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,214
Hell of a way to go out today.

902
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,871
- I could not have done
that surgery without you.

903
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,252
- You would have figured it out.

904
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,358
- No, I wouldn't have.

905
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:25,015
I wouldn't have figured out
a lot of things without you.

906
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,362
You push me to be better.

907
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:28,018
You challenge me.

908
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:32,091
You inspire me to never give
in on a challenging case.

909
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:35,163
And the way that you accessed
that jugular today, it was...

910
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,512
- It was what?

911
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:44,311
- ♪ So come on,
bring the rain ♪

912
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:54,459
♪ Like a tidal wave when
you're tired of waking up ♪

913
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,711
♪ Oh, come on,
bring the rain ♪

914
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:20,347
- And to be crystal
clear when we do.

915
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:33,912
- I had a great day.

916
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:36,535
- Me too.

917
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,986
Don't go back to Minnesota.

918
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,713
- I'm not.

919
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,922
Um,

920
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:47,960
the team wants me to
open up a lab in London.

921
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,755
I'd run it.

922
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,345
Triple the size,
triple the staff.

923
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,316
I wanted to tell you earlier,
but you were already so sad.

924
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:02,527
- You want to go?

925
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,323
- Amelia, I accepted.

926
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,117
I am going.

927
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:00,757
Fantastic.
