1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,220
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,809
No, hey, no, no, no.
Stop. [ Laughs ] Stop.

3
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:09,466
<i>One of the more harrowing parts</i>

4
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:11,364
<i>of complex heart surgeries</i>

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,883
<i>is the moment we
wean the patient</i>

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,541
<i>off the cardiopulmonary
bypass machine.</i>

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,165
Oh, Lucas!

8
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:21,719
<i>We start slowly
warming the patient.</i>

9
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:23,257
- You're up early.
- Couldn't sleep.

10
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:28,312
<i>As the patient's
temperature rises...</i>

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,865
<i>we check to make
sure all of the air</i>

12
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,247
<i>has been removed from the heart.</i>

13
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:33,800
Good morning!

14
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,768
- Hey.
- Morning.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,253
Coffee for the road?

16
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:40,152
- Mm.
- You can bring it back tonight.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,912
Thank you.

18
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:45,778
Anybody want a weed whacker?

19
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,436
The house on the corner's giving
away a bunch of stuff for free.

20
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,645
Oh, I'm gonna be late,
but I'll see you tonight.

21
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,339
- Bye!
- Bye.

22
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:57,410
She took my mug.

23
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,188
Apparently, she'll
bring it back. Tonight.

24
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,954
I found some good
bridesmaid dress options.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,174
If you're looking.

26
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,592
Those dresses
belong in a museum.

27
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:04,762
They're free. And go away.

28
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:07,458
You think that I
could officiate?

29
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:09,353
'Cause I've always
wanted to do that.

30
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,597
I barely know you.

31
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:13,771
Oh, I'm sorry, are
<i>you</i> gonna do it?

32
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,301
Trey and I still have
a lot to figure out.

33
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,947
Yes! I'm in the mix.

34
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,225
<i>Once the aortic
cross-clamp is removed,</i>

35
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:22,401
<i>all eyes are on the heart
for that moment of truth.</i>

36
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,919
<i>Will it start to beat?</i>

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,578
Hey, can I borrow a shirt?

38
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,073
I need to bring some
more clothes over here.

39
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:30,478
Uh, help yourself.

40
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:31,996
Thank you.

41
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,378
You know, I'm gonna
go make breakfast.

42
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,830
Uh, meant to tell you... We
are out of the good granola.

43
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,142
Really? I just bought some.

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,729
I know. Been on a yogurt kick.

45
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,075
I'll get some more.

46
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,905
Oh, is that Kai?

47
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:45,572
Will you tell them I said hi?
When are they coming back here?

48
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:47,195
I've got this documentary
I want to show them.

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,899
Yeah, can I talk about
this a little later?

50
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,577
Yeah. Um, they're about
to go into a meeting,

51
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:51,395
so I just... I've gotta...
No, of course, of course.

52
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,052
To be continued.

53
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:59,576
Oh, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

54
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,096
I didn't know anyone was
here, um, doing this.

55
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,685
Morning, baby. Meet Taya.

56
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:10,000
Taya is Seattle's most highly
regarded Reiki practitioner.

57
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:12,347
R-Reiki. Uh, of... of course.

58
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:15,350
Reiki, you know, it's an
energy healing technique.

59
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:20,355
It clears the mind, promotes
relaxation, improves focus.

60
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,668
I thought I'd give it a try
before my surgery today.

61
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,577
- You want to go next?
- Uh, no, no, thank you.

62
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:26,161
I was just, uh, looking
for my raincoat.

63
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,191
It's in the hall closet.

64
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:36,302
And it's not like my
workload has just evaporated.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
My paperwork has
doubled with the clinic.

66
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,894
Oh, please complain more about
data entry to a chief resident.

67
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:44,276
You want to make it a contest?
Because I work two jobs,

68
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,805
I moonlight in general,
plus I'm a mom.

69
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,140
That's like four jobs.

70
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,519
Well, I feel like I have seven.

71
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm having recurring dreams

72
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,973
about intern
rotation assignments

73
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,872
when I should be dreaming
about... hot nurse.

74
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,874
What? Hot.

75
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:58,324
Nurse. Hot. What?

76
00:02:58,462 --> 00:02:59,853
Carlos. Oh, wait,
quick. Hide... Hide me.

77
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,465
Oh, my God. What is
happening right now?

78
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:05,573
Carlos and I had
a-an interaction

79
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,575
at the intern house party.

80
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:09,162
A quality interaction?

81
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:12,338
Very high quality, yes.

82
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:15,548
And afterwards, he
gave me his number.

83
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:17,240
So, what's the problem?

84
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:18,689
He thinks I'm cool.

85
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:21,105
So? Look at me.

86
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,418
Okay, well, just take
off the bike helmet.

87
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:24,730
Okay.

88
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,494
- I'll tell you when he's gone.
- Oh, gosh.

89
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,646
Hey, have you assigned
someone to supervise me today?

90
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,270
Right, I knew I was
forgetting something.

91
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,718
I have to got to
look at microscopes

92
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,582
and then a compliance
meeting, whatever that is,

93
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,687
so somewhere between that
and the hundred other things

94
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,093
I have to do, uh, I will
get you a supervisor.

95
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,370
Do that first. Owen, I-I...

96
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:47,200
I called the medical commission.

97
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,661
- And said what?
- I asked them for an appeal,

98
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,100
and they granted me one.

99
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,284
They're sending a preceptor.

100
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,588
He will assess
me, and if I pass,

101
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,932
they will temporarily
reinstate my license.

102
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,256
You just decided that? You
didn't even talk to me about it?

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,143
You and I are broken.
You know it, I know it.

104
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,111
I'm pretty sure the
entire hospital knows it.

105
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,871
If I can practice
medicine again,

106
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,598
maybe we can stop
resenting each other.

107
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,231
Alright, when are they
coming to assess you?

108
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,636
Today. He's
downstairs right now.

109
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:11,777
So, about the supervisor.

110
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:15,332
Porter's with Ndugu.
Millin's with Dr. Webber.

111
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,921
Griffith and Yasuda,
you're with, uh, Shepherd.

112
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,130
And Massey's on scut.

113
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:21,787
As a gentle reminder,

114
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:25,100
I will be in the OR
today with the Dr. Fox,

115
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:28,103
so do not page me, call
me, or attempt to find me.

116
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,795
Uh, what if our
patient is dying?

117
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,281
Take that attitude and
channel it into saving them.

118
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,078
Move.

119
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,391
I've come to return my interns.

120
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,954
Pretty sure there's
a no-return policy.

121
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,808
All my surgeries
have been canceled.

122
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:44,786
Only thing they'd be learning is
how to be the viper of Seattle.

123
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,192
Well, I see that a possible
teaching opportunity...

124
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,678
- Where do you want us?
- Look, just give me a second.

125
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,162
Dr. Schmitt, we're late.

126
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,646
Oh, I'm... I'm so
sorry, Dr. Fox.

127
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,200
I just need to
reassign these interns.

128
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,341
Who wants to come fix a penis?

129
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,790
Totally. I'm in.

130
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,608
Consider them reassigned.
Let's go, fellas.

131
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:02,759
Let's go.

132
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:09,800
Uh, Natalia Asaki, 32, post-op
day two from right craniotomy

133
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:12,113
for resection of a
metastatic lesion

134
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,357
from the primary
esophageal carcinoma.

135
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,635
Well, your incision is
healing well, Natalia.

136
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:18,257
No sign of infection.

137
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:20,155
Will I be able to travel soon?

138
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,710
Honey, you just
had brain surgery.

139
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,263
Let's not rush anything, okay?

140
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,852
Our friends chipped in

141
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,475
to give us a divorce-honeymoon.

142
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:33,514
We want to go to Europe
to see the sunsets.

143
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:35,861
Sunset is Natalia's
favorite time of the day.

144
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:40,348
Mm. It's the magical hour when
the sky becomes a painting.

145
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:43,075
My wife and I took a
spectacular trip recently,

146
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:46,078
and yes, it really
does feed the soul.

147
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,667
See? Our trip is
doctor-recommended.

148
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,257
When can we book our
plane ticket, Dr. Webber?

149
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,259
Well, we need to get
a PET scan first.

150
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,813
And then we'll
re-stage the cancer,

151
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,642
and we'll go from there.

152
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,850
Thank you.

153
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,233
Venice first.

154
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,166
If there's gelato, I'll
follow you anywhere.

155
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,409
Yes.

156
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,930
Barbara Collins, 45,

157
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,863
presents with double
vision and headaches.

158
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,348
A CT revealed a tumor in the
center region of the brain.

159
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,178
Today, we will do
a trans-ventricular

160
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:18,938
endoscopic approach
to resect it.

161
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,778
And once removed, we'll
send it to pathology

162
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:24,530
to determine if the mass
is benign or cancerous.

163
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,395
And there it is. Our baby
sister finally has cancer.

164
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,017
Took you long enough.

165
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,193
Dr. Shepherd, meet my
sisters, Didi and Paula.

166
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,610
They flew in from Boston last
night to offer their... support.

167
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,785
We never miss a
cancer diagnosis.

168
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,925
We don't know for sure
that it is cancer.

169
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,343
I'll need to obtain
tissue first.

170
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,791
She has it. We've all had it.

171
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,518
I had breast cancer,
Carol had skin cancer,

172
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,554
and Paula had butt cancer.

173
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,187
We all get it, and then
we make the best of it.

174
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,523
That's right. Yeah.

175
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,559
Barbara, you can finally
come to cancer camp.

176
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,941
We go every year
with our chemo girls,

177
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,194
but this one never
could because...

178
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,530
- No cancer.
- No cancer.

179
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,223
Oh, I forgot. I
brought champagne.

180
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,535
Huh?

181
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,054
Our mother was
fertile for 40 years,

182
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,401
and she finally gave up
sex when Barbara was born.

183
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,820
Is your other sister on her way?

184
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:13,130
Carol? No. She's, uh...

185
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,443
Oh, no. Ladies,

186
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:16,755
meet Carol.

187
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:19,689
She died 15 years ago.

188
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:22,277
Well, she kicked the cancer,
but then she fell off a ladder.

189
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:24,383
She was always the clumsy one.

190
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:25,660
Your sister's in that box?

191
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:27,110
- Yeah.
- Yep.

192
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,594
Well, we take her everywhere.

193
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,216
She loved meeting new people.

194
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:31,632
Yeah.

195
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,772
It's nice... nice to meet you.

196
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,465
- Aww.
- See, that's nice.

197
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:38,915
Good for you.

198
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,053
Yeah.

199
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,964
Oh. Bailey. Hey. Look,
I want to apologize

200
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:56,829
for Owen and I fighting in
front of you and Ben at dinner.

201
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,555
Cappuccino?

202
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,801
Fine.

203
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,493
Honestly, your pie
was the first thing

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,564
that Owen and I
agreed on in months.

205
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:10,705
I mean, the best pie ever.
The most tender crust,

206
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,121
and the filling was
sweet, but not too sweet.

207
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,330
I mean, what is your secret?

208
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:18,368
You know, you're my boss now.
You don't have to butter me up.

209
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:21,198
No, I dreamt about
your pie, truly.

210
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:24,754
You can just ask for what
you want, Dr. Altman.

211
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:28,620
Owen is being evaluated by
the medical commission today,

212
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,001
and he's trying really
hard to fix this,

213
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,969
and if anything goes wrong,

214
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:35,419
he can't be reevaluated
for another six months.

215
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,918
I'm still waiting
for the question.

216
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,871
Would you supervise
him, please? No.

217
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,332
What happened to I'm your boss
and I can ask for what I want?

218
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,462
Doesn't mean I have
to say yes. I'm busy.

219
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,326
And I'm rooting for him.

220
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,741
Mm.

221
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,709
Okay.

222
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,404
Link.

223
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,164
What are you doing right now?

224
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,374
Gerald Lien, age 60,

225
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,894
a history of increasingly
painful, curved erections

226
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:05,380
that led to a diagnosis
of Peyronie's disease.

227
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,072
Okay, so who can tell me

228
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,833
the pathophysiology
of this disease?

229
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,248
It's an inflammatory condition

230
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,836
that can cause a
bend in the penis,

231
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,711
and it's thought to be
caused from repeated injuries

232
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:17,530
due to athletics,
accidents, or sex.

233
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,948
Correct. Okay, let's
go meet Gerald.

234
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,605
Gerald.

235
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:25,262
So nice to see you again.

236
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,197
This is Dr. Schmitt,
Dr. Kwan, and Dr. Adams.

237
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,268
They're gonna be
assisting me today.

238
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:33,443
Gerald first came to me
about six months ago,

239
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,410
when his symptoms first started,

240
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,147
and we weren't able
to help him surgically

241
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:40,312
because we needed to wait until
the progression stabilized

242
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,565
and there was no
further curvature.

243
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,177
You had to wait six months?

244
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,421
Uh, sorry. Please just fix it.

245
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,252
You can fix it, right? So I
can stop avoiding my wife?

246
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,048
Today, Dr. Fox will resect
the plaques that have built up

247
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:55,568
and then place a xenograft
to repair the damage.

248
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,468
Gerald, are you sure there
isn't anyone you want to call

249
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,850
and let them know you're
having surgery today?

250
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:04,060
My wife and our friends think
I'm at a conference right now,

251
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:06,649
where, in about three hours,
I'm gonna pull a muscle,

252
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,765
which will require me to be
in bed for a couple days.

253
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,239
Understood. Alright,
Schmitt, Kwan, Adams,

254
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,448
let's go and study
his penile ultrasound,

255
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,588
and I will see you in the O.R.

256
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:16,935
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

257
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,018
I'll need her latest
scans so we can go over

258
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,423
my approach and positioning...

259
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,839
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd?
Didi and I were wondering

260
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:27,017
if you could tell us where
we could get some coffee.

261
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,809
Uh... Uh, there's a
cafeteria downstairs,

262
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,259
or Dr. Yasuda could grab
some from the lounge.

263
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,581
- Oh, that would be great.
- Oh.

264
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:34,400
Sure. Two coffees,
coming right up.

265
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:36,023
Actually, three.

266
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,094
Uh, and Carol takes hers
with cream and sugar.

267
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,405
She always had a sweet tooth.

268
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:41,821
Okay. Sure.

269
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,271
Thank you, Dr. Yasuda.

270
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,273
Mm-hmm.

271
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,965
How do I get coffee
for a dead person?

272
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:48,829
Same way you get coffee
for a living person.

273
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,900
Pour it in a cup.

274
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,523
You worried she'll get mad at
you if you screw up her order?

275
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,944
It looks like a... Boomerang.

276
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:03,567
- How does he pee?
- Sideways?

277
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,155
As you can see, the
ultrasound shows

278
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,330
a build-up of fibrous plaques,

279
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,850
and these plaques can
contain calcifications

280
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:11,388
or completely ossify,
which means...

281
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,301
The tissue can turn to bone.

282
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,719
Correct. It's worth noting
this is not an ortho case.

283
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:18,721
It's very complex.

284
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:23,898
So be sure to carefully
review the ultrasound studies.

285
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:27,177
Be extremely prepared.
Then get him up to pre-op.

286
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:34,633
So, he's got bone...

287
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,808
In his bone.

288
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,119
Nope.

289
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,055
Penile surgery can
be bloody and messy,

290
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,575
and if anything goes wrong,
this man's erectile function

291
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:46,828
will be permanently impaired.

292
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:49,027
So, let's hear 'em.

293
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:51,270
All of 'em, right now.

294
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,514
Get your jokes out now.

295
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,103
Not one more after you set
foot outside that door.

296
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,961
Captain Hook. Gargoyle
gherkin. Bendy straw.

297
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,488
Get back to work.

298
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,599
Today, I'll be assessing
your clinical skills,

299
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:12,119
bedside manner, - and diagnostic knowledge.
- Yeah.

300
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:13,706
I want you to
pretend I'm not here.

301
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,363
Do everything like
you normally would.

302
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,228
Yeah. Mr. Williams,
I am Dr. Hunt.

303
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,954
I am here to take
a look at that cut.

304
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,898
- Can you tell me how it happened?
- What's he doing here?

305
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,313
Oh, sorry, I should
have introduced myself.

306
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:24,337
I'm Dr. Lincoln.

307
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,236
You... You killed the Tank.

308
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:27,489
Mnh-mnh. I don't
want him touching me.

309
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,584
Dr. Lincoln is an
excellent surgeon,

310
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:30,907
but he is just here
to observe today.

311
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,795
Observe what?

312
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,383
Wh... Well, I am in a
probationary period.

313
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,154
Not because of any
malpractice or anything,

314
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:39,077
more bureaucratic stuff.

315
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,365
I assure you, I am a fully
board certified trauma surgeon,

316
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,944
more than capable of sewing
up a small head laceration.

317
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,256
So, when you're ready...

318
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,776
I'll wait for another
doctor. Not you.

319
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,985
Mr. Williams, I really
need to close that up

320
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,273
before it becomes
infected, so...

321
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,885
Mm, I'll take my chances.

322
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,474
Alright.

323
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,235
So, the PET scan
won't take long.

324
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,109
You can go back to planning
your trip once we're finished.

325
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,135
Our first stop is the island

326
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,656
where Monet painted "San
Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk."

327
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:10,660
He's one of my
favorite painters.

328
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:12,707
Do you have a favorite
place in Europe, Dr. Millin?

329
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,284
I have never been,

330
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,883
but I've always wanted
to go to Paris someday.

331
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,287
Ooh!

332
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:20,256
She has a case of the somedays.

333
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,189
The what? Natalia always says

334
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:23,846
that there are seven
days in a week,

335
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,469
and someday isn't one of them.

336
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:29,817
When you live in
"someday," you waste today.

337
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:32,071
I had a real bad case until I met
her. She knocked it out of me.

338
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,477
The last time he used
the word "someday,"

339
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,513
I made him sleep
in the guest room.

340
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:39,171
Also known as the porch. She
made me sleep on the porch.

341
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,453
Oh, God, she's bleeding!
Hey, Natalia, hey.

342
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,872
I need suction and a crash
cart, and page Dr. Webber! Now!

343
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,010
It's okay. Hey,
hey. Hey, hey, hey.

344
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,188
Into this. Can you breathe?

345
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,724
You know Peyronie's disease
is actually really common?

346
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:03,402
Affects 1 in 11 men.

347
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,335
Worried you got a
kink in the hose?

348
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,510
If you bring that hyena
home again tonight,

349
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:08,891
I am sleeping in my van.

350
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,168
How is that a threat?

351
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,963
Her name is Cara.

352
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,241
Yeah, Cara from
internal medicine.

353
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,701
Did she wear her
stethoscope in bed?

354
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,554
What does that even mean?

355
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,429
Is she why you're worried
you have Peyronie's disease?

356
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:21,013
- You're worried about Peyronie's?
- No.

357
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,501
I don't trust anyone
who doesn't cut.

358
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,872
You know, maybe I'm not
interested in "trusting" her.

359
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,185
The people need sleep!

360
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,741
Are you kidding me? I
have to get out of here.

361
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,915
I understand.

362
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:34,330
Seems like it's going well.

363
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,401
That woman is
yelling in his face.

364
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,230
Well, it's not you for once.

365
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:40,439
This is me trying
to be encouraging.

366
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:42,137
It's a UTI.Owen:
You're probably right,

367
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,718
but I need to do a full work-up,

368
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:45,696
just to make sure that
nothing else is going on.

369
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,999
It burns when I pee, and
I have to go all the time.

370
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,932
It's textbook UTI.

371
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,150
Just give me the antibiotics,
and I'll free up a bed.

372
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,498
We can't. I need to take your
vitals and take a urine sample.

373
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:55,765
And how long will that take?

374
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,767
That depends on how
busy the labs are,

375
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,848
but I promise we will get you
out of here as soon as we can.

376
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:02,565
Okay, I'm already missing the
study group for my logic class,

377
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,705
and then I have an econ
paper due at 5:00 p.m.,

378
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:06,338
and my restaurant
shift starts at 7:00.

379
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:07,984
I don't have time for this.

380
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,262
I'll just use my friend's
leftover antibiotics.

381
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,057
No, no, no. I wouldn't
recommend that.

382
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,751
Okay, what's next?

383
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:20,617
We just need to send off
your type and screen,

384
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,378
and then we'll be ready to go.

385
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,966
Okay.

386
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,726
Uh, can I ask you something?

387
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,659
- Now that it's just you and me?
- Of course.

388
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:30,731
If things don't go smoothly in
there, could it be permanent?

389
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,803
There's always the
possibility of tissue damage,

390
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,254
nerve damage, or more
severe erectile dysfunction,

391
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:38,981
but that only happens
in 20% of the cases.

392
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:41,535
And Dr. Fox is excellent.

393
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,399
Oh.

394
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:45,401
My wife's name is Gloria,
but I call her Glow

395
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,025
because she... just glows.

396
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,614
She was a history professor
before she retired.

397
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:55,273
She loves big concerts,
dive restaurants,

398
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:57,240
and the ocean, and
I didn't tell her

399
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,794
because I didn't want
her to feel sorry for me.

400
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,693
Or look at me differently.

401
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,798
So, what if I'm in that 20%?

402
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,491
How long have you been
married? 37 years.

403
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,080
I don't think that your
condition will be permanent,

404
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,392
but your marriage
sounds like it is.

405
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,774
Right.

406
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:16,225
I'll be back in a few minutes
to take you to pre-op.

407
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,058
Right there. Natalia's
esophageal tumor

408
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:24,854
has eroded into the aorta and
the posterior mediastinum.

409
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,098
Tumor's everywhere.

410
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,134
So, her heart's bleeding out.

411
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,825
Essentially, yeah.

412
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,310
Can you resect it?

413
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:33,597
I wouldn't know where to begin.

414
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:36,555
You paged me?

415
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,799
I need a second opinion.

416
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:42,320
Large esophageal mass,

417
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,255
which has eroded into the
aorta and pericardium.

418
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,362
Sorry. Uh, you don't think

419
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,019
a-a descending stent
graft would work?

420
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,227
That won't help her.

421
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,746
Well, so what do we do now?

422
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,680
Nothing. Best thing we can do

423
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:02,029
for Natalia is, uh,
give her pain medication

424
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,893
and help her go peacefully.

425
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,898
How much time do I have?

426
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:10,520
It depends.

427
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:14,559
Could be anywhere
from a few days

428
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,492
to a few hours.

429
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:20,944
I'm so sorry, Natalia.

430
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,912
We'll make sure
you're comfortable.

431
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,707
Whatever you need.

432
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,847
Thank you.

433
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:30,264
When Elliot gets back, we
can walk him through this.

434
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:32,508
We know that these
conversations can be difficult.

435
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:34,165
No.

436
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,892
Just let us plan our trip.

437
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,723
Natalia, your husband
needs to be prepared.

438
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,518
He needs to say goodbye.

439
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,072
No, he doesn't.

440
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,419
He doesn't need that.

441
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,732
We cannot handle that.

442
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,358
Please.

443
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,913
Let us... plan our trip.

444
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:15,594
I talked to Nurse Staci,
and I got the full download.

445
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:17,208
- The full download?
- Yeah. Carlos.

446
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,106
Okay, dogs, not cats.

447
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,833
Star Trek, not Star
Wars. That's good, right?

448
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,731
And then, oh, he went
to Costa Rica last year

449
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,423
just to see the sloths.

450
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,735
- Isn't that so cute?
- This is stalking.

451
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,152
I really don't want to be
implicated in a stalking case.

452
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,090
Listen, you and Nico
broke up over a year ago.

453
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,225
- I have surgery.
- Oh, my God.

454
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,227
Will you just talk to
him? It's not a big deal.

455
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,263
No. I am not you.

456
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,645
Why is it that every time
someone like me feels insecure,

457
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,061
a very good-looking,
charming person is like,

458
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,063
"Just do it. It's
not a big deal.

459
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,065
It's fun. It'll be easy"?

460
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:48,791
Oh, and he hates vampire shows!

461
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,795
I know you're
scared of vampires.

462
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,314
So, you got kids?

463
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,868
Yes.

464
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,973
- Okay, what do we got?
- Edgar Reyes, 38,

465
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:01,528
MVC, unrestrained driver with
blunt trauma to the chest.

466
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,323
Got diminished breath
sounds bilaterally,

467
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,565
satting at 80%.

468
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:06,533
BP is 95/40.

469
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,131
Intubated and needle
decompressions done in the field.

470
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,467
You ready? On my count.

471
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,090
1, 2, 3, let's go.

472
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,747
Okay, let's bring in the X-ray.

473
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,369
Okay, sats are dropping.

474
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,855
I'm seeing extensive
subcutaneous emphysema.

475
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,098
Plate's already in.

476
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,272
Alright, here we go.

477
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:24,551
Damn it. Deviated trachea.

478
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,249
I can't make out if
there's a hemothorax

479
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:29,314
with all the air in the tissue.

480
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,523
Okay, there's no oxygen
getting to his lungs.

481
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,467
Systolic's falling. We
should call for bronchoscopy.

482
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,434
He'll be dead by then, especially
if he has a ruptured airway.

483
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,564
Get me a 10-blade,
gloves, and betadine.

484
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,128
- What the hell are you doing?
- He might have a tracheal injury.

485
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:42,258
We need to do something
before he codes.

486
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:44,812
So wait for the bronchoscopy
so you don't go in blind.

487
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,677
We don't have time for me to
check all those boxes, okay?

488
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:49,472
Somebody page Dr. Ndugu!

489
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:56,307
Who can tell me why I
am injecting the penis

490
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,552
with papaverine to
induce an erection?

491
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,141
Hello?

492
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,936
The penis must be erect...

493
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:06,954
In order to place the
correct anatomic markings.

494
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,216
Correct. 15-blade.

495
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:11,218
Dr. Kwan, should I
make the incision

496
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:13,634
on the long or short
side of the curvature?

497
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:16,534
Short side.

498
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,673
Correct.

499
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:20,572
Here we go.

500
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,091
Oh, nice blood flow.

501
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,679
Suction, Kwan.

502
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:26,751
Kwan.

503
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,097
Blue? Kwan.

504
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,926
Blue.

505
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,490
I would have bet my
money on the other one.

506
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:32,584
Oh, crap.

507
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,896
Eyes on the field, Schmitt.

508
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,726
Someone get that intern
off my O.R. floor.

509
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,107
Adams, get him out of here.

510
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:39,360
If I leave, can I come back?

511
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,524
Now!

512
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,888
So, there's a chance I
won't remember anything

513
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,632
- when I wake up?
- Well, there is a chance,

514
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,226
but I'm very, very
good at my job.

515
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:55,885
Oh, don't worry,
honey, you'll be fine.

516
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,368
The doctors told Paula

517
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,266
she'd never be able
to eat spicy food.

518
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:01,475
And I eat hot sauce
on my eggs every day.

519
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:04,064
And remember when they forgot
to give Didi her nipple?

520
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:05,721
Who needs two nipples?

521
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,068
Yeah, see, there. - It all works out.
- You know what?

522
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:09,942
We really need to get her
into the operating room.

523
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:12,366
Her pulse is thready. But I will
update you as soon as I can.

524
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,557
Okay. Mwah. We'll
be waiting for you.

525
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,248
Yeah, all three of us.

526
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:17,802
What's wrong with my pulse?

527
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,459
Nothing. It's perfect.

528
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:22,393
But sometimes, we
need our space.

529
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,465
You're right. You are
very good at your job.

530
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:28,191
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Pathology, extension 2479.</i>

531
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,780
<i>Pathology, extension 2479.</i>

532
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:40,549
Mr. Asaki, is
everything alright?

533
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:45,416
Natalia sent me to
get hot chocolate.

534
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,865
She only does that
when she knows

535
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:48,798
that things are gonna get worse.

536
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:50,455
It's her tell.

537
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,324
Coughing up blood is not
a sign of recovery, is it?

538
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:00,362
There are always
unforeseen complications

539
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,503
with any kind of cancer.

540
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,781
Is she dying?

541
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,438
This is really a conversation

542
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,474
you should be having
with your wife.

543
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,653
Do we at least have a month?

544
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,036
A week?

545
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:25,283
Do I have today?

546
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,671
I just need a minute.

547
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,674
I don't want her to
see me like this.

548
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,986
I don't want to cause
her any more pain.

549
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,241
Oxygen saturation
still dropping, Hunt.

550
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,553
It's at 62%.

551
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,693
Tube's in. Ambu bag.

552
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:58,040
We had to do the clamshell
to get a better visualization

553
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,697
of the tracheal repair.

554
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,561
Okay. Sats are rising.

555
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:03,183
Oh, wow. Okay.

556
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:04,771
Patient is
hemodynamically unstable.

557
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:08,084
He needs an exploration and
a definitive tracheal repair.

558
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,741
Alright. Okay. Let's go.

559
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:28,006
Woman over P.A.: <i>Dr. Erica
Newton to Trauma 2.</i>

560
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:29,692
<i>Dr. Newton to Trauma 2.</i>

561
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,982
Dr. Millin? Are you alright?

562
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,606
We're Natalia's doctors,

563
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:50,092
and she is dying, and we are
standing here doing nothing.

564
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,725
You gave her pain meds.
That's not nothing.

565
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:53,889
She trusted us.

566
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:56,926
We should be doing everything we
can think of to fix her heart.

567
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:59,204
I mean, isn't that what you
would want if it were you?

568
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:01,413
Or your wife?

569
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:04,520
I wanted to become a surgeon
because we heal people.

570
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:07,316
You don't just prescribe them
medicine and wait to see if it works.

571
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:09,536
You wheel them to the O.R.,
and then you open them up,

572
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,182
and then you fix them.

573
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,842
That's our job. And right
now, we are failing.

574
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,292
We are failing Natalia,
and we are failing Elliot,

575
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,294
and I don't know
what to do with that.

576
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,267
The worst part of this job
is the powerlessness you feel

577
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:29,303
when you know there
is nothing you can do.

578
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:32,514
Yes, we could take
her back to the O.R.,

579
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:35,482
but all we would be doing
is killing her faster.

580
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:41,868
The best surgeons, the best,

581
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,526
learn how to live with the
worst part of this job.

582
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:02,404
Ready?

583
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,993
Ready.

584
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,168
Wait. If I die... Barbara...

585
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,826
If Carol can die from putting
up Super Bowl decorations,

586
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:11,000
I can die from brain surgery.

587
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:14,832
If I die, do not let
them carry me in a box.

588
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,628
I don't care. Let them
throw me out the car window.

589
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:19,837
Okay.

590
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,536
<i>Dr. Seip to oncology.
Dr. Seip, report to oncology.</i>

591
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:36,543
Where's your preceptor?

592
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:38,372
Gone. He said he
had what he needed.

593
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,099
Ha. Yeah, was that
before or after

594
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:45,587
you did an intracavitary
intubation in the E.R.?

595
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:48,831
You know what, Bailey?

596
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:51,247
I thrive on order and
protocol. I'm a solider.

597
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,835
The chain of command
is in my bones,

598
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:55,493
but I also know when to break
the rules to save the patient.

599
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:56,908
My license wasn't suspended

600
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:58,437
because of my ability
to practice medicine.

601
00:25:58,461 --> 00:25:59,601
It was suspended because

602
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,017
I fundamentally
disagreed with the law,

603
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:03,950
because I did what
I thought was right.

604
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,676
I want to get my license back,

605
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,919
and of course I want to
fix things with Teddy,

606
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:10,726
but if I had done anything differently
today, that patient would be dead.

607
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,349
I did what I thought was right, and I don't
know how to do this job any other way.

608
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,065
Hey, none of those
words you just said

609
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,930
is a thing that your wife
or any of us don't know.

610
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,243
Have you tried apologizing

611
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:24,108
for all of the things
that you got wrong

612
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:27,732
instead of constantly defending
the things you got right?

613
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,393
<i>Dr. Andorka to the NICU.</i>

614
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,224
<i>Dr. Mary Andorka to the NICU.</i>

615
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,264
Is he in a lot of pain?

616
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:43,921
I'm sorry. And... And you are?

617
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,958
Gloria. Glow. Gerald's wife.

618
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,271
Oh, I wasn't aware
that he had called you.

619
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,584
He didn't. He has
no idea I am here.

620
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,276
I've... I've known all along.

621
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,002
He doesn't seem to remember

622
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,738
that I handle all of
our insurance payments.

623
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,522
You never said anything to him?

624
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,835
I thought I should wait until
he was ready to tell me.

625
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,493
And then months went
by, and he didn't,

626
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:06,598
and I respect that.

627
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:10,188
I respect his pride
enough to pretend.

628
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:12,777
Well, the surgery
turned out beautifully.

629
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:14,296
Thank you.

630
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,298
Oh, you don't want
to stay? See him?

631
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:19,819
I just needed to know that
he was going to be okay.

632
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,475
I'll wait for his call.

633
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,101

because you passed out.

692
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:18,171

looks, by the way...

694
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,094
And, uh, babysit you.

695
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:23,441
The way I see it, you owe me.

696
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,100
Fine. I will do your
progress notes for a week.

697
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:31,484
Two weeks.

698
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,382
What?

699
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,109
Nothing. Just, uh,
sizing up the competition

700
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,387
and liking my odds.

701
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,976
Shut up.

702
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:50,426
Did you get all the tumor out?

703
00:31:50,537 --> 00:31:53,230
I did. And the pathology
report came back.

704
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:56,302
It was a colloid cyst.
Your tumor is benign.

705
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,822
- Say it again?
- Barbara doesn't have cancer.

706
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,588
Oh, don't worry.
You'll get it.

707
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,314
You still got time, huh?

708
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,419
Yeah, you'll probably get
breast cancer like me,

709
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,915
and then you can do a tummy tuck
when they do the mastectomy.

710
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,389
I don't want cancer!

711
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:19,981
And no matter what you say,
or how positively you say it,

712
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,949
having cancer is not fun.

713
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:24,778
Didi, you were
exhausted all the time,

714
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,377
and I know you hated
losing your hair.

715
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:28,092
You love your hair.

716
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,405
And, Paula, I hated watching
you throw up all the time

717
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:32,165
and then boast about
how skinny you were.

718
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,064
I hate everything about cancer.

719
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,135
I don't want it,
I've never wanted it,

720
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:39,069
and you need to stop making me
feel guilty for being healthy.

721
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,175
I love you both so much,

722
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:44,488
and I love that
you somehow turned

723
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:47,732
the most horrible disease
that can happen to us

724
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,700
into something positive.

725
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,462
But I still don't want it.

726
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:00,597
And you have to stop carrying
our dead sister around in a box.

727
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,989
That is very weird.

728
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:04,991
It is.

729
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:09,685
We stay positive because,

730
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,654
the truth is, it's the only
way we can deal with it, right?

731
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,657
But you're right.
Cancer sucks.

732
00:33:15,795 --> 00:33:17,314
I hate cancer, too.

733
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,867
And while we're
telling the truth,

734
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,697
there's something
else you need to know.

735
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:25,494
That's not Carol. I left
her in Reno in 2007.

736
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,428
We've been carrying around
cat litter for 15 years.

737
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,541
No. Stop it.

738
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:40,544
Cat litter. Stop it.

739
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:41,821
Stop it.

740
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,415
I heard what happened.

741
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:50,726
I'm sorry.

742
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,662
I am sorry that I made decisions
that affected your life,

743
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,664
my life, and the
life of our kids.

744
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,495
I'm sorry that we
had to flee to L.A.

745
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:03,981
I'm sorry that I couldn't
bring myself to face it

746
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,269
or even talk about it with you,

747
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,365
all the while you
supported our family.

748
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:10,436
I'm sorry that my surfing
partner was attractive.

749
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:13,232
You were right. I distracted
myself with her attentions,

750
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,170
and then I pretended
like I wasn't doing that.

751
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:17,926
I am sorry.

752
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:20,066
I'm sorry for everything.

753
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:25,071
Wait, stop. It, um...

754
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,556
It's my turn.

755
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:29,420
I'm... I'm also sorry.

756
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:33,217
I'm... I'm sorry that
I wasn't as supportive

757
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:34,919
as I could have been
when you were struggling

758
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:36,623
with the possibility
of losing your career.

759
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:38,774
I'm sorry that instead
of talking to you,

760
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,949
I chose to drink.

761
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,985
I'm sorry that
instead of accepting

762
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,987
that we are all
less than perfect,

763
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,644
I chose to lash
out, and I'm sorry,

764
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:49,130
because I know that
nothing you have ever done

765
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:52,754
was meant to hurt me
or the kids or you

766
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:55,308
or... or our somewhat
chaotic life.

767
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:59,381
You did it because you believed
it was right. And I love you.

768
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,590
I always have,
and I always will.

769
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,870
Also, um, Dr. Patel called.

770
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:10,496
And, um, you passed.

771
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:13,464
And I would really love
it if you would return

772
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:15,777
to chief of trauma
effective immediately.

773
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:20,471
Congratulations.

774
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:21,955
I would kiss you, but I'm chief,

775
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,061
and people can see
through the window.

776
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,687
Did you never examine penises

777
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:31,137
in the Caribbean?

778
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:33,035
What about your
urology rotation?

779
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,521
Once again, it's
not about the penis.

780
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:38,420
I didn't expect that amount
of blood in the field

781
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:39,870
and forgot to eat breakfast.

782
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:42,355
I saw you eat a
bagel and a sandwich.

783
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,955
I don't want to talk about it.

784
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,740
Natalia died.

785
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,850
I'm sorry.

786
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,576

- No.
- He passed out in surgery...

want to talk about this."

792

793
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:24,294
No, no. Just had a long day.

794
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,952

any sleep last night.
