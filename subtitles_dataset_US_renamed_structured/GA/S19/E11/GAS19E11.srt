that out just a little bit here.

Ah. So, I'm

111
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,635
And I'm thrilled to
welcome you to Grey-Sloan

112
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,913
as our inaugural class

113
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:18,503
of out-of-state OB/GYN
reproductive healthcare

114
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,633
and advocacy fellows.

115
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:25,171
You have traveled
from Idaho, Arkansas,

116
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:27,819
Texas, even Tennessee
to be with us.

117
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:31,284
And I know you'd rather be
getting this clinical experience

118
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,759
in your own residency programs,

119
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:39,317
but we are honored to offer
this rotation in abortion care.

120
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:42,251
Because how else are you
going to learn, right?

121
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,943
You've all chosen OB/GYN
as your specialty,

122
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,257
and now your respective
states are restricting

123
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,017
how you practice that specialty.

124
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,715
But we are here to make sure you
get the education that you need.

125
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:54,573
I'm sorry. I'm
Dr. Addison Montgomery.

126
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,911
And I've been to
some of your states.

127
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,214
I've seen the desperation.

128
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,931
I've seen the pain,
seen the heartbreak.

129
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,449
I've seen lives lost.

130
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,148
So, anyway, who's
ready to get to work?

131
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,269
Come with me.
- This is Dr. Jo Wilson. - Woman: Hey.

132
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,736
How come we don't get to work
directly with Montgomery?

133
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,364
We did. We made sex-ed videos.

134
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,322
Yeah, that was before
she was a rock star.

135
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:21,349
Did you see the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> story about her?

136
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,920
It's our hospital.
It's not right.

137
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,510
Well, neither is having
to go to another state

138
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,030
to get fully trained
in your specialty.

139
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:28,056
I'm just saying we
are five feet away.

140
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,359
We could join them.

141
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:33,992
Jessica Hall, 22.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

142
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,010
Has been waiting for a
bilateral lung transplant

143
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,522
and is here today...

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,129
Uh...

145
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,899
Uh, sorry. Um...

146
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:46,462
Why is she here? Right.

147
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:49,431
Uh, she's here today for
a single lung transplant

148
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:50,767
from a directed donor.

149
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,297
Are you sure she shouldn't
stay on the list,

150
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,288
hold out for two lungs
rather than the one?

151
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,928
She's been on the list for
two years without matching,

152
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,822
and her condition is worsening.

153
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,731
A single lung will
help prevent her

154
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,908
from deteriorating
into heart failure.

155
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,023
You're just mad RJ's the match.

156
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,276
My boyfriend offers to save
my life over a Sunday dinner,

157
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,683
and she answers by asking

158
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,503
if he's finally
finished his degree.

159
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,685
We were both
feminist-studies majors.

160
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,035
Men only major in
that to meet women.

161
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,735
Go ahead.

162
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,283
Say it. I'm a...

163
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:20,914
You're sexist. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,199
And if he didn't major in
that, we would've never met,

165
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,122
and I wouldn't be
getting a lung today.

166
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,529
Are you? Where is he?

167
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,871
Who's late for surgery?

168
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,750
Surgeons, actually. It
happens all the time.

169
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,156
Uh, maybe not that much.

170
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,641
Well, I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,099
We're not gonna
start without him.

172
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,160
Well, obviously.

173
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,612
Adams, let us know
when he arrives.

174
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,309
When did we reorganize
our triage orders?

175
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,380
And who categorized
our patients this way?

176
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,483
Yeah. That might have been me.

177
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,773
I was running the ER last week,
and they weren't quite right

178
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,740
according to how we do it
upstairs in cardio, so...

179
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,801
Oh, did you check and
see if it was quite right

180
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,696
for us down here in
the trauma department?

181
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,920
Okay. Everyone, listen up.

182
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,303
Just in case there
is any confusion,

183
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,652
I am back as Chief of Trauma.

184
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,900
Do you want to know
what else is back?

185
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,132
The way I used to do things.

186
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:11,803
And I want to return to
our old triage protocols

187
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,007
and revert back to my
old filing systems.

188
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,552
Any questions,
comments, concerns?

189
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,752
Hey. Dr. Ndugu bought
us lunch on Fridays.

190
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,206
Will that continue?

191
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:23,711
Huh! Well...

192
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,208
I'd be happy to let Dr. Ndugu

193
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,027
continue to buy you
all lunch on Fridays.

194
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,393
Okay. Let's
get you into a bed.

195
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:31,579
And we can go over
your medical history.

196
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,268
Chief Bailey.

197
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:38,399
Not Chief anymore,
Marcus. Just Doctor.

198
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,430
Either way, we've got
some protesters outside.

199
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,904
They're trying to
block the entrance.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,037
Oh. Well, there's
always a few.

201
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,581
They're usually peaceful.

202
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,056
Define "peaceful."

203
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:17,579
Millin. Did you page Ndugu?

204
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,157
I thought you were
back running trauma.

205
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,272
It's a blunt trauma to
the chest. So I should...

206
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:24,281
Page cardio, five minutes ago.
Get a chest tray on standby.

207
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,105
Let CT know that we may
need to jump the line.

208
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,220
And let the OR floor know that
we may have a new patient.

209
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:29,245
Right. Thank you.

210
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,411
Okay.

211
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,827
What do we got?

212
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,932
Ryan Jenkins, 24, MVC.

213
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,589
Blunt trauma to the
chest and abdomen.

214
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:38,727
Multiple rib fractures.

215
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,133
Patient's splinting,

216
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,317
and his oxygen saturation's
in the low 90s.

217
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:44,896
Just... I just... just...

218
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:46,548
It's okay. Save
your strength, okay?

219
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,056
Let's get him
inside. Let's go.

220
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,675
Okay. Marni Young?

221
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,184
You're in the right place.

222
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,005
And you're here for
a... medical abortion?

223
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,798
H-How many weeks are you?

224
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:09,207
Oh. 34 and already
very uncomfortable.

225
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,072
I don't want to think
about how 40 weeks feels.

226
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,049
Okay. Uh, well, you know,

227
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:16,431
medical abortions are done
in the first 10 weeks.

228
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,528
And even a surgical abortion is,
um, not gonna happen for you.

229
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,297
No. No, no, no.

230
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:22,703
Okay. It's for me.

231
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,661
I need the
abortion. Six weeks.

232
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,799
Oh, thank God. Oh.

233
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,412
Andra's my support system.

234
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:30,125
We're best friends.
Born two days apart.

235
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,781
Our mamas met in Lamaze class.

236
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,064
Now we're both pregnant,
except I don't want to be.

237
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,470
So here we are.

238
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,739
I brought snacks and
movies and card games.

239
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,184
So we're ready. Great.

240
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,818
All right. We're just gonna
do a quick physical exam.

241
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,178
And then we'll get
you your medication.

242
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:46,495
Any questions?

243
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,532
This clinic kills!

244
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,845
Is
that gonna go on all day?

245
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,261
This clinic kills!
This clinic kills!

246
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,253
<i><i>Hey, Bailey.</i>

247
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,557
Hey. When I call you eight times
in a row, it means pick up.

248
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,620
Sorry. Richard and I are trying
to fix a budget situation.

249
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,574
Well, help me with
my situation first.

250
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,620
- Here. - We have picketers.
<i>- How many?</i>

251
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,268
A lot, and it's my fault.
Uh, they're here for me.

252
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,051
I don't know how they
figured out where I am.

253
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,489
I had to change planes
twice. I didn't take the PRT.

254
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:14,696
My... My locations
are off on my phone.

255
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,688
<i>I...</i> It's not on you, Addie.

256
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,164
Look, um, security wants
us to close the clinic.

257
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:20,935
<i>How long?</i> We
recommend the day.

258
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,651
That... That...
That is dozens...

259
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,222
That's dozens of patients.

260
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,767
There's 100 people
out there right now.

261
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,363
Well, then call
in reinforcements

262
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,528
for crowd control!

263
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,106
What do you want
us to do, Altman?

264
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,438
Crisis protocols are
on the second shelf.

265
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,852
Stay open, call for backup,

266
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,154
<i>and keep me posted.</i>

267
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,886
Got it. Bu... Hey,
keep your ringer on.

268
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:42,923
<i>Yeah.</i>

269
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:46,810
Okay. You heard her.
Call for backup.

270
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,001
Adams still hasn't
uploaded the scans.

271
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,407
Uh, yeah.

272
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:56,807
Well, give it a minute.

273
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:58,868
Maybe the system's
being sluggish.

274
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,619
Or <i>he</i> is.

275
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,217
I'm sorry. I'm... tired.

276
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,355
It's okay.

277
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:06,117
How are you?

278
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,311
Uh... yeah.

279
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,706
I'm good. Good. Busy. Yeah.

280
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,319
I went to pick up
organs in San Francisco,

281
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,271
San Antonio, and Santa
Fe last week, so busy.

282
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,989
No plans for a trip to Boston?

283
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,292
Well, you don't really
plan to pick up organs.

284
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,215
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, I do.

285
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,996
- Have you spoken at all?
- Um, I get a text message

286
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,243
about her getting lost
in the streets of Boston

287
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,000
about, uh... about once a week.

288
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,829
Mm. Those <i>are</i> very
complicated streets.

289
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,289
Yes.

290
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,912
She's overwhelmed. Yeah.

291
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:37,010
If it helps at all, I get
all my updates from Zola.

292
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:41,014
I told her I loved her, and
she pretended not to hear me.

293
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,026
She's complicated.

294
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,259
Yeah.

295
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,089
You make her happy.

296
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,850
Don't give up.

297
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,414
Okay. So I-I dropped off,
uh, Jessica's lab work

298
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,061
and finished her
admission orders.

299
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,269
And the scans?

300
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,547
I-I just uploaded them.

301
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,964
Sorry. I was... I was
dealing with a house thing.

302
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,036
In a few hours, Jessica's gonna
be open on an operating table

303
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,383
with her vital
organs in our hands.

304
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,350
You cannot get distracted
with house things.

305
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,800
Or anything. I-I know.

306
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,639
I-I'm sorry.

307
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:13,633
Uh, the scans are in.

308
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:17,024
Let's, uh... Let's
take a look, shall we?

309
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:18,748
I'm seeing multiple
displaced rib fractures

310
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,697
and a massive hemothorax
on the right side.

311
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:22,845
Once I place the chest
tube, we'll rush him up to CT.

312
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:23,637
Right. Agree.

313
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,003
And then to the OR, depending
on his chest tube output.

314
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,164
He has a bad lung contusion. I'm not
sure how long he'll remain stable.

315
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:30,655
Ryan Jenkins. Our... Our
patient's already in the system.

316
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,949
What? Like he's
been here before?

317
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:33,236
Like he's supposed
to be here today.

318
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,182
Directed lung donor, OR 3.
Recipient's Jessica Hall.

319
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,657
That's Maggie's patient.

320
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:40,685
She's been waiting on a
transplant for almost two years.

321
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,775
Jess... Jess...

322
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,182
Just take... take
my... My lung.

323
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,668
- Take... Just take...
- He's hemorrhaging!

324
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,842
Take it.

325
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,612
O2's dropped to 70s. Damn it.

326
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,822
- Let's get an intubation tray.
- Hang two units of blood.

327
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:56,790
As soon as he's tubed, we're
heading straight to the OR.

328
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:57,928
Here's the blood.

329
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,982
Are you sure it's him?

330
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,534
Can I... Can I see him?

331
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,319
Ryan had his driver's
license on him...

332
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,628
RJ. He goes by RJ.

333
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,290
Either way, it's him.

334
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:13,219
Dr. Hunt, our trauma surgeon,
is prepping him for surgery now.

335
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,211
He needs surgery?
What kind of surgery?

336
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,066
RJ suffered some
injuries to his chest,

337
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,727
and he's lost a significant
amount of blood.

338
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,063
Oh, my God.

339
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,323
His chest... Is it his h-heart?

340
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:24,565
It's his lungs.

341
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,525
- How fast was he driving?
- Are you serious?

342
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,578
Are you really asking
that question right now?

343
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,689
Okay.
Jessica, Jessica.

344
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,441
Okay.

345
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,704
I know this is a lot to take in.

346
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,033
But due to the severity
of RJ's injuries,

347
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,999
he's not going to be able
to donate a lung today.

348
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,543
Or possibly ever.

349
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:50,122
I don't... I don't
care about that.

350
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,942
Jessica. Please get out.

351
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,740
I can't... I can't
listen to you right now.

352
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,767
Please get out, Mom.

353
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,828
And please... please save him.

354
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,046
- Do whatever it takes.
- I'll do everything I can.

355
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,294
Let's, um... Let's
give her a minute.

356
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:16,100
A vaginal ultrasound
helps determine

357
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,230
how far along the pregnancy is.

358
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:21,770
You are counseling the
patient, not persuading, okay?

359
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,418
Offer the facts,
answer questions,

360
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,420
give options, okay?

361
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:27,858
That's the mifepristone.

362
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,445
It'll block your
body's own progesterone

363
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,759
to stop the pregnancy
from growing.

364
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:31,991
After you take that,

365
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,259
we'll start you on
the misoprostol.

366
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,642
If you're not sure, you can take
some time and think about it.

367
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,186
I'm sure. I just
don't like pills.

368
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,624
Okay.

369
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:50,248
I'm two years older than
my mom was when she had me.

370
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,837
She was married, they
lived in a townhome,

371
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:56,038
and when I look back at pictures,
she seems like a grown-up.

372
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,354
But I'm not there yet.

373
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:02,047
I'm still working through the
lasting damage she did to me.

374
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:06,339
So maybe one day I will be
mentally ready to take that on.

375
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,162

She will remain
on the UNOS list,

00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,366
We didn't sleep together.

427
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:23,797
We just... kissed maybe twice.

428
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:27,922
Wow. Uh, I was bluffing.

429
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,535
But now that we're
here, was it good?

430
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,049
Good kissing? I'm engaged.

00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:33,297
Right, right. All right.

432

Trey is a good
guy. He is stable.

433
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,639
He's a grown-up who
pays his bills on time.

434
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,770
And he makes me happy.

435
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,606
Kiss was that good, huh?

436
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,315

439
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,185

00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,975
Okay. - Let me know if you need help.
- Okay.

441
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,991
And I want to let <i>you</i> know how
excellent these trainees are.

442
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,466
They <i>should</i> be.

443
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,976
They were picked from
more than 100 applicants.

444
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:10,817
You know, one of them wrote
that the one silver lining

445
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:13,293
of <i>not</i> being able to get
this training at home

446
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:17,452
is being able to learn from
the great Addison Montgomery.

447
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:20,241
Oh. Well, that's very kind.

448
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,821
No. It's true. You know it is.

449
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,312
You know, we could run
trainings... every month

450
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:29,026
if you want to come back.

451
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:30,191
I don't know.

452
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,366
No. Okay.

453
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:33,253
I know that you're
busy with the clinic

454
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,886
and... and the travel
from Illinois to L.A.

455
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,647
must be just, you know, hard.

456
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,674
And of... of course, um,

457
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,607
visiting your family
takes priority.

458
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,945
But, you know, we'd
love to have you

459
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,016

could squeeze us in.

460
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,143
Oh, my God!

461
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,850
- Oh, my God.
- Hey. Everybody get down.

462
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,115
Down, down.

463
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,117
Okay. You're bleeding.

464
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,781
He's bleed... Oh, my God!

465
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,593
No one goes in or out of the
clinic... not till I have

466
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,358
enough security to
safely evacuate.

467
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,764
Okay. Thanks, Bailey.

468
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:14,783
A brick was thrown through
the window of the clinic?

469
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,583
With "Montgomery
murders" written on it.

470
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,643
- It hit Kwan in the head.
- How bad is it?

471
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,440
Have you read these manuals?

472
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,904
- Cover to cover.
- You know what?

473
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,291
If I had to read giant manuals
for every crisis in Iraq,

474
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,956
I wouldn't have
made it out of Iraq.

475
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,288
Altman, you're supposed to read
them when you're <i>not</i> in a crisis.

476
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:31,846
- When is that exactly?
- Is Kwan okay?

477
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:34,738
He's bleeding, but he
seems to be doing okay.

478
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:36,012
What do the manuals say

479
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,175
about a large-scale
protest at the clinic?

480
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,014
Nothing.

481
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,760
They were written before
Bailey took over the clinic

482
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:44,092
and before the Supreme Court
ruled on <i>Dobbs.</i> Perfect.

483
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,577
Where are you going?

484
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,296
To make sure that no more bricks
are thrown at this hospital.

485
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,791
You're doing it wrong.

486
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,335
Y-You should really
hold your fingers

487
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,188
about 12 inches
away from my face.

488
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,755
Just follow the stupid finger.

489
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,220
Any dizziness? Changes
in your vision?

490
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,071
I'm fine.

491
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,030
Just put the Steri-Strip on
so we can get back to work.

492
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:11,187
I am so, so sorry.

493
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,948
Pretty sure you didn't
throw the brick.

494
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,720
I kind of did.

495
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,232
I-I posted this this
morning on the way here.

496
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,062
I assumed it was
okay. I'm in Seattle.

497
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,122
People believe in
reproductive rights.

498
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,762
I never thought...

499
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,135
People would use it as a road
map to Addison Montgomery?

500
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,610
They threw a brick at us.

501
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:29,759
What do you think
they'll throw next?

502
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:30,612
- Kwan.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:31,641
I feel awful.

504
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,351
I'm gonna resign
from my position.

505
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,764
I mean, they're gonna...
They're gonna fire me

506
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,388
once they find out
about the post anyway.

507
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,792
Just the idea that I could've
endangered the one person

508
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,769
that's given me... any hope
in these last few weeks

509
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,037
makes me sick.

510
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:45,340
But for the first
time in months,

511
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:49,249
today I woke up proud, because
I was joining the fight.

512
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:53,117
We shouldn't have
to hide who we are

513
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,050
in order to practice medicine.

514
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,396
So don't resign.

515
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:59,296
If you do, that
means one less doctor

516
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,012
has made it their
mission to help.

517
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:02,506
And then they win.

518
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,234
Hilum's intact.

519
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:07,580
Lung's shredded.

520
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:11,584
Uh, they want
everyone in the hospital

521
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:12,999
to stay away from the clinic.

522
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:15,312
The ongoing protests
have become violent.

523
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,452
You need to
get back downstairs?

524
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,878
I will as soon as I figure out
where this blood's coming from.

525
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,363
Are you gonna do a
lower lobe resection?

526
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:22,947
If we do that, then
RJ can't be a donor.

527
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:25,184
But that's not the
priority. He's bleeding out.

528
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,231
All right. Okay. What...
What if I use a hilar clamp

529
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:29,705
to temporarily stop the bleeding
and do a wedge resection?

530
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,466
It will preserve
more lung tissue

531
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,789
and could allow him to donate
the other lung at a later time.

532
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:35,377
If you shut off the
circulation from one lung,

533
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,310
- won't his pressure tank?
- Only for a few minutes.

534
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,814
A few minutes could
cost him his life.

535
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,889
Or I could repair
the lung by then.

536
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:44,341
Fine. We got
to move fast, okay?

537
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,766
Griffith, get
ready with suction.

538
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,270
And, Millin, take
over retraction, okay?

539
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:49,553
All right. Clamp.

540
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,212
Do you want me to do it?

541
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:54,876
No. I got it.

542
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,095
All right. Stapler
and lap pads.

543
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,363
Patients are getting restless.

544
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,735
The woman in bed 4 threw
a granola bar back at me,

545
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,453
and I found a trainee
crying in the bathroom.

546
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,744
She's fine, but she's scared.

547
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,122
I think everyone is.

548
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,853
Oh.

549
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,996
Um, team meeting... right now.

550
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,516
Okay. Guys, come. Come, come.

551
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:26,855
Everybody here? Okay.

552
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,975
Um, so, this clinic is named
for my mom, Elena Bailey,

553
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,753
because...

554
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:38,680
When I was, uh, 7, I went with
my mom to the grocery store,

555
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:42,359
and, uh, we got in line
behind a young woman

556
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:45,279
and her fussy baby.

557
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:47,099
Um, for whatever reason,

558
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:49,716
the woman didn't have enough
money to pay her bill,

559
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:51,916
so my mom did.

560
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,221
And later, I asked my
mom, "Do you know her?"

561
00:22:55,339 --> 00:23:00,206
And she said, "I know her enough
to know that she's struggling.

562
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:04,395
And when we can help someone
else going through a tough time,

563
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:05,992
we should."

564
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,700
These are tough times.

565
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:10,452
We are struggling as doctors,

566
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:15,374
as advocates for women's health
and reproductive freedom.

567
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:18,642
We need to help
each other, right?

568
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,532
We need to lift each other up.

569
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:23,302
That's how we get through.

570
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:28,213
Dr. Montgomery has been
on the front line, right?

571
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:29,840
Traveling all over the country.

572
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:33,248
Do you have any advice
for our young doctors?

573
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,419
Excuse me? Someone?
A doctor maybe?

574
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:39,663
Yeah. I think her
water just broke.

575
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:42,691
Oh. Um, you heard her.
Let's go!

576
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,664
Okay.

577
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:57,138
Oh, are those, uh,
Jessica's discharge papers?

578
00:23:57,163 --> 00:24:00,391
Crap. I-I still
need to print them.

579
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,393
Sorry.

580
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:02,764
That's okay.

581
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,576
That's okay.

582
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,292
Meredith left.

583
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,433
I'm aware.

584
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,426
And now I don't know
what I'm even doing here.

585
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:16,188
Hm.

586
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,148
I just... I keep screwing up.

587
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,515
With patients,
with... with papers.

588
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,615
And I-I can't even
pay my gas bill,

589
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,814
and, um...

590
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:34,241
I-I-I want to believe that
I'm here on my own merit,

591
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:38,684
but I keep wondering if I'm
just here because of her

592
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,664
and not because
I'm supposed to be.

593
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,242
Right.

594
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,736
Okay. So... we were supposed

595
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,147
to do a-a directed
donation today.

596
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,299
Our patient fasted.
Our donor fasted.

597
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,705
We were prepped and ready.

598
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:56,800
It was a transplant
surgeon's dream scenario.

599
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:00,364
And then RJ gets hit by a car.

600
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,456
And in a brutal coincidence,

601
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,138
that accident injures
the very organ we need.

602
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:09,608
Yeah. Is this story supposed
to be about me somehow?

603
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,999
I'm saying... the
things you worry about

604
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:17,657
are almost never the things
that really go wrong.

605
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,133
And the things
that do go wrong...

606
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,765
you couldn't have dreamt up.

607
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,791
Your aunt did not accept
you to this program

608
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,810
out of sentimentality.

609
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:30,424
She's too good for
that, and so are you.

610
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:36,479
Get Jessica her
discharge papers, okay?

611
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,264
Yeah.

612
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,964
He...

613
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:51,302
I'm
sorry. I just...

614
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:55,659
needed a breath, and I, uh...

615
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,421
and I can't go outside, so...

616
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,232
Oh.

617
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,088
Um, you know, there's this woman

618
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:04,150
that stands outside the
clinic every Tuesday

619
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,730
with a sign that says,
"Please don't do this."

620
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:12,366
She doesn't, you know, yell
or try to get in the way.

621
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:14,565
Even her sign's polite.

622
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:16,580
And it's still upsetting.

623
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:19,137
I can't even imagine doing
what you're doing out there.

624
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,833
I got a bulletproof vest.

625
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,377
A what? Yeah.

626
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,413
Yeah. Okay.

627
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:27,090
An old O.B. friend of mine
in Texas, uh, suggested it.

628
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:28,703
I thought she was overreacting.

629
00:26:28,728 --> 00:26:33,043
Then I found out her usual
advice is to carry a gun

630
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,366
or hire a bodyguard with a gun.

631
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,851
Clinics are being set on fire.

632
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,326
I know.

633
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,504
You know, staff are having
acid thrown in their face

634
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:43,743
on their way to work.

635
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,375
With the PRT,
they... they just...

636
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,687
They broke one of the windows.

637
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,922
Don't worry. I
had it replaced.

638
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,752
I'm not worried
about the window.

639
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,341
They doxxed me.

640
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,940
All of my information
is online...

641
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:01,002
My home address, my
cellphone number.

642
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:04,306
I got over 500
calls in one night.

643
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:07,130
Then they broke into our garage
and graffitied Jake's car.

644
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:10,193
So now he and Henry are
staying at his sister's,

645
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:12,035
so, you know, mom of the year.

646
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,307
That sounds awful,
and I am so sorry

647
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:16,447
that I suggested that
you go out there...

648
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,891
No, no. Don't you...
Don't be sorry.

649
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,781
I wouldn't have done
anything differently.

650
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,438
I'm not gonna...

651
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:28,509
I'm not gonna
quit. I can't quit.

652
00:27:28,754 --> 00:27:32,240
I mean, patients need
this care, you know?

653
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:34,848
But I-I put my family
in danger. I put...

654
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:36,313
Your clinic is in danger.

655
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:39,030
You are in danger because of me.

656
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,905
You... And how am I gonna
go tell these new OBs

657
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:44,286
that they're gonna
be okay when I'm not?

658
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:46,150
I am exhausted.

659
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:47,576
I am terrified.

660
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,034
I'm not okay. Oh, honey.

661
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,267
Oh.

662
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:53,088
Okay,
okay, okay. Okay.

663
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:57,023
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.

664
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,740
It's okay.

665
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:00,400
Oh.

666
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,244
<i>We're setting up an incident
command post with PD now. North parking lot.</i>

667
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:11,657
- Copy that. Thanks, Marcus.
- Have you heard from the clinic? Jo's not responding to texts.

668
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:12,790
You need somebody
to go over there?

669
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:14,883
That is exactly what I do
<i>not</i> need someone to do.

670
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,223
Well, have you considered - closing to trauma?
- Not yet.

671
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,158
I really think you should...

672
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:21,046
The media will probably
want a statement.

673
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:22,532
Do you want me to work on one?
Dr. Altman, there's a situation...

674
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:23,584
All right. Everybody stop!

675
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,526
I need to be able to think,
which is impossible to do

676
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,090
when everyone is coming
at me at the same time.

677
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:28,475
So can you please
quiet your voices

678
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,722
so I can hear the
one in my head?

679
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:31,333
Okay. Whatever helps.

680
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,360
What is going on?

681
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:36,288
Did you want the voice in
your head to answer or...

682
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:37,471
Talk, Schmitt.

683
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:38,881
They're clinic patients,

684
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:41,624
but the protesters wouldn't
let them in, so they came here.

685
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:42,780
They have appointments

686
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,221
for their annual Pap
smears, glucose tests,

687
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:48,144
cervical-cancer
screenings, STD panels.

688
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,931
Do I just... send them home?

689
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,817
No.

690

someone helped me figure it out.
