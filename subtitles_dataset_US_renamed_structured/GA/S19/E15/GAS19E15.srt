1
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:12,115
- Our DNA is made up of
four nucleotide bases.

2
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,326
The sequences of these
bases is what determines

3
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,363
our unique genetic code.

4
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,125
Everything from
dimples to eye color,

5
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:25,232
to tolerance for spicy food
can be found in our genes.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,690
- What's with the
fancy breakfast?

7
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,396
- I woke up and couldn't
get back to sleep,

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,960
so I made my specialty.

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,548
- I didn't know
you had it in you.

10
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:33,343
- Yeah. Eat when
you can, right?

11
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,104
- All right, let's go.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,082
Let's go, people.
- Hey, you're the one

13
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:39,798
who's not ready.

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,284
- Genetic makeup can also help
ascertain risk for diseases,

15
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,977
so, it stands to reason...

16
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:50,360
- London is an
incredible opportunity.

17
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:52,604
- If we want to
minimize the risk...

18
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:53,984
- OK.

19
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:55,986
It feels like maybe
I should go now.

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,817
- I said that you could use
my lab equipment for work.

21
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,236
I didn't say that I was ready
to hear more about the thing

22
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,615
that you're abandoning me for.

23
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:06,687
- Could we find a way
to change our genes?

24
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,106
And if we could...

25
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:13,556
are we sure we should?

26
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:15,558
- Good morning.

27
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:17,042
- Morning.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,701
- ♪ Ain't no other
place I'd rather be ♪

29
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,600
- God, I miss this bed.

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,813
How long have you been up?

31
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,125
- Four hours.

32
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,372
Maggie, when we were
in the OR together,

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,869
we pull things off
no one else can.

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,341
- I know.
- We work in sync,

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,757
and we communicate,
and we constantly know

36
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,896
what the other one needs.

37
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,208
- If we can do that in there,

38
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,762
then we should be able
to do that all the time.

39
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,667
Come with me to Chicago.

40
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:59,198
We will get settled, and
we'll find a therapist.

41
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:01,259
- Maggie, I don't
have a job there.

42
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,123
- But you'll find one.

43
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:04,790
- Because you're going
to get it for me,

44
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,254
just like you did
here at Grey Sloan?

45
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,575
- I didn't get you a job.

46
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,990
You had to interview
with Richard and Bailey.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,615
- They met with
me because of you.

48
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,720
They didn't come to
Boston and recruit me.

49
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:19,518
I'm... I'm earning respect here,

50
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,658
and I'm finding my footing here.

51
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,902
- So you're saying...
- I'm saying don't go.

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,975
All right? Look, I know
that it has been rough,

53
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,771
and we have both
said some things,

54
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,809
but there's enough good
between us to fight for it.

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,019
Stay here with me.

56
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,298
Fight for us.

57
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:49,721
- Winston, I've been offered
the opportunity of a lifetime.

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,762
- OK.

59
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,769
I am steady.

60
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,771
I'm committed.

61
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,635
You know why?

62
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,501
Because I work hard to be
nothing like my father.

63
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,228
Your birth mom is Ellis Grey.

64
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,404
The genius is baked in.

65
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,302
There will be other
opportunities,

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,099
but the rest of it is
baked in too, Maggie.

67
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,480
So you have to fight.

68
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:28,069
You have to work hard
to be nothing like her.

69
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,734
I hope you stay.

70
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,231
- Ah, morning.

71
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:52,611
- Good morning.

72
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,304
- Morning!
- Well, hello, Dr. Miller.

73
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,478
How is the turtle?

74
00:03:57,616 --> 00:04:00,240
- Very healthy.
- Excellent.

75
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,518
Bailey,
how are you doing?

76
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,901
- Ah... well, my two teenaged
boys and pre-schooler

77
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,871
are in a rental home with
white walls and white carpet.

78
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,874
Kissed that security deposit
goodbye after the first hour.

79
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,738
My phone is no longer ringing
off the hook, at least.

80
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,086
There's that.
- Well, I have asked security

81
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,024
to increase their presence
around the daycare.

82
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,538
- Oh, not necessary.

83
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,955
- Bailey, these people knew
where Tuck goes to school.

84
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,820
The hospital's daycare
is an obvious target.

85
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:32,962
- Which is why Pru
isn't going back there.

86
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,274
Ready for rounds, baby girl?

87
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:35,447
- Let's go to work.

88
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,207
- Ah, stat!
- Stat!

89
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,382
Let's do it.

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,246
Ooh, ooh. Important.
Very important.

91
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:42,765
Let's go. Let's go.

92
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,457
- Well, you look rough.

93
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:49,047
I never said I was a liar.

94
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,566
- I haven't slept in two days.

95
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,264
- Well, at least
you're not babysitting.

96
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,017
I really need to
get out of peds.

97
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,812
You want anything?
- You buying me coffee?

98
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,332
Nope. Not anymore.

99
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,470
Trauma in the pit.

100
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,715
- Amelia, can we just pretend

101
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:03,693
like I'm not leaving and
that you are not mad at me?

102
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,166
I really need to talk.

103
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,685
- Oh, thank God.

104
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,756
Yeah, I need to
talk, too. You first.

105
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:15,004
- This morning Winston
basically called me Ellis.

106
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:17,317
- Was he trying to
start World War III?

107
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:22,045
- He actually wasn't, which
is what made it hurt more.

108
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,909
He wants me to stay.

109
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,740
- OK, so the Ellis
thing... He called you

110
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:30,364
a cold-hearted monster,
but he wants you to stay.

111
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:31,928
- I thought he was
just saying that to put

112
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:35,749
my ambition and career first,
but yours is way meaner.

113
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,613
Uh.

114
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,409
Kai is you, and I'm Winston,

115
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,446
so I don't know
whose side I'm on.

116
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,758
- Say more.

117
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:51,212
- Yesterday, Kai announced
that they are moving to London.

118
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,561
That was after they came
here and made me fall

119
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,703
even more in love with
them, just for extra sting.

120
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,188
- I think I might have done
that to Winston last night.

121
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,329
- I don't want
them to go. I...

122
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,193
I want them...

123
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,471
I want them to prioritize
me. I wanna matter.

124
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,231
- You do matter, Amelia.

125
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,371
You matter to me.

126
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,201
You matter to Kai.

127
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,134
Winston feels abandoned.

128
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:21,207
- I asked him to come
with me to Chicago.

129
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,107
- Well, I can't go to
London. I have Scout.

130
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,043
- Winston did call me cold.

131
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,011
Ellis was cold.

132
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,633
Do you think that's
what he meant?

133
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,774
Do you think that Kai is cold?

134
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,984
- Kai is anything but cold.

135
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:42,505
Maggie, you are
anything but cold.

136
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,680
Saving lives is a noble pursuit,

137
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,923
but it's also one
that makes you happy,

138
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,375
and that is not a
word I have ever heard

139
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,274
associated with Ellis Grey.

140
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,373
- Do you think you could
give Kai the same support

141
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,831
you just gave me?

142
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:59,108
- Definitely not.

143
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:05,494
Go.

144
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,600
Be happy.

145
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:19,991
- Hey, your shoelace is untied.

146
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,408
Yasuda, are you wearing
two different shoes?

147
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,755
- I have two different feet.

148
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,724
Here we go.

149
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,830
What have we got?
- Lindsay Allyn, 37.

150
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,208
Status post fall in the shower.

151
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,040
Negative LOC.
Hemodynamically stable,

152
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,491
but has left-sided motor
and sensory deficit.

153
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,779
Patient with a known
history of Ehlers-Danlos

154
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,563
and a C1/C2 cervical fusion.

155
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,702
- Well, it happened.

156
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,117
My head finally fell off.

157
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,119
- OK. Let's page
Dr. Shepherd. Let's go.

158
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:48,789
- How long have you
had the heightened

159
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:49,917
sensitivity, Ms. Barrett?

160
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,126
- Uh, Tobey. On and
off for a few cycles,

161
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,474
which is why I thought
it was hormonal,

162
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:58,063
and then I started
getting this, um...

163
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,444
dis... discharge.

164
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:00,790
- Discharge?

165
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:04,069
- From my... my nipple.

166
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,864
- Adams, can you grab
me a new penlight?

167
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,073
This one is dead.
- Uh, sure.

168
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,282
- Thank you.

169
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,526
There's nothing like
describing my nipple discharge

170
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,090
in front of a cute
guy.

171
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:15,474
- So, is it both
sides or just one?

172
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:16,357
- Just the right side.
- OK.

173
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,773
- Is that normal?

174
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:18,922
I mean, I just switched
birth control pills

175
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,120
a couple of months ago.

176
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,087
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

177
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:24,573
to leak all of your
shirt during a deposition

178
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,057
in the county jail?
- Mm.

179
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,515
- The correctional
officer thought

180
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,701
I was smuggling something in.

181
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:29,957
- Like what?

182
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,994
- Girl, I don't
know. Contraband?

183
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:34,134
Vodka? Milk?

184
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,688
I don't know.

185
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,346
I am constantly trying
to prove to the partners

186
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:40,623
that they can count on me.

187
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,453
Being the only woman and
the token Black girl,

188
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:44,662
I can't have leakage.

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,663
- We're gonna get
you checked out.

190
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,801
- Thank you.
- Of course.

191
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,010
Be right back.
- Thank you.

192
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,322
- Yeah.

193
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,360
- Dr. Ndugu, you missed
quite the party last night.

194
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,982
I tried to get
Dr. Millin to join,

195
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,605
but she claims
she's not a singer.

196
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:57,903
- You've been here all night?

197
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,745
- Yeah, I wasn't leaving
this one by herself.

198
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,163
Music helps with healing, or so
someone on the internet says.

199
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,234
- Music must be working
because Nola's labs

200
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,443
and vitals look fantastic.

201
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,901
We'll move her
from the ICU today.

202
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,411
- And where's Dr. Pierce?

203
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,379
- Probably busy with
final paperwork.

204
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:14,795
She was able to extend her
stay for Nola's surgery,

205
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,348
but her flight leaves tonight.

206
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,937
- Oh, I guess I thought
maybe she'd change her mind

207
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,352
and stay an extra day or two.

208
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,562
- Nola is in excellent hands.

209
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,805
You should be back
on tour in no time.

210
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:27,394
Hey, there she is.

211
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,532
How are you feeling?

212
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,539
Why does she sound like?

213
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:35,954
Nola?

214
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,369
- Call a rapid response.
- Nola.

215
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,370
- I'll increase her O2.

216
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,544
- Oh, my God. Nola?

217
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,787
Nola?

218
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,585
- It looks like your fall

219
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,172
caused the metal instrumentation

220
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,692
from your previous spinal
fusion to break off,

221
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,625
and your C1 and C2 vertebrae

222
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,282
are now compressing
your spinal cord.

223
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,870
- Can you just put them back?

224
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,488
The fusion was to
fix something called

225
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,288
atlanto-axial instability from
my connective tissue disorder.

226
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,473
- Well, we'll need more
imaging to see the full extent

227
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:02,992
of the damage, but the
traction should help

228
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,638
while we come up with a plan.

229
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,029
- Lindsay!
- Sir, you can't just...

230
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:06,882
- Wait, what hap... I'm
sorry, what happened?

231
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,100
- This is my brother, Carlton.

232
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,505
He asks a lot of questions.
- Hi.

233
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,058
- Yeah, I'm her
primary caretaker.

234
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,415
I'd like to be added
to the HIPAA forms,

235
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,106
wherever those are at.
- We share a duplex.

236
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,511
He's kind of the
Kramer of my life.

237
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,823
- Hey, look at me.

238
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,421
They told me that you
fell in the shower?

239
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,871
I mean, is there something
wrong with the safety handles?

240
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:20,758
- No, no, no, no,
I just slipped.

241
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,011
- OK, but you're
supposed to sit.

242
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,184
- I know.
- That way you don't slip,

243
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,313
right?
- We need to order

244
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,385
a head CT with total spine.

245
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,698
- Yasuda, CT.

246
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,872
- Copy.
- I'm OK.

247
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,842
- Code blue. Code blue.

248
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,706
- Ah, dammit.
- What is that on her neck?

249
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,338
- She developed a blood
clot around her jugular.

250
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,064
It's preventing the blood
from draining from her head.

251
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,514
We need to reopen the incision.
- No, no, no.

252
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:44,644
I want Dr. Pierce.
- We need her out of here. Now.

253
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,646
- Page Pierce!
- Get her out. Scalpel.

254
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:47,830
- Are you gonna
do it right here?

255
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,165
- We have no choice.

256
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,410
All right.

257
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,898
The anastomosis is leaking.

258
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,557
Got it. All right.

259
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,352
Hold it right here, tight.

260
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,802
We have to get her to the OR.

261
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,980
- Oh, Adams. Here, follow me.

262
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:14,087
Pru, this is Dr. Adams,
and he is going to take you

263
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,296
to get a snack in the
cafeteria... no candy.

264
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,057
- Uh... what? I'm supposed
to just take her with me

265
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,576
as I see patients?
- No, now.

266
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,854
You are going to ask Dr. Smith
to give you something

267
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,763
to do that does not
directly involve patients,

268
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:27,203
because I'm needed in the OR
for small bowel resection.

269
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,941
- OK, wait, Dr. Bailey,
I don't think I'm

270
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,320
the right person for this job.
- Oh, no.

271
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,761
You are a Shepherd,
which means that you are

272
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,280
one of approximately
1,000 siblings

273
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,006
and nieces and
nephews and cousins

274
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,180
and children of all ages.

275
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,216
And you definitely,
know how to keep

276
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,392
one adorable little girl out of
trouble for a couple of hours.

277
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,187
OK? Go ahead, sweetie. Go.

278
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:46,671
There. There we go.
- I...

279
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,362
- Yeah. There.
- I...

280
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,953
Yeah, let's go get some candy.

281
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,994
- Oh, I didn't know
you were coming today.

282
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,754
- Oh, just some labs.

283
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,111
- Oh, well, I can come with you.

284
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:05,310
- Richard, we both agreed
that I'd let you know

285
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,519
if there were any major
changes of procedures.

286
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,556
These tests are routine.

287
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,385
How'd it go with Maggie?

288
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,870
- Oh, it hasn't yet.

289
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,492
I hope she didn't already leave.

290
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,943
- Without saying goodbye
to you? She wouldn't.

291
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,740
- Well, our last conversation
didn't go too well.

292
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,327
- She'll come around.

293
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,157
That's what it
means to be family.

294
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,161
- Well, I sure hope
that's how she sees it.

295
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,541
- She will.

296
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,858
How's
everyone this morning?

297
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,204
- When can I have real food?

298
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,655
- Grayson, say
good morning first.

299
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,415
- Morning.

300
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,832
- I'm just going to need
to check your ostomy, OK?

301
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,524
I know the broth is bland, but
I need to see how you tolerate

302
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:47,905
the clear liquids first.

303
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,285
You guys heading out?

304
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:50,538
- Yeah, we need to go
get Grayson's cousins

305
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,771
from the airport.

306
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,300
- Tell them to enjoy
the Mariners game.

307
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,913
Get some pizza, too, since
the bar mitzvah is canceled.

308
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,846
- Only until it's rescheduled.

309
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,364
- It won't be the same.

310
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,997
- It's getting harder
for Zayde to travel.

311
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,367
- It's a big trip from Brooklyn,

312
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,024
even for his favorite
great-grandson.

313
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,889
- I'm right here.
I can hear you.

314
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:10,030
Tatele, you'll do it later.

315
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,861
With or without me,
it will be great.

316
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,034
- OK, let's go.

317
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,105
We'll be back this
afternoon. Promise.

318
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,866
Eat the broth,

319
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,247
and I'll sneak
you a bagel later.

320
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:22,146
OK.

321
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,803
Come on.

322
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,874
Bye, sweetie.

323
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,395
- Mrs. Friedman, a word?

324
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,538
- Here we go, Luna bear.

325
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:39,888
- Have a nice day Thank you.

326
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,717
Checking in?

327
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,824
- Um...

328
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,308
- Ma'am?

329
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,449
Can I help you?

330
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,763
- Hey.

331
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,282
- Hey, what are you...

332
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,664
I... I thought that
you had a consult.

333
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,079
- I shuffled things.

334
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,807
I want to be here
with you two. Hm?

335
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,345
Wait, am I late?
- No, we're just...

336
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:05,258
We're checking in.

337
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,467
- I'll take her.

338
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,848
Come on, Luna.

339
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,780
- Sometimes there are bone spurs

340
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,300
in the cord from the vertebrae
trying to stabilize itself.

341
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,318
With the revision, we
will release the pressure,

342
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:18,029
and the paralysis should
resolve itself pretty quickly.

343
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,593
- Shouldn't take too long.
Lindsay, just stay still

344
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,619
for us, OK?
- Kind of my only option.

345
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,082
- I thought Ehlers-Danlos
was mostly stretchy skin

346
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,106
and hyperflexibility.

347
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,350
- There are different types,

348
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,662
and it presents
differently in each person.

349
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:35,150
Oh. Hand me her labs.

350
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,428
- There is soft tissue
edema and stranding,

351
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,431
also, mild atlantoaxial
displacement.

352
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,467
- Damn it. She
has eonsinophilia.

353
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,779
I've seen this before.

354
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,298
Lindsay is allergic to the metal

355
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,127
that they used to
stabilize her spine.

356
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:48,725
The screws and plate
have to come out.

357
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,475
We're not gonna be able
to do this revision.

358
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:53,340
- So, what? We just
leave her like this?

359
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,101
Paralyzed?

360
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,430
- You want to throw
a bar mitzvah?

361
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:05,663
- Yes.
- At the hospital?

362
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:06,801
- Yes.

363
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,045
- In the chapel?

364
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,503
- And the lobby
for the reception.

365
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,187
Please, Chief, his
great-grandfather is here now,

366
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,843
but he won't be for much longer.

367
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:15,707
- Who is gonna set all this up?

368
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,472
- Hey, heads up.

369
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,553
The cafeteria has chocolate
peanut butter brownies.

370
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:26,753
- Oh, most cafeterias are
completely nut-free now.

371
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,100
- Ohh, uhh... Are
you allergic to nuts?

372
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:31,413
- What do allergic mean?

373
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,933
- Dr. Pierce, can I ask you
a question about a patient?

374
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,693
- I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

375
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,074
- Oh, you're really leaving.

376
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,455
Have you already
turned in your badge?

377
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,593
- What do you got?

378
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:41,882
- Did a breast
exam on a patient.

379
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,287
I think I felt a lump.

380
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,220
- Tobey Barrett?
- Yeah.

381
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,739
- Yeah, prep for an ultrasound
and a possible biopsy.

382
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll be there to supervise you.
- Thank you.

383
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,090
- Ooh, Adams.

384
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,850
- No, ah, ah! No,
no, no, no, no.

385
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,231
No, no. Sorry.

386
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,129
- What do you see, Dr. Miller?
- Nothing.

387
00:15:58,267 --> 00:15:59,993
- Exactly. Neck
exploration's complete.

388
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,961
Now, we can start to
repair the venotomy.

389
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,099
Irrigation.

390
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,342
- I don't understand.

391
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,895
I was watching the surgery.

392
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,243
I mean, I was in the gallery,
but I saw on the monitors

393
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:10,762
you and Dr. Pierce had
perfect anastomoses.

394
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,592
They weren't too loose,
they were precise,

395
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,834
they were well aligned.

396
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,008
How does this happen?

397
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:16,561
- Any sudden
increase in pressure,

398
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:19,875
if Nola held her breath, if
she moved ahead too fast,

399
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,671
if there was any bearing down,
if you create enough pressure

400
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,729
in the body, the weak
parts will just burst open.

401
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,262
Sometimes you can do
everything perfectly,

402
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,436
it still doesn't matter.

403
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,302
- You want me...
- Sew in the patch graft.

404
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,235
Unless you want to go
back to the gallery.

405
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,864
Yeah.

406
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,694
You're gonna wanna
take very small,

407
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,523
evenly spaced, bites.

408
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,595
Don't use too much force.

409
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,253
Good.

410
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,569
- Hey, can we
pretend for a minute

411
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:01,606
that you are not going to
London and I'm not mad at you?

412
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,125
- No.

413
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,441
What do you need?
- Because you're allergic

414
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,459
to the steel screws, we
can't just replace them,

415
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,583
so we have to remove them,
and then posteriorly,

416
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:14,241
fuse your C1 and C2
vertebrae together.

417
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,551
- With what?
- We'll 3D print a matrix

418
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,796
of coral and stem cells,
so your body will use it

419
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:21,454
as a scaffold to fuse the
vertebrae without any metal.

420
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:23,258
- OK, so, hold on. It's
just one piece of bone.

421
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:24,422
How is she gonna move?

422
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,217
- She will lose some
mobility in her neck,

423
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,080
but it will stabilize
the vertebrae,

424
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,499
and it will reduce the swelling.

425
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,125
- I don't think that
you should do this.

426
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,544
I don't. It sounds
like science fiction.

427
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,890
I mean, who puts coral
in people's necks?

428
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,547
- Well, technically,
it's calcium carbonate.

429
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,931
It's a precursor
to bone formation.

430
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:38,706
- Wait till you find
out that the stem cells

431
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:39,781
come from abdominal fat.

432
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:41,681
- It is cutting-edge technology,

433
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,442
but one of the most published
neuroscientists in the world

434
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,869
happens to be in this hospital
the very day that your sister

435
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:48,284
needs this kind of expertise.
- Yeah.

436
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,108
Yeah, well, with all due
respect, cutting edge

437
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,356
just sounds like a
fancy way of saying

438
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,554
experimental and expensive.

439
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:54,492
- Yeah, well, they're
not asking you, Carlton.

440
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,706
You just don't want me to have
a chance at more independence.

441
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,087
- You couldn't take
a shower without

442
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,123
falling out of your chair.

443
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:01,597
- I was shaving, OK?

444
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:04,738
I fell because I
was shaving my legs.

445
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,036
If you must know, I had a
date, and I was getting ready

446
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,260
and I bent over a weird
way to get the right angle

447
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,192
on my knee, and I fell.

448
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,330
You happy?

449
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,299
- You had a date? With who?

450
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,714
- None of your business!

451
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:16,243
And I don't need you
constantly reminding me

452
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,820
of my disability, OK?

453
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,615
Trust me, I'm aware.

454
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,205
This is my decision,

455
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,414
and I'm getting the surgery.

456
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:27,623
- Yeah.

457
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,628
- Can you print the coral now?

458
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:40,084
- These are the saddest
balloons I've ever seen.

459
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,741
We're throwing a bar mitzvah.

460
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,605
It's supposed to
be a celebration.

461
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:45,863
They should look like they're
about to pop, not drown.

462
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,782
It's going great, Chief.

463
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,232
You're the best.

464
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:56,411
Oh, Yasuda, help these two.

465
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,723
I've got to figure out if
there's a semi-decent DJ

466
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,035
in this hospital.

467
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,176
- Are we supposed to be
surgeons or camp counselors?

468
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:06,800
- Ah, says the one-man
Babysitters Club.

469
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,319
Where are you going?

470
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,055
- A woman came in
paralyzed, and Dr. Shepherd

471
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,184
is 3D printing a vertebrae

472
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,802
so we can do an
awesome spinal fusion,

473
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,774
while saving her life
all on the same day.

474
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:15,982
I'm taking a power nap.

475
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,535
- What about the surgery?

476
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,985
- Dr. Shepherd is
still printing,

477
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,332
and I just need 20 minutes
to complete one REM cycle

478
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,590
while the caffeine kicks in.

479
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,681
- On Call room is the other way.

480
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:31,342
- What if she has
CMV or encephalitis?

481
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,728
- Well, she hasn't been
vomiting or had a fever.

482
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,524
- But it could be a tumor,
like an acoustic neuroma.

483
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,902
- Then we'll be grateful that
it's benign and resectable.

484
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,538
- Yeah, but it could
be cancerous, right?

485
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,737
Like... like nasopharyngeal
or something.

486
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,222
There are leukemia
patients that sometimes...

487
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,431
- Jo.

488
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,261
I know this is a
little like saying

489
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:56,333
stop needing oxygen to live,

490
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,611
but let's not panic.

491
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,854
We need to take it
one step at a time.

492
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,166
- Wilson, Luna.

493
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,823
- Yes. Yeah, that's us.

494
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,482
Hey. Come here.
Come here. Ohh.

495
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,245
Will you come with us?

496
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,388
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

497
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,597
Come on. Come on.

498
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,708
- Do you visualize the needle?

499
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:27,916
- Yes.

500
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,228
- Good.

501
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,860
Now, study the
ultrasound, as you guide

502
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,783
the tip of the needle
toward the center

503
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,268
of the hypoechoic mass.

504
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:37,684
- It's bad, isn't it?

505
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,617
You found something
bad, didn't you?

506
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,033
- On appearance, it
looks suspicious,

507
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,184
but we won't know anything for
sure until we get the results

508
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,416
of the biopsy back.

509
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:49,386
- I just got on this
huge case at my firm.

510
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:50,535
They might be
arguing in front of

511
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,802
the Washington Supreme Court.

512
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,562
This was not in my plans.

513
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,978
I mean, I thought this was
some weird, little infection,

514
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,946
and I would go home
with an antibiotic.

515
00:20:58,084 --> 00:21:00,673
Can I try an antibiotic
to see if it goes away?

516
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,192
- An antibiotic, unfortunately,
won't work for this.

517
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,125
- How is this happening?

518
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
I go to the doctor regularly.

519
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,991
I mean, sometimes
I miss it for work,

520
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,234
but I always reschedule,

521
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,098
and I do the self-exams
in the shower.

522
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,238
It's just all feels lumpy.

523
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:15,757
How was I supposed to know?

524
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:17,862
- Tobey, you have
dense breast tissue.

525
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,485
You did everything right.

526
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,210
What Dr. Griffith
found was small,

527
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,799
so it might have been difficult
to feel during your last exam

528
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,457
- I feel like I'm being punished

529
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,460
for working so hard,

530
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,911
for always putting it first.

531
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,810
My mom is gonna say I
should've had kids earlier,

532
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:39,436
that a career is not gonna
make me smile in 20 years.

533
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:43,716
- Yes, it will, if
it's the right one.

534
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,210
I don't mean to
contradict your mother.

535
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:46,477
- Please contradict my mother.

536
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:50,930
- You loving your job,
that is a beautiful thing.

537
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,588
Don't ever let anyone
make you wrong for that.

538
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:57,108
It does not make you cold,
it makes you passionate.

539
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:59,904
And you are not being punished.

540
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,803
Even if this turns
out to be malignant,

541
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,494
you have options.

542
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:05,496
You have good options.

543
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,440
You are so on top of
everything that you came here

544
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,614
immediately, and that means
there's a chance that we might

545
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:12,054
have found something early.

546
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,263
Not everyone has that chance.

547
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,162
You're gonna be OK, Tobey.

548
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,889
- We'll be back with the
biopsy results shortly.

549
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:20,649
Try to relax until then.

550
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:21,787
- OK.

551
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,137
- Just get those to pathology.
- Yeah.

552
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:31,108
If it does turn
out to be cancer,

553
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,490
I can't be the one to tell her.

554
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,906
- Yes, you can.

555
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,604
Good doctors connect
with their patients

556
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:39,150
for all kinds of reasons,

557
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:41,014
and you see yourself in Tobey,

558
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,947
so she'll trust you.

559
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,848
My mother died of it...

560
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:51,197
Breast cancer, and we
did not catch it early.

561
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:53,820
And it was long and painful,

562
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,753
and it took her away from me.

563
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:58,894
It took her away from
a life that she loved

564
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:00,931
and that she had waited
too long to claim.

565
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:05,211
I'm just really
missing her right now.

566
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,282
I hope I'm doing her proud.

567
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,732
- There's no way you're not.

568
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,701
You are one of the best
teachers I've ever had.

569
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,669
I hope I get to
learn from you again.

570
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,363
You know,

571
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,089
a watched 3D
printer never boils.

572
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:23,505
- Our patient was lucky that
you happen to be in town

573
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:25,283
when she took a fall.
- She is, isn't she?

574
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,751
- Well, I think our patient
was lucky to have had

575
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,753
a loved one nearby to help.

576
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,972
- I think our patient is just
trying to live their life,

577
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:33,722
but they can't because
their loved one

578
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,103
is obsessed with being needed.

579
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,588
- So you're saying
our patient is being

580
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:38,934
oppressed by being loved?

581
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:41,316
- Should we go over
the surgical plan?

582
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,869
- Uh... fine.
- Yes.

583
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,561
- OK.

584
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,804
- A little higher.

585
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,842
Good. No, no, lower.

586
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,430
Perfect.

587
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,259
How's that' looking, Pru?

588
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,019
Pru?

589
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:58,195
Ah, damn it. Pru?

590
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,335
Has anybody seen the kid? Pru?

591
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,407
- Well, I guess the gift shop
doesn't have a Judaica section.

592
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,995
- Pru?

593
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,516
- That's not better, is it?

594
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:10,932
- Where's Yasuda?

595
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,390
She's supposed to
be scrubbing in.

596
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,107
- Oh, I'm not sure,

597
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,421
but if you need an
intern, I'm available.

598
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,009
- Let's go.

599
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,496
- Thank you.

600
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,263
- She's OK.

601
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,717
- She's gotta stop
doing this to me.

602
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:40,168
- Nola is being moved
back to the ICU.

603
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:41,790
You can go and sit with her.

604
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:43,585
- OK.

605
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:47,175
Thank you for saving her twice.

606
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,246
Thank you.

607
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:55,701
- I'm glad you're
staying at Grey Sloan.

608
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,324
I'm glad you're not
going to Chicago.

609
00:24:58,462 --> 00:24:59,774
I want to be on your service.

610
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:02,466
Today was amazing. Your
technique is amazing.

611
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:03,985
I want to learn from you.

612
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:06,712
I need to learn
from you. So...

613
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,993
- I'm not being
disloyal to Grey Sloan,

614
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:14,616
and I'm not going to
apologize for being ambitious.

615
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:17,516
- Did my husband call
you too ambitious?

616
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:21,243
- Not exactly, but it felt like
it and not in the good way.

617
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,523
- That man. He's been around
ambitious women his whole life.

618
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,076
He wouldn't have
it any other way.

619
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:27,905
- You are a trailblazer.

620
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,702
- I am. So was Ellis Grey.

621
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,290
- Yeah, right.

622
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:36,051
You... you knew her, too.

623
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,501
- Not really.

624
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:40,815
Our paths would cross at a
conference here or there.

625
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,093
There weren't as many
female surgeons back then,

626
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:44,957
and a group of us would
arrange our flights

627
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,475
so we could have
a drink together

628
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:48,754
that last day, but not Ellis.

629
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,411
She was always jetting off
to her next big surgery

630
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,448
or research.

631
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,761
She wasn't going to let a
little thing like friendship

632
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,349
or camaraderie get in the way.

633
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,386
- Coldness is in my genes.

634
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:03,665
- Not coldness. Focus.

635
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:07,117
Ellis Grey saved a lot of lives.

636
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:15,125
Maggie, you are so much more
than Ellis' pure ambition.

637
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:21,269
You are kindness, caring, honor,

638
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:25,584
fairness, friendship, love.

639
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,760
I happen to believe that
you carry those traits

640
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,866
in your genes as well.

641
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:34,662
- Richard.
- Oh, that man loves you

642
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,112
like you're the best
part of him and Ellis.

643
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,770
In all due respect
to your parents,

644
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:42,601
I don't think a day goes
by when he doesn't wish

645
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:46,294
that he and Ellis
were both brave enough

646
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,468
to follow their hearts.

647
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,298
If only so, he would
have been a part

648
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,989
of your life so much sooner

649
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,026
- I do wish I had
known him longer.

650
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:56,545
- Child, you are moving,
you're not dying.

651
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:59,997
We're going to still
see you.

652
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,281
- I had the terrible
broth, and I'm fine,

653
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,663
Can I please have
something real to eat?

654
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,597
- I think you might want
to wait on the solids.

655
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,323
I got something better for you.

656
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:17,049
- Why are you holding
my nice shoes?

657
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,867
- I talked to your
parents, and they agreed

658
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,915
that since everybody
is here together,

659
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,986
there's no point in
postponing your bar mitzvah.

660
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:26,645
So we're throwing it for you
today here at Grey Sloan.

661
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:28,060
- No.
- What do you mean?

662
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,371
- Are you crazy?

663
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:30,555
I'm not having my bar
mitzvah at a hospital

664
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,960
like some bubble boy loser.

665
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,273
- That's not what I...
- I said no!

666
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,240
No bar mitzvah.

667
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:48,149
- No. No, no, no, no.

668
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,082
No. No!

669
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,157
- Suction.

670
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:58,573
- Are you ready for fusion?
- Why wouldn't I be?

671
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,992
- You're angry, and I just
want to make sure that whatever

672
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,163
it is you're angry about,

673
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:03,727
it's not going to
affect our patient.

674
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,650
- Do I seem angry, Kwan?

675
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,756
- Is this a trick question?

676
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,137
- Kai is taking a job
and moving to London

677
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,760
to start a new research team.

678
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:16,729
So we either have to do oceanic
long distance, or break up.

679
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,351
- Well, for what
it's worth, I heard

680
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,571
they've added a bunch of direct
flights from Europe to Sea-Tac.

681
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:23,632
- Kwan, I don't even know
how you got into this OR.

682
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,151
Just pass me the damn matrix.

683
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,612
- But, um...

684
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,303
it was nothing.

685
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:43,756
It was a... It was
just a little...

686
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,102
It was nothing.

687
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,622
- Like Dr. Pierce
said, you have options.

688
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,143
Breast cancer is incredibly
treatable these days.

689
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,111
- But I don't... I
don't know where to go.

690
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,907
I don't know what to do. I...

691
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:59,358
I always know what to do.

692
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,808
- I do.

693
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:04,052
I know what to do.

694
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,364
- Right.

695
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:10,507
I'm sorry.

696
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:12,440
- Take your time.

697
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:17,859
- ♪ We were born to
last until the end ♪

698
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:23,071
- You did so good, Luna bear.

699
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:29,250
Luna, hey, hey, I love you.

700
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,844
- Sorry for the wait,
Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.

701
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,604
- Oh, um...
- Oh, no.

702
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:39,743
- We're just friends.

703
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,814
- Right.

704
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:45,231
So we did the BAER
test, which is the...

705
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,716
- Brainstem Auditory
Evoked Response.

706
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,339
- We're both physicians.

707
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,065
I'm an OB.
- Well, then you know

708
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,860
premature babies like
Luna run the risk

709
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:54,171
of later complications.

710
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:55,690
We'll have to
continue our studies,

711
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:59,142
but it does appear that she
has progressive hearing loss.

712
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,160
I'd like to run an OAE.

713
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:04,492
She can be asleep for that,
if that makes things easier.

714
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,840
That would be my next step.

715
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:09,877
Any questions?

716
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,058
- I'm not going down there.

717
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:20,991
I'm not...
- OK, well, so what if a few

718
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:22,406
of them come up here, then...

719
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,098
Your cousins or your Zayde?
- What?

720
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,100
Talk me into it?
No, that won't work.

721
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,964
I'm supposed to be
eating sushi and cake.

722
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:29,665
I'm supposed to dance
with Eloise Schurmann.

723
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,529
I have to wear a suit with
pants that cover my butt.

724
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:32,553
- You can wear pants.

725
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,453
- I wanted to stand
up on the bimah

726
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,007
and show my family and friends
in school how proud I am to be

727
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:39,147
Jewish, especially my Zayde.

728
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,529
He wasn't able to have a
bar mitzvah in Germany.

729
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,886
He's always saying
how important it is

730
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,532
to be proud of who we are.

731
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,292
I can't do that like this.

732
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,364
- Well, sometimes things don't
happen like you plan them.

733
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:56,164
Look, part of becoming a man

734
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,166
means learning how
to handle that.

735
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,653
It's like what they
say in the Torah,

736
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,312
you have to leave room for
the magic that only happens

737
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,487
when you let things
look different than how

738
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,660
you imagine them.

739
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,904
- The Torah doesn't say that.

740
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,907
- I'm sure it says
something like that.

741
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:20,913
What if you did it
together, with Zayde.

742
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:24,952
This could be his chance to
become a bar mitzvah with you.

743
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:34,064
- Ah, there he is.

744
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:38,344
Are you ready to reel
into manhood together?

745
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,139
- You and me.

746
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:45,662
- Now, tell me, which
one is Eloise Schurmann?

747
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,216
- The one in the pink dress.

748
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:50,253
- Ohh.

749
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:53,083
Eat. Eat. You're looking pale.

750
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:55,085
Now, wheels up.

751
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:47,758
- God bless you and keep you.

752
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:49,105
- Mazel tov, everybody!

753
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:00,047
- Mazel tov!

754
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,294
- Heard Nola is doing well.

755
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:09,125
I think Viv is going to
be your groupie soon.

756
00:33:09,263 --> 00:33:11,713
- She'll be way too busy
once they're back on tour.

757
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:15,994
I crushed it in there today.

758
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,237
Crushed it.

759
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,206
I wish you were there to see it.

760
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,725
- You don't have anything
to prove to me, Winston.

761
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:30,663
I thought about
everything you said.

762
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:34,874
- You did?

763
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,876
- Ellis stayed with her husband,

764
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,777
and by all accounts, that's
why she became so bitter.

765
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,918
She was ambitious before
that, but never cold.

766
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,333
She stayed.

767
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,955
She made everyone miserable.

768
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,164
My mom did the same thing.

769
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:51,719
She stayed with my
dad for a long time,

770
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:53,755
even though she was in
love with someone else.

771
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:56,448
Both of them, they didn't
follow their hearts.

772
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:57,828
They didn't follow their guts.

773
00:33:57,966 --> 00:34:01,177
They didn't bet on themselves.

774
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,764
They stayed to keep the peace.

775
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:05,422
They stayed to keep
other people happy.

776
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,255
My heart is in my work, Winston.

777
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,398
I don't think I'm cold,

778
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:17,917
and I don't think
you're a coward.

779
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,713
I think that...

780
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,857
I think we did the best we
could and that neither of us

781
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:28,687
is to blame.

782
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:37,213
I love you,

783
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:39,525
but I have to go.

784
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:46,705
- I love you, too,

785
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:49,501
but I have to stay.

786
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,616
- She did great.

787
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:04,205
Her spinal cord was intact, and
the swelling is coming down.

788
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,311
She should regain function
within a few days.

789
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:09,452
- I know I can be
a pain in the ass.

790
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,637
You know, when I was little,
I would follow her around

791
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:14,560
everywhere... to the mall,
football games, movies,

792
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,424
and I'm sure it feels
a lot like that to her

793
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:17,632
now that I live next door.

794
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,393
But when she first
got sick, you know,

795
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,740
I watched this person that
I knew start to fade away,

796
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,328
and I told myself
I would do whatever

797
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,468
it took to bring her back.

798
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,263
- You know, I got
a younger sister,

799
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,990
and she can be a pain in my ass
all the way from Los Angeles.

800
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:36,410
- I know she needs independence.

801
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:37,825
I know she wants it.

802
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,483
I just... I guess I wish
I could fix it for her.

803
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,174
- Yeah.

804
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:48,905
Maybe you should talk to Teddy.

805
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:51,942
Kai could be a good
fit here at Grey Sloan.

806
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:58,397
- Oh, nice job with
the decorations.

807
00:35:58,535 --> 00:35:59,961
Glad you got to
practice your dexterity,

808
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:02,194
while I was repairing
an anastomosis.

809
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:05,715
- Actually, I got to
assess on a cutting-edge

810
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,026
cervical spinal fusion.

811
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,167
- Because you stole it from me.

812
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,479
- Ya snooze, you
lose. Literally.

813
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,378
- You better sleep with
one eye open, Kwan,

814
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:14,827
because I'm coming for you.

815
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,520
- Ah, not worried,
because I know you sleep

816
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,315
with two eyes closed.
- Yasuda.

817
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,420
- Dr. Hunt, I am so
sorry about today.

818
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:22,973
- No excuses. Get
your act together,

819
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,804
or you won't see the inside
of an OR for at least a week.

820
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:29,256
- Richard. Richard?

821
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:30,464
I've been looking for you.

822
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,294
- Yeah, me, too. Um...

823
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:36,849
Listen, your move, it's
caught me off guard.

824
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,645
You have every right
to pursue your career,

825
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,407
and you don't need
me to affirm that.

826
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:46,721
- I know, but it feels nice.

827
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,656
- This is... this is for you.

828
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,214
It holds business cards.

829
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:58,733
- Oh! Oh, I thought it was...

830
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:02,012
- It's a miniature version
of the bench where I learned

831
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,739
that I had a daughter.

832
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:10,883
My life was forever
changed in that moment.

833
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,138
I hope you remember me
when you look at it.

834
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:20,583
- Richard, I'm not going to
need a bench to remember you.

835
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:24,207
- ♪ Good to see you ♪

836

- One for me, and
one for my date.

841
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:43,685
It looks like she
found another guy.

842
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,539

- Personally, I
prefer a vanilla cake.

846
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,832
- No. I mean the bar mitzvah.

847
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,799
Grayson is having
the time of his life.

848
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,008
- He's dancing with
the girl he likes.

849
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:09,079
- You know, I think
you should consider

850
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,219
a peds fellowship, Schmitt.

851
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,051
I mean, you connect with
kids, you listen, you care.

852
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,087
It's rare.

853
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:22,023
- Hearing aids are, like,
invisible these days.

854
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,889
Look, it's wild.
- Can you... can you just not?

855
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,616
- I'm just saying technology
has come a long way.

856
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:30,031
There's tons of info out there.

857
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:31,250
It's not as scary as it seems.

858
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,172
- Yes, it is, Link.

859
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,451
It's extremely scary.

860
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:39,351
- I'm sorry, just
trying to balance out

861
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,042
the doom clock that
I know is going on

862
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,572
in your head right now.
- Because my child

863
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:44,736
is going deaf?

864
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:51,087
I don't... I don't
care if technology

865
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:53,227
has come a long way.

866
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,685
This girl has been
through enough.

867
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,820
She doesn't deserve to have
to go through this, too.

868
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:59,958
I just...

869
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,416
I need to wrap my
head around this

870
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,720
before you go all cheerleader.

871
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,038
Thank you for being here.

872
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,423
- You're right.

873
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,494
London is too far
for long distance,

874
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:19,736
and I spoke to Teddy.

875
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,600
Nothing is definite, but...

876
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:24,396
- You can't quit
your job for me.

877
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:25,570
- No, I didn't.

878
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,399
She's expecting some
research funding.

879
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:28,952
You could move here.

880
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,370
- Amelia, we work because
of the long distance,

881
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:34,544
because you get to
spend half of your time

882
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,581
with Scout and the
other half with me,

883
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,377
and the two don't overlap.

884
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:42,518
- So is it about my kid?
- No...

885
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,658
From the minute I told
you about London, which

886
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:47,764
is the biggest career
opportunity of my life,

887
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:50,284
you have made it about you.

888
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,735
There were no words
of encouragement,

889
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,116
no congratulations,
no acknowledgment

890
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:57,636
of how hard I worked for this.

891
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:02,503
This is about you and me

892
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:06,921
being at very different
places in our lives.

893
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:13,238
I love you.

894
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,171
That is still true.

895
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,520
But...
- But.

896
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:26,044
That's what people say

897
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:27,839
before they abandon you.

898
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:31,187
- ♪ But when we grow ♪

899
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,053
- Segments of our DNA strand

900
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:39,471
can be turned on or off by
our behaviors and environment.

901
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,753
- How did your test go?

902
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:47,583
- OK.

903
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,345
I'm telling the truth.

904
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:52,795
I promise.

905
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,763
It's just that

906
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:58,007
Meredith left and
Maggie is leaving,

907
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:03,357
and the idea of just losing you,

908
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,221
I just can't fathom it.

909
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,983
- I hope to be with you
for a very, very long time.

910
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,985
But the only thing
I can guarantee

911
00:41:11,123 --> 00:41:15,196
is right now, and right now, I
want to dance with my husband.

912
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:25,862
- ♪ We hope, we hope ♪

913
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,521
- So why not change the
expression of our DNA

914
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,936
and make it our own?

915
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:36,977
- ♪ We keep on
moving ooh, ooh ♪

916
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:39,842
♪ And while the world's
spinning around ♪

917
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,914

♪ Oh, ooh ♪

920
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,819
- Because who we
are isn't determined

921
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:54,097
just by what we inherit...

922
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:57,963
- ♪ Oh ♪

923
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,587

♪ Oh, we keep on moving ♪

926
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:15,774
- But by what we
choose to do with it.

927
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,853
- Fantastic.
