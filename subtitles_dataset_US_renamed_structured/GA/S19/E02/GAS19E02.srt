1
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:05,954
My mother
always used to say

2
00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:07,829
that you could tell the
difference between an intern

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:10,338
and a second-year
resident by their sutures.

4
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:13,376
Wait, ladybug, you
forgot your lunch again.

5
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:15,848
Made your favorite.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,647
My favorite.

7
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,024
Go back inside, Grammy.
Dad's getting your breakfast.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,525
Bye, baby. Love you.

9
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:32,281
One of the more common
mistakes an intern makes

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,367
is tying their
sutures too tightly,

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,660
which causes tension.

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,289
Wow. Right? It's my first.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,416
Car? Place.

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,835
I installed a Wi-Fi hotspot
and a camper stove. Ah.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,046
And, no, you can't borrow
it.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,591
The more tension, the longer
it takes the wound to heal.

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,877
It decreases blood flow,
increases scar formation,

18
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,806
and even necroses the skin.

19
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,557
What are you doing? I
worked till 4:00 a. m.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,643
Thought I'd put on
fresh underwear.

21
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,020
Please do not tell me
that you are living here.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,856
I'm not. It's
just a safe space

23
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,651
to put my stuff till I
find a permanent place.

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,278
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,215
Please don't say
anything to my mom.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,716
I don't even talk to your mom!

27
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,993
Ah, this whole sister hate
thing may work in my favor.

28
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,686
Okay, just come stay at
Meredith's for a few days.

29
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,712
If you're gonna survive
internship here,

30
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,696
you're gonna need a night
or two of good sleep. Nope.

31
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,332
You at least need to do laundry.

32
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,876
You're offering to
wash my underwear?

33
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,504
We agreed. No special favors.

34
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,340
So even though they may have
technically closed the wound...

35
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,817
Hey.

36
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,913
They may have opened the
door to even more problems.

37
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,555
We're late.

38
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,267
Whoa, whoa! Slow down!

39
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,060
My God. We almost just died.

40
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,180
Have you seen these e-mails

41
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,691
about Nick Marsh's plans
for the residency program?

42
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,443
It's weird. The
Residency Director

43
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,528
is e-mailing about
the residents.

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,322
He wants to push
pre-rounds by an hour,

45
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,907
set up a mixer with
the nursing staff,

46
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,951
and wants to bring
in a yoga instructor.

47
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,995
Oh! When? When will they work?

48
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,205
I mean, he's doing exactly
what I thought he would,

49
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,375
but I just thought he
would, I don't know,

50
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,587
stop by my office or send
me an e-mail or call me.

51
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,798
Sounds like this is not entirely
about the way he does his job.

52
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,967
The job that you offered him.

53
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,969
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

54
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,598
So, I suppose I will
see you ladies tonight.

55
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,810
Did you forget?
Zola's presentation

56
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,979
for the Pacific
Northwest Scholars.

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,732
Her paper is a finalist
for their merit program.

58
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,983
What's the paper about?

59
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,986
Her hero. Dr. Ellis Grey.

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,613
Twist. I don't care.

61
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,074
I'll show up for anything
that celebrates Zola.

62
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,618
I'll see you tonight. See you.

63
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,745
Nurse Krueger
to the O. R. Nurse Krueger to the O. R.

64
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,331
Hello. Listen up.

65
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,375
Dr. Schmitt is your
chief resident.

66
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,751
He's our
only senior resident.

67
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,419
He's gonna be handing
out your assignments

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,338
while I'm doing a
kidney transplant.

69
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,006
Who can name the
top three causes

70
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,342
of end-stage renal disease?

71
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,719
Hypertension, diabetes,
glomerulonephritis.

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,137
He didn't raise his hand.

73
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,014
Yeah, I don't care
about any of that.

74
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,265
Am I correct? Yeah, you are.

75
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,726
Do I get to scrub in?
No, uh, you cannot.

76
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,019
Okay. Have fun, Schmitt.

77
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,108
I haven't slept in two days.

78
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,444
I am answering pages from
six different services,

79
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,489
and I had a cupcake for
breakfast, so no one complain.

80
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,909
Adams, you're with
Dr. Pierce. Kwan's with Ndugu.

81
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,371
Yasuda, report to Owen Hunt.

82
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,207
And, uh, Millin and Griffith,
surgical consult in the pit.

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,835
Uh, two of us for one consult?

84
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,505
Two interns make a whole doctor.

85
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,049
Now, don't embarrass
me or kill anyone

86
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,094
or drop anything
inside a patient.

87
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,515
This is the moment you go.

88
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,060
Come on.

89
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,024
Dr. Kwan.

90
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,860
Yeah. Tell me what you see.

91
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,863
Pericardial effusion?
That's right,

92
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,698
which is compressing
this patient's heart.

93
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,158
What would be your
recommendation?

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,243
Hi! Remember
Mr. Veras? He's back,

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,203
and his trach is infected.
Can you take a look?

96
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,581
Also, a new patient
in 523 needs an echo

97
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,499
and admissions orders
for observation.

98
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,376
Are you talking to me or...

99
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,420
Always assume I'm not.

100
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,713
I have a VATS
lobectomy in an hour.

101
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,506
I pushed that to this afternoon.

102
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,341
Maggie, I already rescheduled
that patient twice.

103
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,718
I double-checked his labs.

104
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,239
A few hours will not
change his status.

105
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,264
Okay, uh, yeah, I
will get it all done.

106
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,557
Thank you. I will
check in with you

107
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,726
after my valve replacement.

108
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,895
We're doing a valve
replacement? What type of valve?

109
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,189
TAVR. But you are on scut.

110
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,274
No special favors,
right? Uh...

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,525
Uh...

112
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,194
All I did was put
in a chest tube.

113
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,779
Was there an
attending in the room?

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,739
It's the E. R., Teddy.
There's about three attendings

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,158
in this area at all times. Was
one specifically watching you?

116
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,327
One specifically has
been barking at me 24/7,

117
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,829
so, yeah, I assumed
she was still here.

118
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,331
Do you need something?
Mika Yasuda,

119
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,167
reporting for
Dr. Hunt's service.

120
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,336
I'm his intern today.

121
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,757
You know, you might want
to find a new service.

122
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,009
Yeah, Dr. Hunt used
to be chief of trauma,

123
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,011
and then he lost his mind,
so now I'm chief of trauma.

124
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,013
Yeah, also, she's my lovely
wife and mother of my children.

125
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,890
Her favorite color is blue.

126
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,016
Did she really
need to know that?

127
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,393
Yes. To humanize you!

128
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,646
According to the Washington
Medical Commission,

129
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,106
if he attempts to do
anything on his own,

130
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,734
he will be reported and
lose his medical license.

131
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,820
Understood?

132
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,321
Oh, so I'm supposed to...

133
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,031
Call an additional attending
for the following...

134
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,242
Intubations, chest tubes,

135
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,328
surgical consults,
I&Ds, NG tubes,

136
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,248
lap repairs, washouts...

137
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,416
Pretty sure this isn't surgical.

138
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,377
Well, don't give up hope yet.

139
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,587
So, when did the, uh...
The vomiting start?

140
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,839
I can't remember.

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,091
Any alcohol last night? Drugs?

142
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,760
We shared a few drinks
while playing "Barn Finders"

143
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,762
at a friend's apartment. Oh.

144
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,889
It's a video game.

145
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,766
You play? Sometimes.

146
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,308
Not at all.

147
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,185
Yeah, we got back
at like 3:00 a. m.,

148
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,521
and, uh, we split some
leftover fried rice

149
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,439
I had in my fridge.
It's from that place

150
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,275
across the street from
the student union.

151
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,652
We are never ordering
from there again.

152
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,072
Any blood in your vomit?

153
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,741
I-I don't know. Here.

154
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,703
Okay, well, we'll get you both
started on some IV fluids,

155
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,288
and then we'll give
you another run...

156
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,456
Okay,
just... Just stay calm.

157
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,709
Okay? Take a deep breath
for me if you can.

158
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,460
Uh, Dr. Griffith,

159
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,337
we need some oxygen
here, please. On it.

160
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,839
Okay.

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,466
What's happening to him?!

162
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,511
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

163
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,682
What the hell is
this? I don't know.

164
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,475
Well, find somebody who does!

165
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,826
Okay.

166
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,953
Hi!

167
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,080
Hi, Pru! Luna, say hi!

168
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,750
Okay, healthy snacks, check.

169
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,710
Uh, sanitizer, check.

170
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,629
This is my kind of mom group.

171
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,633
No endless brunches, no
power walking in full makeup

172
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,135
and earrings and tight leggings.

173
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,221
Alright, waters,
uh, baby wipes, yes,

174
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,015
and, uh, sunscreen.

175
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,725
You are organized.

176
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,518
Not my first rodeo.

177
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,438
Thank you so much for
calling. All I do is work

178
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,650
and watch Link bring home
half the women in Seattle,

179
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,069
which, you know, I'm not one
to judge a choice, but it...

180
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,945
Uh-huh. Okay.
Look, if we hurry,

181
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,989
the girls can go down the slide
while it's still in the shade.

182
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,824
Oh. Uh, are we late?

183
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,869
Yes. Let's power-walk.

184
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,537
Okay.

185
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,045
Did you page both of us?

186
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,547
Uh, I paged Chief Grey.
I paged Dr. Webber.

187
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,708
Did you happen to talk to
each other before doing that?

188
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,345
Uh, never mind. Never
mind. Uh, what do you got?

189
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,431
Um, 19-year-old male with abdominal
pain, vomiting, and chills.

190
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,225
He recently was
experiencing chest pain,

191
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,466
shortness of breath, and a
rash on his abdomen and chest.

192
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay.

193
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,316
What about him?

194
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,401
College roommate.

195
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,735
They ate the same thing

196
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,320
four hours before
both presenting with

197
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,030
food poisoning symptoms,

198
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,283
but he hasn't developed a
rash or shortness of breath.

199
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:17,037
It's on his legs
and his arms, also.

200
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,581
Let's get blood cultures,
get a chest X-ray.

201
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,626
Put him on high-flow oxygen.
Admit him to the ICU.

202
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,838
Call internal medicine and
page us when you're done.

203
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,673
One of us.

204
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,594
Excuse me. Hi.

205
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,431
Do I need all that stuff, too?

206
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,933
So, your intake form says
that you're experiencing

207
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,226
abdominal discomfort,
Mr. Peters?

208
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,811
Harold, please.

209
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,771
But I may know what the
discomfort is from...

210
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,774
There you are! This
hospital's a maze.

211
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Sharon, I told you
to wait in the car.

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,236
And I told you I thought
that was a stupid idea.

213
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,821
I still can't find my phone.

214
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,614
What if the kids call
and need something?

215
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,867
You won't be able to help if
you're on an operating table.

216
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,577
What's wrong with
him? I'm fine.

217
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,245
Probably an ulcer or
something. He says that

218
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,413
every time we're supposed
to go to my mother's.

219
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,873
Your abdomen is distended,

220
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,249
so I'm gonna have
to do an ultrasound

221
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,793
to figure out how
to proceed, okay?

222
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,336
I have three minutes.

223
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,547
And I'm not sure I'm
gonna survive them.

224
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,425
Do I need to remind you
why I'm here, Dr. Hunt?

225
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,885
Well, it's been about 10
minutes since the last time,

226
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,928
so, sure, knock yourself out.

227
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,805
Are you all doctors? Teddy,
this is just an ultrasound.

228
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,224
So then it should go
quick. Hi, I'm Dr. Altman.

229
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,560
Yes, we are all doctors.
And you're all necessary?

230
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,353
No. You know what? Why don't
you just do this yourself?

231
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,813
Well, if I were to
do everything myself,

232
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,525
then no one would
learn. Would they?

233
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,152
We're a teaching hospital.

234
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,653
We should have gone
to Seattle Pres.

235
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh, geez.

236
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,158
I'll be right back.

237
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,953
Dr. Schmitt.

238
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,747
I was supposed to
remove the drains

239
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,208
from Dr. Ndugu's
patient an hour ago.

240
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,376
I have to go round
on Webber's post-ops,

241
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,378
and the nurses keep
texting me angry emojis.

242
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,963
I can't work for
Dr. Hunt because it means

243
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,590
you're also working
for Dr. Altman,

244
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,550
which means you're
working for velociraptors.

245
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,344
They're vicious, can
snap in an instant,

246
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,929
but there is a
mind-game component

247
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,597
going on between those
two that is so deep,

248
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,140
it might destroy
all of civilization.

249
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,144
Short, succinct,
clear sentences.

250
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,647
What? I don't
have time to pee,

251
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,149
and you just said so many words.

252
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,901
Can I be on your service
instead of Dr. Hunt's?

253
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,277
No.

254
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,405
Now get back in there
and do your job.

255
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,328
Thank you. Hey. I
just asked Winston

256
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,956
if he could help on an anterior
approach for a spinal fusion,

257
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,415
and he said to check with you?

258
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,000
He's monitoring a
few patients for me,

259
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,919
and I may need an
assist on a TAVR.

260
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
Well, I can assist on the TAVR.

261
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,966
Out.

262
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,930
Is everything okay with Winston?

263
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,474
He seemed a little... Was
he doing his scissors talk?

264
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,309
I don't know what you mean.

265
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,354
When Winston gets irritated,
he talks like scissors...

266
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,565
Like, every word, it sounds
like snip, snip, snip.

267
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,400
He wants to yell,
but he holds back,

268
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,236
so he just cuts the
air with his words.

269
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,279
I thought he was mad at me.

270
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,990
No, he's mad at me.

271
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,325
I pushed his surgery
because I'm a perfectionist

272
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,203
and I want perfection
for my patients.

273
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,873
And there's no such thing
as perfection in interns,

274
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,583
and there are still
no senior residents,

275
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,793
so I ask perfect Winston.

276
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,879
Yeah, well, I still need someone
to help on my spinal fusion,

277
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,339
so you need to work on all that.

278
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,638
We do have one senior resident.

279
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,557
Dr. Schmitt.

280
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,601
Page him.

281
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,061
And don't eavesdrop
on my conversations.

282
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,442
What happened? He became
completely unresponsive,

283
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,111
and his pressure tanked.
The rash is now everywhere.

284
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,073
Let's start him on pressors.
Push sux, etomidate.

285
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,075
Get me an intubation tray.

286
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,706
Two of you, come around
here. Stand behind me.

287
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,167
Watch exactly what I'm
doing. You want to make sure

288
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,794
you have full visualization
of the vocal cords.

289
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,011
Griffith, come around and
listen for breath sounds.

290
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,144
Bilateral breath
sounds. Okay, great job.

291
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,687
Thank you.

292
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,942
Uh, Chief Grey?!

293
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,740
What the hell is
wrong with this kid?

294
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,753
Hey, I need you to
come back to work now.

295
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,713
I make more money here.

296
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,631
You do not.

297
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:41,677
Uh, as a resident, I made
around 55K a year, before taxes,

298
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,054
when I regularly
worked 80-hour weeks,

299
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,472
and weekends and holidays.

300
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,432
The math sucks,
Levi. Not to mention

301
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,559
I didn't love the stress
that came with it.

302
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,604
If I make a mistake
here, nobody dies.

303
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,898
Taryn, you are a surgeon.

304
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,566
I was a surgeon.

305
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,860
Now I'm a bartender

306
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,862
and you're on the vagina squad.

307
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,740
Was! I was on
the vagina squad.

308
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,326
Now I am chief resident,
general surgery.

309
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,412
Only because I'm
not coming back.

310
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,205
Disagree.

311
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,416
So come back and prove me wrong.

312
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,418
No.

313
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,920
Grey wants you back.

314
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,964
Did she say that?

315
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,050
Meredith is straight,

316
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,177
and I have enough
self-esteem now to know

317
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,972
to only fall for women
who might love me back.

318
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,391
So, thanks, but no thanks.

319
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,351
Wow.

320
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,145
Bartending really is
good for you, huh?

321
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,604
Right?

322
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,356
Please
come back anyway.

323
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,774
No! Oh!

324
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,819
Ugh!

325
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,738
I'm coming, Dr. Pierce.

326
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,905
Bye.

327
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,288
Initially presented
like textbook food poisoning,

328
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,457
and then evolved into
septic shock within hours.

329
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,833
Do we have the
source of infection?

330
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,501
Uh, no. Not yet.

331
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,087
His chest X-ray shows
bilateral pleural effusions,

332
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,964
and he's exhibiting
signs of DIC.

333
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,301
The rash is non-blanching.
It could be petechiae.

334
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,094
I initially thought it was
Steven Johnson Syndrome,

335
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,804
but the rash doesn't
peel with pressure.

336
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,057
Any case reports
of Bacillus cereus

337
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,309
and sepsis after eating rice?
It's not Bacillus cereus.

338
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,728
It's not food poisoning at all.

339
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,148
Have any of you ever seen a
patient bleed from every orifice

340
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,983
after eating bad leftover rice?

341
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,651
Well, then solve it. What?

342
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,445
You and Millin and the
rest of the interns,

343
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,073
hit the research
and figure it out.

344
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,324
Before it's too late.

345
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,122
Hello, Altman.

346
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,084
Well, I'm glad you and
Hunt decided to come back.

347
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,462
I imagine it's hard with everything
he has to go through right now.

348
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,881
Let me guess. Owen thinks
that I'm drinking too much,

349
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,841
so he asked you to intervene.

350
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,468
Thanks. I'm good.

351
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,346
I was just asking
how you were doing.

352
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,265
Well, I have spent the
last six months on my feet

353
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,309
working locum tenens in L. A.

354
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,645
While Owen developed
an artistic penchant

355
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,897
for building sand castles,
which was fun for the kids,

356
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,733
but, honestly, the sand
castles were pretty basic.

357
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,236
And since his legal
team bankrupted us,

358
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,447
Owen and I now have lengthy
arguments about important topics

359
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,992
like whether to buy name-brand
or store-brand shampoo.

360
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,787
Every time I look at his face,
I am filled with such annoyance

361
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,581
that I have to go outside
and pretend to garden

362
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,209
when, really, my kids are
just seeing me rip up plants.

363
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,794
The worst part of
all of it is...

364
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,338
Is that I still don't
want to leave him

365
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,132
because he's the
father of my kids,

366
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,343
and somewhere really deep
down inside, I still love him.

367
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,095
And wine helps me remember that,

368
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,389
so I drink three
glasses a night.

369
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,723
But never at work.

370
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,100
And the kids are
in bed by 8:00,

371
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,518
and I don't get
behind the wheel.

372
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,019
I mean, the riskiest
thing that I may do

373
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,063
is watch too many
puppy videos at night.

374
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,304
Is that a problem for you, sir?

375
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,946
Always good to see you, Altman.

376
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,701
Hey! Adams.

377
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,202
Dr. Shepherd.

378
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,955
I wanted to run
something by you.

379
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,707
About a patient.

380
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,708
I'll catch up.

381
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,382
I found you some
apartments to see.

382
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,633
Mom always said you
were the best liar.

383
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,843
That was bad lying.

384
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,887
Wait, is that a
loft? Eh, kinda.

385
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,638
I think there's some creative
license with the advertising,

386
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,223
but it's near Meredith's.

387
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,975
Uh, great, send it to me.

388
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,811
You can visit, see the
kids, eat for free.

389
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,480
You won't see me cook, but
Meredith's pretty good,

390
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,857
and Maggie makes
dinner on Sundays.

391
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,859
Hey, can you not walk so close?

392
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,943
What's wrong with you?

393
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,696
You're hovering. I'm helping.

394
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,281
The more people see us together,
the easier it's gonna be

395
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,991
for them to figure
out we're related.

396
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,409
I've already been
designated the screw-up.

397
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,037
Please don't make
it worse. Bye.

398
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,788
You know, it could be
toxic shock syndrome.

399
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,415
That would explain the rash.

400
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,335
But there's no liver
or renal dysfunction.

401
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,378
Have you considered
erythema multiforme?

402
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,381
No one asked you. I asked him.

403
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,716
What? Chief Grey told us to.

404
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,593
I will ask everyone

405
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,386
if it prevents my name going
on a death certificate.

406
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,264
So, who's dying?
How can we help?

407
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,934
It's a 19-year-old male,
ate leftover fried rice,

408
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,852
vomited for six hours,

409
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,021
a generalized, purple,
star-shaped rash

410
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,315
all over his body, and is now
in full-blown septic shock.

411
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,316
Ah, he looks pretty
dead already.

412
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,734
That's from bad rice?

413
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,278
I've never seen so much vomit,

414
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,197
and my parents did a
lot of hallucinogens.

415
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,951
And it was like a...
Like a rainbow of vomit.

416
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,161
Like red-brown,
yellow-green, bilious.

417
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,955
I'm done. DRESS syndrome?

418
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,331
No. He doesn't take any meds,

419
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,333
and his eosinophil
count is normal.

420
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,126
- Kawasaki disease?
- No.

421
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,464
Ugh. I have to go
find an attending

422
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,633
to supervise my attending
so they can supervise

423
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,510
me learning nothing.

424
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,886
Have fun.

425
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,429
Rickettsial disease? No.

426
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,056
It's not even your case.

427
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,817
Well, that should tell
you how wrong you are.

428
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,312
Harold, so, your ultrasound
didn't show any abnormalities,

429
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,315
so we're gonna do a CT scan
to get a better look, okay?

430
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,401
Is it possible
to get some privacy?

431
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,195
You and I? Without...
Oh, um, Dr. Yasuda,

432
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,863
can you take Mrs.
Peters to grab a coffee?

433
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,157
Yeah. Mrs. Peters, if you
would just follow me...

434
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,493
Oh! It's here.

435
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,079
I used the app to locate
my phone. It's in here.

436
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,205
Let me call it.
Sharon, please...

437
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,582
Ah, Harold, give me two seconds,

438
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,250
and you can be
alone all you want.

439
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,793
I really need you to leave.

440
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,877
Sharon!

441
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,504
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

442
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,550
Oh, for God's sake,
are you sitting on it?

443
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,011
It sounds like it's
coming directly from yo...

444
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,512
Mm. Harold,

445
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,764
did you stick my
phone up your ass?

446
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,224
Please say no.

447
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,184
You're always on the damn thing!

448
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,394
Oh, my God. We don't even know

449
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,812
what your face
looks like anymore

450
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,647
'cause you're glued
to social media!

451
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,065
Unbelievable.

452
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,692
Ow! Oh, my God!

453
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,153
Page Dr. Altman
so I can retrieve

454
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,154
the  phone.

455
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,156
Hang it up! Yeah. Oh, oh, God.

456
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,034
Okay. Okay. I...

457
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,960
So, are things at
least improving at Grey-Sloan?

458
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,755
How are you doing
it? Doing what?

459
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,215
Not breaking things

460
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,344
and sobbing uncontrollably
and screaming in public

461
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,179
every time you
look at Pru's face

462
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
and think about the world
that she's growing up in?

463
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,604
I try to remember she's
already lost one parent,

464
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,274
and if I did something
to get myself arrested,

465
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,486
no one would be there

466
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,614
to read her "The Pout-Pout
Fish" at bedtime.

467
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,866
I mean, Ben, he just
reads the words.

468
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,534
I do it with the rhythm.

469
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,416
Carina and I did
extend our clinic hours

470
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,585
to accommodate the
patients from out of state.

471
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:35,048
Oh. Are you having to pick
up more hours in surgery,

472
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,259
or has that calmed down now
that the interns are back?

473
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,886
No!

474
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,888
What? I thought you wanted

475
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,932
to be my mom friend.

476
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,142
I'm just
making conversation.

477
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,853
You are using me for
information about the hospital.

478
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,440
You want me to be
your Deep Throat!

479
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,651
I prefer Delta
Source...

480
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,444
an Imperial intelligence source

481
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,198
during the early years
of the New Republic.

482
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,077
Well, you gonna talk or not?

483
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,999
Alright, Harold, let me know

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,418
if you feel any
discomfort, okay?

485
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,627
Physical or emotional?

486
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,129
Uh, we're gonna be fast.

487
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,256
Okay, Yasuda, I need
you to press hard

488
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,590
on the lower left
quadrant, okay?

489
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,467
Don't forget gloves.

490
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,052
I'm beginning to understand
why you did this, Harold.

491
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,430
What? Okay, ready here.

492
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,807
Okay, here we go. Now, Harold,

493
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,642
I'm gonna need you to bear down.

494
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,519
No one should ever say that
to another human being.

495
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,895
And push.

496
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,899
Alright, try forceps
or a balloon catheter.

497
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,359
Push harder, Harold.

498
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,448
Owen, if you can't grasp it,

499
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,574
he's gonna have to go
to the operating room.

500
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,327
You wanna
take that to his wife?

501
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,579
Hmm?

502
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,210
I'm the guy who killed
his college roommate.

503
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,754
They're gonna make
podcasts about me.

504
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,297
He is not dead.

505
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,007
And I believe we can save him

506
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,217
once we know exactly
how to treat him.

507
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,553
Can you tell me anything
you know about him?

508
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,514
Um, he's from Massachusetts.
Parents are divorced,

509
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,975
and I don't ask about it
'cause my parents are divorced

510
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,393
and I don't like
talking about it.

511
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,228
Uh, he's a history major,

512
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,647
loves sports documentaries,
hates coffee, I mean...

513
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,733
Anything you know
about his health.

514
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,152
Oh. Um...

515
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,988
He had syphilis once.

516
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,537
Hello.

517
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,374
Hey. Hi.

518
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,919
How was the, uh,
kidney transplant?

519
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,337
Uh, well, it's
making urine already,

520
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,297
so, you know, on par. Good.

521
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,466
Yeah. Good.

522
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,551
And you're liking
the, um, new position?

523
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,261
I saw all the changes
that you made.

524
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,514
Yeah. Uh, is there an issue?

525
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,556
Not at all.

526
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,518
Okay, good.

527
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,685
Where are you staying?

528
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,312
You know, same place on Union.

529
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,439
Oh. I like that place.

530
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,316
Yeah, you're acting
a little weird.

531
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,692
Excuse me. Chief Grey? Yes.

532
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,945
Um, it's Chase.

533
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,613
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

534
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,907
Good luck. Sorry.

535
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,326
His foot's cold, and
I can't get a Doppler signal

536
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,203
anywhere below the knee.
We don't make a move,

537
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,163
this leg could turn gangrenous.

538
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,791
Any family around?

539
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,794
His mother is on a
plane as we speak.

540
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,922
Well, if she wants
to see her son alive,

541
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,799
that leg's gotta go.

542
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,968
You have to amputate?

543
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,011
You do.

544
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,097
I'm sorry, what?
Cutting something off

545
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,099
is way easier than
reattaching it.

546
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,600
Get him prepped and upstairs.

547
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,527
Advance the guide wire
carefully to the aortic annulus.

548
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,153
It's very
angulated here.

549
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,154
I don't want to injure anything.

550
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,240
It's okay. Just go slowly.

551
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,408
There. Good.

552
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,993
Schmitt, why
aren't you in O. R. 4?

553
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,287
Because I am trying
really hard not to injure

554
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,873
this man's vasculature
in this O. R.

555
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,833
You prepped and studied
for my VATS lobectomy.

556
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,252
And if I remember correctly,
you begged to be my assist.

557
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,795
If you were supposed
to be his assist,

558
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,255
then why are you
in here being mine?

559
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,132
The schedule changed so much.

560
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,967
And you are chief of cardio.

561
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,305
And I play Dungeons & Dragons,
so I follow hierarchy.

562
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,682
And for the record,
I'm very tired.

563
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,059
Please don't say that with
your hands in my patient.

564
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,352
I thought I was helping you.

565
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,104
By taking my assist to be yours?

566
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,314
Winston... Alright,
you know what?

567
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,733
I'll reschedule the
lobectomy again.

568
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,077
Hi.

569
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,079
Oh, uh, Marsh. Yeah.

570
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,082
What exactly is
"mini Grand Rounds,"

571
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,876
and why was I invited?

572
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,586
Uh, we did them in Minnesota.

573
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,880
Interns take turns presenting
on cases to their class.

574
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,424
It helps their skills for rounds
and future lecture capabilities.

575
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,842
So it's good.

576
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,218
Well, what am I supposed to do?

577
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,511
Well, I thought
you could be there

578
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,888
to help me provide feedback.

579
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,140
Look, is this gonna be a thing?

580
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,652
Someone questions me every time
I make a change to the program?

581
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,299
Because I kinda thought
that's why I was hired here.

582
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,376
Look, um, six months ago,

583
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,737
I was trying everything I
could to save this place.

584
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,388
My wife wasn't doing well.

585
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,039
I blamed you for Meredith
going to Minnesota.

586
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,732
I wasn't my best self.

587
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:16,008
I've already apologized
to Meredith about it.

588
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,208
And, um, well, you
deserve the same.

589
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,518
I'm sorry.

590
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,213
I appreciate that,
Dr. Webber, I do, but...

591
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:27,030
it does kinda feel
like there's more here.

592
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:29,598
Oh, no. N...

593
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:31,332
Well, okay, yes.

594
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:33,859
Um, it's none of my business,

595
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:37,345
and I'm not exactly sure what
happened between the two of you,

596
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,581
but, um, she's worth
taking a job for.

597
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,315
If that's why you did it.

598
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,479
And I'd be honored to
join you for feedback.

599
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,404
Okay.

600
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,554
Oh, and, uh, Marsh, uh,

601
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:53,247
program's yours now.

602
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,633
I thought you were getting
to scrub in with Dr. Ndugu.

603
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,010
His wife
rescheduled it.

604
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,848
He's married to Dr. Pierce,
and there are clearly issues.

605
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,017
Ah, do they back-seat-drive
each other's rectals?

606
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,853
What is that a euphemism for?

607
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,356
Nothing. I literally just experienced
that with Dr. Altman and Dr. Hunt.

608
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,733
Why is everyone
married to each other?

609
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,651
Because doctors have no lives

610
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,361
and no time to
meet normal people.

611
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,074
Great. Everything sucks.

612
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,255
Are you flirting with
me on a sick patient's leg?

613
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,216
No. No, no,
no. No, no, no. No.

614
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,052
Crap. No. That is
not me flirting.

615
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,803
That is me being an
encouraging teacher.

616
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,847
Supportive.

617
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,683
In an appropriate way.

618
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,769
Uh, I didn't put a winky
face next to it or anything.

619
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,104
I-I genuinely don't want you
to cut off the wrong leg.

620
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,237
Ten blade, please.

621
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,592
What happened? He just
started breathing really hard,

622
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,344
then he made this choking sound.

623
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,762
Is he dead? He's
in cardiac arrest.

624
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,472
He needs to be intubated.
Should I get Dr. Altman?

625
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,015
No, there's no
time. Mrs. Peters,

626
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,184
I need you to step
outside. But Harold...

627
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,144
We're gonna take
care of him, okay?

628
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,561
Wait, you're
gonna do it? Nope.

629
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,687
I'm gonna walk you
through it now.

630
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,147
Switch with me.

631
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,944
Okay, don't over-think
this, Yasuda.

632
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,779
Make sure you have everything
ready that you need.

633
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,280
Test the tube.

634
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,700
Tube looks good. Stylet.

635
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,661
Okay, grab the scope.

636
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,287
Okay. Other way.

637
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,747
Ah, sorry.
Visualize the cords.

638
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,624
Okay. Ready?

639
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,751
Okay. I can see them.
Take the tube. Insert it.

640
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,671
We don't have much time
here, so one fluid motion.

641
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,797
Trust your instincts
on the angle.

642
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,590
I got it through.

643
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,635
Cuffs up.

644
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,803
Let's start bagging.

645
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,055
Well?

646
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,183
Breath sounds on both sides.

647
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,143
Breath sounds on both
sides. Nice work, Yasuda.

648
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,104
Airway is secured.

649
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,064
All we need to do now is,
uh, get his circulation back.

650
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,649
Good job.

651
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,401
I requested a single room.

652
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,735
Grew up an only child

653
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,489
and have... or had...
Social anxiety.

654
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,826
Dreaded meeting new
people, large parties.

655
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,036
Anytime I got an e-mail
during orientation

656
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,124
with the word "mixer" in the
subject line, I-I panicked.

657
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,668
Then Student Services
assigned me a roommate.

658
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,045
And I almost dropped out.

659
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,214
Till I met Chase.

660
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,757
I know this is gonna
sound really weird,

661
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,385
but you know those
emotional support animals

662
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,429
for people who can't
handle crowded places?

663
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,931
You're comparing
him to... a dog.

664
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,975
He
fixed all my issues!

665
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,936
I mean, he... he showed me how
to walk up to a group of people

666
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,938
and actually talk to them.

667
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,398
We haven't gotten
into a single fight,

668
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,108
and we basically live
on top of each other

669
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,526
inside of a crowded dorm.

670
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,864
I mean, we've had colds
together, flu, athlete's foot,

671
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,948
which I don't know
if you've had, but...

672
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,784
Crowded dorm.

673
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,952
Do you know if Chase received

674
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,079
all of his childhood
vaccinations?

675
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,124
I don't know. Why?

676
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,626
I-Is he gonna be okay?

677
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,502
I hope so!

678
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,130
I know this goes against
everything you've been taught,

679
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,924
but you need to cut harder.

680
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,344
All the way through the
joint, layer by layer.

681
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,305
Griffith?
The food poisoning

682
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,307
was a distractor. Chase
has meningococcus.

683
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,184
His cultures came
back? Not finalized,

684
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,519
but I checked his records. He
was never vaccinated for it,

685
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,563
and his gram stain is showing
gram-negative diplococci.

686
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,815
Meningococcus would
explain the septic shock.

687
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,817
Not to mention, it's common
in college... College dorms.

688
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,778
There's too much blood.
I-I can't control the bleeding.

689
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,113
Oh, God. He's not clotting
properly due to the DIC.

690
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,949
Damn it. I did everything
you told me to!

691
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,992
Clamp. Elevate the leg.

692
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,452
Turn up the tourniquet.

693
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,453
Clamp.

694
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,757
So residents now get
free weekly lunch...

695
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,384
Mm-hmm. Attending mentors,

696
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,302
and an extra hour of sleep?

697
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,179
Mm-hmm. And let me guess,

698
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,390
there's a pinball machine
in the locker room now, too?

699
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,850
No. Oh,
but I did hear a rumor

700
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,395
about monthly passes
to a yoga studio.

701
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,815
You think the
program's gone soft.

702
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,193
No. I think it's finally
headed in the right direction.

703
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,196
I'm angry because I tried

704
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,366
to implement similar
changes at various times

705
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,326
and was always met
with resistance.

706
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,412
You're allowed to
change your mind.

707
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,956
If you miss it,
you can come back.

708
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,212
I started a garden
at Pru's preschool.

709
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,382
We planted daffodils
and sunflowers

710
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,134
and talked about
plant life cycles

711
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,594
and how when you plant a seed,

712
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,432
the roots have to grow
first, before anything else.

713
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,813
I wrote a sex education program
with a community clinic.

714
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:20,234
I'm answering phones for
a women's organization.

715
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,611
I am planting seeds.

716
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,989
Growing roots.

717
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,450
I-I think I'm following, but...

718
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,410
I'm still not ready.

719
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,537
You're still not ready. No.

720
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,497
Okay.

721
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,169
But, Wilson...

722
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,131
I do count you as a mom friend.

723
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,390
Altman paged me.
What do you got?

724
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,642
A central line. I
can't do it on my own.

725
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,519
Alright, okay. You
go ahead, Hunt.

726
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,272
Okay. Thank you.

727
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,232
I'm sure she loves
every moment of this.

728
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,526
You know, she
considers this payback

729
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,654
for the past six months
when I wasn't able to work.

730
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,698
I mean, I was
miserable, Richard.

731
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,658
I'm a trauma surgeon who
was trained in the military.

732
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,744
I am wired to work.

733
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,954
So instead of sitting
around drinking

734
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,623
and looking at people with hate,

735
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,375
I surfed to distract myself.

736
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,004
I built sand castles
to entertain my kids.

737
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,674
I wrote letters to Congress in
support of burn pit legislation.

738
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,676
And I maybe chose

739
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,428
the most expensive
attorney that I could find

740
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,806
to get my career back. And
you know what's hilarious?

741
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,390
She's the one who said
that we should run.

742
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,102
And I listened 'cause she's
my wife and I love her.

743
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,478
I love her despite the fact

744
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,439
that she highlights our
credit-card bill balance

745
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,691
and posts it on the fridge
just so I don't forget

746
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,692
that we're broke.

747
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,486
So now, not only am I

748
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,363
living with someone
who resents me at home,

749
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,117
she stands over me every
second here at work.

750
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,370
Line's in.

751
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,163
Um...

752
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:01,043
I-I suggest you find
some physical space.

753
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,505
Yeah. You got any ideas?

754
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:09,344
Dr. Gear to the
E. R., stat. Dr. Gear to the E. R., stat.

755
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,723
I'm sorry I messed
up your schedule.

756
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,810
Today, or the past six months?

757
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,439
I know I've leaned on
you, and I-I'm sorry,

758
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,443
but you are so talented, and
I needed that in my O. R.

759
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,780
I needed to be able to trust
the person standing next to me.

760
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,115
And we didn't have
any residents.

761
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,992
Now we do. We have interns.

762
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,493
Okay. That makes
it okay to treat me

763
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,704
the way you used to treat me
back when we were at Tufts?

764
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,539
As your resident?

765
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,280
Of course not.

766
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,973
Why do you think
I'm so talented, Maggie?

767
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,313
Because you... you
are.

768
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,922
I mean, you've studied.

769
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,006
You've practiced.
You work really hard.

770
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:52,033
I had a good
teacher. That's why.

771
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:54,680
And you can't expect everyone
to be as good as you and me

772
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,931
unless you teach them.

773
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,183
Unless we teach them.

774
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,601
And I can't do that

775
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,519
if you're constantly
pulling me off my cases.

776
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,646
It's not fair to me. It's
not fair to my patients.

777
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,303
It's not fair to
this next class.

778
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:05,954
Okay.

779
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:07,756
Okay?

780
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,547
I really am a
good teacher, aren't I?

781
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:16,219
Just don't let them
fall in love with you.

782
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,579
Because...

783
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,930
But he's alive.

784
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:33,438
And he doesn't have a
leg? From the knee down.

785
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,006
But you can live without a leg.
And he has that option now.

786
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:38,741
Due to Dr. Griffith's
quick thinking.

787
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,180
The culture came back
for meningococcus.

788
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,291
His mom should be here soon,
but you can go and sit with him

789
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,901
so long as we get you
gowned and gloved.

790
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,510
Thank you. Okay.

791
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:53,489
We'll all need to be
on a four-day regimen

792
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,408
of prophylactic antibiotics
due to the exposure.

793
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,704
How's Millin? I don't know.

794
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,290
Okay, well, Chase had
uncontrollable coagulopathy.

795
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,001
Any one of you would have
struggled to control that bleeding.

796
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,352
So be there for her, because when
it's you that makes the mistake...

797
00:34:08,377 --> 00:34:10,547
I won't. You will,
and when you do,

798
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,217
those people are the only
people who will understand.

799
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:15,053
It's too early to
go numb, Griffith.

800
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:18,891
What if I'm not the
comforting type?

801
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,008
Surely there must be something
that makes you feel better

802
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,700
when you have a day like that.

803
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,147
I have faith in you.

804
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,430
Mmm.

805
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,040
It's the only place in the
hospital that smells good.

806
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:48,422
Like peppermint.

807
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,311
It's eucalyptus.

808
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,217
Stuffed animals are
pretty soft, too.

809
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,983
Come in.

810
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,776
You paged? Yeah. I just, uh...

811
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,820
I wanted to go over
this budget request

812
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,406
for the, um, "Lunch & Learns."

813
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,742
What is a Lunch & Learn?
Well, the department

814
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,995
provides the interns protected
time for lunch once a week,

815
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,498
and rotating attendings
will lecture.

816
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,917
You really want to talk
about this right now?

817
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,294
Do you have
somewhere else to be?

818
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,630
Why does it seem like
you're mad at me?

819
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,423
I'm not.

820
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,177
You haven't said two words
to me since you've been here.

821
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,803
I thought, since
you were here...

822
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,597
That's just it. Wha...
You thought what?

823
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,724
I-I kind of need you to
say it here, Meredith.

824
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,851
You need me to say what?

825
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,394
Great, you're both here.

826
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,562
We're in the middle of
something right now.

827
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,897
I can't work for Teddy.

828
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,815
It's been a day.
It's been a week.

829
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,401
But anyway, I talked an intern
through an intubation today,

830
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,861
and I was pretty
damn good at it,

831
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,863
so let me be a teacher
for these next six months.

832
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,490
That's how I can be helpful.

833
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,450
I won't keep attendings away
from their own services,

834
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,118
and Schmitt won't be
run into the ground.

835
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,329
Let me work for you.
I'll teach labs,

836
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,956
skills, sutures, anything.
I'm your guy to teach.

837
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,833
Because I cannot
stand in that E. R.

838
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,293
With my wife looking
over my shoulder,

839
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,420
or only something
terrible will happen.

840
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,465
So save my marriage, Nick
Marsh. Please, save me.

841
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,011
Okay?

842
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,597
Oh. Sure. Okay. Thank you.

843
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,848
Thank you for your time.

844
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,184
Thank you. Yeah.

845
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,729
If you disagree with any of
the changes, let me know.

846
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,815
Nick. Nick!

847
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,109
Look, I don't have time for all
this back and forth, Meredith.

848
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,902
And based on the way people
just walk on in here,

849
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,945
neither do you.

850
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,697
Good night.

851
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,281
I went numb.

852
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,867
The program shut down,
and we lost a patient.

853
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,328
And you didn't have my back.

854
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,206
You know how many people
I've lost in my life.

855
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,708
And when I watched
you walk away,

856
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,461
and I thought I lost
you, then I went numb.

857
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,798
That's why I didn't
call you for six months.

858
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,260
An then when I saw you in
the surgical corridor, I...

859
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,599
I could feel again.

860
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,728
I know I'm still
in love with you.

861
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,147
I know
my life is crazy.

862
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,773
And I know I can't stop people

863
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,276
from coming in the
door every five minutes

864
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,154
and interrupting
absolutely everything I do.

865
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,034
But I do know that I love you.

866
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,162
So if that's what
you need to hear,

867
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,206
I'll say it, as many times
as you need to hear it.

868
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,046
Can I take you to dinner?

869
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,299
Let me take you to dinner.

870
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,592
No.

871
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,885
No?

872
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,388
But you can take me

873
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,432
to Zola's presentation

874
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,560
for the Pacific
Northwest Scholars.

875
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,770
I'm in.

876
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,689
Okay.

877
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,858
See you tonight.

878
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,861
Tension exists
throughout the entire body.

879
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,867
How it affects you depends
on how you manage it.

880
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,204
Why? It's a coping mechanism.

881
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,830
There was a study
out of Amsterdam

882
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,874
that said when people
touch stuffed animals,

883
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,584
especially if they
have low self-esteem,

884
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,127
it helps relieve anxiety.

885
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,879
I don't have low self-esteem.

886
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,756
I intubated a patient today.

887
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,424
Neither does Adams.

888
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,302
He's sleeping with
Dr. Shepherd, chief of neuro.

889
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,804
What? I... Well, it
makes me feel better.

890
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,598
I'm not. Why... Why...
Why would you think that?

891
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,683
Uh, I saw you two coming out
of the on-call room together,

892
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,393
whispering in the halls.

893
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,646
Unless you have a
different explanation?

894
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,608
- Geez.

895
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,652
Oh, everyone owes me $12
for the stuffed animals.

896
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,111
Nope. Who gives
people a present

897
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,738
then asks them to
pay for it? Hey.

898
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,449
I'm more of a cat person.

899
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,034
Some people can self-regulate

900
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,704
by breathing,
meditation, exercise.

901
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,040
They develop tools that
help them fight the stress

902
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,042
and reduce the pain it causes.

903
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,253
While at the
Clinic in Minnesota,

904
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,506
Dr. Grey conducted six
different clinical trials

905
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,925
that helped lead to advances
in cellular regeneration

906
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,677
related to liver disease.

907
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,346
She began a seventh, but she
unfortunately never completed it

908
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,306
because she started
exhibiting signs

909
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,767
of early onset
Alzheimer's disease.

910
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,020
Early...

911
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,190
Early onset Alzheimer's
disease can be a...

912
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,275
But
not all people

913
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,568
are wired that way. Be a...

914
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,491
Early onset Alzheimer's can be
a genetic illness in which...

915
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,077
Alzheimer's can be a...

916
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,832
Um, it's genetic, which means...

917
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,418
Some people feel
completely overwhelmed by it.

918
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:42,713
Something's wrong. It's
genetic. It means...

919
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,841
It means my mom
and my aunt, they'll get it, too.

920
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,220
They'll get it. They're gonna
die, and I'll have no one.

921
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,347
My aunt and my
mom are gonna die.

922
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,726
They're gonna die.
They're gonna die.

923
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,561
And the tension
freezes their bodies

924
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,062
until they can't move at all.

925
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,397
It's okay.

926
