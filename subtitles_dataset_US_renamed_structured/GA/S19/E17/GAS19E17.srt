1
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,215
As doctors,
we rely heavily on data

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,045
to treat our patients
and minimize risk.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,667
So when there is no data,

4
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:14,945
any move can be extremely scary.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,845
- What are you doing
here this early?

6
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,270
- Getting stood up.

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,554
You?

8
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:22,825
- Couldn't sleep.

9
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,715
- ♪ I've decided to no
longer be contained ♪

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,673
♪ Oh, no ♪
- Enjoy.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,922
We have to solely
practice medicine on a hunch,

12
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:34,310
relying on instincts and hope.

13
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,209
Sometimes it does
not go our way.

14
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,980
- Hey, why do you drive
slower than my grandma?

15
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,143
- I drive the speed limit.

16
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,145
If you need to whine,
maybe find a bus.

17
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,733
- Maybe we should
leave earlier then.

18
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,538
- Maybe someone should
stop staring at themselves

19
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,393
in the mirror all the time.

20
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:51,396
Why you hiding?

21
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:52,856
- I wanna scrub in
on one more surgery

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
before Altman fires me
for moonlighting at Joe's.

23
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,825
- She's not gonna fire you.
Helm took a stand for you.

24
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,885
- I didn't ask her to.

25
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,231
I have no idea what she said.

26
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,232
She doesn't even
know what she said.

27
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,716
She was in a rage blackout.

28
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,925
What makes her think she
can speak for me at all?

29
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,203
- Okay. Go.

30
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,618
Go, go, go, go, go.

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,244
Sometimes it does.

32
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:14,729
Before there was a
cure for diabetes,

33
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,490
scientists followed
their instincts

34
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:17,767
and gave sick children

35
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,908
an experimental
extract called insulin.

36
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,841
As terrifying as it was,

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,603
that risk has now saved
millions of lives.

38
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,880
- Ladies first.

39
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,158
- ♪ Know I'm
landing on my feet ♪

40
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,781
- Oh, I'm good.

41
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,747
But even if
your hunch is strong,

42
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,301
before taking the leap,

43
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,925
some part of you always worries,

44
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:39,926
"What if I'm about to
make a huge mistake?"

45
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,412
- Okay, great. Yeah. We'll
see you then. Thank you.

46
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,071
Okay. Luna's first auditory
verbal therapy is on the books.

47
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,142
I just have to reschedule
her audiologist,

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,120
find her a speech therapist,
get caught up on notes,

49
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,353
and deliver a baby.
- Can I help with anything?

50
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,459
- Um, you wanna deliver a baby?

51
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,229
- I was kind of hoping
for one of the other jobs.

52
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:59,464
- It's okay. I
got it. Thank you.

53
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:00,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,536
- Can you do a
consult in the ICU?

55
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:05,125
- Sure. I've got about 20
minutes before my next consult.

56
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:08,265
- Oh, you're gonna want
to reschedule that.

57
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:11,959
- Hey, uh, about this morning,

58
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,281
I... I get a ride into
work with my roommates...

59
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,342
- Don't care.

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,688
- Uh, okay. I...

61
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,666
Well, I... I thought you'd
yell at me or something.

62
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,357
- Yeah, I don't... I don't
care about the excuse.

63
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,900
I care that you did not show up.

64
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,212
- Right.

65
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,706
- So I'm about to tell
you a bunch of things

66
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,869
I need you to do today,

67
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,251
so I would suggest
you write it down.

68
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,909
Um, round on my post-ops,
then check with pathology

69
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,325
to see if Mr. Kane's
biopsy results are back in.

70
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,016
After that, I need you to review

71
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,778
tomorrow's patients' PT/INRs.
Tell me if anything looks off.

72
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,814
And then Sarah
Hawkins in bed seven,

73
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,232
when her blood sugar stabilizes,

74
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,024
turn off her insulin drip.

75
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,200
And put these notes
into the charts, 'kay?

76
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:48,098
And, Adams?

77
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,514
I hardly yell.

78
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,691
- Okay, the patient in
bed three can go home.

79
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,555
Just follow-up in the
clinic in two weeks.

80
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,248
Dr. Kwan?

81
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:03,390
Um, I... I haven't had a
chance to just say thank you

82
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:06,910
for stopping that patient
when he came after me.

83
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,543
- Oh, no, no, no.
It... it was nothing.

84
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,398
- It was not nothing. It
was very much something.

85
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:15,160
And I am grateful, so thank you.

86
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:23,789
- Maxine?

87
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:24,928
- Oh.

88
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,136
Call me Max.

89
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,587
Maxine makes me feel
like a grandmother,

90
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,761
which I am, of course,

91
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,763
but no need to
broadcast the fact.

92
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,144
- Are you looking for Jules?
- No.

93
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:35,674
And don't you dare
call her down here.

94
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:36,738
I don't want to worry her.

95
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:37,986
- Well, is everything all right?

96
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,875
- Well, I woke up
feeling a bit dizzy.

97
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:45,673
I'm sure it's nothing but at
my age, better safe than sorry.

98
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,371
- Well, let's take a
look. Come with me.

99
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,021
- But don't I need to check-in?

100
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,954
- Oh, no, no. You
are VIP. Come on.

101
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,371
Oh, finally.

102
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,063
Right over here.

103
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:58,548
- Sorry, sorry.

104
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,043
- What's with the
emergency meeting?

105
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,413
- We have an intern problem.

106
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:03,726
- Oh, is this about
Yasuda working at Joe's?

107
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,104
Because from what I understand,

108
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:06,463
it was only a couple
of weeks and it's over.

109
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,927
- Yasuda was working at Joe's?
- Yes.

110
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,259
- I thought Helm
worked at Joe's?

111
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,284
- And Yasuda.

112
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,597
- Why does any
surgeon work at Joe's?

113
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,599
- Because the system is broken.

114
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,428
And according to
these, they have to.

115
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:17,601
- What is this?

116
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,983
- It's the intern
surveys of the program.

117
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,468
I asked Schmitt to hand them out

118
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:22,646
and these are the results.

119
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,541
- "The lockers are from 1955."

120
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,613
- "Need low-fat oat
milk in the cafeteria."

121
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,788
- "More hypoallergenic
pillows in the on-call room."

122
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:34,274
- This isn't a spa, Altman.

123
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:35,999
I wouldn't put much
stock in these.

124
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:38,278
- Yeah, I didn't
until I read this one.

125
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,624
Uh, here we go.

126
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,315
"Our salary doesn't even equal

127
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,766
the average cost of
living in Seattle."

128
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,388
- Well, that can't be right.

129
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:46,907
- It is.

130
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,634
They included research.

131
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,095
- The patient was in a wingsuit
accident in Sun Valley, Idaho.

132
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,604
- Wingsuit? Like, skydiving?
- More like BASE jumping.

133
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:57,124
He slammed into a granite
wall at high velocity.

134
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,653
- I'd question his
personal choices,

135
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:00,276
but people like that
keep me in business.

136
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,439
Any major head injuries?

137
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:02,577
- Miraculously, no.

138
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,269
He was initially stabilized,

139
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,513
had wash-outs, and was
splinted at Boise General,

140
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,611
but they didn't have the
resources to do the rest.

141
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,345
- What'd he break? Femur?
Tibia? Humerus? Pelvis?

142
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,313
Yes.

143
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,973
- Don't worry.

144
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,457
Feels worse than it looks.

145
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:39,235
- So, you and Jules, huh?

146
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,202
She's quite the catch.

147
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,549
- It's not like that.

148
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,895
We're just friends.

149
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,967
- Friends with...
What'd they call it now?

150
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,382
"Benefits"?

151
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,246
- She told you that?

152
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,663
- You know us girls;
we spill the tea.

153
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,182
- Ms. Anderson.

154
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,391
It's good and not
good to see you again.

155
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,944
You feeling a little woozy?

156
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,913
- Well, it's not bad, really,
but after the last go-around,

157
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,915
I don't want to
take any chances.

158
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,848
- She's a bit tachy.
BP is slightly low.

159
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:10,197
- 'Kay, um, you know what?
Open your mouth for me.

160
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,510
Yeah, you're a
little dehydrated.

161
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,488
So as long as you're here,
we'll just run a few tests,

162
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,765
make sure nothing
else is going on.

163
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,100
- 'Cause I'm a VIP.

164
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,930
Exactly.

165
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:22,105
Uh, let's run a CBC,
CMP, urinalysis,

166
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:24,487
and give a bolus of IV fluids.

167
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,431
Uh, I'll come back and check
on you in a little bit.

168
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,318
If you need anything,
Dr. Kwan's your guy.

169
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:29,975
- Okay.

170
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,047
- So what else has
Jules told you?

171
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,566
- Nope. Can't tell you.

172
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,775
- But you just said...
- Sorry.

173
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,812
It's... what did she call it?

174
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,124
It's girl code.

175
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,128
- Sam Sutton, 44,

176
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:47,579
wingsuit versus
boulder, 24 hours ago.

177
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:50,237
GCS, 15, no evidence of TBI.

178
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,308
Has a left-sided pneumothorax
with a chest tube

179
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,896
placed at the other hospital.

180
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,588
Sustained multiple fractures
to all four extremities, ribs,

181
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,314
as well as stable
spinal fractures.

182
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,902
- Sam, this is Dr. Lincoln.

183
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,974
He is Chief of
Orthopedic Surgery.

184
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:04,330
- Do you mind if I take a look?

185
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:06,046
- Please.
- All right.

186
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,255
Have we ordered CT angio
on all four extremities,

187
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,336
check for blood flow?
- Dr. Hunt did this morning.

188
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,845
- All right.

189
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,709
Okay.

190
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,205
- Yeah, I can wait to
remove the dressings

191
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,507
until we're in the OR.

192
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:21,337
Is it annoying is if say
you are extremely lucky?

193
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,340
- Say it. He has,
like, 50 times.

194
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,158
- You tried to glide
through a 2-meter hole

195
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:27,550
in the side of a mountain.
- Oh.

196
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,488
Well, you could have
been right there with me.

197
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,278
Kwame was my copilot
in the Air Force

198
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,659
and now we're wingsuit buddies.

199
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,695
- Wait, you mean
a literal wingman?

200
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,973
- Except I prefer to go
around the giant rocks.

201
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,457
- How's it look?

202
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:41,012
You think I'll be back to BASE
jumping in a month or two?

203
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,703
- Uh...
- Kidding.

204
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:43,961
I know I'm lucky to be here.

205
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:45,637
But I did promise my nephew

206
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,812
I'd teach him how to ride
his bike this summer.

207
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,055
Like to make good on
that. What do you think?

208
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:53,058
- Um, I'll take a closer look
at your scans and X-rays,

209
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:56,303
but I gotta be straight with
you, the damage is extensive.

210
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,995
- If anyone can help,
Sam, Dr. Lincoln can.

211
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,825
He is the best.

212
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:05,485
- I'll do everything I can.

213
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,595
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah?

214
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:13,952
- Can I ask you
something real quick?

215
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,840
- Of course.

216
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,049
- He's the surgeon who
operated on the Tank.

217
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:19,751
Should we get a second opinion?

218
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,398
- Dr. Lincoln is an exceptional
surgeon with a stellar record.

219
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,090
And the best of us
can have a bad day.

220
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:26,851
- Hmm.

221
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,614
Every time Sam's mind
takes him to a dark place,

222
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,582
it's his body that
ends up saving him;

223
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,929
marathons, martial
arts, diving off cliffs.

224
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,759
He needs his limbs and
I need him to live.

225
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:42,798
So don't have a bad day.

226
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:46,077
- I will do my best and

227
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,803
my best is pretty damn good.

228
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,407
Page me when those
scans are up, please.

229
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:57,157
- Yeah.

230
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,885
- Oh, um, Adams
gave me these, uh...

231
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,370
These notes that you scribbled
with, like, wedding stuff.

232
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,244
I... I spilled a little
bit of kombucha on them.

233
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:08,340
So if you wanted, you can
text me and when you...

234
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:13,380
I'm... I'm your new
Maid of Honor now.

235
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:15,762
Did he not tell you?

236
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,143
- He did not.

237
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,457
- Okay. Uh, well,
nothing to worry about.

238
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,356
I am not going to
do the blood thing.

239
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:28,119
In fact, I am not
going to do anything.

240
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:31,018
Unless you text me.

241
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,296
FYI, I am partial to cat emojis.

242
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,349
- Hey, do you think
they're gonna be in there

243
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,179
for a long time?
- According to the OR schedule,

244
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:44,870
they all cleared their
electives for the morning.

245
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:46,527
But it only takes five
minutes to fire someone,

246
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,759
so who knows.

247
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,599
- I just... I just can't
read Marsh's handwrit...

248
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,831
Do you know what this says?

249
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,326
- I'm about to lose
two jobs this week.

250
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,145
I really don't feel
the need to help you.

251
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,181
- How about for a liver
transplant recipient

252
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,976
on the fifth floor?
- I can't read that.

253
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,738
- Huh. I don't remember
assigning either of you to

254
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,085
the service that takes care
of patients in the hallway.

255
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,638
- Okay.

256
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,057
Okay, but how good are you at
reading Marsh's handwriting?

257
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,125
- "Check Prograf level
and stop Protonix."

258
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,024
- Thanks.

259
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,132
- How many bones did
he actually break?

260
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,618
- I've counted 75 so far.

261
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:21,068
He's got comminuted fractures
in all the long bones.

262
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,623
- Plus the rib and spinous
process fractures too.

263
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,428
- Yeah, we don't have to
worry about those for now.

264
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,695
They'll heal on their own.

265
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,742
- It's incredible that
his spine is still intact.

266
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,802
- Nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

267
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,977
It's like...
- He's a jigsaw puzzle.

268
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,531
A broken one, obviously.

269
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,153
But we can put him back together

270
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,155
one surgery at a time.

271
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:41,571
- Wait you're... You're
gonna do this in stages?

272
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,435
- Well, uh, we'll
need to reconstruct

273
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,989
his right femur first,

274
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,302
using cadaver bone to
fill in this defect here.

275
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,856
Once that's done, we'll wash out

276
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,513
and fix the left extremity
since its already open.

277
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,136
Then we'll go in the next day

278
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,967
and fix the left
femur and tib, fib.

279
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,005
And the right extremity and
digits can wait for last

280
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,385
since they're stable for now.

281
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:05,285
- Um, why not fix all
four extremities at once?

282
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,080
I mean, isn't there
risk of sepsis

283
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:09,565
from the open wounds if we wait?

284
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,023
- Well, if... If
you put him under

285
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,706
for an extremely
long period of time,

286
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:15,295
you're looking at a high risk
of anesthesia complications:

287
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,849
bleeding, clots.

288
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:21,163
- Life over limb.
- Exactly.

289
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:24,373
And if the bone and
tissue loss is too severe,

290
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,307
we may have to amputate.

291
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,139
- No. No way. I'm
not doing that.

292
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,141
- You're not doing what?

293
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,833
- I don't want one
of my arms or legs

294
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,386
to die waiting in line.

295
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,699
- Well, no. I'm not saying
that that will happen,

296
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:40,883
I'm saying it could happen.

297
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,115
I wouldn't be doing my job if

298
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,782
I didn't put all the risks
on the table for you.

299
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,877
Trust me, this is
the safer option.

300
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,845
- Compared to what?

301
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:49,023
- Is there another option?

302
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,409
- We could do all
the repairs at once,

303
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,952
but it is a much longer surgery.

304
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,369
- Which I strongly do
not recommend due to

305
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,888
the possible complications...

306
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,891
- But waiting also
has its downsides.

307
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,169
Muscle death from
such a severe injury

308
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:04,275
could lead to potentially
fatal consequences

309
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:07,796
or you could get sepsis
from the open wounds.

310
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,590
- Those are also
heavy complications.

311
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,144
- Yes, but we would...

312
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:14,078
- I was trained to assess major
risks and take them anyway.

313
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:17,046
So let's do this.
All or nothing.

314
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,585
- Wow. I think they're starting

315
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:30,473
Dr. Lincoln's
wingsuit surgery soon.

316
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,475
- Uh-huh.

317
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,970
- Mentioning it in
case you thought

318
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,755
maybe I could go
up there for a bit?

319
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,032
- No.

320
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,274
- To observe?

321
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,275
For my education?

322
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,312
There's, like, 91 broken bones.

323
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,383
- That's cool. But still no.

324
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,422
Ms. Anderson, uh, I'm afraid
your urinalysis came back

325
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,838
positive for a UTI.

326
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:53,082
- But I always pee after sex.
- And that's good.

327
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,671
But you can also get a
UTI from dehydration,

328
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,466
especially as we get older.

329
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:01,021
- I drink all the
time; tea, mint juleps.

330
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,334
- Those are diuretics.
They cause dehydration.

331
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:04,818
Yeah.

332
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,751
- I know. I'm just kidding.

333
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,685
Yeah, I admit, I could be
more diligent about water.

334
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,663
- Well, we're gonna put
you on an oral antibiotic

335
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:13,620
and some more IV fluids, 'kay?

336
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,933
Dr. Kwan will be nearby
if you need anything.

337
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,632
- Don't be mad at Adams.

338
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,771
- No, I'm not.

339
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,187
I probably shouldn't
have asked him.

340
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,707
- You definitely shouldn't have.

341
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,331
- Just wanted to go through
it with a friend who knows me.

342
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,195
- Well, I know you.

343
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,922
Unless you meant a friend who's
had their tongue in your mouth,

344
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,338
because I could be convinced.

345
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,031
Okay, quick. What's your sign?

346
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,480
- Taurus.
- Oh, that tracks.

347
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,897
Film or TV?
- Sleep.

348
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,426
- Fair. What's your
favorite crystal?

349
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,313
- What are you doing?

350
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:52,693
- I'm getting to know you.

351
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,074
- How's it going?

352
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:57,215
Anybody have a funny
joke, a good story?

353
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:58,907
- Uh, it's just a
little while longer.

354
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,574
We're making sure that
there's blood flow

355
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,945
in your extremities.

356
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,636
- Since I have a minute, listen.

357
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,432
I'm worried about Kwame.

358
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,090
He's my ride or die and...

359
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,437
I might die.

360
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:14,135
So I'm gonna give you
his wife's number.

361
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:15,924
And if I die,

362
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,512
I need you to call her.

363
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,411
If I die, I need you
to make sure that

364
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,585
she comes to pick him up
because he will be a wreck

365
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,071
and he won't be able
to drive himself safely

366
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,659
and he is too proud
to call her himself.

367
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:31,180
Can you do that for me?

368
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,803
- I'll take the number,

369
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,047
but hopefully, we
won't have to use it.

370
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,981
- How's it look?

371
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,397
- CT angio shows signs
of diminished blood flow

372
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,399
all over the place.

373
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm still trying to
wrap my head around it.

374
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:48,508
- We need to get him in
OR as soon as possible.

375
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,615
Staged surgeries.

376
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:55,066
Then you tell him we
could do it all at once.

377
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,656
- It's what he wants.
- He wants to live, Hunt.

378
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:02,039
And staged surgeries
is how he lives,

379
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,006
one manageable piece at a time.

380
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:07,320
- If he loses his limbs,
if he can't jump...

381
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,495
In the Army, I was trained
to run on adrenaline,

382
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,291
risk, and terror, and
when I got home...

383
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,363
War makes you alive
and dead, Link.

384
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,641
And regular life
gets dull really fast

385
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,574
when you come home from that.

386
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,862
The thrill of being
a trauma surgeon is

387
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,233
the only thing that saved me.

388
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,821
Sam is not a daredevil.

389
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,444
He is a veteran
coping with trauma.

390
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,308
And even if he can
never jump again,

391
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,586
he needs the hope that
there is something out there

392
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,142
that can make him feel
more alive than dead.

393
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,663
- Get out.
- What?

394
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,632
- You're not an orthopedic
surgeon so get out.

395
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,127
- Are you refusing
to do the surgery?

396
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,187
'Cause the longer that we...
- No, I'm refusing to

397
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,224
waste more time talking to you

398
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,985
when I need to figure out
how to do the damn thing.

399
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:54,542
I will call you when I need you.

400
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,370
But, respectfully,
Hunt, get out.

401
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,594
- My first idea was
to appeal to Catherine

402
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:17,217
and to the foundation.
- Well, residents' salaries

403
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,392
are government-funded and
they always have been.

404
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,428
And, I mean, money may be tight,

405
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,705
but when you're in training,

406
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,569
you don't need a fancy car.

407
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,295
I mean, you eat a
lot of canned soup.

408
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,056
- Grilled cheese.
- Pasta.

409
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,403
- Cereal.
- See? I mean, we all did it.

410
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,163
And besides, a hospital covers

411
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,200
a resident's
malpractice insurance.

412
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:35,891
They have free parking,

413
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,999
meal stipend of up to $15 a day.

414
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:43,692
- Where can you get three
meals a day for $15?

415
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,900
- Cereal.
- Pasta.

416
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,119
- Okay, neither one
of you are helping.

417
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:47,154
Oh, shoot.

418
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,663
I got a 911 in
the ICU. Gotta go.

419
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,217
- Oh, hey.

420
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,736
I'll tell you another benefit
they have that we never got.

421
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,635
The hospital pays the residents

422
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,500
to have four weeks
paid vacation a year.

423
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:03,298
Uh, yeah, that started
when I was coming up.

424
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,817
My great-aunt died

425
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:09,269
and I asked for a week
to go help my mom.

426
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,202
- And did you?
- When I asked,

427
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,415
my attending asked me if I knew
why we were called residents.

428
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,900
"Because we live
in the hospital."

429
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,159
- Did you go to the funeral?

430
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,145
- I did not.
- Mm.

431
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,492
Did I know the
attending at that time?

432
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,598
- It was you.

433
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,226
But the one that got away...

434
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,710
That was Marshall.

435
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,954
We met in pre-law.

436
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,819
- You were a lawyer?
- Oh, heavens, no.

437
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:44,925
But a lot of good-looking
young men wanted to be.

438
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,375
No, I...

439
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,447
I preferred the literature
classes I took on the side.

440
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:53,072
So I ended up teaching
Austen and Miller.

441
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,315
Marshall, well,

442
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:58,249
he had a fire in his belly.

443
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:02,357
Confident and strong
and so handsome.

444
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,224
I never told him
how I felt, though.

445
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,502
- Why not?

446
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,091
- I was waiting

447
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:15,887
for him to come and
sweep me off my feet.

448
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,994
Too many romance
novels, I suppose.

449
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,686
Some days I still kick myself.

450
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,516
- Coming through.
- Trauma two,

451
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,966
Hang two units of blood.
- Check his pulse.

452
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,210
- How exciting.

453
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,005
- How's his airway?
- Go.

454
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,801
Go on. I'll be fine.

455
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,872
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

456
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,150
Come back and tell
me all about it.

457
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,119
- Okay. I'll come right
back and check on you.

458
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,893
- Why am I quicker to
answer a page than you?

459
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,067
- I just saw it. What happened?

460
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,531
- You failed to
follow my directions,

461
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,346
that's what happened. I told
you to check her blood sugar

462
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,968
so you would know when to
turn off the insulin drip.

463
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,315
- Crap. I just hadn't
gotten there yet.

464
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,764
- Yeah, I asked you
to do that hours ago.

465
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:55,788
And because you didn't,

466
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,112
she went into
hypoglycemic shock.

467
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,414
- Is she okay?
- For now.

468
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:01,392
- No, no. Dr. Marsh, I...
I swear I was just...

469
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,762
- No, I don't want excuses.

470
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,764
I don't want 'em. I want
effort. I want change.

471
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:06,283
I offered to help you.

472
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:08,295
I sat with you and I gave
you advice on how to improve.

473
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,253
I have rooted for you
because I know you can.

474
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,359
So when you continue to
be distracted and late

475
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:14,957
and make careless mistakes...
- I'm trying.

476
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,431
- Try harder!

477
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:23,921
If you want me on your side,
then you need to grow up.

478
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,026
So get your meds right.

479
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,132
- My meds?

480
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,549
- You're clearly struggling
with your ADHD, so fix it,

481
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,690
or you risk losing your career
before it's even started.

482
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,852
- Two of my co-residents
were pregnant when I came up.

483
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,258
My chief told me if I
could keep my legs together

484
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,846
I would be asked to scrub in
at least five times a week.

485
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,849
Ooh, remember Davidson
from Vascular?

486
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,782
Oh, gosh.

487
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,614
- He once asked if I had
been a good girl that year.

488
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:05,134
And if I had, I should ask
Santa for some surgical skills.

489
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:06,791
- No.
- Ew, gross.

490
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,000
- At my intern orientation,

491
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,382
a senior resident played a video

492
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,282
of the people running with
the bulls in Pamplona.

493
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,732
And even on that grainy film,

494
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,529
you could see three
people get gored by bulls.

495
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:24,257
He said, "This is what your
internship is gonna be.

496
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,776
"Every day you're gonna wake up,

497
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:26,994
"you're gonna start to run,

498
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:29,020
and hope you don't
anger one of the bulls."

499
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:31,885
- We are not bulls! These
are horrible stories.

500
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,311
And they probably
don't even account for

501
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:35,544
half of what we experienced.

502
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:38,444
Yes, there is something to
be said for... for family,

503
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:41,964
and tradition, and adversity
making people stronger.

504
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:44,035
But if our interns
are experiencing

505
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,728
an ounce of the abuse
that we suffered, we...

506
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,764
- I yelled at Yasuda.

507
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,145
She dropped a retractor

508
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,596
and I kicked her out of
the OR and off my service.

509
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,974
- Well, you had a lot going on.

510
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,599
Doesn't make it okay.

511
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,680
- It doesn't, and that's
why we have to do something.

512
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:59,672
- Um, excuse me for a minute.

513
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:04,642
Hi.

514
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,679
Hi, you okay?

515
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:09,544
- Hey, have you seen Dr. Marsh?

516
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,511
- No.

517
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,479
- Do I have ADHD?

518
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,860
- Yeah, I see it.

519
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,424
- I forgot to turn
off an insulin drip

520
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:20,382
and a patient went into
hypoglycemic shock.

521
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,315
- And you still work here?

522
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,834
Do you know how many classmates

523
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,836
I've served fries to
while wearing a paper hat?

524
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:26,837
A lot.

525
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,494
It wasn't fun, but I did it

526
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,427
because I was determined
to be a surgeon.

527
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,429
And now I have made
it all the way here

528
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,086
and half of the surgical
chiefs are meeting about me

529
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:36,616
because I took a second
job to make ends meet.

530
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,089
But you,

531
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,299
you almost kill someone
but it doesn't matter

532
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,784
because you're related
to surgical legends.

533
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,431
- You're gonna be
working on this patient

534
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:01,078
until you retire.

535
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,219
- I heard. 91.

536
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,945
- Uh, 93.

537
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,844
I just found two more hairline
fractures in his pelvis.

538
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:12,503
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Great.

539
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,850
- Hunt said you're gonna
repair all four limbs at once.

540
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:18,095
- Yeah, I really wish
Hunt would shut up.

541
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:21,616
I'm the one who has to plan a
potentially 19-hour surgery.

542
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,973
I'm the one who has to consider
the risks of putting a patient

543
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:25,792
under anesthesia for
that amount of time.

544
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,794
I have to plan for every
possible catastrophe:

545
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:30,590
stroke, PE, heart attack,
and 50 other complications

546
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,903
screaming through my head.

547
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,043
And you'll be the one

548
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,563
who would lose a patient like
you lost Jermaine Talbott.

549
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,979
And then you would have
lost the Tank and this guy

550
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:41,877
with everybody watching.

551
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:44,708
- It's not an unlikely scenario.

552
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:48,746
- Okay, but in the scenario
where everything goes well,

553
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,059
what do you need?

554
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:53,544
- To grow an extra pair of arms.

555
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:55,581
Or three.

556
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,654
Two teams. One to help
me reduce and repair

557
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,069
the fractures in one extremity

558
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,382
and one to position the
next extremity ahead of time

559
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,245
and begin the wash-out process.

560
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,075
Plus, our best person to perform

561
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,111
vascular anastomoses
and rotational flaps.

562
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,010
Not to mention
someone to help me

563
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,839
place the osteoarticular graphs.

564
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,323
And a full anesthesia team

565
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,946
to care of the
resuscitation process

566
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:19,570
throughout the whole thing.
It's at least six surgeons.

567
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,608
- Well, you've got one more.

568
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,230
- Thought you had
to deliver a baby?

569
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:25,542
- I did.

570
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,062
Mae Ashley, 6 pounds, 8
ounces. She is beautiful.

571
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,410
'Kay. Who else you need?

572
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:39,832

00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,563
Lincoln says it's important
to plan the work...

582
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:13,037
- So you can work the plan.
Yeah, I've heard it before.

583
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:15,350
I know that you're worried,

584
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,973
and I'm guessing it's related
to that football player,

585
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:19,596
Jermaine Talbott.

586
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:23,323
And you're thinking whether
another long surgery

587
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,016
on a guy who's supposedly
in shape could go south.

588
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,259
And I'm guessing
you're wondering if

589
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,986
Lincoln is the right
guy for the job.

590
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,574
- Uh...

591
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,334
you're not wrong.

592
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,475
- I know you better
than you think.

593
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,614
And if it helps,

594
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:40,720
my last ortho surgery
was an amputation.

595
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:43,033
And I think you know
I'm really hoping

596
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,655

- You know and yet your patient
was wandering the halls?

601
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,499
- I know and it
won't happen again.

602
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:02,431
You're lucky I owe you one.

603
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,710
- Dr. Kwan, welcome back.

604
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,608
- Max, I'm so sorry I
was gone for so long.

605
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:09,922
- Even though you were
expressly told not to leave.

606
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,581
- Oh, don't be silly.
I had a terrific time.

607
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:17,619
I even ran into one
of my favorite people.

608
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:21,623
Benson, this is
my grandson, Hugh.

609
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,039
He's a doctor too.

610
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:27,387
- Ms. Anderson, I'm
Dr. Schmitt, remember?

611
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,218
- Hugh, tell them
about the time that

612
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:33,739
you helped save that man's
life on the airplane,

613
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:37,708
when he choked on,
what was it, a grape?

614
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,745
- I'll tell them.

615
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:42,264
Um, let's put her on
telemetry, get blood cultures,

616
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:44,122
and start her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

617
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:45,854
- She's more
hypertensive and tachy.

618
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,200
No, she's definitely septic.

619
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,893
Admit her to the ICU right now.
- Is she...

620
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:52,378
- She has delirium from the UTI.

621
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,660
- So your labs are looking good.

622
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,904
You're ready for takeoff.

623
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,561
To the OR.

624
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,459
Sorry.
- Me too.

625
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,495
You're giving Kwame
stiff competition

626
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,945
in the dad joke category.

627
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,809
- Hey, my kids
think I'm hilarious.

628
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:11,121
Mm-hmm.

629
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,674
- I'm getting paged to the ICU.

630
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:13,882
It's a 911.

631
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,919
- Well, go. I've got this.

632
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:18,892
How many kids do you have?

633
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,993
- Uh, three. And
one on the way.

634
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:22,331
And they love their Uncle Sam.

635
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,376
- And I have pitched
the name Sam every time.

636
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,344
Maybe if I don't make
it out of this surgery,

637
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:28,722
you and Kelly'll finally do it.

638
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:30,865
- Ah, don't say that.
You gon' make it.

639
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:33,108
- I plan to.

640
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:36,318
But I've been lucky enough to
have a life full of adventure

641
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,320
and if this is where
that luck ends...

642
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,668
- Hey, Griffith, can
you check to see if

643
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,773
the OR is ready? And
we will take him up.

644
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,257
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

645
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,983
Hi.

646
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:49,608
- Excuse me, who are you?

647
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:53,612
- Oh, I am Dr. Wilson. I
am one of your surgeons.

648
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,096
It's nice to meet you, Sam.

649
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:56,753
- This may come
across as forward,

650
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:59,307
but I might be dying
in the next 18 hours,

651
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:01,965
so I'm gonna ask.
Are you single?

652
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,449
Remember, I might be dying.

653
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,865
So if you're not, you could lie.

654
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:08,937
- I'm single.

655
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,525
- Great.

656
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:11,778
Now I have something
to live for.

657
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,362
Excuse me.

658
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,399
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

659
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,090
- It's okay. You've
got good timing.

660
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,343
- Yeah, we were just
talking about you...

661
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:26,921
- I have made mistakes.

662
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,370
I accept that responsibility.

663
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,545
I accept that there
will be consequences

664
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:31,843
when I don't do things right.

665
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:33,041
But right now, it feels like

666
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,352
the biggest mistake
that I have made

667
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,033
is not having enough
money to work here.

668
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:37,586
I wasn't born with
a silver spoon.

669
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:40,348
I don't have the family
pedigree to fall back on.

670
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:41,763
And my student loans are real,

671
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:43,534
and the risk of my
parents losing their home

672
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,423
if I can't make my loan
payment is also real.

673
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,641
And... and what? The promise
of an attending's salary

674
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,806
ten years down the line?

675
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:52,360
That doesn't do anything
for me right now.

676
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:54,683
I think you all know that I
bust my ass for this program.

677
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,640
And I will continue
to devote myself to

678
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:58,573
becoming an excellent surgeon.

679
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,956
But that devotion has to
include working a second job.

680
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:04,475
- Well, actually, it doesn't.

681
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:05,925
- I quit.

682
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,927
Can't fire me 'cause I quit.

683
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,414
- You're not getting fired.

684
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:14,209
You're getting a grant.

685
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,591
- We are starting an
emergency relief fund

686
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,248
for any resident
that might need it.

687
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,866
It's not gonna pay
off all your loans,

688
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,803
but it will help make ends meet.

689
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:25,289
And we would like for you
to be the first recipient.

690
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:28,016
- Unless you've quit.

691
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:29,293
- No.

692
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,467
No, I don't quit.

693
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,090
I rescind my quitting.

694
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,367
Thank you.

695
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,992
You have no idea how
much that means to me.

696
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,373
- Well, we kind of do.

697
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,928
Sometimes we just...
We need reminders.

698
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,413
- Yeah.

699
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:50,211

700
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:54,008

I got your page, and what...

701
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:55,561
Max?

702
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,597
- ♪ Trying to get back

703
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,427

705

00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,020
- The cadaver graphs ready?

707
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:08,643
- Thawed and prepped.
Sam's ready too.

708
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:12,647
- Dr. Lincoln...

709
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,073
are you sure this
is the right plan?

710
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,167
There are so many risks.

711
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:16,903
And when we operated
on Jermaine Talbott...

712
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:19,067
- Griffith, we all
know what happened.

713
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,390
I'm sure Dr. Lincoln's replayed
that surgery in his mind

714
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:22,830
hundreds of times.

715
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:24,669
That was a complication that
could have happened to anyone

716
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,765
at any time and he
doesn't need an intern

717
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:29,388
questioning his skills,
professionalism, or his plans.

718
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,246
- Except it's not my
plan, Hunt, it's yours.

719
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,254
- Dr. Hunt, what I meant was...
- Griffith!

720
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:35,739
If you don't share my
confidence in Dr. Lincoln,

721
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,879
I suggest you keep
it to yourself.

722
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:45,203
- I'm sorry. I did
not at all mean to...

723
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,026
- Don't be sorry.

724
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:48,372
Jermaine's surgery haunts me,

725
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,374
so I can't imagine
what it's done to you.

726
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:51,686
Procedure went perfectly.

727
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,744
Post-op clot was the last
thing on anyone's mind.

728
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:57,312
But none of that makes it any
better for him or his mom.

729
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,350
But I need you focused.
I need your head clear.

730
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,490
I need you with
this patient today.

731
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:06,114
Because this is what Sam wants.

732
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,772

00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:12,913

00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:15,020
Bailey sent me in to cover her.

736
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:18,230
- Your, uh, one last surgery?

737
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,852
- Oh, screw that.

738
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,510

00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:27,998

00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:33,970
Could have sold tickets.

743
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,249
- All right. We're ready.

744
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:39,044
- Okay, everyone,
this is Sam Sutton.

745
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,391
He is a veteran and a hero.

746
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,531
And we thank him for his service

747
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,671
by keeping him alive today.

748
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,224
- Let's do this.

749
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,674
All or nothin'.

750
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,684
- This will be a very
long, complex surgery.

751
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,824
You will get hungry.
You will get tired.

752
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,723
Your feet will hurt.
And when that happens,

753
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,174
I want you to think about Sam,

754
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:09,246
because there is no
margin for error.

755
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,799
We will get through this

756
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:14,527
because we will get
Sam through this.

757
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,566
All or nothin'.

758
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:21,051

760
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,475

761
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:33,236
Why didn't you call
me when she got here?

762
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,307
- She said not to.

763
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:36,791
- She came into
the emergency room

764
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,794
and you didn't think to
notify her emergency contact?

765
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,412
- Okay, she was fine
when she came in;

766
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:43,142
just dizzy. We ran tests.

767
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,799
We started treating
her infection.

768
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,387
I got her everything she needed.

769
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:48,941
- Clearly.

770
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,393
- And then she apparently
left her bed and...

771
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:54,498
- What do you mean she left?

772
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:55,741
Where were you?

773
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,053
- She told me I could go.

774
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,296
- She said you could go
so you just took off?

775
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,436
Is she the patient
or the doctor?

776
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:04,612
I mean, wh... what, were
you stealing another surgery

777
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,407
or flirting with that nurse?

778
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:08,823
- Okay, what is
this really about?

779
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,687
- This is about an
81-year-old woman

780
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:15,830
who is now septic and delirious
because you didn't do your job!

781
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,970
I've got it from here.

782
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,358
- I'm not typically
one to judge,

783
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,636
but who was the
first fool that said,

784
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:30,741
"Maybe if I put on
a squirrel suit,

785
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,191
I'll make it to the other side"?

786
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:33,468
- Franz Reichelt.

787
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:34,825
He attempted to jump
from the Eiffel Tower

788
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,714
in a wingsuit in 1912.

789
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:40,337
I... I was really into
aviation when I was a kid

790
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:43,685
so I know weird stuff.

791
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:46,309
- Did Franz make his landing?

792
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,345
- Hit the ground headfirst.

793
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:51,589

- He's out of surgery.

00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:21,119
- You did it.
- Well, it's not over yet.

827
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,465
- He did.

828
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:24,846
Dr. Lincoln was able to
save all of his limbs.

829
00:35:24,984 --> 00:35:27,677
I'm not sure there's another
surgeon who could have.

830
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:30,128
Sam is lucky
for multiple reasons.

831
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:32,164
And one of them is that
he was brought here.

832
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:33,579
- He's stable for now.

833
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,409
I'll monitor him closely.

834
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,111
But he still has a
long road ahead of him.

835
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,829
We can't say when but we
think with extensive PT

836
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:45,004
he will be able to walk again
and use his fingers fully.

837
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,558
- Ah, he will.

838
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:50,424
Sam, he's sort of the friend
who defies expectations.

839
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:51,597
- Hmm.

840
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:52,988
Well, he'll be back
to his room soon.

841
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:55,153
You can go see him.

842
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,878
- Thank you.
- Course.

843
00:35:58,052 --> 00:35:59,847
Congratulations, Link.
You pulled it off.

844
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,307
- You ever put me in
that position again

845
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:03,437
in front of a patient,

846
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,301
we'll have a problem.

847
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,685
And Hunt.
- Hm?

848
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:12,549
- Thank you for your service.

849
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:25,735
- Yasuda, can I talk
to you for a minute?

850
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,497
Dr. Shepherd, I
am very grateful

851
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:31,430
for the grant money and
for not being fired.

852
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,225
But I just finished a very long,

853
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:34,502
very gnarly surgery

854
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,239
and I'm really not in
the headspace to process

855
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:37,378
whatever mistake you're
gonna say I've made.

856
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:40,232
- You haven't made
a mistake; I have.

857
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,820
I overreacted the other day

858
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,211
when I kicked you
off my service.

859
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:44,478
It had nothing to do with you.

860
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,480
You did not deserve it.

861
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,538
And I am a person who
believes in accountability,

862
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:50,760
so I apologize.

863
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:53,072
- I'm sorry too.

864
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,626
- For what?

865
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,766
- Nothing.

866
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:58,733
You make me nervous. I...

867
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:01,702
I meant apology accepted.
- Mm.

868
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:16,958
- Adams, you okay?

869
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:19,237
- Fine.

870
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:28,694
Listen, you deserved that,

871
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,663
but I should not have
called you out on your ADHD.

872
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,699
I'm sorry about that.

873
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:37,013
- Yeah, that, uh... It
kind of threw me off.

874
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:38,911
- You... you've never
had your meds adjusted?

875
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,154
- I don't have meds.

876
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,673
I... I don't have ADHD.

877
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:44,192
Or I, um...

878
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,885
I don't have a diagnosis.
- Ah.

879
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:50,958
- But I've been reading
up on it and, um...

880
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:55,859
- And things are starting to
come into focus a little bit?

881
00:37:55,997 --> 00:38:00,485
I'm your program director.
I'm gonna notice some things.

882
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,556
Lack of attention to details,

883
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,282
hyperfocus,

884
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,526
uh, poor organizational skills,

885
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:08,769
improved performance when

886
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:10,702
complicated tasks
are broken down.

887
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,808
Adams, the signs,
they're all there.

888
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,538
Or maybe it just
takes one to know one.

889
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,368
Yeah.

890
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:22,966
Look, when I was
diagnosed in college,

891
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,271
I... I thought my chances of
becoming a surgeon were over.

892
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,202
But I went and I got
the help I needed

893
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,662
and now it's just
something I manage

894
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,861
like any other part of my life.

895
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:35,865
I always thought I was
just the black sheep.

896
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:39,731
You know, with this
program, with my family.

897
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:43,321
I never thought that I
might be neurodivergent.

898
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,253
- Yeah, well, typical
is just so boring.

899
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:51,915
- So what happens now?

900
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:54,849
- You go get checked out
and take it from there.

901
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:56,403
Easy.

902
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:07,700
- Dr. Lincoln. I was just
coming to check on his vitals.

903
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:10,658
- His H&H and electrolytes
are holding steady.

904
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:14,973
But I'm gonna stay by
his side, just in case.

905
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:16,215
- Understood.

906
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,804
That's a relief.

907
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:22,463
- Excellent work
today, Griffith.

908
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,052
- You too, Dr. Lincoln.

909
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,266
- Hey.

910
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,785
They told me you would be here.

911
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:35,614
Thought you could use a boost.

912
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:39,756
- Yeah. I'm just
realizing how tired I am.

913
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,240
Those are both for me, right?

914
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,280
You should go and rest.

915
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,317
I'm fine. I'll stay.

916
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,078
- 'Kay.

917
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:53,287
Want some company
till he wakes up?

918
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,669

we face dozens of

What can I get you?

932
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:42,888
- I didn't listen.

933
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,580
I came here a
couple of months ago

934
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,202
to ask you to come back.

935
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,792
And when you shared with
me how difficult that was,

936
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,587
I didn't listen.

937
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:52,588
But...

938
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:56,592

946
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:13,481
Do you need a consult
or can it wait?

947
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:14,620
- It's not a consult.
- Okay, great.

948
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:16,508

949

I owe you an apology.

951
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:26,484
I blamed you for Maggie
leaving even though I knew that

the truth is
complicated, and painful,

953

of my business.
