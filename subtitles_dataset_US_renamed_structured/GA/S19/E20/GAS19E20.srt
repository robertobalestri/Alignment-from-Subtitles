00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:05,640
For decades, if we
wanted to see inside the brain,

2
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:08,091
we had to inject air into
a patient's spinal column.

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:09,389
What can I get you?

4
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:11,320
Uh, scotch, please.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,484
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,817

a British engineer
changed everything

we could see what was
happening inside the brain.

00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,286
It was painless, convenient,

41
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,668
and an absolute game-changer.

42
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:43,817
Eight pounds, seven ounces.

00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,430
And Kelly?

44
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,225
Cursing me.

45
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,031
She only let me out of the
house to come visit you

46
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,826
because I promised to bring home
a chai latte and nipple cream.

both of those things

48

Sam.

But he said that... I got it.

61
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,084
You can go.

62
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,052
You're in black scrubs.

63
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,365
That means at this moment,
you are an OB resident.

64
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:25,746
Dr. Lincoln is an attending.

Technically speaking,
he outranks you,

66
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,576
so if I'm good at my job...

67
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:32,580
Yasuda, in any color
scrubs, I outrank you.

68
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:33,719

That guy really doesn't want
you to be alone with me.

73
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,042
What's the story?

74
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,529
But just because we could now
see inside a person's brain...

75
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,703
doesn't mean we know
what it's thinking.

76
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,303
Okay, so I'm guessing
you all received

77
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:57,018
the same cryptic
text that I did.

78
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:59,607
More rude than cryptic.
Didn't even open with a hello.

79
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,712
I'm hoping for a tour.

80
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:03,404
Sample
A is identical.

81
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,371
It could... It could
be a technical error.

82
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,304
Meredith? This
doesn't make sense.

83
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,237
It literally does
not make sense.

84
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,273
It's all wrong.

85
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,999
What is?

86
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,935
Everything.

87
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,833
Are you... okay?

88
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,319
We have to question everything
we know about Alzheimer's

89
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:23,769
if we're gonna cure it.

90
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,853
She was fine. She
was better than fine.

91
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,348
Well, her fractured rib
must've nicked her lung

92
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:41,856
and caused the pneumothorax.

93
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,765
Okay, we intubated her.
We re-inflated her lung.

94
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:44,997
Why isn't her pressure rising?

95
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:47,241
I don't know. Maybe
because she's 81.

96
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,819
They don't exactly
bounce back, Kwan.

97
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:51,659
She will, though. She has to.

98
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,523
We need to report
this to Dr. Altman.

99
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,421
We need to document
everything that happened

100
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,354
because the ethics
committee will need it.

101
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:58,711
Okay, well, what if we
wean her off the sedatives?

102
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,357
Can we extubate?

103
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,808
Damn it,
her pressure's still too low.

104
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,914
Oh, no. She's not
responding to fluids.

105
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:06,639
Max. Oh, my God.

106
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,410
When I left, she was
fine. I don't understand.

107
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:09,746
Her lung collapsed.

108
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,610
She's DNI. Why
is she intubated?

109
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,405
Who did this?

110
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,200
Who did it?!

111
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,374
It was me.

112
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,207
Over there. Great. Thank you.

113
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,347
Helm, you're back?

114
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,365
I was in the getaway van,
and now I have to pee.

115
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,327
I don't know what that means,
but there's a trauma coming in.

116
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,511
Yes, I'll change! I'll change.

117
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,181
I mean, I'll go change.

118
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,873
Yeah. Hey, grab
a gown. Let's go.

119
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:33,943
Got it.

120
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,016
What do we got?

121
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,709
29-year-old male, GCS 15, MVC.

122
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,514
Vehicle spun out of
control and hit a tree.

123
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:44,712
Suffered facial bruising...

124
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,989
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

125
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,060
I-I just think it's my
arm. It feels broken.

126
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,969
- And yes, potential injury to
the left arm. - Got it.

127
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,315
Adams, page ortho.
Let's get him inside.

128
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,031
Let's go.

129
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,965
Uh...

130
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,523
Her BP isn't
responding to fluids.

131
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:03,707
We need to put her on pressors

132
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,077
if we're going to
keep her alive.

133
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,908
Great, more things she didn't
want. Max was very clear.

134
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,737
She was DNI and DNR,

135
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,566
and Dr. Kwan blatantly
ignored that.

136
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,568
You can't keep going
against her wishes.

137
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:15,156
Before you do anything else,

138
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,331
you need to speak with
Maxine's medical proxy.

139
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,884
I can call her son.

140
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:20,541
Her medical proxy isn't her son.

141
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,164
It's... you.

142
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,581
Then it's
Dr. Millin's decision.

143
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:27,959
You either put her on pressors,

144
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,457
or you extubate her
and hope for the best.

145
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:30,699
Pressors will keep
her alive longer,

146
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,046
but it's more about
considering her...

147
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,392
Can you please just
be quiet for a minute?

148
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,900
I need to think.

149
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:42,943
Dr. Altman, is there a
chance she'll make it

150
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,323
if we remove the tube?

151
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,807
You know I can't answer that.

152
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:50,778
Uh, fine. We'll put
her on pressors.

153
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,573
I'm on it. Don't talk to me.

154
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,299
Okay.

155
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,853
Um, Schmitt?

156
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,452
Do you think that you could
just look inside my mouth

157
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:02,755
and see if there's like an
abscess or... or anything?

158
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,275
I mean, it... It's
on the left side.

159
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,932
On the bottom.

160
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,004
A-A-Anything?

161
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:12,903
No, but... but respectfully,
Chief, I'm not a dentist.

162
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,601
So, there's just
too much history.

163
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:23,017
We're better as friends.

164
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,640
Well, that explains why the
doctor who saved my life

165
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,297
now looks like he
wants to kill me.

166
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,436
He's in love with you.

167
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:29,644
Oh, no.

168
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,612
He's not. He's... He's...

169
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,339
He's living with you,
raising his kid with yours,

170
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,754
learning sign language?

171
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:37,411
As a friend.

172
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,276
No guy does all that for a
woman who's just a friend.

173
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:43,106
Well, you don't
understand our friendship.

174
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:44,763
Youdon't understand
your friendship.

175
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,799
It's not like that.

176
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,259
And honestly, I'm
getting a little tired

177
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,424
of having to explain
this to people.

178
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,564
Okay. Okay.

179
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,430
I owe my life to Dr. Lincoln,

180
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:58,225
so I should probably
get out of his way.

181
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,953
But he's had years to figure
out what I did in just minutes.

182
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:05,128
You're an amazing
woman, Dr. Jo Wilson,

183
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,785
and in a few weeks,

184
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,211
when I'm not hooked up
to all these machines

185
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,720
and you are no longer my doctor,

186
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,895
I'm gonna sweep you off
your feet like you deserve.

187
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,454
I should check on
my other patients.

188
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,490
Good.

189
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,699
You're chatting my ear
off, and I need to rest.

190
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,546
Dr. Sky to the NICU.

191
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,292
Dr. Akira Sky to the NICU.

192
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,500
Are you ready?

193
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,468
What? Ah, ready, yes.

194
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:36,884
Ready to kick cancer's
ass and go back to work.

195
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,472
That's right.

196
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,198
I took a couple days off

197
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,821
when I decided on the mastectomy
instead of a lumpectomy.

198
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,719
Good. But at least this way,

199
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,480
I don't need radiation
five days a week.

200
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,137
Right. How are you?

201
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,976
You here to spill more
tea? Let's hope not.

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,899
A failed wedding is
enough for one day.

203
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,487
Alright.

204
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,489
Oh, spoke too soon.

205
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:58,813
I'll check on you in recovery.

206
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,356
Okay.

207
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,254
Thanks.

208
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:03,945
Hi. Trey's here.

209
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,431
Here, as in in this
hospital here? Now?

210
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,289
Yeah, he came in as a
patient in trauma one.

211
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,964
Oh, my God. It's just
a minor car accident

212
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,997
with a possible arm fracture...

213
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,402
Crap.

214
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,025
Simone, it's minor!

215
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,958
Dr. Burchfield to Pediatrics.

216
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,340
Dr. Benita Burchfield
to Pediatrics.

217
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,345
The pressors seem to be working.

218
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,174
Max is stable.

219
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:26,830
For now.

220
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,111
She was sitting there talking,

221
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,985
and then all of a sudden,
she couldn't breathe,

222
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,649
and I had to make a
split-second decision,

223
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,046
and I chose to save her life.

224
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:37,565
Life?

225
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,567
I mean, look at her.

226
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,052
That's not life for her.

227
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,608
In fact, she considers
that not life

228
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:48,783
to the degree that she
had legal papers drawn up,

229
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,406
and then she signed them.

230
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,384
It's in her chart, it's
on a board in her room,

231
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,581
it's on her bracelet.

232
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,618
It is not for you to choose.

233
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:58,138
You have any idea the position
that you've put me in?

234
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:01,210
If we can't extubate,
I'll have to decide

235
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:04,937
whether we put in a
trach or a feeding tube.

236
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:06,275
And then if that doesn't work,

237
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:07,630
I might have to decide

238
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:10,357
to unplug my favorite
person in the world.

239
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,329
Where is she? Is she here?

240
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,124
Just let us finish
assessing you.

241
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,747
Trey, you have a left
comminuted humeral fracture.

242
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,208
It's gonna require a
plate in order to...

243
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,750
Align and stabilize the bone.

244
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,304
Can I still operate or not?

245
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,109
He's a second-year surgical
resident in Baltimore.

246
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,755
Is this your dominant hand?

247
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,481
No.Well, you'll be fine.

248
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:32,941
We'll know more about your
recovery once we get in there.

249
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,313
Yeah. This could be bad.

250
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,797
Trey, I'm so sorry.

251
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,730
You two know each
other? Don't ask.

252
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:43,666
It's because of him, isn't it?

253
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:44,667
Trey.

254
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:45,840
Piece of crap.

255
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,842
Whoa! Hey! Hey, hey!

256
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,017
That's my dominant hand.

257
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,855
Most people believe that
Alzheimer's is related

258
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,892
to the formation of amyloid
plaque in the brain.

259
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,688
People, as in, the top
scientists in the field.

260
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,828
You mean the people
with the loudest voices,

261
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,624
and they will shame anyone
who believes any other theory

262
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,039
other than the plaque theory,

263
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,810
and that's where most
of the funding goes.

264
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,043
And the only meds
that are approved

265
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,079
are meds that reduce plaque,

266
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,988
and those meds are supposedly
reducing the plaque.

267
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:20,875
Woop!

268
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,913
Is that not a good thing?

269
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,295
Well, it would be
if we could trust

270
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,228
everything that's
being published.

271
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,058
I met a young neuroscientist
out of Tennessee,

272
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,405
and he found evidence
of image-tampering

273
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:34,743
in some of the leading papers.

274
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,201
How long is she gonna do this?

275
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:37,892
I need to present an award.

276
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,861
Meredith, when's the
last time you slept?

277
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,873
Well, Jackson had to go to
London to manage a crisis,

278
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,244
so I called all of you here

279
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,462
because you all know me
better than anyone else does.

280
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,145
And I need to run this past
you before I tell anyone else.

281
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,836
Run what past us?

282
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,700
My possible new
theory on Alzheimer's.

283
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:57,118
Let me show you more data.

284
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,850
Oh, thank God!

285
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,414
Winston, Winston,
hey! Can you help me?

286
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:08,838
I'm trying to fasten my dress,
and Meredith keeps texting me.

287
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,105
You look...

288
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,175
Whew.

289
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,177
That's a dress.

290
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,765
And your hair...

291
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:23,766
Wow.

292
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,457
Wow, yourself.

293
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:28,529
Um... here.

294
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,360
Yeah.

295
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:42,094
Uh, congratulations.
Chief of Cardio.

296
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,305
Yeah, well, uh,
the previous chief

297
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,307
left me a disorganized mess.

298
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,032
Schedule's color-coded
by surgeon.

299
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,347
Grand rounds topics are
set until next year,

300
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:56,557
possible case studies
are labeled by procedure.

301
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,041
Yeah. It's a catastrophe.

302
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,255
Thank you.

303
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,774
You're welcome.

304
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,280
You know I'm Team Skywalker.

305
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,455
Why do I get a sense
there's a "but" coming?

306
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,492
I just got a second
chance and hit my stride,

307
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,941
the chief respects me,

308
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,402
and I don't need
to get dragged down

309
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,117
into a fight over
you and Griffith.

310
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,015
Well, I'm the one
who got punched.

311
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:43,166
And I can't live in a house
where people are fighting.

312
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,539
I'm gonna be working and
living with a couple again,

313
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,023
just like in college.

314
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,542
Okay, I...

315
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,855
So, we need some ground rules.

316
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,374
No sex in shared spaces,

317
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,203
no remnants of sex
in shared spaces,

318
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,067
no auditory anything

319
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,380
'cause I need at least
three full REM cycles

320
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,898
per night to kick ass at work,

321
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,866
and I refuse to not
kick ass at work.

322
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:06,662
I need an intern
for Trey's surgery.

323
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,698
Maybe not you.

324
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,055
Yasuda, call up and make sure
that they're ready for us, okay?

325
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,149
On it.

326
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,645
Keep an eye on
Sam Sutton for me.

327
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,670
Sure.

328
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,543
How long have you two been...

329
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,579
It wasn't like that. I
never cheated on you.

330
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,022
But you have feelings for him.

331
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,654
I didn't leave you
for another man.

332
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,760
I didn't. I left...

333
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:37,934
because I...

334
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,835
I'm not the person I was
when we got together.

335
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:45,079
After everything
that's happened,

336
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:46,497
blowing up my life in Baltimore,

337
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,806
moving here... it's changed me.

338
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,014
I'm...

339
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:52,224
I'm a different person.
I want different things.

340
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:53,812
You mean you want Adams.

341
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:58,507
What I don't understand
is you said yes.

342
00:13:58,645 --> 00:13:59,645
You moved up the wedding.

343
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,166
Was any of it real?

344
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,754
After Baltimore.

345
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:05,835
I mean, did you still love me?

346
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,550
Yes.

347
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:08,803
Then we can get through this.

348
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,139
Trey.

349
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,210
I'll move here. We'll
slow things down.

350
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,625
We can figure it out.

351
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:16,732
I've figured it out already.
This isn't what I want.

352
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,528
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

353
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,391
You're an incredible person,

354
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,809
and I'm sorry I let
it drag on this long.

355
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,569
I wanted to do the right thing.

356
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:28,226
I was confused, and...

357
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,300
Let me clear something up.

358
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,302
Adams isn't good enough for you.

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,131
He's a screw-up.

360
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,709
He'll never learn because he has
a family name to back him up.

361
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,758
And if you decide
to be with him,

362
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,587
your whole trajectory changes.

363
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,047
Your life will fall apart,
and I'm not gonna be there

364
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,728
to help you pick up the pieces.

365
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,544
Max's pressure
has improved,

366
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,431
and we're weaning
her off pressors.

367
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,202
Hopefully, we'll be able
to do a sedation pause

368
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,676
and neuro exam soon.

369
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,439
What if she doesn't wake
up? What happens next?

370
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:12,028
Let's just try not to think
about that right now, okay?

371
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,249
Why aren't you yelling
at me right now?

372
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:23,350
Last year, I killed a patient

373
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:27,872
because I was sure I
knew how to save him,

374
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,770
and I didn't.

375
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:33,843
I learned more from that
mistake than any of the wins,

376
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:35,465
not because somebody
yelled at me,

377
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:38,468
but because it ate at me.

378
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,609
I would lie awake at night...

379
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,542
feeling the blood all over me

380
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,684
and how the... how the
scalpel felt in my hand,

381
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,859
replaying it over
and over in my mind.

382
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,138
I don't have to yell at you
because I've been there,

383
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:55,589
and I know you're already
doing it to yourself.

384
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,283
I saved a life.

385
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:01,975
I didn't end one.

386
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:11,329
He's making it really
hard not to yell at him.

387
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:14,470
What?

388
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,127
Olympic Village.

389
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,577
Ah.

390
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,313
"Assemble the greatest
talents in the world

391
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,201
and put them in one building."

392
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,824
Yeah, feels like it
was so long ago now.

393
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:27,276
Still one of the best
nights of my life.

394
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,383
Alright, let's do it.

395
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,834
Lightning round... Don't
think, just answer.

396
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,664
But we already know each other.

397
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:37,148
Oh. Okay.

398
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,368
Alright, if you had a dog,
what would you name it?

399
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,187
Oh. Ruth.

400
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:44,086
For a dog?

401
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,502
Why not?

402
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,652
Alright, a million dollars...

403
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:48,653
What would you do with it?

404
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,679
New boots.

405
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,956
It's free money.

406
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,416
You don't have to
get what you need.

407
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,062
I don't need them, I want them.

408
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,212
And you don't know what kind
of boots I'm considering.

409
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:58,790
Fair, alright.

410
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:00,343
Okay, your turn. Okay.

411
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:01,931
Dog's name? Marlin.

412
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,622
Oh, that's a good
name for a dog.

413
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,072
Yeah.

414
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,211
A million dollars?

415
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,386
I'd build a time machine.

416
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:11,803
I could go back in
time and tell my mom

417
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,599
I was nominated for a
Catherine Fox Award.

418
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,545
Your answers are so
much better than mine.

419
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:22,825
We should get dressed
and check in with Mer

420
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,954
before the pre-reception
for the nominees.

421
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,336
These things never
start on time.

422
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,582
Wow.

423
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,067
What he said.

424
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,587
Meredith, this is huge.

425
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:38,830
Right?

426
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,108
And you can't tell anyone
outside of this room.

427
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,903
Well, Catherine
asked me to speak

428
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,285
to the fundraisers tonight,
update them on my work.

429
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:48,598
If you tell them this,
you'll be written off.

430
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:52,602
Doctors who blow up
pre-existing ideas, sound ideas,

431
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,639
they're not seen
as "cutting edge."

432
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,710
They're seen as crazy.

433
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,023
And not only will you
jeopardize your relationship

434
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,507
with the foundation,

435
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,085
you could destroy
your entire career.

436
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,166
And if... ifyou're right,

437
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:05,944
it's gonna take you
five years to prove it

438
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,859
and another five years
to be widely accepted.

439
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,034
By then, you'll no
longer be published

440
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,276
or invited to conferences.

441
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:12,933
You will be forgotten.

442
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,937
You see it.

443
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,490
You see the data.

444
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:20,268
You have to admit there
is the possibility

445
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,667
that the plaque is not
causing Alzheimer's.

446
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:24,289
I see inconsistencies.

447
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:27,465
But, Mer, what you
are hypothesizing

448
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,916
insults decades of genius work.

449
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:33,471
It insults Derek's work.

450
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:35,576
If this institute is important,

451
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,718
if... if... if you
want it to continue,

452
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,168
you have to keep all
of this to yourself.

453
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:43,515
So should I not pursue my work?

454
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,586
Should we just let
the science catch up

455
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,141
and let hundreds of
thousands of people die?

456
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,729
That would be lying.

457
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,663
No. No, it's not lying.
It's, uh... It's discretion.

458
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,735
Look, I-I want you
to pursue your work.

459
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,668
Just do it on the side so
that your lab stays open.

460
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,705
I mean, if you make this public,

461
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:02,763
there's a possibility you
could lose your funding

462
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,605
and your reputation.

463
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,471
Maintain the respect that
you have built for yourself.

464
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,558
It's a protein
identification system.

465
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,423
It uses electricity to push
tissue samples through...

466
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,841
With protein through a gel
which separates the molecules.

467
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:33,807
Yeah, I know.

468
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,604
As a fellow, I did a
lot of bench research

469
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:40,469
and spent way too many hours
on one of these things.

470
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,266
Interns seem to be doing well.

471
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,233
Lucas says you've
been very supportive.

472
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,246
Yeah, you know, we... we...
We don't have to do this.

473
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,409
Do what?

474
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:50,627
Small talk. We
don't have to do it.

475
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,205
We just don't have to.

476
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,148
I-I told you I loved you,
you pretended not to hear me.

477
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,553
It doesn't matter anymore.

478
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,186
We've both moved on, and
you're happy out here.

479
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,659
That's good.

480
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,420
And you're clearly
breaking new ground.

481
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,320
What would you
do? Would you lie?

482
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:08,048
Oh, I don't know.

483
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,636
I guess it would
depend on how badly

484
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:11,672
I needed the money to
keep the work going.

485
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:17,827
But I don't know, did you
really come all this way

486
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,923
just to... just to
follow the rules?

487
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,753
'Cause that would
piss me off even more.

488
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,083
Just have
his doctors call.

489
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,487
You've done enough already.

490
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,802
Everything okay?

491
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,769
That was Trey's mom.

492
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:42,048
I just told her he's in surgery.

493
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,016
How'd that go?

494
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:47,501
They're really mad at me.

495
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,652
Well, it's not your fault that he
got into an accident... It is, Lucas.

496
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:53,853
He was coming here to see me
because I blew up his life,

497
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,589
and now he's a surgeon
with a shattered arm.

498
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:56,797
Well, Lincoln will
do the repair...

499
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,101
And you got punched... I'm fine.

500
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,282
And the money that my dad
gave me for the catering...

501
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,618
Hey, don't think about that now.

502
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,561
None of this would have
happened if it weren't for me.

503
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:03,839
What, are you supposed to just marry
someone you're not in love with?

504
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,831
Stop trying to let me
off the hook, Lucas.

505
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,626
I hurt people.

506
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:12,837
Sorry.

507
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:13,907
It's fine.

508
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,704
It's complicated. I get that.

509
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,326
I should go. Wait,
Lucas, I really...

510
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,442
No, I mean, uh, Yasuda asked
me to check on Sam Sutton,

511
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,606
so text me if you need me.

512
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:40,140
I really understand what
you love about Maxine.

513
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,006
She's not just a
funny, sweet old lady.

514
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:46,698
She's brave.

515
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:47,952
She's like no one I've ever met,

516
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:51,738
and she's generous
with her advice.

517
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,878
And the way she gives it...

518
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,398
reminds me a little of my mom.

519
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,124
She worries about me.

520
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:03,543
She doesn't always come
out and say it, but...

521
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,201
she'll leave a
plate of food out,

522
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:08,789
a cup of tea, sunscreen.

523
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,344
She'll "accidentally"
wash my towels

524
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:12,759
or bake my favorite muffins.

525
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,450
She...

526
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,282
She worries.

527
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:22,700
My own parents never
really did that for me.

528
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:25,875
She's awake.

529
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,084
Max.

530
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,223
Max, Max, Max.

531
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,432
Oh, no. No, no, no.

532
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,581
Can you hear me?
Don't touch the tube.

533
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,193
I know, I know, I know.

534
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:34,401
Relax, relax.

535
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,516
I'm here, I'm
here. Relax, relax.

536
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,886
It's okay, it's okay.

537
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,962
Please take your seats.

538
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,275
The awards show
will begin shortly.

539
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,968
Yes, this is a room filled
with medical genius...

540
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,486
Hi!

541
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,144
It's so good to see all of you.

542
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,215
Mwah! Hi!

543
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:58,425
I thought we were going to
see you at Meredith's lab.

544
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,979
Well, you know, work called.

545
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,221
I got stuck.

546
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,982
Mm-hmm.

547
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,200
Can I come and see it tomorrow?

548
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,398
Of course.

549
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,262
There she is!

550
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,886
I need to borrow Meredith
just for two minutes.

551
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,646
Darling... Yes.

552
00:23:12,784 --> 00:23:14,304
The money table is
over here.Mm-hmm.

553
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:18,135
I need you to come and just give
them an update on your work,

554
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,722
uh, say thank you, and smile.

555
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,448
Easy.Easy.

556
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:22,829
Good luck.

557
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,393
Amelia, you're worse
than my two boys.

558
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,659
No phones at the table.

559
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:26,877
It's Mer's research.

560
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,079
As promised, I wanted
to introduce all of you

561
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,460
to Dr. Meredith Grey.

562
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:34,718
Pleasure to meet all of you.

563
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:36,843
Kenneth Turner, CEO of Rivco.

564
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:39,432
I have been following
your work for years.

565
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,503
I'm so appreciative
of what you're doing.

566
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,401
My mother was just
diagnosed with Alzheimer's

567
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,851
about a year ago.

568
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,716
It's been extraordinarily
difficult,

569
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:51,030
but you have been
a source of hope.

570
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,446
Any insider news
into your progress?

571
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,486
Um...

572
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:03,870
I do believe that we
have been focused on...

573
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:05,975
On the wrong thing,

574
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:08,150
which means your money
is not being well-spent.

575
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:09,807
Dr. Grey.

576
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:12,154
Well, the current studies
and the dominant theories

577
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,467
and the goal of the
new treatments...

578
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,780
I believe are designed
on a faulty premise.

579
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,171
Max, I know you're scared.

580
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,587
We are going to get you
more meds right now.

581
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:32,830
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

582
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,349
Okay. Here.

583
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,946
Max, Max, you...
You are not dying.

584
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,776
You don't have a
long-term condition...

585
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:51,020
You had a complication
from a simple rib fracture.

586
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,574
So, I had to make a decision,

587
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:53,827
and it might not have been
the one that you wanted,

588
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,336
but I think you were wrong,

589
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:58,097
and I think I was
right to fight for you

590
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,754
just like you taught me how
to fight for Enzo and his mom.

591
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:03,585
Okay, s-so just give us
24 hours on the vent,

592
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:05,045
and we'll run some
tests in the morning

593
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,805
to make sure that you
can breathe on your own,

594
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,866
and then I promise
we will take it out.

595
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,248
And in the meantime, we'll
give you some excellent drugs

596
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,043
and play some music
or whatever you like.

597
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:15,148
Tom Jones.

598
00:25:16,563 --> 00:25:18,289
We'll play Tom Jones.

599
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,021
You're not Yasuda.

600
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,816
No, she got called
into the O.R.,

601
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:29,473
so I'll be taking
over for a bit.

602
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,408
Let me guess, the
other guy looks worse?

603
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:34,892
It's nothing.

604
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,135
Disgruntled patient?

605
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:39,034
Actually... yes.

606
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,452
You don't have to
worry about me.

607
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:41,968
You could be terrible,

608
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,256
and I can't even really
give you the finger.

609
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,005
You need to rest.

610
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,318
Yeah, yeah, I'll just lie here.

611
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:50,010
Completely immobilized and
starved for entertainment

612
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,772
while you withhold whatever
juicy story you have

613
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,739
from a man who can't even move.

614
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:58,157
There's a girl.

615
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,686
Okay, you just don't
need to finish.

616
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,229
I know the rest.

617
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:08,236
I feel funny.

618
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,585
Damn it.

619
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:14,483
Hold on, Sam.

620
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,175
Oh, God.

621
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,487
I need help in here!

622
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,248
And page Chief Altman!

623
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:21,663
Code blue.

624
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,941
Rest up, okay?

625
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,770
Let's keep an eye
on the swelling.

626
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,842
He says he doesn't
want any pain meds.

627
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,648
I have a feeling that's gonna
change in a couple of hours.

628
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,787
I'll let you know
how he's doing.

629
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,330
Nice to have you back, Helm.

630
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,677
So, how does it feel to be back?

631
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:38,921
Like someone took
kryptonite out of my shoe.

632
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,475
But I'm still coming down

633
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:41,555
from the most perfect
date I've ever had,

634
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,168
so might be that, too.

635
00:26:44,306 --> 00:26:46,481
Wow, a busted wedding, driving
the bride's getaway van,

636
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:49,622
and starting your new job a
day early was a "perfect date"?

637
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,969
Yeah, well, my sense of
"perfect" might be a little odd,

638
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:54,454
but I got to spend
the day with you.

639
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,319
Sam Sutton.

640
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:58,665
Dr. Wilson must have left,

641
00:26:58,803 --> 00:26:59,918
and he needs someone
else to entertain.

642
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:03,912
Crap, 911. Damn it, Adams!

643
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,810
Go. I'll call you tonight.

644
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:10,194
What the hell happened?

645
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:11,920
Oh, my God. I was
checking in on him,

646
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:13,104
and then his chest tube
started pouring blood.

647
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,336
He's lost over two liters.

648
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:16,200
His aorta must have transected.

649
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,064
He's bleeding out
into his chest.

650
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,082
The chart said it was
only Grade 1 this morning.

651
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:21,975
Alright, we need to get
him up to the O.R. right now.

652
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,439
I already asked them
to get it ready.

653
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:26,624
Alright, meet me up there, and
prep him as fast as you can.

654
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:35,771
What are you doing?

655
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,152
Taking a break.

656
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,740
Out here?

657
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:40,120
It's quieter.

658
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:42,847
Or it was.

659
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:45,850
You want me to leave?

660
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,095
Is that what you want?

661
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,511
What is going on with you?

662
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:56,482
Just wondering what
you want, that's all.

663
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,138
I...

664
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,283
I... I think that
you should move out.

665
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,674
I've been thinking
about it for a while.

666
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,907
I think that it's...

667
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:10,772
confusing for the kids.

668
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,990
So, this is about the kids?

669
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,017
Yes. Not Rocky the
Flying Squirrel?

670
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,467
Sam?

671
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,092
No, no, not
necessarily, but yeah,

672
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,784
I want to be able
to meet someone.

673
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:25,269
Well, you seem to
be doing just fine.

674
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:26,936
I'm not comfortable bringing
people home like you are.

675
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,445
I haven't done that in months.

676
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,655
I've been too busy
packing lunches

677
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,623
and showing up at... At
Luna's doctor's appointments

678
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:37,074
and being your shoulder to
cry on and your punching bag.

679
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:39,318
Why do I feel like you're
accusing me of something?

680
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:42,976
I have changed my entire life
to revolve around you, us.

681
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,151
I never asked you to!

682
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,125
And now, the moment
that we've all been waiting for,

683
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,783
the Catherine Fox Award.

684
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:00,477
This award is given to those
who have achieved excellence

685
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:03,272
in our field while
pushing boundaries.

686
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,965
Here to present
this year's winner

687
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,519
is a Fox recipient herself,

688
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:12,903
one of our most well-known
boundary pushers,

689
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,491
Dr. Meredith Grey.

690
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,564
Wait, why aren't they
calling me up there?

691
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:23,016
I took that plane ride from hell
just to present the damn award.

692
00:29:23,154 --> 00:29:24,994
Well, this is a room
filled with medical genius. Ben!

693
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,330
Sorry I'm late. H...

694
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:28,021
I look around and
see those responsible

695
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,955
for incredible achievements
in medicine this year...

696
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:33,958
Bio-artificial hearts,
partial heart transplants,

697
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:36,823
stem cell therapy,
xenotransplantation,

698
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,307
gene editing.

699
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:39,826
But for the first time ever,

700
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:42,553
Dr. Fox, in her
infinite wisdom,

701
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:46,350
has decided that this is
the year to break the rules.

702
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:49,318
For the first time ever,
the award is going to go

703
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:53,806
to a non-surgical project,
even a non-nominee.

704
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,086
We are in the midst

705
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:00,847
of a national public health
crisis in this country.

706
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:03,481
I taught them. I taught them at my clinic.
Right now, in more than half of our states,

707
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:06,335
women are being forced to carry
not only unwanted pregnancies,

708
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,510
but unsafe pregnancies.

709
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:11,168
They are legally prohibited
from receiving care

710
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,688
that protects not only
their reproductive rights

711
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,068
but their survival.

712
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:16,553
And with these bans,

713
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,934
doctors are no
longer being trained

714
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:20,902
in these procedures,
life-saving procedures,

715
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,560
that are used in more
than just abortions.

716
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,494
But there is one doctor who is
trying to change all of that,

717
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:29,324
one procedure at a time,

718
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:31,740
one trainee at a time,

719
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:34,571
whose groundbreaking work in
protecting reproductive rights

720
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,505
and training the next
generation of doctors

721
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:40,024
on how to perform
reproductive care.

722
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:41,957
Dr. Miranda Bailey,

723
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:44,512
we would love to present you
with the Catherine Fox Award

724
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,928
for your significant
contribution

725
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,516
to medicine this year.

726
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,455
Get up there. Go!

727
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:05,325
Oh, my God.

728
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:08,190
Congratulations, and thank you.

729
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:17,993
Yeah!

730
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,067
Okay, okay, okay.

731
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:25,587
Oh, my goodness. It's
been such a long year.

732
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,313
Hi.

733
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:30,385
Okay, okay, okay.

734
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,767
Okay.

735
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,431
You're
debating the logic

736
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,719
of a non-nominee
winning an award.

737
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,193
I mean, kind of. Yeah.

738
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:47,051
Well, at least it was
Bailey who stole it...

739
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:48,990
I m... won, won.

740
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:50,647
At least it was Bailey who won.

741
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,132
If I'm gonna lose to somebody,
it might as well be her.

742
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,997
Oh, man.

743
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:59,621
Yeah, I-I couldn't stop
thinking of Baby Arlo tonight,

744
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,796
just wondering what
he'll do with his life.

745
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,211
Doesn't matter what he does.

746
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,420
He has a life now,
thanks to you.

747
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:07,249
Hey, thanks to us.

748
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,563
You want to get a drink?

749
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:13,670
Is this what we are now?

750
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,741
Married but apart

751
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:18,985
and having mind-blowing sex
whenever we're in the same room?

752
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:22,230
When we pull off medical
miracles together?

753
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:25,923
Sex and medical miracles were
two things we always got right.

754
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:31,791
Maggie...

755
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,587
should we get divorced?

756
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:38,729
Is that what you want?

757
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,835
I want to excel at my new job,

758
00:32:40,973 --> 00:32:43,562
like, really tear it up.

759
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,944
And I want to save lives
and help patients like Arlo,

760
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:49,371
and I want to teach this next
generation everything I know,

761
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,880
and I want to break new ground.

762
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:55,090
And I don't want this to be
my last Fox Award nomination.

763
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:56,471
I want it to be the beginning.

764
00:32:57,817 --> 00:33:00,440
Well, let's just
start with that.

765
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,063
We'll figure out the rest later.

766
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,175
Alright, come on, Miranda.

767
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:12,463
There are people waiting outside
to take their picture with you.

768
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:15,110
Oh, no. I ugly-cried.

769
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:17,596
I can't believe I
ugly-cried... I'll be outside.

770
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,435
In front of the most
accomplished surgeons

771
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,771
in the world.

772
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,601
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

773
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,130
I plan on ugly-crying in
the car on the way home.

774
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,707
Hmm?

775
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:26,822
I'm going to lose
all of my funding

776
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:28,572
because I cannot bite my tongue.

777
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,919
Well, you'll get more. How?

778
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:33,784
Because you're you, and you
won't stop until you do.

779
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,752
Some of us find that annoying.

780
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:42,586
I just spent the last
hour in the lobby

781
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,140
and missed Bailey winning
a Catherine Fox Award

782
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,280
because I was reading all
of Meredith's research.

783
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:50,801
She is about to sink my
brother's entire legacy,

784
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:53,055
and the irony of that is a
little more than I can take,

785
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,702
so I'm gonna head to a meeting.

786
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,875
Do you want to come?

787
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,740
Um...

788
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:01,156
when we were on the plane
and it started to go down,

789
00:34:01,294 --> 00:34:04,159
I tried to drink
Catherine's martini.

790
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:08,957
And did you? No, no.

791
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:11,477
Bailey knocked it
out of my hand,

792
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,444
but ever since, that's
all I can think about.

793
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,723
I mean, alcohol is all I see.

794
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,589
Well, of course it is.
You're an alcoholic.

795
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:22,868
Alcoholics love alcohol.

796
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,596
Sobriety is unbelievably
hard on a normal day,

797
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:30,013
and we... we thought
we were gonna die.

798
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,118
Yeah, I just... just wish
I could take the edge off.

799
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:35,087
Right.

800
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,409
Every day, I wish I could
just have a glass of wine

801
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,745
like everybody else.

802
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:40,230
Yeah, well, we're
not everybody else.

803
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:41,127
We're not.

804
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:43,785
Let's find a meeting.

805
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:46,788
Um, I-I-I better
wait for Catherine.

806
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:48,272
Alright.

807
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,790
I'm gonna find a meeting,

808
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,897
and I'm gonna text
you the address.

809
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:01,113

I, uh...

820
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,538
I don't understand.

821
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,231
I did pretend not to hear you.

822
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:53,752
I was tired and scared
and overwhelmed,

823
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,339
and I know that sounds stupid,

824
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:58,895
but I thought that what I
should do in that moment

825
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,104
was to focus on the children,
so that's what I did.

826
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,726
And as you can tell,

827
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:05,108
I'm still tired and
scared and overwhelmed

828
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:09,008
and I probably just blew
up my career, but...

829
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,219
I miss you.

830
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:18,224
Listen, I-I met Michael.

831
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:19,501
He's wonderful.

832
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,365
So great with the kids.

833
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:24,265
Then what
do you want from me?

834
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:27,509
Michael is Zola's
tutor. He's brilliant.

835
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,649
So, you went to my house?

836
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,962
Yeah, I went...
I went to your house.

837
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,792
I did.

838
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,450
Why didn't you mention
that in the lab?

839
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:37,323
Well, because you were
in mad-scientist mode,

840
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,038
and also...

841
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:40,143
like, Michael.

842
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,248
Michael?

843
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,319
Michael exclusively dates men.

844
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:48,427
Ah, okay.

845
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:50,739
Really?

846
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,811
You know, I went to your house

847
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,468
because I thought I
was gonna die today.

848
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,816
It's a long story, and
I didn't die, obviously,

849
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:02,613
but it made me realize
how badly I want to live

850
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:06,652
and that I've wasted years of
my life trying to avoid pain.

851
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,309
And I went to your house to say

852
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,518
that I never should
have let you walk away

853
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:13,486
and to say that I want
to live a whole life

854
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:17,766
with love and mess
and pain and you.

855
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,185
Well, okay, then.

856
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,082

She's on the minimum settings.

863
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:54,838
That's good news.

864
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,426
You think I don't know that?

865
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:57,876
I'm confused.

866
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,533
You're mad that
she's doing better?

867
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:02,501
I'm mad at you!

868
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,368
No, no. I am... I
am enraged by you.

869
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:11,303
You are the most selfish,
arrogant, impulsive,

870
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,581
enraging person I have ever met.

871
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,239
You never consider
anyone else's feelings.

872
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,828
You never care about how anyone
else feels or what they want.

873
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:26,525
You put me in an
impossible situation today,

874
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:28,389
and I hate you for that.

875
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:31,219
I hate you so much that
I'm going to cry now,

876
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:33,014
because that's how
I express anger,

877
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:35,499
and I'm going to hate you even
more because you saw me cry,

878
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:39,020
and the worst part
is, you saved her.

879
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,715
You saved my favorite person.

880
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:47,546
So, now, I don't get
to just hate you.

881
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,479
I have to love you, too.

882
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:08,819
We'll do an
emergent thoracotomy.

883
00:39:08,843 --> 00:39:10,949
We will get in there and
cross-clamp the aorta

884
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,812
as quickly as we can

885
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,963
to give anesthesia time to
catch up on blood volume.

886
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,127
Then we will do the repair.

887
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:20,993
Yasuda, you are on retraction.
Adams, you are on suction.

888
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,409
I need you to work as
quickly as you can,

889
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:25,446
so I need you both
to anticipate.

890
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:27,241
Absolutely. Got it.

891
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:29,933
His lap pads are ready.

892
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,384

00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,592
Oh, my God. Uh, page Hunt!

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,042
Page everyone!

895
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,146
Get a crash cart!

896
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:40,495
Do you have any
idea how many times

897
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:42,428
I've switched clinic
days with a fellow

898
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,155
or asked Amelia to
change the Scout schedule

899
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,985
so that I can be there
for you and Luna?

900
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,848
Do not put me and Luna

901
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,230
in the middle of your
constant need to save the day.

902
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:52,507
We are fine.

903
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:53,933
It's not that I want
to save the day,

904
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:55,994
it's that I care
about you and Luna.

905
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,764
Well, since it's all
such a chore for you,

906
00:39:57,788 --> 00:39:59,273
moving out should
be a great option.

907
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,827
Right, since we're just
roommates, like you told Sam.

908
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,002
What was
I supposed to say?

909
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,831
Something that sounds like more

910
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:08,627
than two random
people co-habitating.

911
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:10,467
Well, you're really gonna
get hung up on semantics?

912
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,630
What does it matter?!

913
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:14,771
It's not semantics,
Jo, it's love!

914
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:18,188
I'm in love with you, Jo.

915
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:20,294
I'm... I'm so completely
in love with you.

916
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:21,778
How do you not see that?

917
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,198
I have loved you since
you were a freshman

918
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,441
and I was a senior,

919
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,201
and we wore cheesy crab hats

920
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,203
and served meals in buckets.

921
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,171
And I've almost said
it a hundred times.

922
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,828
I say it to myself, I
say it in the mornings

923
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:40,728
when you're mean to me before
you've had your coffee.

924
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:45,629
I say it when I see you
studying next to the fireplace.

925
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,321
I say it when...

926
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:52,050
you think I can't hear you
singing to Luna, and I can.

927
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,017
And I should've
said it out loud,

928
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,595
but I-I didn't want
to freak you out,

929
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,091
and then we
found out about Luna.

930
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,751
I love you...

931
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:06,788
and I'm gonna love you forever.
