1
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,705
- I feel like I'll
say the wrong thing.

2
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,120
- You really can't.

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,207
There are no wrong answers here.

4
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,725
- Okay.

5
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,373
His kindness.

6
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:22,984
He's very kind.

7
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,485
- Something you love and
appreciate about Maggie?

8
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:33,013
- Yeah.

9
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:35,903
I guess I am...

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,528
Well, I love... I love that
she's here this morning,

11
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,910
because that means that
she's finally admitting

12
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,877
that we need help communicating.

13
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:43,996
So...

14
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,284
And I...

15
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:54,220
I appreciate how
hard Maggie works.

16
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,098
- How is that a bad thing?

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,574
- How is what I said bad?

18
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,240
- Every life on the planet
begins as a single cell,

19
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:04,347
which splits and multiplies
over and over again.

20
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:05,866
Each cell has a purpose.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,937
- Okay, the kids are
dressed and ready,

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,904
and you're... still not up.

23
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,341
- I can't. I feel awful.

24
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:16,163
Can you take Luna to day care
for me so that I can sleep?

25
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,168
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:21,260
- And as it forms, internal
and external forces

27
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,678
converge on it.

28
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,146
- I know what you're doing.

29
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,311
- What, trying to spend
a little more time

30
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,656
with my wife?

31
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,316
- Now, you're gonna
have to go home

32
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,941
and then come back at
the end of the day.

33
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,657
- Yeah, well, I got the
day off, so I got time.

34
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:39,583
- Two extra trips,
more carbon footprint,

35
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:41,962
killing the planet...
Think of our children.

36
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:43,540
You see?

37
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:46,426
They've extended the
security perimeter,

38
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:47,690
perfectly safe.

39
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,057
- Signaling to the cell
what it will become.

40
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:52,173
We call this process
differentiation.

41
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,797
- Thanks for the ride.

42
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:57,192
- Love you.
- It'll be fine.

43
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:01,473
- An arm, a bone, a brain...

44
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,955
- Hi, good morning.

45
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,178
- Perfectly safe.

46
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:06,308
- All cells take a journey

47
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,751
from generalized to specialized.

48
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,739
- Sorry, sorry. I know
I'm a little late.

49
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,386
I have roommates,
tandem parking.

50
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,689
Anyway, I am here for
my plasma donation.

51
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:19,787
- We don't call it a donation
when you're taking $75 for it.

52
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,055
- Fair point.

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,944
- They go from nothing
to something...

54
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,367
- You're three
pounds underweight.

55
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,716
Can't give plasma today.

56
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,732
- Not possible.

57
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,545
I do this every two
months. Check your records.

58
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,604
- Check the scale.

59
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,231
Come back when you qualify.

60
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,654
- Or what you could
be to what you are.

61
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,889
- Hey.
- Good morning.

62
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:40,546
Do you want to meet up
if you have a break,

63
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,743
on-call room on four?

64
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:43,114
- Sounds fun.

65
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,726
Might take me a
while to get there.

66
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,827
I'm in Phoenix.

67
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,133
- Why?

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,737
- Because that's
where my next job is.

69
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,315
I finished my gig in Seattle.
- What?

70
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,367
You never said anything.

71
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,429
I was with you two days ago.

72
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,180
- Well, you always
seem more interested

73
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:57,780
in the on-call room on
four than actually talking.

74
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,382
- I...

75
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:00,689
- I got to go.

76
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,164
Let me know if you're
ever in Phoenix.

77
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,076
- I mean, I'd just
as soon elope,

78
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,586
but Trey and his family...
Super into tradition.

79
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:10,648
When he asked his brother to
be his best man, he cried.

80
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,941
My sister and I
hardly speak, and...

81
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,352
- She's trying to say that
she needs a maid of honor.

82
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:19,785
- Oh, I like you so much, but
I would be bad at that job.

83
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,730
- Hey, what the hell?

84
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,391
You left me again.
- Be on time.

85
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,190
- You know, if your
silver-spoon, nepotism ass

86
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:26,595
isn't in the seat by
7:00, you are out of luck.

87
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,338
- Tough, punctual, efficient...
There's your maid of honor.

88
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,749
- What?
- Forget it.

89
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:32,160
But you said 6:45.

90
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,738
- Yes, because we
gave you a fake time

91
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,984
that's 15 minutes before we're
actually planning to leave.

92
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,767
- And yet, you
still can't make it.

93
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,311
- Well, you could
have woken me up.

94
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,719
Does anybody have my back here?

95
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,041
- No.

96
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:03,802
- Oh, okay. Yes, I understand.

97
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:06,115
And I appreciate it, but...

98
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,289
Okay. Thank you.

99
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,460
- Busy morning?

100
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,192
- How come no one ever mentions
that part of the chief job

101
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,563
is actually being a reference
for other institutions

102
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,380
who are looking to
poach your surgeons?

103
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,404
- Not following.

104
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:18,706
- Harvard Med, NYU,
Heart Center of Chicago,

105
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,078
they're all on my call list

106
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,690
because they are
interested in Pierce.

107
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:23,270
How long has she
been working here?

108
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,316
Maybe there is something
in her contract

109
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,101
that prohibits her from leaving.

110
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:29,448
- Leaving? Maggie?
- Yeah.

111
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,842
That article has given
her a lot of attention.

112
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,881
Look, I don't wanna hold anyone
back, but we just lost Grey.

113
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,700
I mean, how do we
get Pierce to stay?

114
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,378
- Yeah, I'm on it.

115
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,388
Oh, great. Thanks.

116
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,001
I'm sorry... yeah, hi.

117
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,825
This is she.

118
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,087
- So cough and
sniffles, bed six.

119
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,607
- Nothing like half a
decade of medical training

120
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:49,863
to use on a runny nose.

121
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,349
- You know, I had a
patient who had sniffles.

122
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,859
Turned out he had a CSF
leak in his brain, so...

123
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,116
Uh, oh, complex trauma
case transferred

124
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,141
from a rural hospital.

125
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,615
Kwan, you wanna see the helipad?

126
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,996
- Oh, yeah.
- Just Kwan or...

127
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,031
- Adams, code phlegm.

128
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,481
Bed five needs a Neti pot.

129
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,034
Thank God you're here.

130
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:07,797
- Ma'am, please try
to keep your mask on.

131
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,626
- Agh, help!

132
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,041
I need a doctor.

133
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:11,830
- Move.
- I saw him first.

134
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:13,236
- Nope.
- No...

135
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:15,058
- Hey, hey.

136
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,878
- Have you been injured?

137
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,870
- Okay, rodeo wreck...
Rider in Oregon

138
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,624
got bucked off and stomped
on by a 1,000-pound bull.

139
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,924
- It's barbaric... bull riding.

140
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,295
Nothing but testosterone addicts

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,666
getting off on torturing animals

142
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,375
because it makes them
feel more like a man.

143
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
- Huh. Let's go.

144
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,511
Kay, what do we got?

145
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,394
- Georgia Arkins,
16. Crush injuries

146
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,007
from being trampled by a bull.

147
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:39,166
GCS 15, CT scan shows
a retrohepatic hematoma

148
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,460
from an IVC tear,

149
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:41,900
multiple lumbar burst fractures.

150
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,121
Vital signs are stable.

151
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,419
- She's been given
sedatives for transfer,

152
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:45,789
so she's a little out of it.

153
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:46,930
Local hospital didn't
feel equipped to handle

154
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,577
her complex injuries.
- Thank you.

155
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,132
- Can I go again?

156
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,883
The bull, can I go again?

157
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,507
I only got to 5 seconds.

158
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,809
- So anything you want to add

159
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:57,053
to your initial
assessment, Kwan?

160
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,385
Look up for me.

161
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,300
- He's exaggerating.

162
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,656
- Ever since the
interview, she's received

163
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,820
half a dozen amazing offers,

164
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,892
including a position in
bioartificial heart research.

165
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:11,378
- So we inject an
extracellular matrix

166
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,243
of a pig's heart, which
serves as, like, scaffolding,

167
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:16,866
with human stem cells,
that it can grow

168
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,419
cardiac muscle tissue.

169
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,870
- And then we electrically
stimulate them to twitch,

170
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,528
cell by cell, until they
start to beat together,

171
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:26,703
essentially as
one beating heart.

172
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,015
- It's beautiful.

173
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,268
- Yeah, which means more hearts

174
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,363
for people who need them.

175
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:34,055
- The research is at the
Heart Center of Chicago.

176
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,611
- Oh. Well, that's
a fantastic city.

177
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:39,406
- Yes, it is!

178
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,236
It's the Art Institute
and Steppenwolf,

179
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,686
deep dish pizza.

180
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,377
- You can keep those
winters, though,

181
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:48,587
with the wind just ripping
in off the lake like that.

182
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,348
- That's what parkas
and mittens are for.

183
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,522
- And it's weak pizza, really.

184
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:54,283
It's just quantity over quality.

185
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,423
- So are you considering it?

186
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,114
- Well, I might like to, but...

187
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:59,402
- Look, I've already
moved across the country

188
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,653
for you once.

189
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,463
And then, when I tried
to change my specialty,

190
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:05,696
also for you, you lost
all respect for me.

191
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,442
So...

192
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,179
- Please don't put
words into my mouth.

193
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,757
- Those are your words.

194
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,435
You put those words
in your own mouth.

195
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,905
I have to go.

196
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,726
- You have to go now?
- Can we pick this up?

197
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,969
- God's sake, Maggie,
I have waited weeks,

198
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,905
weeks of just tiptoeing around,

199
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,692
going along with this
ceasefire that you proposed

200
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,524
until we could get in
here and try to fix this.

201
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:35,378
And now you're on the hot seat,
so you just want to walk out?

202
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,948
You know, no, I'm not even
that surprised by this.

203
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,846
- I'm on trauma call, Winston.

204
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,829
Please excuse me.

205
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,185
- Hey, what are you doing here?

206
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,241
The kids okay?

207
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,854
- Everyone's fine, except you.

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,372
You're not fine.

209
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,537
And you're also not sick.

210
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:19,432
- I am sick. What
are you doing here?

211
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,242
- I took the kids to day care,
and I took a personal day,

212
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,995
because your body does this.

213
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,636
- My body does what?

214
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,699
- It aches so that you'll
rest because it's learned

215
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,243
that if it aches,
you'll stay in bed,

216
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,841
when nothing else works
to keep you in bed.

217
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,902
You need a day off,
but you're not sick,

218
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:42,045
which is why you get a latte

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,787
and...

220
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:54,161
The little doughnuts
with the pink frosting.

221
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,153
- You took the day off?

222
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,733
- Yeah, I figured you
could use the company.

223
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:03,797
Plus, after I eat three boxes
of these, I'm no good at work.

224
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,734
- You ate three boxes?

225
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,065
- No, but I'm about to.

226
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,385
You might want to look away.

227
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,594
- I'm just gonna go.

228
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:14,771
No.

229
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,496
- Ow!
- Any feeling of nausea?

230
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,740
Ah, not really.

231
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:24,225
Is there anything you
can do about the pain?

232
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,745
It feels like someone's
dicing my intestines.

233
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,551
- We'll take care of
that for you in a moment.

234
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,197
But I need to finish
this physical exam

235
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:31,888
before we can...
- Look, I came here

236
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:34,063
because Grey-Sloan's
supposed to be the best.

237
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:35,905
So please, you gotta help me.

238
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,585
- It could be a
positive McBurney sign.

239
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,964
- Which could be caused by...

240
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,310
- Appendicitis.
- Diverticulitis.

241
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,249
- Yo! What the hell?

242
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,637
- I was seeing if the
pain was exacerbated

243
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,869
by jostling movements.

244
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,388
- Can we wait to play school

245
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,923
until I'm not in agony?

246
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,256
- Let's get him comfortable.

247
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:52,869
We'll send him up
for the basic labs,

248
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,522
and then let's take him
up to CT for some scans.

249
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,714
- Did I hear correctly, a bull?

250
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,992
- T-bird. He's feisty.

251
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,270
I just didn't get out over
his front end in time.

252
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,238
- When T-bird
trampled over Georgia,

253
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,447
he crushed her liver
and likely tore her IVC.

254
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,105
There's a big hematoma in
the retrohepatic space,

255
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,142
which it looks contained
for now, stable HNH.

256
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,938
- She's got unstable T10
through L3 burst fractures.

257
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,369
- Please don't tell my parents.

258
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:24,917
They freak out whenever
stuff like this happens.

259
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,688
- This has happened before?

260
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,682
- I had a huge cut on my back,
a broken wrist, a broken leg.

261
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh, and I have
this massive scar.

262
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,979
- Whoa, whoa!
- Push two of midazolam.

263
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,858
- Okay, this burst L3
fracture is too unstable.

264
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:39,000
Without immediate surgery,
we're talking about paralysis.

265
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,288
Once Maggie goes in
and repairs the IVC,

266
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:42,763
I will stabilize the spine.

267
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,377
- I don't think I should go in.

268
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,799
- There's a massive hematoma.

269
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:47,008
- And it's sitting
in a minefield.

270
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,260
The hematoma is stable for now.

271
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,045
But you should go in
and repair the spine,

272
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,698
and I will be there
to monitor her.

273
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,948
Just use a posterior approach
to avoid rupturing it.

274
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,561
- What if it happens anyway?

275
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,845
- Then we'll flip her,

276
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,319
and I will control the bleeding.

277
00:10:58,354 --> 00:10:59,561
- No, I'm not sure
I should go in.

278
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,346
- If you don't, she
never walks again.

279
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,003
- Are Georgia's parents here?

280
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:08,502
- Look. All I need
is antibiotics.

281
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,470
It'll clear up in
a few days or so.

282
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,866
- Maybe.

283
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,488
But I am hearing some
wheezing in the left lung.

284
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:16,473
Okay.

285
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,397
We should get a chest
X-ray, make sure

286
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:19,715
we're not looking at pneumonia.

287
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,294
- No. No chest X-ray.

288
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,873
- There's no
discomfort involved.

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,830
- Until the bill comes.

290
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,731
- When my husband died,
I was lucky enough

291
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,802
to find work in a bookstore.

292
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,494
It's lovely.

293
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,830
The owner is kind, but
low wages and no...

294
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:40,154
No benefits.

295
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:42,053
- Without the
X-ray, I can't tell

296
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:43,433
how serious this is, so...

297
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,540
- I can hardly
afford antibiotics.

298
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,922
Anything else is
out of the question.

299
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:51,925
- Look, I'll get
you the antibiotics,

300
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,548
but just stay here.

301
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,894
Okay? I'll be right back.

302
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,275
- Dr. Sutton, Dr. Tracy,

303
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:58,276
psych to recovery.

304
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,909
Dr. Sutton to recovery.

305
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,108
- He didn't even tell
me he was leaving.

306
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,938
He insinuated that
I wouldn't care

307
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:07,078
because I only
cared about the sex.

308
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,735
I didn't use him for sex.

309
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,930
He used me for sex,
and then he left.

310
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,571
I'm the victim here.

311
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,199
- You're the doctor.
He's the nurse.

312
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:16,315
You've got all the power.

313
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,790
- You clearly don't
understand gay male culture.

314
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,263
He's hotter.

315
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,713
He has all the power.

316
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,208
- Doesn't sound like
he felt that way.

317
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,854
- Why aren't you sad for me?

318
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,754
I'm the nice guy who,
once again, got left.

319
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,618
- Well, the interns
who have come in here

320
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,452
after working and being
yelled at for 16 hours

321
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,769
definitely don't feel
like you're the nice guy.

322
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,635
- I don't yell!

323
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,107
That wasn't yelling.

324
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,590
That was loud talking.

325
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,937
I'm nice.

326
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,384
- I love you. I mean it.

327
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,293
- If the hematoma ruptures
while you're fixing the spine,

328
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,467
she could die.

329
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,951
- But if it doesn't rupture,

330
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:55,126
it could heal on its own?
- That's right.

331
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,095
- The safest option is to just
monitor Georgia in the ICU.

332
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,753
- She may not walk again,
but she would be alive.

333
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,445
- Sounds like this thing
could rupture any time.

334
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,182
I mean, hell, it could
be rupturing right now.

335
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:07,621
Cody... She...

336
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,026
- He's not wrong.

337
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,172
- Do the spinal surgery.

338
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,923
- Sir, I wanna make sure
that you understand...

339
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,500
- We do.

340
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,705
Save our daughter's
ability to ride.

341
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,164
- No stranding,
appendix looks normal.

342
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:35,214
No evidence of colitis.

343
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:38,816
- That's an awfully
quick assessment, Adams.

344
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:42,345
You know, scans are
like a piece of art,

345
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,106
a still life, say.

346
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,936
Maybe you first look
at it and you shrug.

347
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:49,007
Looks like a pear, or tulip.

348
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,699
But you sit with it for a while,

349
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,390
learn to open up your mind,

350
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:55,324
and maybe it might
guide your eye

351
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,499
to something that the
artist wants you to see.

352
00:13:58,534 --> 00:13:59,383
- Hold up.

353
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:01,720
It turns out Seth's been to
five different Seattle ERs

354
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,124
in the past three weeks,

355
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,532
all discharged with a script
for controlled pain meds.

356
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,995
- Seattle Pres, two
nights, Pacific Gen, one,

357
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,686
St. Anne's, two hours.
- Okay.

358
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:13,847
I get what you're implying.

359
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,491
- And according
to their records,

360
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,431
you have a history of drug use

361
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,666
that you didn't bother
to tell us about.

362
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,532
We can't help you if you're
not telling the truth.

363
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,009
- Oh, my God. I...
I don't have...

364
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,185
Back in the day, I did
Adderall to stay up.

365
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,704
I'm a private equity analyst.

366
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,026
All-nighters go
with the territory

367
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,155
when you're starting out.

368
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,743
But I haven't done it in years.

369
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:36,197
And I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

370
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,687
to write me off like all
those other hospitals.

371
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,988
- We're not writing you off.

372
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:40,403
Addiction is a disease.

373
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:41,819
- It's a disease I don't have.

374
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:43,821
- And your scans are clean.

375
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,039
And I got on the
phone with colleagues

376
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:46,238
of those other hospitals,

377
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,261
who also found
nothing on your scans.

378
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,251
- Maybe they didn't sit
long enough with the scans.

379
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,847
- These aren't interns, Adams.

380
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,115
These are world-class surgeons

381
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,620
with decades of experience.

382
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,085
- So you're just gonna
kick me out on the street

383
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,043
like everyone else?

384
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,915
- No, we are gonna
exercise our due diligence

385
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,176
and take extra tests,

386
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,145
and if they show nothing,
then we will discharge you

387
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,309
with a referral to an
addiction specialist.

388
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:07,138
- I should never have
admitted I ever used drugs.

389
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,675
You screw up once, you're
a screw-up forever.

390
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:26,281
- She's about prepped and ready.

391
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,741
Why didn't you tell me
about all the job offers?

392
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,630
- Offers come in
every time I publish.

393
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,679
Happens to everyone.
- Not like this.

394
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,781
Look, it doesn't matter
where you are, right?

395
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,900
I mean, it matters
what you're doing.

396
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,271
If you just ask Teddy or Richard

397
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,815
for whatever you
need research-wise,

398
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,289
they will get it for you.

399
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,833
You don't have to move to
do your next big thing.

400
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,029
Meredith and I
managed to pull off

401
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:51,056
the Parkinson's procedure
right down the hall.

402
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:52,825
- She's ready.

403
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,030
- All right.

404
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,693
- So when you all told
me about those 8:30

405
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,911
surgical study sessions,
what time were they really?

406
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:08,942
What do you think

407
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,816
about Chilaiditi
syndrome for Seth?

408
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,394
- Thinking it's
usually associated

409
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:13,785
with ascitic and
cirrhotic patients.

410
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,431
Also, we would have
seen it in the scans.

411
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:16,847
And we have our answer.

412
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,823
All those tests came back
clean, except his urinalysis,

413
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,097
which is positive for opiates.

414
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,041
- Because all those other
hospitals gave him meds.

415
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,206
- Webber said to discharge him.

416
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,336
I'm gonna discharge him.

417
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,927
- Tessa Hobbes.

418
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,299
- Why would you bring up Tessa?
You know that still hurts.

419
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,906
- Because my gut told me
that we should have taken her

420
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,982
straight to the OR.

421
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:36,462
You heard me say it, but
I didn't fight for it.

422
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:38,430
And now my gut's saying that
Seth's telling the truth.

423
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,088
- Nothing I've seen makes
me think Webber's wrong.

424
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,263
- Yeah, but do you
think there might be

425
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,909
a chance that I'm right?

426
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,382
I mean, I've always
had your back.

427
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,337
Could you at least have mine?

428
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,562
- I'm already on my
second residency.

429
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,021
- He's not gonna fire us.

430
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,378
- Have suction ready.

431
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:00,290
- Blood pressure's steady.

432
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:04,685
- Chief, I have a wheezing
60-year-old patient in the ER,

433
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,931
possible pneumonia.

434
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,317
She needs a chest X-ray
and a nebulizer treatment,

435
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,620
but can't afford it.
Can we do it pro bono?

436
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,624
- You'll have to fill out
the forms with accounting.

437
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:13,972
They're gonna want
to confirm her income

438
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,086
and make sure that
she qualifies.

439
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,318
It may take a day or so.

440
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,975
- But she needs
to be treated now.

441
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,769
- If we break the
rules for one patient,

442
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,219
it's not fair for the others.

443
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,259
I was eating doughnuts
from the trash

444
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,502
because I need to gain weight
in order to be eligible

445
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,032
to donate my plasma
because I am broke.

446
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,885
So is my patient.

447
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,959
I don't need your help,

448
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,468
and I am not looking
for handouts.

449
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,230
I just want to take
care of my patient.

450
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,142
- I'm sorry.

451
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,452
You have to go through
the proper channels.

452
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:45,438
Yasuda, I have protein
bars in my office.

453
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,702
You're welcome to them any time.

454
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,159
- Removing the lamina.

455
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,290
Can't stop thinking
about that father.

456
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:54,053
I'm reconstructing a spine just
to have her go back out there

457
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,527
and wreck it all over again.

458
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,740
- Yeah, lots of parents

459
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,295
live out their fantasies
through their kids.

460
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,600
- So her last shock panel
showed a hemoglobin of 11.

461
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,787
So the bleed is stable.

462
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:04,297
Just be careful with
your instrumentation.

463
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,695
- I'm not sure you hovering
is gonna make things

464
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,377
go more smoothly.

465
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:10,312
- How many times have we
fixed up a pro football player

466
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:11,866
just so he can go back out
in the field in the hopes

467
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,202
of making the playoffs?

468
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,041
- Don't get me
started on football.

469
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,530
- Except rodeo is the only gig

470
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,223
with a poor animal out
there against their will.

471
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:19,360
It's cruel.
- Can we keep

472
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,668
all nonessential
chatter to a minimum?

473
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:23,641
Georgia has a giant
bleed hanging over her

474
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,806
that could burst in any second.

475
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:26,832
- Pedicle screw, please.

476
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,118
- I think it's a
connection. I think...

477
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,291
- Adams, Griffith!

478
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,509
- Is everything
okay, Dr. Schmidt?

479
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,273
- Just checking in on
how you two are doing.

480
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:42,247
How's life?

481
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,475
What's up?

482
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,579
- I don't understand.

483
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,352
- What are you working on?

484
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,757
- Okay, we... we know Webber
said to discharge him.

485
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,415
But we really think

486
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,831
that there's something
more to this patient.

487
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,429
And if we could just
have a little more time

488
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,603
to study his case,
we can figure it out.

489
00:18:58,627 --> 00:18:59,697
- Okay. No.

490
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:00,870
You're interns.

491
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,803
It doesn't matter
what you think.

492
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,358
If you can't be trusted
to follow instructions,

493
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:07,291
then you can't be
trusted in the OR.

494
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:09,818
Discharge the patient.

495
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,951
And never question
Dr. Webber ever again.

496
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:30,107
- I should probably go
to work and check on Tia.

497
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:32,488
- Tia and her baby
are both okay.

498
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:34,487
I've checked.

499
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,355
A car drove into human beings

500
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,012
and tried to kill
you and your friends.

501
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,576
You've earned a day off.

502
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:46,905
- Why is it so hard
for me to rest?

503
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,551
How am I supposed to know that?

504
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:54,131
- Because you knew
that I wasn't sick

505
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:55,718
before I even knew
that I wasn't sick.

506
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,134
- I've known you a long time.

507
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,570
You notice things about somebody

508
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,769
when you've known
them a long time.

509
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:03,072
- You knew what my
favorite doughnuts were.

510
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:04,471
- Same answer.

511
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,913
- So why is it so
hard for me to rest?

512
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:08,696
You don't have a theory?

513
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,640
I could tell you why I think

514
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,942
it's hard for me to rest.

515
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,623
Would that help?

516
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,663
- Yes, please.

517
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:22,285
- Well, I was a pretty
happy go-lucky kid.

518
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,382
I got cancer, and my parents
started to fight all the time.

519
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:31,137
And I was sick, stuck in bed,
listening to my parents fight

520
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,458
through the walls.

521
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:35,964
So I think I associate
rest with misery.

522
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,867
- I don't think that's it.

523
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:42,179
- Okay.

524
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,904
You know me better
than I know me.

525
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,251
- I've known you a long time,

526
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,607
and when you've known
someone a long time,

527
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,631
you notice things.

528
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,195
- So what do you think it is?

529
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,327
- I think you only
have trouble resting

530
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,217
when you're not taking
care of somebody else.

531
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,440
You'll lay around all day
with a baby on your chest

532
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:05,098
if that baby needs you.

533
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:10,552
You lay in bed with me with
doughnuts if I need you.

534
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,554
And when you got cancer

535
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,410
and your parents
started fighting,

536
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,145
you started to take care of them

537
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,733
so they wouldn't split up.

538
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,563
You learned to
take emotional care

539
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,748
of the people who are supposed
to be taking care of you.

540
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,601
And that's why it's
hard for you to rest

541
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,914
when you're by yourself.

542
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:29,778
You don't feel safe
when you're not

543
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,416
taking care of somebody else.

544
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:34,558
That makes you anxious.

545
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:49,505
- And I think you can't rest

546
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,292
because you never had
anyone to take care of you.

547
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:56,011
So you stayed busy all the time

548
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,186
taking care of yourself.

549
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,472
And when you're still,
you feel that pain.

550
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,163
- I need a nap.

551
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,786
- Want me to go?

552
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,685
- No.

553
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:23,487
That feels nice.

554
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:39,296
- Harborview Med, last
Tuesday, 2311, nothing.

555
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,332
- If Webber or Schmidt
finds us, we're fired.

556
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,747
- Yeah, well...

557
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,661
- You'd think
that'd be annoying.

558
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,496
- It clears my mind,
helps me unwind.

559
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,379
You have anything like that?

560
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,413
- Ice skating.

561
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:58,082
What?

562
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,248
I just... I wasn't
expecting that.

563
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:03,009
- Well, you don't know
everything about me.

564
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,308
- True.

565
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,782
I never pictured you as the type

566
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:10,067
to have a big fancy wedding
or matching dresses.

567
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,338
- I don't want either.

568
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:17,526
I want the marriage, but not
the pomp and circumstance.

569
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:21,037
- Not even a little pomp,
like meat on a stick

570
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:23,823
or chucking a bouquet at
your girls, group pics?

571
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:26,664
- I truly hate you.

572
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:30,589
I think it's sweet
that Trey wants

573
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:32,306
to create a moment in our lives

574
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:33,815
that we're gonna
remember forever.

575
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,396
But he's a romantic.

576
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,968
Even when we're just
out getting pizza,

577
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,968
he's like, "I wish I could
freeze this moment forever."

578
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:39,770
- Oh, wait. Wait. Wait.

579
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:41,211
That's it.

580
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:43,567
Moments... that's..

581
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,861
Okay.

582
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:46,279
These scans... They're
not works of art.

583
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:48,063
They're... they're moments.

584
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:51,160
They're frozen moments in time.

585
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,304
- Oh, good. Glad
we cleared that up.

586
00:23:56,338 --> 00:23:58,271
- Okay, look. Here we go.

587
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,650
There and there...

588
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,515
- Do you know where they came
up with the eight seconds

589
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,233
as the time the rider
has to stay on the bull?

590
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,259
It's because the bull
starts to lose its strength

591
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,159
to fight back and
they stop bucking.

592
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,169
The official line is that it's
for the safety of the animals,

593
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:17,196
but it's really because
they become so weakened

594
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:18,843
that we stop being entertained.

595
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:21,877
- BP's dropping.

596
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,225
- Pierce, is that
what I think it is?

597
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:24,630
- She's bleeding out.

598
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:26,309
- The hematoma ruptured.
Stop the fusion.

599
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,911
We need to flip her.
- Her spine is exposed.

600
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:28,795
- It doesn't matter.

601
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,210
Pack it and throw
some ioban on it.

602
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,442
Hang 2 units of blood.

603
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:33,272
Prep for an x-flap
and a sternotomy.

604
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,859
Every second counts
here, people.

605
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:36,147
Until we get this bleed stopped,

606
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,172
this is my OR.

607
00:24:58,451 --> 00:24:59,970
- Okay. This is it.

608
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,767
When we get in there, Kwan,
you're gonna alternate

609
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,242
cardiac massage with Millin.

610
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:06,322
Scalpel.

611
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,049
Okay, Georgia, here we go.

612
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:11,714
- Scalpel.

613
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:16,300

- She's becoming more acidotic.

620
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,315
- We can't lose her.

621
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,858
- I need more suction.

622
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,422
- Still no pulse.

00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:25,393
- I've got the cava

631
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:26,626
- Millin, switch with Kwan.

632
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:28,317
- We've maxed out
on her pressors.

633
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:29,799
- Pickups?
- Still no pulse.

634
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,537

Ligating, push epi.

- Packing the

638
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:49,860

639
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:53,133
- ♪ Set me free

640
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,803
The nurse brought

and the inhaler.
I'm off to my shift.

642
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,255
- Please don't go
before getting an X-ray

643
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,488
and the nebulizer treatment.

644
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:01,647
We could do it pro bono,

645
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,363
but we just need to
fill these forms out.

646
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,837
- If I miss work,
I don't get paid.

647
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,177
And if I don't get paid...

648
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:07,815
- You can't pay your
bills. I get it.

649
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,910
- No...
- But...

650
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:10,856
- No, you don't.

651
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:13,401
You're a doctor
with a cushy salary.

652
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:16,083
- Well, I am a surgical intern.

653
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:18,766
My salary is government
funded, and it is not enough

654
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,379
to keep me from
drowning in loans.

655
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:21,684
Between undergrad
and med school,

656
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,366
I owe more than
two grand a month.

657
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,162
That doesn't even account
for what I send to my parents

658
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,510
to help them with
their mortgage payment

659
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,329
because they co-signed
all of my loans.

660
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:31,081
I literally sell my
blood in order to get by.

661
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,395
And if I thought that I had
pneumonia that could lead

662
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,041
to sepsis and
respiratory failure

663
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:36,084
that could prove fatal
if left untreated,

664
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,282
or, at the very least,

665
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,699
keep me out of work
for eight weeks,

666
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:42,106
I would get the X-ray
and the treatment.

667
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:44,221
And when the bill came, I
would pay the bare minimum.

668
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,707
And if it went to the
collection agencies,

669
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,974
I would pay them the
bare minimum too.

670
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,864
And it might be a huge,
long, pain in the ass,

671
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:52,339
but I would be alive.

672
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,823
- Where do I go for
the chest X-ray?

673
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:09,447
- Pick it up, guys,
a little faster.

674
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,783
- You know what they called
me when I was chief resident?

675
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,006
The Nazi.

676
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:16,677
- That is wildly
inappropriate...

677
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:19,398
- Yes.
- On so many levels.

678
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:22,061
- I mean, I wasn't
a tough child,

679
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,398
not in the obvious ways.

680
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:26,263
I was sensitive all
through high school

681
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,437
and undergrad and med school.

682
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:31,648
So as a resident, even
more so as chief resident,

683
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:34,754
I thought I had
to overcompensate.

684
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:37,688
And for a while,
I became someone

685
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:39,734
people didn't like very much.

686
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,529
- And what did you do?

687
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:47,317
- Well, I realized
that my idea of myself

688
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,399
had come out of sync
with who I had become.

689
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,300
Schmidt, you are
chief resident now.

690
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:56,017
You are no longer an underdog.

691
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:58,675
It's time for you to stop
seeing yourself that way.

692
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,297
- You're saying I
shouldn't demand

693
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:01,526
excellence from the interns?

694
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:04,085
- I'm saying there's
many ways to do that.

695
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,784
And the one that will
work best for you

696
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,867
is likely the one
that lets you be you.

697
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:12,551
I mean, you said you want us
to be the vagina of the program

698
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,824
because vaginas are so strong.

699
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:18,128
Well, vaginas also
bring pleasure.

700
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:21,328
They bring joy, bring life.

701
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:25,650
You got to be the whole vagina,
Schmidt, not just the muscle.

702
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,874
- It's like we were staring
at a single cell of film

703
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,409
and trying to watch a movie.

704
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:35,822
We have to look at all the scans

705
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:38,471
in order to see if
they tell a story.

706
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:42,051
Okay, look... Look
here, four to five.

707
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,285
There's a slight thickening
in the cecal wall here.

708
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,175
Yeah? And then
six and seven...

709
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,422
- No more thickening,
but mild fat stranding.

710
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:50,300
- Yeah.

711
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:55,327
And then eight, nine, ten,
the pattern reappears.

712
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,547
The flare-ups come and go,

713
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:59,324
but the CT scans only
capture one moment in time.

714
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,564
Now our little film
tells a different story.

715
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,947
I mean, there's gotta
be something in there,

716
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:05,111
a foreign object
causing these reactions.

717
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,001
- Like a fish bone, maybe,
or a piece of cartilage

718
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,441
that wasn't digested properly?

719
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:11,053
- You want to tell
me why the patient

720
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:15,322
I told you to discharge hours
ago is still stuck in my ER?

721
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:21,215
- So she's gonna be okay?

722
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,259
- Uh, yeah.

723
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:25,668
Georgia did well under
the circumstances,

724
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,042
against all odds.

725
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,327
- But we would like
to speak with you

726
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,939
about the bull riding.

727
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,099
- I should wait for my husband.

728
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:36,462
- We would like to have
a minute with just you.

729
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:38,227
- Oh.

730
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:45,964
Georgia's father, her
grandfather, her uncles...

731
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:48,165
They are all champion riders.

732
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,503
But Cody never wanted
Georgia to go near a bull.

733
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,269
Every Christmas,
he would give her

734
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:59,865
a dollhouse, ballet
slippers, a soccer ball.

735
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,245
She wouldn't touch them.

736
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,904
She wanted boots,
spurs, a saddle.

737
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,872
Cody thought when she
took her first spill,

738
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,284
she'd lose interest, but...

739
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,231
but when she got laid up
with a crushed trachea,

740
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:14,534
we said no more.

741
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,675
Guess what? She wouldn't eat,

742
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,712
wouldn't speak, couldn't sleep.

743
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:23,470
The light in her
eyes was just gone.

744
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:27,428
- To keep doing this will
very likely kill her.

745
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,421
- You think I don't
worry about that

746
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:32,044
every single day of my life?

747
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:35,107
But to take her dream
away from her...

748
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,975
That would for sure kill her.

749
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,829
Excuse me.

750
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,014
I'm gonna go find my husband.

751
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:45,579
- Nothing is harder
than parenting,

752
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,957
but you have to be the parent.

753
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:49,846
- Would it have worked on you

754
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,744
when you were a teenager
doing hard drugs,

755
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,091
risking your life?

756
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:55,852
Was your mom able to stop you?

757
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,370
- I was using drugs to mask

758
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,477
some very real pain in my life.

759
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:02,173
- Maybe it's the
same for Georgia.

760
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:04,200
Maybe she's masking the
pain of having found

761
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,113
her one true passion

762
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,587
and hearing everyone around her

763
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:11,651
tell her that she is
selfish for chasing it.

764
00:32:13,062 --> 00:32:14,802
- Oh, no, no, no,
no. Georgia, no.

765
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:16,006
- She's pulling the tube out.

766
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:18,343
- Increase her O2
and draw an ABG.

767
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,091
Hey.

768
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:22,120
- Georgia, you're okay.
Just take a breath.

769
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:28,383
- Georgia, calm down. I need
you to put this mask on.

770
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:29,824
Your body needs
additional oxygen.

771
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,794
- I've had kids
self-extubate before.

772
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,661
Instinct and adrenaline kick in.

773
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,446
- How long... How
long will it take?

774
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,923
- You will be up and walking
in four to six weeks.

775
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,348
- Ride.

776
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:42,756
- Georgia, going back to
rodeo would be a mistake.

777
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:44,748
Most people do not
survive the surgery

778
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,005
that Dr. Pierce just did.

779
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,470
- I'm not most people!

780
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:50,498
Would you be saying the
same thing if I was a guy?

781
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,374
- Georgia, I'm not like
most people either.

782
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,781
I was really good at something
when I was your age too.

783
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,670
I skipped grades, I won prizes,

784
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:57,924
and everybody thought
it was my parents

785
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:00,088
that were pushing me, but
it was me. It was all me.

786
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,780
So I get your focus.

787
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,195
I get your passion.

788
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,501
And I certainly get
what it's like to be

789
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,104
a girl in an all-guys' world.

790
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,684
Maybe you'll ride again someday.

791
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:10,384
But a few hours ago, you were
almost dead and paralyzed.

792
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,998
Stop fighting us and let
us save the possibility

793
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,138
of your future.

794
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:20,606
- There's the ileocecal valve.

795
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,564
- I hope we didn't
just put a tube

796
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:24,591
into a patient for no reason.

797
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,756
- Whoa, whoa, what's
that in the distal ileum?

798
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:30,111
- Move the camera down and left.

799
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:32,856
- There!
- Is that a...

800
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,891
- Toothpick. I'll be damned.

801
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:35,929
- Oh, my God.

802
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:38,585
How did it not shred his
esophagus on the way down?

803
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:40,508
- Well, it perfed the bowel.

804
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,821
Then it impacted into
the intestinal wall,

805
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,133
where it hid from
the scanner's radar.

806
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:46,664
Adams, what's the game plan?

807
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:49,623
- Use the endoscopy forceps
to fish it out carefully.

808
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:51,696
- Being careful not to break
it and leave a piece behind

809
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,671
that could cause
an abscess later.

810
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:58,584
- All right, hold it steady.

811
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,475
- Will this take away
all of this pain?

812
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,812
- It absolutely will.

813
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,321
Almost there.

814
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,659
Incredible save, Adams.

815
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:19,754
Incredible save.

816
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:24,689
- Have I mentioned
that I had my hand

817
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:26,328
on an actual beating heart?

818
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:28,428
- Only about six times.

819
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,016
- But hey, I heard you found
a bobby pin in some guy's ass

820
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,733
or something, so also cool.

821
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,735
- I convinced a patient
to get a chest X-ray.

822
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,564
- Hey, congratulations, Adams.

823
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,542
Yasuda's day was
sadder than yours.

824
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,887
- Yeah.

825
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,260
- Hey, thanks for
everything today.

826
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:45,378
If you need anything,
I got your back.

827
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:48,889
- I do need something.

828
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,501
I know this might be weird,

829
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,160
and if it's still hard
for you, you can say no.

830
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:54,979
But you know me better
than anyone here,

831
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,891
better than anyone at my
old program, actually.

832
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:01,073
And I could really use a friend
to help me get through this.

833
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,456
I'm asking you to
be my man of honor.

834
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,442
- Yeah, of course.

835
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:16,685
It'd be an honor.

836
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:19,503
- Thank you.

837
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:22,382
- Hey, everyone,

838
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:24,967
I want you to know
I heard you all did

839
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:27,220
some incredible work today.

840
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:29,694
And so, if you're up for
it, I would like to invite

841
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,652
you all out for drinks.

842
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,449
I'm actually serious.

843
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,812
- Uh, oh.
- So just, you know,

844
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,456
meet me at Joe's.

845
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,705
- Free drinks.
- Yeah.

846
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,995
- Any chance you need
another bartender?

847
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,607
- When would you sleep?

848
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:56,230
- I'd figure it out.

849
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,129
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

850
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,028
The manager is hiring
for the late shift.

851
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:02,546
I can put in a good word.

852
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,892
- Thank you.

853
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,139
- Okay, people,
this is my treat.

854
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:10,313
- Thank God.

855
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:11,566
- Yay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

856
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,454
- Thank you.

857
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:14,731
- Thanks, Dr. Schmidt.

858
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:15,870
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

859
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:17,182
- Welcome.

860
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,183
- Thank you.

861
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,874
- Mm-hmm.

862
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,497
- Mm.
- Oh.

863
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:24,016
- Oh.

864
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,178
- Chaser?
- Mm-hmm.

865
00:36:25,203 --> 00:36:26,477
- What are you, her babysitter?

866
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:27,744
- Man of honor, actually.

867
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:28,808
- Oh, thank God.

868
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,959
I didn't wanna have to carry
around those blood vials.

869
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,175
You mix them together,

870
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,569
and you pour them
out at the altar.

871
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,729
- Why do you think a
maid of honor does that?

872
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:39,135
- My mom did it at
my uncle's wedding.

873
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,240
- I cannot overstate
how not normal that is.

874
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,139
- Whatever. I'm
going to order food.

875
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:44,633
Anyone else?

876
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:47,873
- Can you get me some fries?

877
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,075
- I'm starving.

878
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,158
- So when's the wedding?
- Next month.

879
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:55,170
But it's in town so
no one has to travel.

880
00:36:55,195 --> 00:36:56,570
And I don't need
any extra time off.

881
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:58,076
Trey is gonna take care
of most of the logistics,

882
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,515
so you won't...
- Griffin, I...

883
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,922
I was just asking.

884
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:03,547
- Sorry, yeah.
- That's okay.

885
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,608
- Next month.
- Okay.

886
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,704
- Wanna get out of here?

887
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,896
- I can't.

888
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:13,138
We said no feelings,
and unfortunately,

889
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:15,924
I find your staunch
support of animal rights...

890
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,759
hot.

891
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:19,865
- Okay.

892
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,164
What if I have no feelings?

893
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:26,734
- That works.

894
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:36,537
- You wanna pick up takeout?

895
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,711
I kind of feel like Italian.

896
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:41,645
- I already ordered,
Chang's Garden.

897
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,693
- Right, of course you decided.

898
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:54,583
- Stop.

899
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,601
Stop. I need to look at you

900
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:57,626
when I say this.

901
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:00,937
- Okay.

902
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,447
- You invited me to
dinner with your family,

903
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,681
and then you abandoned
me when things got tough.

904
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:06,795
- What? When?

905
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,995
- The first time that
I met your family,

906
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:11,273
your father showed up,
and you became unhappy,

907
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:16,613
and then you logged off,
and you left me there.

908
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:18,398
My mother always used
to quote Maya Angelou.

909
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,736
She used to say, "When someone
shows you who they are,

910
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:24,005
believe them the first time."

911
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,697
Why didn't I believe
you the first time?

912
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,321
You showed me who you were,

913
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,771
and I just didn't wanna see it.

914
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,952
- And who am I?
- You're a person who retreats.

915
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,910
When the going gets
tough, you retreat.

916
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,662
You quit. You disappear.

917
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:39,765
You protect yourself, no matter
what it costs anybody else.

918
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:42,912
- You're the one thinking
of taking a job in Chicago.

919
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:45,388
- A job in Chicago
is nothing, Winston.

920
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:48,071
Marriages can easily
survive a job in Chicago.

921
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:51,030
But you don't seem to
want us to survive.

922
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,595
You just seem to want to
punish me with your absence.

923
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,078
- I'm right here!
- But you're not.

924
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:57,514
You're not.

925
00:38:57,549 --> 00:39:00,793
You took your love,
and you retreated.

926
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:04,811
You disappeared inside yourself.

927
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:07,041
When the going got tough,
you protected yourself,

928
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,561
no matter what it
cost anybody else.

929
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,528
I am right here.

930
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:13,662
You are gone.

931
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,801
You couldn't even think
of something nice to say

932
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:18,165
about me this morning.

933
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,019
Even when you wanted
to quit cardio,

934
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,935
supposedly to save our marriage,

935
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,272
that was you quitting.

936
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:24,781
That was you retreating.

937
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:27,913
That was you giving up your gift

938
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:29,595
so that you could
avoid direct conflict,

939
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,657
and that is what
I don't respect.

940
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:36,666
It isn't your heart,
Winston, it's your cowardice.

941
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:39,023
- Oh, wow, really, Maggie?

942
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:42,396
- And the pizza in Chicago
is the best in the world.

943
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:44,478
So I'm gonna go there.

944
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:47,210
And I'm gonna take my
extraordinary passion,

945
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:49,271
and I'm going to use
it to build hearts

946
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:51,267
that will save
thousands of lives.

947
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,430
And you can stay here,
and you can pretend

948
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:55,202
like it was you
who was abandoned,

949
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,723
but we both know the truth.

950
00:39:56,748 --> 00:40:00,210
- At a cellular level, we are
made of forks in the road.

951
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:04,246
A generalized cell is born,
and it splits and splits,

952

not having much
choice in the matter.

953
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:09,314
Eventually, it's a body.

954
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,134
Eventually, it's you...

955
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,782
- Come here, Scout.
- Out in the world.

956
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,602
- He was down.

957
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:17,249
How are you feeling?

958
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,108

- Hear that, Scout?

964
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,844
She feels better. Whoo-hoo!

965
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,407
- So maybe you are who you are.

966
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:40,198
- All right, can
you say whoo-hoo?

967
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:42,619

you love or what you want

can choose to be

Oh, it was humbling.

974
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:02,154

almost lost a patient.

00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:15,483

losing another sister.
