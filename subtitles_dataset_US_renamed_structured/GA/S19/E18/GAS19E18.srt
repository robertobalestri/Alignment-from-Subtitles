our bodies can't function.

9
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:23,189
- I haven't written mine
yet, but I will by Friday.

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,315
Wait, you already wrote

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,380
and memorized your
vows, didn't you?

12
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:26,484
I'm excited too.

13
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,944
I just need more hours in a day,

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,654
but I did book a car to
pick up your parents.

15
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,989
- Our brains...
- Okay.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,121
Hearts, and kidneys...

17
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,450
- See you soon.

18
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,118
Can only tolerate
a lack of oxygen

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,912
for a limited time before
their cells begin to die.

20
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,748
- Wow, you really know
what you're doing.

21
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,312
- I have had seven sister's
worth of hand-me-downs.

22
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:44,213
This is nothing.

23
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,990
Wouldn't have pegged you
for a vintage dress though.

24
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,057
- I was gonna rock a jumpsuit.
- Fierce!

25
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,966
- But then my grandma
pulled my mom's dress

26
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,426
from the attic, because
she thinks I'm my mom.

27
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,471
And it just felt like a sign.

28
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,473
I'm just lucky you
have tailoring skills.

29
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,017
- Lucky, and also,
you're getting a bill.

30
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,102
About five minutes

31

- ♪ Come and feel it now ♪
- Wow.

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,514
About 30 for the
heart and kidneys.

33
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:06,398
- Don't look.

34
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:07,776
It's bad luck for the
bride to see the roommate

35
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,527
before the wedding.

36
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,987
Yeah, you're fine.

37
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,405
- Have you guys seen this email?

38
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,948
Apparently, Dr. Webber has

39
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,575
a special announcement
this morning.

40
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,035
Wait, do you think
the residency program

41
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,286
is coming off probation?

42
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,704
- Or maybe Grey or
Pierce is coming back?

43
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,623
- Or they're finally
putting cheese curls

44
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,290
back in the vending machine.

45
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,584
It's more likely
than either of yours.

46
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,919
We're leaving in five minutes.

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,879
I'm only gonna tell
you once, okay?

48
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,422
- She's still in
a wedding dress.

49
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,800
- And you're slow.
Get in the shower.

50
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,094
- ♪ Your moment shining down ♪

doctors know the
clock is ticking.

00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,976
- ♪ It's a vibe, can
you feel it now? ♪

54
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,023
- Matcha latte, your favorite.
- Thanks.

55
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,608
- You could have one every
day if you came back.

56
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,235
- Could have one every day now.

57
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,029
- Well, yeah, but you wouldn't
need to cross the street.

58
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,865
Plus, you could wear scrubs,
which are basically pajamas.

59
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,034
- Are those your
big selling points?

60
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,286
- Well, Webber has an
announcement this morning.

61
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,788
That's gotta be good news.

62
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,039
- Yeah, well, don't
get your hopes up.

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,791
I only agreed to
talk to a few people.

64
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,001
Ooh, I gotta go.
- Oh!

65
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,670
You get to save lives...

66
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,421
in pajamas!

67
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,798
- BokHee, hey.

68
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,426
- Um, uh, attention,
everyone. Attention.

69
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,971
- We have some exciting
news that we want to share.

70
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,682
As you know, each year,
the Catherine Fox Award

71
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,809
recognizes surgical innovations

72
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,353
that push the boundaries
of modern medicine.

73
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,231
- It's been some time since
Grey Sloan's had a nominee,

74
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,025
but this morning, we
received word that not one

75
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,529
but two of our doctors
have been nominated.

76
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,282
- Please join me
in congratulating

77
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,159
Dr. Nick Marsh

78
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,203
nominated for his work
on xenotransplantation.

79
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,122
- Wow, thank you.

80
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:47,292
- And Dr. Winston Ndugu,

81
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,503
who's been nominated along
with Dr. Maggie Pierce

82
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,047
for their groundbreaking
partial heart transplant.

83
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,511
We look forward
to celebrating you

84
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,346
at the award ceremony in Boston.

85
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,816
Congratulations
again to both of you

86
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,776
I've got seats on the
Fox Foundation jet.

87
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,111
- Thank you.

88
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,238
I'm headed to the OR now,
but I'm truly honored.

89
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,532
- Congratulations.

90
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,375
- I'll have information
about the ceremony

91
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,919
and travel plans later today.

92
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,212
We're just finalizing
a few things.

93
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,380
- That's okay. I'm good.

94
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,508
I'm... I'm not going.

95
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,885
But thank you.

96
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,179
- Sam Sutton post-op
day two status.

97
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,264
Post upper and lower
limb fracture repairs

98
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,934
and right lower
extremity gastroc flap.

99
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,354
All Doppler signals are strong,
and no sign of infection.

100
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,980
- I hear I'm gonna be famous.

101
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,398
- Well, it depends
on how you define it.

102
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,483
We're writing up your case
for a medical journal,

103
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,318
not "The New York Times."

104
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,362
- But we do hope it'll help
other doctors and patients.

105
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,446
- So they know how to treat

106
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,198
the next guy who
breaks 93 bones.

107
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,659
- Well, your vitals look good.

108
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,243
I'll come back and check
on you later tonight.

109
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
- Great. What happened
to my other doctor?

110
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,790
- Uh, Dr. Griffith, the intern?

111
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,583
- No, no, no, she
had light brown hair,

112
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,835
Disney princess eyes,
heart-stopping smile.

113
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,420
- Dr. Wilson?
- Yes.

114
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,755
Is Dr. Wilson single,

115
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,382
or did she just say that
because I was dying?

116
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,509
- She said that?

117
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,260
- Well, she's with
other patients,

118
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,221
but Dr. Yasuda will
be taking your data

119
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,639
for the rest of the day,
so if you need something,

120
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,766
just ask her.
- All right.

121
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,767
- Yeah.

122
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,603
- You can call me
a Disney princess,

123
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,397
but I don't date patients.

124
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,857
- And we should also
monitor her urine output

125
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,567
and fluid status.

126
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,362
- Uh, Dr. Bailey?

127
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,822
May I please be on your service?

128
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,573
- I thought you
were on Shepherd's.

129
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,367
- I was, but I know this case,

130
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,577
and I can provide a
high level of care.

131
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,788
- You know the patient,

132
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,374
which is a reason for you
not to be on the case.

133
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,792
- She and I are not family,

134
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,252
and we've barely
known each other

135
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,879
for more than a few months.
I can be professional.

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
- I'm happy to switch.

137
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,261
- Okay, Millin, you're with
me. Kwan, go find Shepherd.

138
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,972
Hello.

139
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,098
- Hello, Doctor.

140
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,058
- Maxine Anderson, 81 years old.

141
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,268
Diagnosed with a UTI

142
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,353
complicated by
delirium and sepsis.

143
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,439
Treated with IV antibiotics.

144
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,732
Her delirium has resolved,

145
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,859
and she's been off
pressors for 24 hours.

146
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,486
She's being downgraded
to a stepdown bed today.

147
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,323
How are you feeling today?
- Much better, thank heavens.

148
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,366
I lost my marbles
there for a minute.

149
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,202
- Well, glad you're
feeling better.

150
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,913
- Jules... I mean, Dr. Millin,

151
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,582
if that happens again,

152
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,584
I want you to know a few things.

153
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,712
First, please remember
to feed Mr. Darcy.

154
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,422
- The cat.

155
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,715
Got it. What else?

156
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,258
- I want to be cremated.

157
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,510
Spread my ashes in
the Grand Canyon

158
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,429
and play Tom Jones
at my funeral.

159
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,430
- Max...

160
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,807
- And if I'm going,

161
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,309
just let me go.

162
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,769
I do not want to lie around

163
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,355
like a turnip for
the rest of my days.

164
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,484
No shocking with paddles,
no tube down my throat.

165
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,652
I want to be remembered
as a vibrant 81.

166
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,154
- Max, you're not dying.

167
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,656
You're being moved from
the ICU to a regular room.

168
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,826
- But we understand your wishes,

169
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,828
and we'll get you the paperwork.

170
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,121
- You'll be able to go
home in a day or two.

171
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,416
- Oh, that's great news,
not that I mind it here.

172
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,293
The food's edible,

173
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,712
the orderlies are
quite good-looking,

174
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,340
and with Jules
sleeping down the hall,

175
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,342
it almost feels like home.

176
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,052
- I've had a couple
of late nights.

177
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,346
That's what the on-call
room is for, right?

178
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:33,184
- Okay, Mrs. Anderson,
Dr. Millin will transport you,

179
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,020
and I will see you
in your new room.

180
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,567
- Max.
- Oh, I forgot.

181
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,320
- Either of you ever seen an
abdominal aortic aneurysm?

182
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,571
- Only in textbooks.

183
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,948
- I read that triple
As are super rare,

184
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,574
Basically unheard of
in patients under 60.

185
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,159
- That's right.
Keep up, please.

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,369
- Well, our guy's only 29,

187
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,620
and he's a
non-smoking vegetarian

188
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,996
with no predisposing
genetic history

189
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,456
of cardiac disease.

190
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,291
- What are the triple As
most serious complications?

191
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,918
- Dissection, a tear
in the aortic lining

192
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,461
requires stenting or surgery.

193
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,879
- Rupture, if the
aneurysm bursts,

194
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,506
we gotta take him
straight to the OR.

195
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,841
- Good.
- Is that why we're rushing?

196
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,884
- Not exactly.

197
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,637
No, no, no, no, no,
not again. Ray, listen.

198
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,430
- Look, I'm sorry,
Dr. Altman, okay?

199
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,642
I can't do this today.
- Ray.

200
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,602
- Sorry, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.

201
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,062
- Uh, what are we
supposed to do now?

202
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,230
- We run after him.

203
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,498
- Hey, I just saw the
funniest thing at day care.

204
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,251
Scout was annoyed that
Luna had this hedgehog toy,

205
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,502
and he made this face.

206
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,129
It looked exactly like you look

207
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,422
when you're annoyed with me.

208
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,258
- Excuse me. Sam
Sutton asked for you.

209
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,801
He said it wasn't
urgent, though.

210
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,595
- Yeah, I just saw him.

211
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,638
- No, he's asking
for Dr. Wilson.

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,099
- Oh.

213
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,517
- Mm.

214
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,728
- That's it. That's the face.

215
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,147
Wait, why... Why are
you annoyed with me?

216
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,817
Don't you think it's
a little inappropriate

217
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,736
to tell a patient
that you're single?

218
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,155
- He asked, and he
thought he was gonna die.

219
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,782
- He said you have
Disney princess eyes.

220
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,202
- You think I don't?

221
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,287
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

222
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,497
I appreciate the
misplaced chivalry,

223
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,749
but do you remember
how many times

224
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,000
I would get hit on at
Jimmy's Crab Shack?

225
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,877
I think I can handle myself.

226
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,921
- Dr. Angle to the Psych Unit.

227
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,298
Dr Lea Engle to the Psych Unit.

228
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,175
- Ray, can we just stop
and talk about this?

229
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,969
- Look, you said I didn't
need the surgery right now.

230
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,096
- Right now and never are
two very different things,

231
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,224
plus that was two months
and three failed attempts

232
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,308
at surgery ago.

233
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,768
- Okay, well, I'm still alive,

234
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,438
so I'm good, great,
fantastic, really.

235
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,066
- You have a weakened
aorta, which supplies blood

236
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,151
to all of your major
organs. If it bursts...

237
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,569
- I know, okay? You told me.

238
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,820
But those consent forms,

239
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,822
they say I could
have renal failure

240
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,200
or heart problems or
bleed out during surgery.

241
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,451
No, thanks.

242
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,119
- There is a less than 5% chance

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,330
of renal failure, bleeding
out, or heart problems,

244
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,332
but there is a 10% chance

245
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,626
that your aneurysm will
rupture at any moment,

246
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,878
and if that happens,
your chances of survival

247
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,464
are worse than all of
these numbers combined.

248
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,217
- Okay, just stop. Just stop.

249
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,594
I don't know about
all the statistics,

250
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,222
but what I do know is
that those consent forms

251
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,391
say I could die a
dozen different ways

252
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,059
if I do the surgery.

253
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,394
I'm an illustrator.

254
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,187
I sit at a desk all day.

255
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,273
It doesn't require
much exertion.

256
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,025
- At this point, it
might not take much.

257
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,278
- I'll take my chances.

258
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,822
- Those chances would be so
much better with surgery.

259
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,032
- You can't force me to do this.

260
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,036
- Ray.
- So we just let him go?

261
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,123
- He's a ticking time bomb.
- Informed consent.

262
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,584
We can't force a patient
to get a procedure.

263
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,043
His mom will work on him,

264
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,461
and hopefully he will come back.

265
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,922
All right, you two,
go to the skills lab,

266
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,257
and I will page you
if something comes up.

267
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,594
- Mm. Coming?

268
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,013
- Yeah, go ahead.
I'll catch up.

269
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,604
- Hey, you were looking for me.
- I was.

270
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,984
I have a question about
the... The, uh, the plate

271
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,863
that you put in my arm, and...

272
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,032
Okay, yeah, obviously, I
don't really have a question.

273
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,576
I just wanted to see you
so I could thank you.

274
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,995
- For what?
- Saving my life.

275
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,414
- Okay, I know that
post-op can be boring...

276
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,416
- It is. It is so boring.

277
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,627
I thought I could flirt with you

278
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,794
while we play a game of cards.

279
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,380
You'd be holding all
the cards for real.

280
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,884
- Well, my day is
anything but boring, so...

281
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,594
- Okay, okay, go
cut people open.

282
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,763
I'll be here all
week. We have time.

283
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,640
- Actually, I'm
delivering twins.

284
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,267
I am both an OB-GYN
and a general surgeon.

285
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,353
- You're pretty
and multitalented.

286
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,189
We are a rare breed.

287
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,485
- Uh, so what do you do now
that you're no longer military?

288
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,820
- Oh, I'm still a pilot,
just not military.

289
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,656
- So flying hundreds of
people through the air

290
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,115
wasn't terrifying enough.

291
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,575
You had to put on a
shiny sleeping bag

292
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,202
and jump out of a plane.

293
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,746
- I'm actually a
pretty simple guy.

294
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,457
- Yeah, because
simple guys are always

295
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,252
jumping off of pyramids and
rainforest cliffs, or...

296
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,130
- You stalked my social media.

297
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,510
- I wanted to know
what wingsuiting was.

298
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,514
- Um, I have to get back to OB.

299
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,349
Is there anything
else that you need?

300
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,517
- Not at the moment,

301
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,894
but I will keep
your offer in mind.

302
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,483
- You realize that
she meant medically?

303
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,530
No, she didn't.

304
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,911
- Ray, hi.

305
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,163
Uh, can I have a minute.
- Oh, my God.

306
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,249
Stop with the consent forms.

307
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,875
What, do you get a commission
on the surgery or something?

308
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,753
- Uh, no, no, no
commission. Just my notes.

309
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,672
I just want to talk.
- Yeah.

310
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,257
You mean talk me
into the surgery.

311
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,093
- No, no, no, talk
about the surgery.

312
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,012
Okay, it's your
decision. I just...

313
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,264
I won't be able to sleep

314
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,015
knowing I didn't do
everything I could

315
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,185
to make sure you were informed.
Let's just take a walk, okay?

316
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,565
You're leaving anyway, right?
I could use some fresh air.

317
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,944
- Are you coming?

318
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,446
- Dr. Brooks to Oncology.

319
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,573
Dr. Brooks to Oncology.

320
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,536
- We got you one with a window.
- Oh, how nice.

321
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,415
Surprise!

322
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,792
- Norma, Lois!

323
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,795
- Welcome to your new room.
- Did we scare you?

324
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,173
I didn't want to yell,
but Norma made me.

325
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,508
- I'm fine. I loved it!

326
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,218
Come here, you two.

327
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,513
Mwah!

328
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,432
- I told them they could
only stay for an hour.

329
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,517
You need to get your rest.
- Oh, don't listen to Jules.

330
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,144
She's in doctor mode.

331
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,190
- Speaking of Jules, we
brought your crochet bag.

332
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,234
- You know, my treble stitch
is getting much better.

333
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,654
- Wow, nice, but
that's a half double.

334
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,240
I can show you the treble
this afternoon again.

335
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,950
- Oh, you see how
she talks to me?

336
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,495
- She's an angel, if a
doctor can be an angel,

337
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,913
like in that movie.

338
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,665
- Oh, we put your
toiletries in the bathroom.

339
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,919
- Oh, thank heavens. My
hair needs a good brushing.

340
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,797
- "Angel Doctor."
- That's not a movie.

341
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,799
- Uh, "Doctor Angel."
- That's not a movie either.

342
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,383
- Max.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

343
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
- Okay, okay.
- Thanks.

344
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,262
- Oh, Doc.

345
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,598
- Her color's good.
- How's her appetite?

346
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,849
- Uh, it's back.
Her appetite...

347
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,684
Ow!

348
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,353
Max.

349
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,396
- Oh, Max, are you okay?

350
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,361
I... I... I don't know. Am I?

351
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,322
- Okay, all right.

352
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,741
Okay, just take deep breaths.

353
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,167
- Winston.
- Hey.

354
00:13:55,168 --> 00:14:00,214
- Will it be awkward for
you seeing Maggie so soon?

355
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,342
- It'll definitely
be awkward, yeah.

356
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,553
- But, uh, you're coming anyway.

357
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,764
- Very few Black men have been
nominated for this award...

358
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,683
So I'll be there.

359
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,977
- I'm proud of you, son.

360
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,312
I'm proud of me too.

361
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,940
Excuse me, a consult.
- Okay.

362
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,780
The Catherine Fox
Award means something

363
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,824
to people around here.

364
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:31,078
You know, if Winston can
rise and face Maggie,

365
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,290
I think you'll be able to
handle seeing Meredith.

366
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,125
- Dr. Webber, I don't believe

367
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,085
in ranking medical
contributions.

368
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,670
I just don't.

369
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,921
I also don't feel the need
to go all the way to Boston

370
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,548
for some rubber chicken dinner.

371
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,133
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's
a little presumptuous...

372
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,719
- Your absence would be an
insult to this hospital,

373
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,554
your fellow
nominees, and my wife

374
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,723
for who the award is
named, so I suggest

375
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,725
you get off your
moral high ground,

376
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,560
set aside your
feelings about Boston,

377
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,063
do your job, and join us.

378
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,940
- Dr. Olivares to
Labor and Delivery.

379
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,301
Dr. Olivares to
Labor and Delivery.

380
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,446
- Floor wasn't even slippery.

381
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,114
There weren't any obstacles.

382
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,534
I was just walking to the sink.

383
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,119
Ow.
- What do you see, Millin?

384
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,704
- Uh, she has a fractured rib,

385
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,748
which explains her pain when
she moves her upper body.

386
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,999
- What's the treatment for that?

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,542
- Rest. It should
heal on its own.

388
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,793
- What about her head?

389
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,545
- The cut doesn't
appear serious,

390
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,755
but I'd like to get a scan.

391
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,383
So let's get her up
to CT and page Neuro.

392
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,137
- Maxine...
- I'm not up to visitors today.

393
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,973
I think you two better go.

394
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,767
- I'll be here, and I will
call with any updates.

395
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,018
I promise.

396
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,571
- Left open comminuted
humeral fracture,

397
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,031
right open femoral fracture...

398
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,532
- Do you always narrate
your data input?

399
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,451
- Helps keep me accurate.
What are you working on?

400
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,952
- I'm watching an
old triple A surgery

401
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,079
while double checking
the wedding spreadsheet

402
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,205
for the RSVPs.

403
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,206
- Oh, you know
I'm coming, right?

404
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,499
- Never sent in a card.

405
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,876
- I live with you.
It was assumed.

406
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,252
- Adams isn't coming.

407
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,838
- That is different,
and you know it.

408
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,924
You bringing a plus one?

409
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,467
- Did you even read
the invitation?

410
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,552
- I was working two jobs.

411
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,805
It's this weekend,
right, isn't it?

412
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,683
Why'd you move it up again?
- Grandma's getting worse.

413
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,309
She's got maybe a good 90
minutes in the morning,

414
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,436
and that time is shrinking.
- That's rough.

415
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,397
- You know what she
remembers though?

416
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,147
Weddings, she loves them,

417
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,692
the colors, the
flowers, the favors.

418
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,110
We actually have conversations
about the wedding

419
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,320
that feel completely real.

420
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,948
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,867
- I'm just gonna
take a look around.

422
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,496
How's the new space?
- Can't complain.

423
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,626
- Is everything okay?
- I don't know, let me think.

424
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,253
You complained to
Altman about a job

425
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,713
you haven't worked
at for months.

426
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,298
You projected your own
trauma onto my situation

427
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,675
resulting in half of
the surgical chiefs

428
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,677
meeting about me.
- I'm sorry.

429
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,557
I... how can I make it up to you?
- I'll get over it.

430
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,518
I just need to be mad
at you for a minute.

431
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,396
- Is that a literal minute or...
- Figurative.

432
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,398
Right.

433
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,025
I'm just gonna...

434
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,699
- I always thought
you two had chemistry.

435
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,492
- What, me and Helm? Why?

436
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,244
She hasn't made a move.
- You could.

437
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,996
- I don't like rejection.

438
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,165
I once had very embarrassing,
somewhat traumatic rejection

439
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,501
during a prom-posal go
viral at my high school.

440
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,711
I don't make the
first move anymore,

441
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,962
and it's worked out fine for me.

442
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,715
- Okay.

443
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,550
Who's your plus one again?

444
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,559
- So you're an illustrator, huh?

445
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,021
- Yeah, yeah, graphic novels.

446
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,775
I draw, and my friend
Sunita writes the stories.

447
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,610
We're working on one
right now about a kid

448
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,572
whose big brother is afraid
to die before he turns 30,

449
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,241
so they're building a portal
to a parallel universe

450
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,078
so that they could time jump
and that he could turn 31

451
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,705
and then reenter the real world.

452
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,582
- Cool.

453
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,251
Also very specific.

454
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,088
I had a really vivid
dream when I was a kid.

455
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:13,217
Um, my grandpa who
died before I was born

456
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,677
sat at the edge of
my bed and told me

457
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,721
we'd be together for
my 30th birthday.

458
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,433
It scared the crap out of me,

459
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,103
so I've never smoked.
I don't drink.

460
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,313
I stopped eating meat.
Hell, I don't even drive.

461
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,981
I take public transit.

462
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,942
And maybe it's
completely irrational,

463
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,653
but I always thought,
if I could just make it

464
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:36,073
past 30 I'll be okay.

465
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:41,120
I need to stay alive for my mom,

466
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,288
and I'm helping with my
sister's college tuition,

467
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,833
so I can't die.

468
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,045
I don't wanna die.

469
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,134
- I don't want that either.

470
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,846
Look, I'm not a
professional like you,

471
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,889
but here is your aorta.

472
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,642
- Dr. Adams, look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

473
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,810
- Look, the statistics
freak you out,

474
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,937
so let's draw it.

475
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,691
Okay, so we'll access your
aorta through your groin,

476
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,818
and then we'll
thread a small wire

477
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,570
up through the
abdominal aneurysm,

478
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,238
and then we'll deploy a graft,

479
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,866
which will expand to
reinforce the weak area

480
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,994
and simulate an artery,
which will allow blood

481
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,454
to flow through safely.
- Is that a potato?

482
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,874
- That's a kidney.
- With a Slinky?

483
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,459
That's the graft.

484
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,753
Bruh, you suck at drawing.

485
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,089
Fair.

486
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,176
But I promise

487
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,179
this procedure has been
tested over and over,

488
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,556
and if a problem comes
up like you mentioned,

489
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,558
we have ways to address it.

490
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,978
What we can't do is be with
you if the aneurysm ruptures

491
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:48,979
while you're at home.

492
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,693
- Did you feel dizzy before
you fell, Mrs. Anderson?

493
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,612
- I don't think so.

494
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,323
I just remember
losing my balance

495
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,367
and stupidly hitting
my head on the sink.

496
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,702
Maybe it's a sign.

497
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,245
- Loss of balance
can be a symptom

498
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,747
of a variety of conditions.

499
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,832
- Or a sign that my time is up.

500
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,376
When the racehorse
breaks its leg,

501
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,753
they usually put it down.

502
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,379
- Max, you're not a racehorse.

503
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,340
- No, not anymore.

504
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,093
- Oh, an active brain bleed
in the subdural space.

505
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,511
We should prep for
a decompression.

506
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,138
Kwan, book an OR.
- On it.

507
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,265
- Uh, Dr. Shepherd, could
I scrub in if that's okay?

508
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,226
- Uh, no, it's not.

509
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,770
You were on neuro this morning,
and you traded with Kwan.

510
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,481
- I could trade back.
- You will do no such thing.

511
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,732
- What is happening here?

512
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,734
- Ah, Millin just
confirmed my suspicion

513
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,110
that she's too
close to the patient

514
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,904
to be her doctor.
- What? No, no.

515
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,322
I just... she's talking
about being euthanized

516
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,740
like an animal.

517
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,367
- Look me in the eye and tell me

518
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,536
that you do not consider
that woman family.

519
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,374
Mm-hmm, you're off
the case for good.

520
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,054
- Dr. Altman.
- Yes, yes.

521
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,265
We're all very excited.
Thanks, Catherine.

522
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,267
You know, technically,
Grey Sloan can claim

523
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,060
three Catherine
Fox Award nominees

524
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,603
since Pierce performed
her transplant here.

525
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,021
- That's great. About Ray...

526
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,440
- Yeah, I know it
can be disappointing.

527
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,234
Sometimes patients
just don't understand,

528
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,903
but there will be other
triple As to repair.

529
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,697
- Yeah, but I still
think we should do Ray's.

530
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,490
He signed the consent forms.

531
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,372
- Page Griffith, and
let's get him to radiology

532
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,833
before he bolts
again. Well done.

533
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:43,468
- Oh.
- Seriously?

534
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,595
You're lucky the twins'
mom is still dilating.

535
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,139
What is it?
- I have an itch to scratch.

536
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,558
No, literally, it's... help.

537
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,226
- This is what
orderlies are for.

538
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,477
- I know.

539
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,854
I could've called somebody else,

540
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,315
but then you wouldn't be here.

541
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,191
- Don't move.

542
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,901
Okay. That?

543
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,321
- Oh, you are the best doctor
I've ever had in my life.

544
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,741
- If you ask for a
sponge bath, I'm leaving.

545
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,285
- You know, last
time I had a cast,

546
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,995
they let me pick the colors.

547
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,747
How old were you?

548
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,749
- Seven. Fell off
the monkey bars.

549
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,042
- You had a death
wish even then, huh?

550
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,752
- I was so bummed.

551
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,130
My dad was taking me to
my first pro ball game.

552
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,716
I had been practicing catching
fly balls for three months.

553
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,259
Glove doesn't fit over the cast.

554
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,927
Can't catch anything.

555
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,429
But the first baseman
saw me in the stands,

556
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,057
ran over, signed my cast.

557
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,142
I cried when they cut it off.

558
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,730
- Well, you're, uh, lucky
with all the dumb stuff you do

559
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,940
that you haven't
had a cast since.

560
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,861
- Yeah, I have had
half a dozen surgeries

561
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,447
and one metal plate,
but yeah, no casts.

562
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,410
The twins.
- Oh.

563
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,079
Gotta go.
- Lucky bastards.

564
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,544
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

565
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,713
I'm... hey, I'm glad
to be nominated.

566
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,841
- Do you know how
many codes I ran

567
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,259
to save lives in
the ER last year?

568
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,178
Where's my award for that?
- For doing your job?

569
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,429
- He was doing his.

570
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,014
- My research is helping
to cure Parkinson's.

571
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,641
You don't see me
nominated for anything.

572
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:17,229
- Listen to you two complaining
about your lack of recognition.

573
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,647
- You're right.

574
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,732
- We're happy for him and Marsh.

575
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,567
- I mean, I oversaw

576
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:26,029
a simultaneous
12-person domino surgery

577
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,616
wherein six people
got new kidneys.

578
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:33,245
You know, I used deactivated HIV

579
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,206
to save a boy with SCID.

580
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,168
I mean, I spearheaded
changes in post-op protocols

581
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,840
to reduce post-op fistulas,
basically curing the problem.

582
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,550
If anyone should ask,
"Where's my award?"

583
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,135
it's me.

584
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,765
- I was almost out of here.
- You will be soon.

585
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,226
Dr. Shepherd has
done a lot of these.

586
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,646
- You're drilling into my
81-year-old skull, right?

587
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,731
If it were only me,
I'd tell you to put me

588
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,192
out of my misery and
send me to the farm.

589
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,487
I talked to Norma about Jules.

590
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,990
I said she was an
excellent roommate.

591
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,867
Not sure I can say
the same about Norma.

592
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,286
That woman snores
like a freight train.

593
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,497
Let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

594
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,250
I know that Jules
loves living with you.

595
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,793
- Mm.

596
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:26,256
Pete, my son, he went to college

597
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,551
right after my husband
and I divorced.

598
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,053
I brought him up
to be independent,

599
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,766
which was maybe my excuse
for not being more involved.

600
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,602
By the way, it worked.

601
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,438
He graduated and
moved to London.

602
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,064
I hardly ever see him anymore.

603
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,860
He doesn't need my
homemade split pea soup

604
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:51,031
or my special herbal
teas to ward off colds

605
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:55,619
or my hugs after a long day...

606
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,956
but Jules, she needs
all of those things.

607
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,877
It seems she didn't have
them when she was a child,

608
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,963
and now I get to
give them to her.

609
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:11,134
She's lucky to have you.

610
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,385
I'm the lucky one.

611
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,942
- What did you do
to convince him?

612
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,944
- I drew a bad picture.

613
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:31,447
I thought he'd respond
to a different approach.

614
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,866
- Chief, I just
wanted to say thanks

615
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,618
for funding the intern
skills practicum.

616
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,911
I appreciate it.
- Of course.

617
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,746
And congrats, again,
on the nomination.

618
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,373
- Sure, yeah.

619
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,999
- Oh, uh, Richard wanted me
to ask you about the dinner...

620
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,209
- No, count me out on that.

621
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,672
- Ray, what's wrong?

622
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,215
- My back, it really hurts.

623
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,842
Something's wrong.

624
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,095
- Damn it.

625
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,347
- Oh, my God, is that a...
- It's a rupture. Come on.

626

Code blue!

627
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,393

Radiology. Third floor.

628
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,936

news this morning.

- Well, I wish everyone
shared your enthusiasm.

682

loves awards? Helm.

- Oh, she does, huh?
- I don't know.

684
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,196
I'm just looking
for a good segue.

685
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,198
- Ah.
- How did things go with her?

686
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,616
- She said she'd think about it.

687
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,243
- Did she seem upbeat?

688
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,036
- Well, honestly, she
was asking for things

689
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,747
we hadn't done before.
- Were they unreasonable?

690
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,417
- Well, not terribly,
I suppose, but...

691
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,751
- With all due respect, sir,

692
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,795
I don't see why
this is a question.

693
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,047
This hospital is bursting
at the seams with patients

694
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,009
and not enough doctors.
Helm is a proven asset.

695
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,719
You know exactly what
you're getting with her,

696
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,137
because you trained her.

697
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,763
You've worked with her
long enough to know

698
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,850
her talent and her
dedication, and frankly, sir,

699
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,353
we need more senior
residents, so please, please,

700
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,105
just give her what she wants.

701
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,440
- Nurse Kingsbury to Five West

702
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,317
Nurse Kingsbury to Five West.

703
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:41,112
- Again, it ruptured, and we
couldn't control the bleeding.

704
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,909
- I am very sorry,
Mrs. Sanchez.

705
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,288
I...

706
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,539
the hospital will mail

707
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,459
your son's belongings
to you in Tempe.

708
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
- Thank you, Doctor.

709
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,008
- Yeah, those calls
are never easy.

710
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,597
Hey, you got him
back to the hospital.

711
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,018
Adams, there's...
There's a thing with ADHD

712
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,562
where we feel the
losses really deeply,

713
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,482
so you have to take equal time

714
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,650
to give yourself
credit when you win.

715
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,487
You fought for him. Hey, hey.

716
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:27,742
You fought for
him. That matters.

717
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,246
- He knew in his
gut he was dying.

718
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,748
He knew he wasn't gonna see 30.

719
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:39,128
I knew in my gut
that I was different.

720
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,214
There was something different
about me my whole life.

721
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,968
I knew I wasn't just lazy,
which is what they called me.

722
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,636
You know, I went down
a rabbit hole online,

723
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,348
and I have pretty much
every single symptom.

724
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,767
I mean, difficulty focusing,

725
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,520
time blindness,
short attention span,

726
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,438
and my family is
full of doctors.

727
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,857
It's not like ADHD
is rare. You saw it.

728
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,859
Why didn't they?

729
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,826
I... I think parents,
sometimes they see their kids

730
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,202
through the lens of
their own experience.

731
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,745
Your parents were overachievers,

732
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,497
so they expected you to
be, and when you weren't,

733
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,499
they were so busy pushing
and pushing you to live up

734
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,876
to your potential, they
didn't think to look

735
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,588
for why you weren't

736
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,464
- Yeah, or maybe they
were just too busy

737
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,591
being disappointed in me,

738
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,176
they didn't bother.

739
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:38,397
You know, I hope you win
the Catherine Fox Award.

740
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,066
- Why?

741
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:46,654
- I don't know, because
I feel like a failure,

742
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,364
and I feel like I
caught this too late,

743
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,991
and if you win, then...

744
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,493
- If I win, we
aren't just losers?

745
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,995
Is that it?

746
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,165
Yeah, something like that.

747
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,337
- You know, Adams, this award,
it doesn't mean anything.

748
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,423
- If that's your
acceptance speech,

749
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,218
it's gonna need work.

750
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,431
- How long does a
delivery usually take?

751
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,975
A couple hours?
- Like, from Postmates?

752
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,811
- Never mind.
- Dude, you gotta take it easy.

753
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,980
Women don't love
aggressive flirting,

754
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,440
at least not from men.

755
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,025
- You don't get anywhere
if you don't ask.

756
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,069
You gotta at least ask.
- False alarm.

757
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,446
- You paged her again?
- Wasn't me.

758
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,822
- The twins do not
want to come out.

759
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,282
- So you came back
to get cheered up

760
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,284
by your favorite patient.
- No.

761
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,871
I was making sure that
Yasuda is checking...

762
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,373
- I am.
- On... okay.

763
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,416
Here.

764
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,671
That sounds...
- Weak.

765
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,422
- It does sound weak. Here.

766
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,551
Take this. Ready?

767
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,014
The flap's congested.
- What does that mean?

768
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,642
- We moved muscle from
the back of your leg

769
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,186
to the front to cover the bone.
- The flap.

770
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,979
- Yes. Yasuda,
what's happening?

771
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,356
- A hematoma, it's
putting pressure

772
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,066
on the flap and cutting
off the blood supply.

773
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,651
- Why do I feel
like this is bad?

774
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,695
- It is bad, if the flap dies.
- Is that gonna happen?

775
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,947
- Not if I decompress it.
- Another surgery?

776
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,156
- We can do it right
here if you consent.

777
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,491
- Do it. DO it.

778
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,660
- Yasuda, push
additional morphine.

779
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,496
- I'm good. I have a
high pain threshold.

780
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,456
Plus I kind of want to see this.

781
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,292
- Okay. Ready?

782
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,590
- Okay, more gauze.
- Yeah.

783
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,176
- Thank you.
- Okay.

784
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,137
Just breathe.

785
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,528
- The decompression went well.

786
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,115
- I know those are a regift.
I'm the one who brought them.

787
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,700
- I thought you'd want
to keep these for Maxine

788
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,910
while she's in the ICU.

789
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,330
Or I could keep them
by the nurses' station.

790
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,331
- No, leave 'em there.

791
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,710
- Well, hopefully, it
won't be that long,

792
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,337
and you can both
get out of here.

793
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,549
I know what it feels like

794
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,718
to sit by the side
of someone you love

795
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,721
and worry they're
not gonna make it.

796
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,600
I know that fear
and anger and grief.

797
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,645
- It's okay. Professional
distance and all.

798
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,608
- I'm just saying it's okay
to have those feelings.

799
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,235
I'm here for you.

800
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,488
- I'm fine, Kwan.

801
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,493
I need to call Norma and Lois.

802
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,190
- I've done a lot
of cool things,

803
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,944
but you just sliced into
my leg like it was nothing.

804
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,863
- It's no swimming with sharks.
- Oh, you went deep.

805
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,032
That post was from at
least three years ago.

806
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,493
- Wow, I never thought
I could be a third wheel

807
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,453
in a patient room.
- What was that, Yasuda?

808
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,413
- Nothing.

809
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,791
- Dr. Wilson, OB
called for you.

810
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,293
Cathy Han is headed into L&D.

811
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,711
- For real this time?
- I don't know.

812
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,673
I don't work up there.
- Okay.

813
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,007
- You just cut my leg open,

814
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,509
and now you're about
to deliver twins?

815
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,887
You are my hero. Sign my cast.

816
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,311
No tears when they remove it.
- No promises.

817
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,653
- See? You gotta at least ask.

818
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,323
- Richard.
- Here you go.

819
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,867
- Marsh.
- Yeah.

820
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,702
- I care about this program.
- I do too.

821
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,328
- Not like I do.

822
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,581
It's my legacy, and I need to
get it back to where it was,

823
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,249
and a nomination for
our residency director

824
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,168
is a big deal.

825
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,545
- I was about to ask
about a seat on the plane.

826
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,922
The residents, they need
me to get over myself,

827
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,718
and apparently so
do you, so yes,

828
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,929
I can put aside my
feelings about...

829
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,099
Boston if there's still
room on that plane.

830
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,562
- I think that can be arranged.

831
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,189
Good night.
- Good night.

832
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,940
When a patient codes
or loses their airway,

833
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,401
a doctor's first priority
is to get oxygen flowing.

834
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,990
We have a limited time
before damage sets in,

835
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,783
so we spring into action...

836
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,577
- Cheeseburger, no
mayo, extra pickles,

837
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,370
and a side of fries.
- I didn't order.

838
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,747
- Did you want something else?
- No.

839
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,124
I've just never been a
regular anywhere before.

840
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,542
- Yeah, well, don't
get used to it,

841
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,421
because I just gave notice.

842
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,298
- You're coming back
to the hospital?

843
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,217
- Yep.
- Ah.

844
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,593
- And there's something
I should tell you.

845
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,261
- Okay.

846
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,681
- Uh, as you know,
resident wellness

847
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,226
is important to me.
- Same.

848
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:11,687
- Uh, and I told Webber
that if I came back

849
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,690
I wanted to be in a
position to help with that,

850
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,567
you know, make sure
people don't burn out,

851
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,905
that they have mentors,
and so Webber agreed

852
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,157
to make me co-chief
resident with you.

853
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,874
That's the best news ever.

854
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,751
- Okay.

855
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm so glad you think that.
- Are you kidding?

856
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,589
It's way too much work
for any one human to do,

857
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,967
plus it's you and me.
- I know.

858
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,760
- Were you surprised
when Webber agreed to it?

859
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,470
- Not nearly as much
as when he agreed

860
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,097
to give me eight
weeks' vacation.

861
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,432
- Eight weeks?
- Yeah.

862
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,892
But don't worry, though.

863
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,561
I'll give you plenty of
notice before I take it.

864
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,147
- Eight weeks.

865
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,276
But in life, time
limits aren't as clear.

866
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,069
- Do you want to
go to a wedding?

867
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,988
- Do they need a bartender?

868
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,949
- Okay, I have to
say something to you

869
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,911
that is not very
comfortable for me to say...

870
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,913
which is that I like you,
and I don't mean that

871
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,373
as a boss or a friend.

872
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:15,042
I like you like you, and
if you're not interested,

873
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,210
that's okay.

874
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,712
I will simply walk
away and possibly

875
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,046
never step foot
in this bar again

876
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,673
due to my previously
mentioned discomfort,

877
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:24,218
but at least I asked...

878
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,554
and if you are interested,

879
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,222
my roommate Simone
is getting married,

880
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,640
and I know it's
very last minute,

881
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,725
but there will be
food and drinks,

882
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,101
and I think dancing.

883
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,477
I still haven't fully
read the invitation,

884
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,770
but I...
- Uh, Yasuda...

885
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,647
- I thought we could go together

886
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,567
on a date in case
that wasn't clear.

887
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:40,901
It can be hard to gauge

888
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,278
whether it's better to hurry up

889
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,529
or take things slow.

890
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:48,576
- Uh, Yasuda, I'm
about to be your boss.

891
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,579
Co-chief resident with Schmitt.

892
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,332
- Oh. It's inappropriate.

893
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,376
- But...

894
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,086
if the wedding is
this weekend...

895
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,713
- It is.

896
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,966
- Then our date would
predate my employment.

897
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,468
- It would.

898
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,763
- Okay.
- Okay.

899
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,806
- Do you want a drink?

900
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,516
- Yep.

901
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,643
We don't always know
how much time we have

902
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,812
before the clock runs
out on opportunity.

- Yay. Fist bump.

907
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,536
No.

908
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,872
- Okay, well, your
signal sounds good.

909
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,582
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

910
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,378
- Another itch
scratched, please.

911
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,423
- Where?
- Back of my neck, right side.

912
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,050
Okay.

913
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,513
Okay.

914
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,973
- Mm-hmm.
- There?

915
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,351
You know, if being an OB and
a surgeon doesn't pan out,

916
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:58,854
you could switch to this.

917
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,023
- Oh, I was just
coming to check on you,

918
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,192
but I guess you're covered.
- This woman is my hero.

919
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,152
She cut my leg open like
it was a piece of steak.

920
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,529
- I heard.

921
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,241
Okay, I guess I'm
gonna head out.

922
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,326
I'm gonna grab some
food on the way home.

923
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,245
You want anything?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

924
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,038
- Wait, you two live together?

925
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,499
- We do.
- We're roommates.

926
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,419
Okay, I'll see you later.

ivory towers ♪

00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:27,216

929
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,968
- Mm-hmm.
- Identical?

930
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,177
- Identical.
- Oh.

00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,054

To eat, not work.
- Huh.

939
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,118
- I'm so sorry about Ray.
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

which I'm figuring
out I probably have,

946
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,887
but there's this
thing, this symptom

947
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:16,807
where you get stuck in
your head, you overthink,

948
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,643
you have a hard time
saying what you mean,

949
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,228
because you can't
help but think about

950
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:26,192
all the possible
ramifications, and so...

951
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,114
Don't get married.
- Lucas.

952
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:37,077
- Maybe... maybe I'm too late,
or maybe I lost my chance.

953
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,330
But I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

954
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:42,666

while you still had time

00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,721
