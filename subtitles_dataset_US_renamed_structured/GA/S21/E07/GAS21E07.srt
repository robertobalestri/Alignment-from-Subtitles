1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,065
<i>In 1986, Congress passed</i>

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,469
<i>the Emergency Medical Treatment</i>
<i>and Labor Act,</i>

3
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:13,071
<i>which prohibits emergency rooms</i>
<i>from denying patients care.</i>

4
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:16,242
<i>If you don't have a dollar to</i>
<i>your name, it doesn't matter.</i>

5
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:19,278
<i>You can go to any</i>
<i>emergency room at any time</i>

6
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:21,079
<i>and they have to treat you.</i>
Uh, is your hand broken?

7
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:22,582
Door was open.

8
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:24,383
That's not an excuse.
What are you doing?

9
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,085
Socks got mixed up again.
Where are your...clothes?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,222
I stopped putting them away.
Saves time.

11
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,625
Yasuda!
Try knocking.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,562
<i>Some people think this law</i>
<i>has contributed to overcrowding</i>

13
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,863
<i>and hospital closures.</i>

14
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:40,031
Yasuda, open up.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,907
<i>But I don't know</i>
<i>a single E.R. doctor</i>

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,478
<i>who would turn a patient away</i>
<i>even if they could.</i>

17
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,481
<i>Sometimes all that means</i>
<i>is treating an ear infection.</i>

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,155
<i>Other times you see a patient</i>
<i>on the table</i>

19
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,624
<i>- and your heart stops.</i>
- Fire's knocked down.

20
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:11,230
<i>The rarest of diseases.</i>
<i>Hopeless co-morbidities.</i>

21
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:19,305
<i>Cases you've never seen that</i>
<i>you're not trained to handle.</i>

22
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:22,141
Two victims, unconscious.
Get a couple gurneys.

23
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,144
<i>All you can do is close</i>
<i>your eyes and say a prayer.</i>

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,850
<i>Because once a patient enters</i>
<i>the emergency room,</i>

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,555
<i>they're yours.</i>

26
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:42,161
So, should we go out
for breakfast for your last day?

27
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,796
And miss my last chance
at burnt coffee

28
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,933
and watery oatmeal
from the cafeteria?

29
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:54,674
I'm gonna miss this.

30
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,375
Mm.

31
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,076
I'll be back
before you know it.

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,047
Yeah, but six weeks
feels like forever.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,584
Maybe I can --
I can take a sick day

34
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:07,052
and come visit you
for a long weekend.

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,554
Yeah.

36
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,989
And you'll be back
for your mom's birthday.

37
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:12,991
Actually, my mom
is thinking about

38
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,993
coming down
to San Antonio.

39
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,995
She wants to see
where I'm living.

40
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:20,031
Well, there's, uh,
Fourth of July.

41
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:23,169
But tickets are probably
through the roof.

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,708
Texas is feeling
really far away right now.

43
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:36,047
"For the Lord has not given us
a spirit of fear,

44
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:40,419
but of power and love
and of a sound mind."

45
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,388
2 Timothy, 1:7.

46
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:45,957
Is it wrong
that I think it's hot

47
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,526
when you quote
Bible verses?

48
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:52,063
"For there is no fear
in love,

49
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,434
for perfect love casteth out
fear."

50
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,012
Can we talk?

51
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:10,249
I don't want you
to be upset about this.

52
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,218
If I could just talk you through
what happened.

53
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,985
You let someone kiss you

54
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,755
when we were supposed to be
working on our marriage.

55
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,124
I think I know enough.

56
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,891
Hey, can you play baseball?

57
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:23,195
Uh, pitched 85 miles per hour
in college.

58
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,165
Thank God.
Are you free Saturday?

59
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:28,434
You resurrecting
the hospital softball team?

60
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,102
Yeah.

61
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,604
I mean, I wanted to do
something fun

62
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,306
with everybody
outside the hospital,

63
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,274
but, uh, Griffith asked
if she could use a tee,

64
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,908
and Millin said she'll hit
but she won't run.

65
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,144
Yeah, I would love to,
but, uh,

66
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,045
I have to take my kid
to a birthday party.

67
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:41,447
Well, can't Dr. Bailey
do that?

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,316
You want to ask her?

69
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,184
Two incoming traumas.
I'll meet you outside.

70
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,219
Chaplain to patient services.

71
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,987
Chaplain to patient services.

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,890
Oh, there you are.
How'd it go last night?

73
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,293
Oh. Uh, yeah.
Tuck's team won by two.

74
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,796
Uh, Pru, uh, got a visit
from the Tooth Fairy, and, uh...

75
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,464
Oh!
Yeah.

76
00:03:58,497 --> 00:03:59,799
Uh, you?

77
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,900
Saved a patient.
Lost a resident.

78
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,636
Oh, yeah.
I heard about Schmitt.

79
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,471
Yeah.
You okay?

80
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,938
He's happy.
I'm happy.

81
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,507
Oh, boy. Okay.
I'll see you at home.

82
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,309
All right.

83
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:13,379
22-year-old female,
two-car collision, GCS 14.

84
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,182
Bilateral crush injuries
to both lower extremities.

85
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,517
Given morphine for pain
en route.

86
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,186
Chloe?
This is Dr. Webber.

87
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,887
My legs. They hurt so much.

88
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,491
Okay. We'll take a look.
We got you.

89
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,526
Where's Mika?
She was driving.

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,261
W-We'll check.
You just be still, okay?

91
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,496
This is Yasuda's sister.

92
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,433
Yasuda.
That's Yasuda!

93
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,034
What? Yasuda?

94
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,404
27-year-old female, GCS 14.
Brief LOC.

95
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:39,638
Blunt trauma
to the abdomen.

96
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:40,872
BP is 90 over 40.

97
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,475
Received one-liter bolus
of LR.

98
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:43,809
Yasuda, it's Altman.

99
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:44,943
And Bailey.

100
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:48,046
C-Chloe is my --
my sister.

101
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,048
She's here.
Webber's got her.

102
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,485
All right. Let's move.
Let's get her to Trauma 1

103
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,354
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!
We got you. We got you.

104
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,132
Uh, prominent bruising
in the right upper quadrant.

105
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,667
She's hypotensive
and tachy.

106
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,169
All right.
Let's get a FAST exam,

107
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,671
trauma panel,
and chest X-rays right now.

108
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,173
Weren't you on
last night?

109
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:16,709
I operated with her
this morning.

110
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,377
X-rays are on their way.
No, Adams.
You shouldn't be in here.

111
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,579
No. I want to help.
Do it somewhere else.

112
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,013
No, no. I need to say.

113
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,884
Skywalker.

114
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,085
Go.

115
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:32,725
Take care of C-Chloe...
please.

116
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,230
Oh. Sats are dropping.
We need to intubate right now.

117
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:41,767
Adams, go!
All right.
Push etomidate and sux.

118
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,437
And I need a 7-0 ET tube.

119
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,405
No major lacerations.
We just need stereo strips.

120
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,741
Where do you want me?
In the waiting room.

121
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:52,178
Mika!
Push 50 of fentanyl.

122
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,713
Chloe, I need you
to be brave for me, okay?

123
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,182
You can do this.

124
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:58,617
Yasuda asked me
to help her sister.

125
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,219
You know the rules.
No friends, no family.
With all due respect,

126
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,953
you've spent more time
with Chloe than I have.

127
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,223
I can't help in there.
Please let me stay.

128
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,858
Go pull up the X-rays
for Dr. Lincoln.

129
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,593
Okay.
Catch me up.

130
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,261
Chloe Yasuda, 22-year-old female
MVC with crush injuries

131
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,263
to the bilateral
lower extremities.

132
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,365
FAST exam came back negative.
Yasuda?

133
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,633
Is she--
Yeah.

134
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,602
Okay.
What do we got on the X-ray?

135
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:19,238
It's coming up now.

136
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,439
Multiple comminuted
fractures.

137
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,741
All right.
Weak DP pulses bilaterally.

138
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,743
We're gonna have to check
for blood flow in the legs.

139
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,445
Adams, go get
the Doppler monitor.

140
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,284
Where is she?
Who's with her?

141
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:33,985
Bailey, Altman,
and Ndugu. She's in Trauma 1.

142
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,254
Trauma 1.

143
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:39,325
All right.
Putting in the chest tube.

144
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,461
How are you doing on your side?
Scalpel.

145
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,263
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. No.

146
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,499
You all need to step away
and let us take care of her.

147
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:50,436
She's definitely bleeding
in the abdomen.

148
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,171
I need a gown and gloves.

149
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,473
Millin, there's nothing
for you to do right now.

150
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,075
Damn it, we need to put in
a central line.

151
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,544
Call the blood bank
and activate MTP.

152
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,379
C-Come on.
Let's go.

153
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,215
No. She's -- She's bleeding out!
She needs to go to the O.R. now!

154
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,083
She's coding.

155
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,119
All right.
Starting compressions.

156
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,020
No. No. Mika!
Mika! Mika!

157
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,656
Get her out of here now!
No!

158
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,625
Code -- M-Mika!

159
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:14,126
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, Yasuda.

160
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:21,284
We'll be fine. People do
long distance all the time.

161
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:24,987
And I've always wanted to work
with kids.

162
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,057
I've only lived in Seattle.

163
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,160
I've only been here,
just like you.

164
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:32,995
We need to get out
into the world

165
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:36,233
and experience something new.

166
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,001
Make our mark.

167
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,804
Right?

168
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,441
Your graduation speech
needs work.

169
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,010
Is this Ruby Garner?

170
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:49,646
Yeah.
I helped deliver her.

171
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,181
Is she going home?

172
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,649
Well, if she can pass
her car-seat test.

173
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,852
Can't believe
you're leaving me.

174
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,921
I'll be back
all the time.

175
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:00,257
Yeah, but you'll be
with James.

176
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,326
Do you think it's a mistake,
doing long distance?

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,795
I don't even moved yet.
It's already hard.

178
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,030
I am not in the position

179
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,866
to be giving relationship advice
right now.

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,502
Oh.

181
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:14,938
Dr. Yasuda was brought
into the E.R., MVC.

182
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,940
She's in the trauma bay.
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:17,807
Do you need to go?
Hi.

184
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,376
We know we're early,

185
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,711
but we're excited
to bring her home.

186
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,647
How's her car-seat test
going?

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,850
Well, she's not
loving it.

188
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:30,520
Is she --
She's turning blue.

189
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,356
Okay. Someone get me
a neonatal intubation kit.

190
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,225
What's happening?
Is she breathing?

191
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,427
Mr. and Mrs. Garner, I need you
to go to the waiting area

192
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,329
so that we can take care
of your daughter, okay?

193
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:40,964
We're not going anywhere.
Excuse me.

194
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:42,532
Nurse Madison, can you --
Thank you.

195
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,601
But...

196
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,902
Okay.

197
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,337
You got it?

198
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,438
Yeah.

199
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,506
Got it.

200
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,177
I got your page.
Where do you need me?

201
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,645
Prepping for a thoracotomy.

202
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,514
Got me.
Stop compressions.

203
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,318
- Oh.
- We got a sinus rhythm.

204
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,953
All right.
She's lost a lot of blood.

205
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:05,056
She's in hemorrhagic shock.

206
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,823
It's got to be
a diaphragmatic rupture.

207
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,959
It looks like her liver
herniated into her chest.

208
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,994
She's still too unstable. We got
to get her to the O.R. now.

209
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,896
I'm calling up now.

210
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,097
Have the blood product sent
up to the operating room.

211
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,699
Hang another unit.

212
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:16,833
Uh, take over.

213
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,435
I'll meet you up there.

214
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,738
Come with me.

215
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,343
Neither leg's getting
a signal.

216
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:27,577
Somebody give me
the pressure monitor.

217
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:30,213
She just had her first round
of chemo.

218
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:32,215
We need to look out
for acute kidney injury.

219
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,217
High pressure
in both legs.

220
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,785
No blood flow.
Bone-crush injuries.

221
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:37,621
Legs are tight. That's --
Acute compartment syndrome.

222
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,389
All right.
We got to relieve the pressure

223
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,790
so she doesn't lose her legs.
Okay, Adams. Step aside.

224
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,325
I'll take the right leg.
Warren, you take the left.

225
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,194
We're gonna do
bilateral fasiciotomies.

226
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,528
I want full skin incisions,

227
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:47,464
anterolateral
and posteromedial.

228
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:50,600
All right. Make it quick.
Let's go.

229
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,205
How is she doing?

230
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:57,340
Better now that
she can breathe.

231
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:58,575
How are her parents?

232
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,744
Worried.

233
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,979
You'd think being pregnant would
make me more sympathetic.

234
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:06,516
But I'm kind of just annoyed
their baby's already out.

235
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,418
You're okay, Ruby.
I'm right here.

236
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,788
For today. Then he's leaving us
to fend for ourselves.

237
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,323
Traitor.
Are you being mean

238
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:15,425
because you're having
separation anxiety?

239
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,429
No. I am tired and hormonal.
Don't psychoanalyze me.

240
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,965
Okay. There it is.
Fluid around the heart.

241
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,833
Probably from the viral
infection she had

242
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,335
a couple weeks ago.

243
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,404
Gonna have to run some labs
and aspirate.

244
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,005
You want me to consent
the parents?

245
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,774
Oh, you don't have to do that.
It's not your job.

246
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:31,975
I don't mind.

247
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,977
I don't know
what I would have done

248
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,812
all these years
without you.

249
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,516
Oh, my God. Shut up.
I am not crying before lunch.

250
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,818
Dr. Netelbeek to Ortho.

251
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:45,221
Dr. Tessa Netelbeek to Ortho.
Okay, Ruby.

252
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:48,491
All right. So, she appears
to have extensive liver damage.

253
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,727
How's her neuro exam?
No signs of TBI yet.

254
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,996
We'll have to scan her
after the O.R.

255
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,998
We will try
and keep you updated,

256
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,200
but right now,
she is our first priority.

257
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,535
Dr. Bailey, please.

258
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:00,670
We're going to do
everything we can.

259
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,806
She means a lot
to all of us.

260
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,476
She really couldn't be
a better hands.

261
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,845
I-I switched with her.

262
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,313
She worked
the night shift?

263
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:12,049
I was swamped,
and she helped me.

264
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,250
And then I-I told Ndugu
to let her scrub in.

265
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:16,120
If she hadn't been on the road
when she was --

266
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:17,687
You have to stop that.

267
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,222
Great. Advice from
the no-feelings guy.

268
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,657
No.
That's not what I m--

269
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,292
Look, you can't think
like that

270
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,227
or the guilt will eat you alive,
okay? Trust me.

271
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,562
Don't tell me
what to think.

272
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:27,697
You don't know what
the hell happened.

273
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:30,167
Neither do you.
I'm just stating facts.

274
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,835
Okay.
You want to hear facts?

275
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,870
Our friend is fighting
for her life in there,

276
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,672
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

277
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,707
I know that might not matter
to you

278
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,910
and your stone heart,
but it matters to me.

279
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,771
Oh, I'm s-- Hey.

280
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,738
Hey.
How's it going?

281
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:53,440
It's pretty brutal.

282
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,076
At least you get to do
something. I feel helpless.

283
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:57,544
I wish I could do more.
I just want to camp out

284
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,046
in the O.R. corridor
and wait for updates.

285
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,314
But I can't find Millin.
She won't text me back.

286
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:01,783
Then I'm talking --
Hey.

287
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,822
Keep me posted on Chloe,
okay?

288
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:18,398
You okay?

289
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,467
I, uh...

290
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,070
I called out Yasuda once
for eating an old doughnut.

291
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:24,772
It was after a meeting,

292
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:26,607
and I found her pulling it
out of the trash.

293
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,176
And for some reason,
it just set me off.

294
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,678
She was struggling,
and she didn't deserve it.

295
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:34,181
I'm sure
she forgives you.

296
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,351
I'm sorry about Cass.

297
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:39,686
I know. Don't think
about that right now.

298
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,859
Teddy, look at me.

299
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,866
We can do this.

300
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,234
We can do this.

301
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:00,607
Yeah.
Abdomen and chest look good.

302
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,643
Has anybody called
their parents yet?

303
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,478
Webber was trying to get
in touch with them.

304
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:08,515
You know, Yasuda she's the glue
of our class.

305
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,219
Somehow she manages to be
best friends with everybody.

306
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,655
Yeah, I'm still
getting to know everyone,

307
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,057
but I got Yasuda's number
right away.

308
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,460
Yeah, one time, um,
when I was living at the house

309
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:22,663
one day, I thought there was
an earthquake.

310
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:27,267
But it turns out it was
just Yasuda pumping herself up

311
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,003
for the night shift.

312
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:31,940
Being a doctor
is never harder

313
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,908
than when you personally care
for your patient.

314
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,309
How's it look?

315
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,912
Uh, no chest
or abdominal injuries,

316
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:40,147
and the leg scans
are coming up now.

317
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,920
I see a irregularity
in the popliteal artery.

318
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,554
Well, let's just keep
an eye on it

319
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,556
and get a vascular consult
when we open her up.

320
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,258
All right.
These are complex fractures.

321
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,061
We're gonna have to do
a combined approach

322
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,129
of ORIFs and ex fixes
in both legs.

323
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,899
Let's get her prepped
for surgery.

324
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:04,906
Target is ID'ed below the left
of the xiphoid bone.

325
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:06,607
Okay.
Needle's ready.

326
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,043
We have visual confirmation
on the ultrasound.

327
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,045
Okay.
All right.

328
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,614
We're almost ready.

329
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:17,584
Then you'll feel better and
your parents will feel better.

330
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,720
They sure do love you.

331
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:22,023
Even though you've been living
in different places.

332
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:26,094
Are you about to compare
the life of a baby in the NICU

333
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,029
to your long-distance
relationship?

334
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,163
Well, <i>you</i> didn't
give me advice.

335
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,767
Monitor's showing bradycardia.

336
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,068
You need to move.
Okay.

337
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:35,469
Here we go.
Okay.

338
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,704
Remove the ultrasound probe.
Yeah.

339
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:39,107
Right there.
Okay, Ruby.

340
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,607
You're gonna feel
a little sting.

341
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,754
Remember when you dropped
your glasses

342
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:55,155
in somebody's abdomen?

343
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:57,724
I try really hard not to.

344
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,159
You've come a long way.

345
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,797
All right.

346
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,932
Heart rate is back
to normal rhythm.

347
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,233
Great.

348
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,002
You want to tell
the parents

349
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,971
we may need to keep her
another couple nights,

350
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,405
but then she should be
able to leave?

351
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:12,272
Sure.

352
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,409
Okay.
You want advice?

353
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,846
Long distance is awful.

354
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,616
It's expensive and lonely,
and I would never recommend it.

355
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,486
But if <i>you</i> are committed
to making it work...

356
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,389
...it will.

357
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:45,405
Okay.

358
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:47,975
Bears or worms?

359
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,110
I'm not hungry.

360
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,179
She is gonna get
through this.

361
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,847
I came down here
to be alone.

362
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,648
She isn't
just your friend.

363
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,583
I know that.
Do you know that?

364
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,251
Because you are acting like this
is happening just to you.

365
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,054
We are all freaking out
here.

366
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:02,023
We all need each other
right now.

367
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,858
Mika and I
aren't just friends.

368
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,259
Like you're together?

369
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:07,661
Yes.

370
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,831
No.

371
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:10,898
I don't know.

372
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,736
Okay.
What...

373
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,073
What do you call it when --
when you flirt with someone

374
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:21,441
and then sometimes you kiss
and you want to be together

375
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,543
but then her sister
gets sick

376
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,213
and you work together,
and it's all just --

377
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,680
Complicated.

378
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,116
Yeah.

379
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,319
Yeah, that's exactly it.

380
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:36,190
Gonna need something stronger
than gummy bears.

381
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,764
All right.
Spleen's intact,

382
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,631
and there's no bleeding
in the retroperitoneum.

383
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,466
Okay.
At least there's that.

384
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,601
She's still losing
a lot of blood.

385
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,436
Hang two more units.
More lap pads.

386
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,471
Okay. This liver is fractured
right down the middle.

387
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:52,672
Pringle maneuver?

388
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:55,275
It's worth a try.
Clamp.

389
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,311
Okay.
And staple.

390
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,381
Uh, bleeding is still
too profuse.

391
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,950
We should try
hemostatic agents.

392
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:05,019
Both lobes are jacked.

393
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,753
We need to remove the liver
before she bleeds out to death.

394
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:08,655
No, we are not adding
liver failure to someone

395
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,892
who is too hypotensive
and too unstable.

396
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,261
- That could kill her, too.
- I agree with Altman.

397
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,129
Let's move to damage control.
Embolize in I.R.,

398
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,064
then resuscitate in the ICU
until she's stable.

399
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,000
And then we move her back
to the O.R.

400
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,534
We need to be more aggressive.
She'll continue to bleed.

401
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,936
We need to excise the liver

402
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,503
and put her
on the transplant list now.

403
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:25,106
She just coded.
She could code again,

404
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,506
and we might not get her back
again.

405
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,176
Okay. Enough.

406
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,477
This is one of our own
lying on this table.

407
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,914
She needs us to stop arguing
and to save her life.

408
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,116
We will <i>not</i> remove
her liver.
Thank you.

409
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,119
And we will also not leave her
in the ICU overnight.

410
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,954
Do you have a better plan?

411
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,688
Oh, boy.

412
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,456
Hmm.

413
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,895
Okay. We will pack her,
scan her head to toe,

414
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,131
then get her to the ICU,
give her blood,

415
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,166
let her stabilize
for a few hours

416
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,501
while we get our acts together
and figure out a better plan.

417
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:57,171
Anybody feels the need
to disagree, step the hell out.

418
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,172
Lap pads.

419
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:08,245
How's she doing?

420
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:11,281
She's putting up
a good fight.

421
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:14,885
Uh, I can sit with her
if you have things to do.

422
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:18,122
Okay.
Page me if you need anything.

423
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,124
I'll be close.

424
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,937
You messed up laundry again.

425
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,909
I don't have a...
single clean sock.

426
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,879
And I-I know
what you're gonna say.

427
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,615
I left my clothes in the washer.
But...

428
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,685
Yeah, I-I...

429
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,254
I don't have a good
justification for that.

430
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,492
You still suck at laundry,
though.

431
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,734
I'll tell you what.

432
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,603
You pull through this
and I'll...

433
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:08,606
do all your laundry
for as long as we live together.

434
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,408
But don't get greedy,

435
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,776
'cause I-I can't start
doing everything for you.

436
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,711
The dishes in the sink.

437
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:18,215
The...hair in the drain.

438
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:21,084
The dried toothpaste on...

439
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,555
That's all you.

440
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,494
Not that you actually do
any of those things.

441
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,300
You're a terrible roommate.

442
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,616
Altman said you were here.
I didn't believe her.

443
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,786
Ah. Whenever I'm stuck
on something,

444
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,588
I like to go
for a walk.

445
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:00,157
It clears the mind,
settles the nerves.

446
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,662
But I don't want to be far
from my patients, so treadmill.

447
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,230
Plus I get
some steps in.

448
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:07,398
Makes sense.

449
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,667
Any ideas?
Not yet.

450
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,069
Collectively, the four of us
have probably published

451
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,571
close to 300
case studies.

452
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,906
You counted?

453
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,674
Well, no, but I'm --
I'm just saying,

454
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,411
based on how much we've seen and
how much we've accomplished...

455
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,279
We should have ideas.

456
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:24,349
Yeah.

457
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:27,184
I let Yasuda do
the bronchial anastomosis

458
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,554
on a lung transplant
this morning.

459
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,255
She's got real skills.

460
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,257
Of course she does.
I trained her.

461
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,361
You like teaching?
Yeah.

462
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:37,829
I didn't even think
about it

463
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,029
when I decided
to go into surgery.

464
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:40,465
But yeah, I do.

465
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,400
It's my favorite part
of the job.

466
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,135
I get it. You get to support
fledgling doctors

467
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:48,306
and watch them grow
into surgeons

468
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,807
who can stand
on their own.

469
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,743
It's fulfilling.

470
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:55,880
You hit your step goal?

471
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,682
I've got an idea.

472
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,151
Yes.
Yeah. Okay.

473
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:02,520
Her CT scan shows

474
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,656
that only 25% of her liver
remains viable.

475
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:05,990
Not enough
to preserve function.

476
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:07,725
Agree.

477
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,894
I still think the risk
of removing it is too high.

478
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:11,963
I agree with that too.

479
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,299
So what exactly
is your plan?

480
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:18,135
We resect the entire
right lobe,

481
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:22,105
then we resect the damaged areas
in the left.

482
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,742
Then we give the remainder
of the liver

483
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:28,646
the circulatory support it needs
to recover and grow

484
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,716
with dialysis
and aggressive resuscitation.

485
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,851
How?
The common hepatic artery

486
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:36,153
is completely damaged
at the takeoff.

487
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:45,162
We remove her spleen and
use its vessels to reconstruct

488
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,565
and feed what's left
of the liver.

489
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,868
You think the remaining piece
of the liver will be functional?

490
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,604
I am hoping it will.

491
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:54,606
This won't be as simple
as you make it sound.

492
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,908
Okay. I know.
It's a long shot, right?

493
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,209
But Yasuda is strong,

494
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,946
and we've all seen her
give everything she's got

495
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,748
to her family, her patients.

496
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,516
She would do it
for any one of us.

497
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,584
Yeah.

498
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,752
Mm.
Yep.

499
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,921
I'm in.

500
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,122
Yeah.
Me too.

501
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,461
Right.
Let's get her back to the O.R.

502
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,497
Hi.

503
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,066
Hey.
How's your last day?

504
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,201
It's graduation day.

505
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:26,203
For the preemies,
they get to leave the hospital.

506
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:28,506
Ah. Do you need a chaplain
for that?

507
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,041
No.

508
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:33,176
Well, is there anything else
I can help you with?

509
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,948
You could move to Texas
with me.

510
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,616
What?

511
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,218
People get into car accidents,
and people die,

512
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:44,789
and life is short, and
you've lived all over the world.

513
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,624
Why not San Antonio
with me?

514
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,393
Well, I mean, my --
my whole life is here.

515
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:51,129
You know, my job.
I just bought my loft.

516
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,797
I'm falling in love
with you.

517
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:56,934
I'm sorry to put you on the spot
like this.

518
00:22:56,968 --> 00:22:58,970
You d-- You don't have to decide
this second.

519
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,203
You don't even have to decide
today.

520
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:04,008
Just...
Just think about it.

521
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:08,546
Sorry.

522
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,448
Let's talk about this
later.

523
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,150
I'll meet you in the lobby
after work.

524
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,951
Okay.

525
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,666
Nothing? You don't feel
a tiny bit better?

526
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,201
They're babies.

527
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:33,236
Who could also die in
a terrible car accident one day.

528
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,242
Come with me.

529
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:45,349
You're not going to make me hold
one of them, are you?

530
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,924
Sit.

531
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,160
Do not test me.
Not today.

532
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:09,340
Oh, my God.

533
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:11,743
It's like sitting
into a hug.

534
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,259
How long have you
and Yasuda been a thing?

535
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:32,363
We haven't had sex yet,
if that's what you're asking.

536
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:33,364
It's not
what I'm asking.

537
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,400
Couple months.

538
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:39,370
We keep trying to
slow it down,

539
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:40,805
and then we just
pick it back up again.

540
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:43,074
Why can't you just be
together?

541
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,710
Because we're friends,
w-we work together.

542
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:46,744
Hi.

543
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:58,489
I've never had a relationship
that feels like this.

544
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:04,228
So, like, easy and...
electric and...

545
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:11,335
I-I think we were both scared
of messing it up.

546
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:15,706
It's kind of ironic now.

547
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,645
Mika is not going down
without a fight.

548
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:24,282
Especially if she has you
to fight for.

549
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:29,620
This poor kid.

550
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,156
She just started chemo,
and now this.

551
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,091
Makes you count
your blessings, huh?

552
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,160
Popliteal artery
is bleeding out.

553
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:37,261
Damn it.
Vascular clamp.

554
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,763
How can I help?

555
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:41,599
There's too much blood.
Okay. Page vascular!

556
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,134
She's gonna lose her leg
if they don't get here quick.

557
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,303
Clamp!
All right.

558
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,670
I-I'll go get someone.

559
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:47,805
Good.
Right there.

560
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,340
More suction.

561
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,375
Speak now or forever hold
your peace.

562
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,147
Here we go.

563
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,615
Titan, please.

564
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,620
How's the liver looking?

565
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:05,556
Ischemic and still bleeding.
Suction.

566
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,891
I need Dr. Altman
or Dr. Ndugu.

567
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:08,960
We're a little busy
right now.

568
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:12,163
Chloe has a bad vascular bleed.
She's about to lose her leg.

569
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,433
All right. I'll go.
Owen, take over for me.

570
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,201
What O.R. is she in?

571
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,036
Four.

572
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:23,074
Adams, they need you
in Chloe's O.R.

573
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:24,976
Adams!

574
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,011
Uh...

575
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,896
How's the signal down her leg?

576
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:54,166
Weak. At this point, there could
be irreversible ischemic damage.

577
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,335
Yeah. Her myoglobin
and C.K. levels are elevated.

578
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,971
We should continue sodium bicarb
and start Mucomyst.

579
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:00,639
Sorry. I got held up.
Gown and glove me.

580
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,608
I need 6-0 of prolene
and vessel loops.

581
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:05,244
All right, Chloe.
Hang in there.

582
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:07,613
Stay with me.
We got you.

583
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,081
Vascular anastomosis
is complete.

584
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:50,883
It's holding.

585
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,519
Okay.
Removing the clamp.

586
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:00,059
Now we all pray to God
it works.

587
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,537
Hey.

588
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,208
I just told a woman that's
been laboring for 14 hours

589
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,277
that she was only
two centimeters dilated.

590
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:18,944
Thought she was gonna
punch me.

591
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:20,379
How's Ruby?

592
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,282
Good.
Her vitals have improved.

593
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:24,583
Okay. Great.
Where's James?

594
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:27,786
I don't know.

595
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,889
Well, maybe he got held up
with, uh, with a patient.

596
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,991
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.

597
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:34,927
If I haven't completely
freaked him out,

598
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,797
maybe it's just, uh,
back to long distance

599
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:43,102
and I'll rack up a bunch
of frequent-flyer miles

600
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:45,604
and we'll talk on the phone
all the time.

601
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:46,805
I could get better
at sexting.

602
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,141
Mm! Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:29:48,174 --> 00:29:50,342
It's a silver lining.

604
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:57,150
Getting drunk
and sleeping with you...

605
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:59,384
was the best mistake
I ever made.

606
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:06,625
Will you be
my baby's godfather?

607
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,595
Are those two things
supposed to be related?

608
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:11,029
No.

609
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:16,034
When I'm upset,
you're my first call.

610
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:21,874
Because even on my worst days,
you always make me laugh.

611
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:26,578
And the reason I was so mad
when you quit O.B.

612
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:29,282
wasn't because I got you
the job.

613
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:31,817
It was because I was losing
my favorite person to work with.

614
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,355
And now I'm losing you
again.

615
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:37,589
I'm not dying.

616
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:39,658
We're gonna talk
all the time.

617
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:43,562
The world is
a hardened place...

618
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:47,032
full of hardened people
like you.

619
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:51,770
You walk through life
with this giant open heart.

620
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:56,875
I want you
in my kids' lives.

621
00:30:56,909 --> 00:31:01,413
I want you to teach them
to be gentle...

622
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,448
and warm-hearted.

623
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:06,418
And all of that
Star Wars stuff.

624
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:08,987
That'll be fun.

625
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:13,625
So be their godfather.

626
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,627
They'd be lucky
to be loved by you.

627
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:20,266
I'm flattered.

628
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,102
I mean, I love them
so much already.

629
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,405
But I am Jewish.
Is that even allowed?

630
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:27,506
Just say yes
and buy them amazing gifts.

631
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,777
I would love to be
their godfather.

632
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:42,188
I didn't like her
when I first met her.

633
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:43,555
What?

634
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:46,125
Ow.
I like her now.

635
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,095
She was just so...loud

636
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:51,797
and all up in my face
all the time.

637
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,032
I like calm.
Quiet.

638
00:31:55,968 --> 00:32:00,406
I met her right after I bumped
into someone I'd slept with.

639
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,075
She rescued me.

640
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:04,077
Wait.
Who'd you sleep with?

641
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,510
That's not the point
of the story.

642
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:07,479
Wait.
I kind of remember this.

643
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:09,248
Did you sleep
with Lincoln?

644
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:11,750
What?

645
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:13,585
Well, I'm really glad

646
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:15,520
I didn't run into
any of <i>you</i> jerks that day.

647
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,093
Um...

648
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:31,570
She's stable,
and she's recovering in the ICU.

649
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:34,940
Now we wait and see.

650
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,675
Well, I guess this is one way
to get out of charting.

651
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,977
Ah! They should've reassigned
your paperwork today.

652
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,446
Yeah. Well,
it's pretty much the only thing

653
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,914
they'd let me do all day,

654
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:53,949
so I figured
I might as well finish it.

655
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:56,151
Not that she cares.

656
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:59,355
Oh, Yasuda, weirdly,
loves paperwork.

657
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:01,924
She blasts music
and times herself.

658
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,296
Code blue, room 4429,

659
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,697
surgical ICU.

660
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,098
Code blue...
That's Chloe.

661
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:13,035
room 4429, surgical ICU.

662
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:14,937
Page an attending!

663
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,140
...room 4429.
Someone start bagging.

664
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:19,475
I'll bag.

665
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:23,946
Push one of epi.

666
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,548
I'll get the epi.

667
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,317
Okay.

668
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,352
Come on. Come on.

669
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:43,399
Oh, hey.
How's Yasuda?

670
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:45,602
Um, she's, uh...

671
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:47,936
She's good.

672
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,505
Interns are with her.

673
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:55,278
Look, we should --
I know that today's --

674
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:58,180
You go.

675
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:02,117
I overreacted.

676
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,155
It was a mistake,
and you told me right away.

677
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,191
You did nothing wrong.

678
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:09,892
I'm still sorry.
I just...

679
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,795
I would never want to
cause you any pain.

680
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:13,963
I know.

681
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:17,033
Come on.

682
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:19,436
Thank you.

683
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,571
Let's go home.

684
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:22,439
Let's go home.

685
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:24,040
Charge to 200.

686
00:34:26,343 --> 00:34:28,144
Clear!

687
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,418
Again.

688
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,719
What happened?

689
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,053
Clear.

690
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:39,623
Her potassium spiked.
She went into V-fib.

691
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:43,793
Charge to 300.

692
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,598
Clear.

693
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:50,768
Come on. Come on.

694
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,801
How long has it been?

695
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,570
40 minutes of CPR.

696
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,172
Adams.

697
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:01,177
Adams.

698
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:02,346
You've done all you can.

699
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:11,921
Time of death...22:16.

700
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:14,558
No. No.
You can't stop.

701
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:16,260
Someone bag.

702
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:18,295
Millin, back away.

703
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:19,430
Come on, Chloe.

704
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:20,930
Come on.

705
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,366
Come on.
Come on, Chloe.

706
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,866
Help me!

707
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,901
Jules...
Chloe, come on.

708
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:27,036
Come on.
Jules...

709
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,906
...she's gone.

710
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:37,847
Wait --

711
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,296
What's that?

712
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,963
Chloe's personal
belongings.

713
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:58,067
She didn't make it.

714
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,069
Rhabdo.

715
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:02,138
Crush injuries
on top of chemo

716
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:05,174
was just too much
for her body to handle.

717
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:07,478
It's...
It's her shoes and her phone

718
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,078
for when Yasuda
wakes up.

719
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:10,481
<i>If</i> she wakes up.

720
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:12,850
Babe...

721
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,451
No. No, no.
'Cause it's not over.

722
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:16,553
And I have to stay vigilant.

723
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:18,288
You know, if you hug me,
I'm gonna cry.
Okay.

724
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:20,022
And I cannot cry.

725
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:28,164
You're staying here?

726
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,666
I mean,
I-I know that means

727
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,468
another night away
from you and the kids, but --

728
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,136
Don't even worry
about that, all right?

729
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,538
Yasuda needs you.

730
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,373
Tomorrow morning,
you -- you give the kids

731
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,242
whatever they want
for breakfast, right?

732
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,744
Waffles. Pizza.
I don't care! Just...

733
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,513
We can do that.

734
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:45,883
You make something good
happen, Ben Warren.

735
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,950
I need something good
to happen.

736
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:55,292
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

737
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:17,013
<i>When you're met</i>
<i>with the impossible,</i>

738
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:18,849
<i>the only place to turn</i>
<i>is toward each other.</i>

739
00:37:18,882 --> 00:37:20,884
She told me to take care
of her sister.

740
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,821
Do not blame yourself.

741
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:25,589
You did all you could.

742
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,792
I ran her code.

743
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,627
<i>I</i> called
her time of death.

744
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:31,929
None of this
is your fault.

745
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:34,932
S-She'll understand.

746
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:36,366
No.
I-I have to go.

747
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,602
Lucas.
<i>When you lose,</i>

748
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:41,205
<i>you have someone</i>
<i>to cry with.</i>

749
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,211
<i>When you walk</i>
<i>into the unknown,</i>

750
00:37:47,244 --> 00:37:49,213
<i>you have someone</i>
<i>to hold your hand.</i>

751
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:58,422
I'm Dr. Schmitt.

752
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,224
You made the right call.

753
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,261
Levi!

754
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,795
Hi!
Hi.

755
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:40,430
I-I am so sorry about the lobby.
I just...

756
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:41,865
No. It's okay.

757
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,634
This was a big ask,
and you weren't ready.

758
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,303
No. I was in the admin office
resigning from my job.

759
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,340
You still want me to go to Texas
with you, right?

760
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,488
Wait.
Wait, wait.

761
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,055
Please tell me
that this is a yes,

762
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,291
because I just quit
my job.

763
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,091
Yes.

764
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:13,564
Let's go!

765
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:14,865
Together.

766
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,738
<i>And when you win,</i>

767
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:24,975
<i>there's someone by your side</i>
<i>to celebrate.</i>

768
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:29,078
<i>And suddenly,</i>
<i>the impossible feels possible.</i>

769
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,051
<i>But sometimes there's no one</i>
<i>to turn to.</i>

770
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,320
<i>Sometimes you're all alone.</i>

771
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,324
It's late.
You all should go home.

772
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,695
It could be days
before she wakes up, okay?

773
00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:45,662
Go get some rest.

774
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,564
Come on.

775
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:50,400
Could you let us know
if anything changes?

776
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:53,870
I'll call
the second it does.

777
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:15,626
<i>In those times,</i>
<i>you have to keep the faith.</i>

778
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:42,519
<i>Remember that even</i>
<i>if you can't see them</i>

779
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:44,621
<i>or feel them or hear them,</i>

780
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,891
<i>your people are out there,</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

781
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:05,409
Yasuda.

782
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:08,345
Hey, welcome back.

783
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:12,649
Your surgery,
it went well.

784
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,985
You're gonna be okay.

785
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:16,053
Mm-hmm.

786
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:18,722
Chloe?

787
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:29,599
Chloe?

788
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,036
No.

789
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,238
No.

790
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,842
No.
Shh.

791
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:43,180
No!

792
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,415
No.

793
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,985
No.

794
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,822
Oh, no.

795
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:04,534
<i>Even after you're gone.</i>
