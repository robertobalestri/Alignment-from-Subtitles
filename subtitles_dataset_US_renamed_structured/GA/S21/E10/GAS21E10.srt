1
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:06,355
<i>Before they're even
scheduled for surgery,</i>

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:09,738
<i>every patient asks
how long it will take to recover.</i>

3
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:12,464
<i>The implication being
the quicker the better.</i>

4
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:14,709
The fancy car, the private jet.

5
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:17,607
It's a nice way to distract
from the ick factor

6
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:19,680
of being flown in for an F.O.C.

7
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,060
That's a "friend of Catherine."

8
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:24,822
Her friends deserve
liver transplants too.

9
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:28,412
Right. Okay. So we're doing it
out of fairness?

10
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,069
I miss the OR.

11
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,038
Hmm. And this has nothing to do
with Ellis's school fundraiser tonight?

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,661
I spend all my time fundraising
for Alzheimer's research.

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,182
It gets a hundred-percent of my focus.
And I can donate to the school online.

14
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:42,011
Okay. I get it.

15
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,048
You're scared of
the other moms, aren't you?

16
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,497
They're scared of me.

17
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:47,189
Oh. That's true.
That is true.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,295
Plus, this gives me a chance
to check on Catherine's shunt.

19
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:51,953
And, uh, Richard?

20
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,437
Maybe you check on him?

21
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:57,614
Well, I didn't operate on him.
So...

22
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,617
<i>Search online
and you'll find advice</i>

23
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>from all kinds of people
without medical degrees</i>

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,725
<i>about how to heal faster...</i>

25
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:06,622
Morning.

26
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:08,486
Mmm. Intern retreat morning.

27
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:09,936
Yeah, a whole day out of the OR.

28
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,454
Why do you sound happy?

29
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,456
No morning rounds.
Why do you sound miserable?

30
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,114
- Just interns all day.
- You still avoiding Millin, huh?

31
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:19,186
She threw me under the bus with Altman.
Has barely acknowledged me since.

32
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,326
It's kinda hard to do that
when you're avoiding her.

33
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,571
Whose side are you on?

34
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,262
What are we supposed to wear
to this thing?

35
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,023
Uh, clothes?

36
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,715
- Oh. - But do you have to
put them on right now?

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,971
<i>...because most people
don't wanna hear what we say,</i>

38
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,420
<i>which is to rest,</i>

39
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,976
<i>and let your body heal
on its own time.</i>

40
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:53,911
Oh, th-this is great.

41
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:56,120
Well, it's not Cottonwood
Resort, but you know,

42
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,122
you gotta do what you gotta do.

43
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:02,540
I loved when Richard would invite
my residency class to his home.

44
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,369
For a party or a meal.

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,440
But you know,
retreat is supposed to be a change of pace.

46
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:07,787
This is change.

47
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:09,651
You rearranged
the whole living room.

48
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,619
I hope this is fun.
They need it.

49
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,485
I gotta go. Altman's been watching me
like a hawk ever since the heat dome.

50
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,280
You should be happy
that's all she's doing.

51
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,729
What happened to
staying out of it?

52
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,421
I'll see you tonight.

53
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:23,147
Good luck with your retreat.

54
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:24,631
Oh. No luck needed.

55
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,427
- Danny Ford, retreat facilitator.
- Uh.

56
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:31,086
I've got a curriculum that's worked
for its clients from Fortune 100 CEOs

57
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:32,363
to at-risk teens.

58
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:33,951
So you're in good hands. Mine.

59
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:35,780
Well, then I'll keep
my luck to myself.

60
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,575
- Okay.
- Danny, come on.

61
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:38,956
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

62
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,441
- I appreciate it. All right.
- Okay.

63
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,614
- Oh, I'll take it.
- Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

64
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:47,585
Good morning, sleepyhead.

65
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,104
I am beat.

66
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,693
Scout woke me up twice
last night asking for "wawa,"

67
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,283
and I brought him water,
and he spiraled his cup across the room.

68
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,457
I thought you were
supposed to be resting.

69
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,287
Yeah, well, most of my patients
will be back at work by now,

70
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:04,360
but Bailey's strong-armed me
into taking more time.

71
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,018
It's been less than a week
since your procedure.

72
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,986
I am fine. I just...

73
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:13,680
I feel a little pressure
when I go up and down the stairs.

74
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:14,957
Want me to carry you?

75
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,028
Mmm. Like when
I sprained my ankle,

76
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,860
and you carried me to the campus
health center. No, thank you.

77
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,965
- I only dropped you once.
- Yeah, I wouldn't brag about that.

78
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,625
Okay. Yeah.

79
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:28,730
Hmm.

80
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:31,491
- I don't hate it, but what is it?
- Mm-hmm?

81
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:35,909
Bacon, egg, cheese, a pancake between
two doughnuts.

82
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,878
It's a sandwich
of my favorite breakfast foods.

83
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,983
Yeah!

84
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,639
Mmm.

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,123
- Okay, you just...
- Okay.

86
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,885
Yeah, so you just kind of
just squish it down.

87
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,651
Go fix bones. Okay.

88
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,485
My Aunt Jeannie brings potato salad
to family picnics in a cooler like this.

89
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,866
Well, this one's
for precious cargo.

90
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,351
Katie Ramsey's waited
six months for this heart.

91
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:05,939
Well, I won't tell
my Aunt Jeannie

92
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,114
that you don't think
her potato salad is precious.

93
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,290
And I won't tell our patient that you
compared her heart to potato salad.

94
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,706
- Fair enough.
- Mmm.

95
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,711
Morning.

96
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,818
- Dr. Ndugu.
- Hey.

97
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:25,546
I thought I missed you.

98
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:28,928
Jackie said that you had
already checked on her.

99
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,999
Oh, yeah, I got an early start
on rounds today.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,656
- Jackie's doing well, so...
- Yeah.

101
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:35,970
...and now I'm picking up a heart
for a transplant patient.

102
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,975
That's impressive.

103
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:48,499
I'm actually glad I ran into you.
We've been here so long.

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,984
It feels kinda weird
not to start my day with you.

105
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,787
She seems nice.

106
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,963
- Yeah, I helped save her daughter.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,137
Doesn't seem like that's why.

108
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,383
- Hey, Amelia.
- Hey, how's Jo?

109
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:13,386
Not answering my texts about lowering my rent
now that Levi's moved out.

110
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,079
That wasn't for me.

111
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,150
Marley Frank, 37,

112
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,428
jumped off the 15-foot high bridge
into shallow water. No LOC.

113
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,844
Complains of neck
and back pain. Vitals stable.

114
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,363
I'm also freaking freezing.

115
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,124
Hello, Marley, I'm Dr. Lincoln.

116
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,022
This is Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Helm.
We're here to help.

117
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,992
I do need to ask, did you
hurt yourself on purpose?

118
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:33,993
We can find somebody
for you to talk to.

119
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:35,822
No, it wasn't that kind
of jump, I swear.

120
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,894
Marley, we're here.

121
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:39,964
Are you a runaway bride?

122
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,105
Divorcée. Just finalized it.

123
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:45,763
I'm having a divorce party to
ring in my good riddance era.

124
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,903
Yeah, you are!

125
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,354
I was tossing my ring into Lake Union
when I remembered how expensive it was.

126
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,528
We tried to stop her,
but we didn't make it in time.

127
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,047
We had a few
celebratory mimosas.

128
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,256
- Oh, I can make more.
- Yeah!

129
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,810
- They were my bridal party.
- Now we're her divorce party.

130
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,020
Yeah! Yeah!

131
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:01,986
Okay, let's go to Trauma 3.

132
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,884
- Okay. Not you.
- Let's go!

133
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,301
You take them to the waiting room.
No alcohol in the hospital.

134
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,165
This way.

135
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,443
So what happened to the case
you mentioned last week?

136
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,479
The patient's thigh skin graft worked
'cause it was thicker and stronger.

137
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,172
Are you talking about the thigh skin
or his new penis?

138
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,897
You know it's both.

139
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:19,072
Are we interrupting?

140
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:21,247
Oh, no, Dr. Marsh, please.

141
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,145
- Meet my former student, Dr. Evynn Moore...
- Hi. Pleased to meet you.

142
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,836
- ...and her lovely wife...
- Nice to meet you.

143
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,632
- ...Professor Tasha Lawson.
- Hi.

144
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,806
Nice to meet you. Urologist?

145
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:31,878
Oh, leader in
penile reconstruction.

146
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,018
She thinks she taught me
everything I know.

147
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,641
Child, please. You couldn't have cared less
about a penis before you met me,

148
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,436
- and you know it.
- She's not wrong.

149
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,990
Tasha, Evynn.

150
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:43,027
Good to see you again,
Dr. Webber.

151
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,686
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you too.

152
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,447
I see you already have
a general surgeon on the case.

153
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:53,658
Tasha's case is complicated.
She needs a real team.

154
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,281
On top of her bile ducts
being scarred

155
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,215
because of the primary
sclerosing cholangitis,

156
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,975
she has situs inversus.

157
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,011
I thought my sinuses were okay.

158
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:05,395
They are, babe. We're talking about
your abdominal organs being reversed.

159
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,603
Don't let her confusion
fool you.

160
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,882
She's a poli-sci professor
and the smartest person I know.

161
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:13,195
We might be looking
at hepatic encephalopathy.

162
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,370
That's why she needs
a new liver.

163
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,819
I need a new liver?

164
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,649
Yeah, baby.
That's why we're here.

165
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,929
Your liver's failing because
it's not draining properly.

166
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,861
Yeah.
But what about my sinuses?

167
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,139
They're okay, T.

168
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,142
We're grateful Dr. Fox got us listed here
and the liver's finally become available.

169
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,179
The Portland hospitals were
giving us the run-around.

170
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,284
You're with the best now, Tasha.

171
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,322
Okay, well then, I'd like Tasha's consent
to have her records sent over.

172
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,531
I already got 'em.

173
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,153
We've had issues
with hospitals losing things.

174
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,569
Dr. Fox always said we have to
take care of ourselves

175
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,433
- 'cause no one else cares as much.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:47,644
- Okay, let's get started then.
- Okay, I'll see you soon.

177
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:49,853
Thank you.

178
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,032
Richard, where are you going?

179
00:07:56,377 --> 00:08:00,174
- Marsh and Grey, they can handle this.
- Evynn is expecting you.

180
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,142
I can go. He clearly
doesn't wanna work with me.

181
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:06,421
I know Meredith prefers to keep
her cases close to the vest.

182
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,906
- I'll work with whoever.
- Stop. Everybody, just stop.

183
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:12,668
Do you know what happened to Evynn and Tasha
before they came here with us?

184
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,360
They were rejected by, not one,

185
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,433
but two hospitals that were
thrown by the situs inversus.

186
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,919
And when Evynn pushed on them,
they questioned her medical credentials.

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,405
They said whatever they could
to make her feel lesser, make her feel small,

188
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,649
to make her go away.

189
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,686
I promised them
top-notch doctors.

190
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:32,343
I promised them A-plus care.

191
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:36,520
Make me rescind those promises,
and you know what will happen.

192
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:37,901
Put it aside.

193
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:43,838
Okay.
Shall we go look at the scans?

194
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,561
It's good to be back
in the field, huh?

195
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:03,426
Yeah, I barely get out,
even near the hospital.

196
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:06,430
Well, that woman in the elevator could
probably show you around.

197
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,398
All right, she's...
Her daughter's my patient.

198
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:11,192
Not forever.

199
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:13,195
Yeah, well, we already
went out once. So...

200
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:16,302
And? What, you didn't vibe?

201
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:20,789
I think once is kind of
my max right now.

202
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,414
- You ever been divorced?
- Uh, no.

203
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:31,524
Okay, well, when a date finds out I'm divorced,
the conversation shifts.

204
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,112
Like she's trying to figure out
why my ex left, you know,

205
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:36,666
so she can decide
whether to cut and run.

206
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,703
Sounds like you just
haven't met the right woman.

207
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,189
Or maybe this is my life now.

208
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:42,604
If you want it to be.

209
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:45,226
But years ago I dated a woman
who was divorced.

210
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,953
And, you know, I had to wait a minute
for her to be ready for me.

211
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,230
But it was worth it.

212
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,956
You ever wonder
what happened to her?

213
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,718
She is at our house
running an intern retreat.

214
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,210
Hey, can you not stab me?

215
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:06,696
Molly sent me a picture of her toothbrush.
I'm trying to send something back.

216
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:09,457
Wow, you two
are terrible at sexting.

217
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,874
Yeah, don't care. I'll get the real thing
after she comes back

218
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,531
after breaking up
with her boyfriend.

219
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,328
She walked right by me.
Didn't even say hi.

220
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,949
- Bailey?
- Millin.

221
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,090
She owes Simone an apology.

222
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,059
- Do I even wanna know why?
- Mm-mmm.

223
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:26,337
Is this where the caffeine is?

224
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,063
Hey, good morning to you too.

225
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,169
Oh, crap, I'm sorry.

226
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,344
That's okay.
I accept your apology.

227
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,967
Let's forget about it
and move forward.

228
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,970
Does she know what she did?

229
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:40,489
Sorry I asked.

230
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,906
See, even you can say it.

231
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,945
- Who do you have odds on?
- Not us.

232
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:51,259
Okay, let's go, everyone.

233
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:59,127
All right, come on in.
Take a seat. Any seat. Let's go.

234
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,060
But don't get comfortable.

235
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,925
Today isn't about being stuck behind a desk
writing progress notes.

236
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:05,306
Is it about working
with patients?

237
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,240
- Or improving technical skills?
- Yes, and yes.

238
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:12,383
Today has been designed
by Danny and myself...

239
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,524
to help you become
better surgeons.

240
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,526
Why don't we start with an icebreaker
to get to know each other?

241
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,011
Well, we know each other pretty well.
Can we skip that part?

242
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,290
No, you cannot.

243
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,429
We're gonna break into pairs.

244
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,293
So, turn to the person
sitting next to you, and let's...

245
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:29,365
Or we could count off ones
and twos so we can mingle more?

246
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,092
Yes, that's an excellent idea.

247
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,510
- Let's start.
- Great.

248
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,970
These scans are
from three months ago.

249
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:51,145
She has some beading
in the common bile duct,

250
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:54,736
but the common hepatic vein should be
long enough to do a proper anastomosis.

251
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,841
Mm-hmm. Sure.

252
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,327
Previous stent is in place.

253
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,813
We can transplant the liver
at 90 degrees

254
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,850
with the right lobe up
to accommodate the situs inversus.

255
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,128
Mm-hmm.

256
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,062
We're going to operate together.

257
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,583
You're going to have to
speak to me eventually.

258
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,653
Hey, sorry, excuse me.

259
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,829
So, Valley Green Hospital sent
images of the donor liver.

260
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,658
Well, any strictures
or anomalies

261
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,386
that would prevent us from grafting the liver
at 180 degrees horizontally?

262
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:30,598
Uh, I just said we should transplant
it 90 degrees, so we need to discuss it.

263
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:34,084
I didn't think you liked discussing
medical procedures with me.

264
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,879
What do you think
that I've been doing...

265
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,710
I just... I just came to tell you
I'm passing on the liver.

266
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,195
Yeah, it's too big. I wanna hold out
for a better fit for Tasha.

267
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,059
They'll be disappointed,

268
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,441
but at least it gives us extra time to get
some updated imaging.

269
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:46,512
Yes.

270
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,384
Marley, I'm sorry that we had
to cut your wedding dress.

271
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:01,422
Don't be. I can't believe
I paid to have it cleaned and boxed.

272
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,355
When did I think
I was gonna wear it again?

273
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,944
Let me know
if you feel any pain.

274
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:09,397
All I wanted was a clean break.
It's such an ugly divorce.

275
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:13,952
Brad and I argued over every soup spoon.
And I don't even like soup.

276
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,436
It doesn't mean
you don't like spoons.

277
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,196
Okay,

278
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,060
you're feeling pain
at the thoracolumbar junction.

279
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:22,029
I think I feel a step off.
It could be a chance fracture.

280
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,927
Did she say a "France fracture"?

281
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,241
No. "Chance." Like you took a chance on love,
and it didn't work out.

282
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:29,657
It's a specific kind
of vertebral fracture.

283
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,419
It's hard to say. We'll know more
once we get some scans.

284
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,594
You said you wanted
a clean break.

285
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,842
- Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Grey.

286
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:42,602
That's Dr. Marsh, T.

287
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,018
That's... That's what I said.

288
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,537
Be right back.

289
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,090
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay. I'm terrible with names,

290
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,402
and I don't have encephalopathy.

291
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:51,714
Are you gonna get the liver?

292
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,474
So I took a look
at the donor scans,

293
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:55,442
and I think we should
hold out for a better one.

294
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,860
But it's a good match.
Dr. Fox let me see the scans too.

295
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,726
Okay. Well, in terms of blood work
and viral serology, yeah, it could work.

296
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,245
- But the graft is too big.
- We're talking about three millimeters.

297
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,214
I've read several case reports
of successful transplants with bigger grafts.

298
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,182
There's also plenty of cases
where it's caused complications.

299
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,841
Portal hypertension,
delayed graft function,

300
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,773
not being able to close up
the abdomen.

301
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,741
There are always risks.

302
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:20,674
Yeah. And I'm a transplant surgeon.
It's my job to minimize those risks.

303
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,090
Tasha is stable.
We should wait. We have time.

304
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:26,403
Every day that goes by is another chance
for her liver to fail.

305
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,267
We could wait weeks
for another match.

306
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,511
You may know transplants,
I know my wife.

307
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,548
She needs this now.

308
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:35,758
Evynn. Something's wrong with the phone.
It keeps buzzing.

309
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,001
Okay. I'll be right there.

310
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,246
You're supposed to be the best.
Make it happen.

311
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:42,731
Let me see.

312
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:46,872
Baby, it's just Minya.

313
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:49,254
Her and Bahr say "Get well soon."
See? They sent pictures.

314
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,429
- That's them?
- That's their kids.

315
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,742
It's your niece and your nephew.

316
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:09,481
Untying the human knot takes teamwork
and direct communication.

317
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,829
Ooh. Ooh. Adams. Adams, your elbow
is uncomfortably close to my testicles.

318
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,451
Okay, believe me,
it doesn't wanna be.

319
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,662
- Kwan.
- I'm communicating directly.

320
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,491
Uh, uh, step over my arm.

321
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:21,942
Exciting.
See, this is some untangling.

322
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,047
Honestly, this is a great
exercise that you can do

323
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,843
whenever you need a little
brush up on cooperation skills.

324
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,156
Well, we should be practicing
square knots, not human knots.

325
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,952
Can you turn right? Your...
No. Your other right.

326
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,643
- Oh, my right or your right?
- I can't tell.

327
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:35,265
Well, I don't know
which way to move.

328
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,026
- Can you turn under my arm?
- All right.

329
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:39,028
Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no!

330
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,546
Hey!

331
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

332
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,136
Okay. Good try.

333
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:47,623
Learning how to laugh
at our mistakes is also a part of this.

334
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,832
Next, we're going to work
on problem solving.

335
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,904
So pick a number
and find your partner.

336
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:55,423
- Oh. That's good. Here, I'll help.
- Oh. Thank you.

337
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:07,022
Spinal fractures just require
a brace or a cast, right? We googled.

338
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:11,025
Sometimes. Um, unfortunately,
yours is unstable.

339
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:15,512
We need to surgically place screws
and rods in your spine for support.

340
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:19,413
That... That sounds like a lot.
Are there other options?

341
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,830
Risking paralysis, unfortunately.

342
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:25,075
I was 23 when I married Brad.

343
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,490
I went straight from living
with college friends

344
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,010
to moving into his condo.

345
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,979
This is the first time
I haven't ever had to share a bathroom.

346
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,118
I finally have white towels

347
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,603
because I don't care
that they're not practical.

348
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,916
I'm supposed to be
living my best life,

349
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,229
not worried I'm never
gonna walk again.

350
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,851
You've got this, Marls.

351
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,372
You'll get anesthesia, much better
than cheap champagne.

352
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:47,924
It wasn't cheap.

353
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,306
Plus, this guy will be
taking care of you.

354
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:51,929
You're single, right?

355
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,035
- No ring.
- Okay.

356
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:55,967
I just got divorced.

357
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,935
We weren't thinking for you.

358
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,800
Um... We need to prep her
for the OR, so...

359
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,422
I will let you know
when she's done.

360
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,286
Okay. Oh, we'll be here
the whole time.

361
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:08,601
Don't be scared. Oh, think about how
you got the dog and Brad didn't.

362
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,607
- The scans aren't done?
- Almost.

363
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,126
Then why'd you page me?

364
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:18,956
Because we're working together.

365
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:20,785
I apologized to you.

366
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,683
I told you I hated lying to you.

367
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,030
Catherine was my patient.
What did you expect me to do?

368
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:28,275
- I expected you to tell me.
- And break every oath I've ever taken?

369
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:29,656
It hasn't stopped you before.

370
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,210
Hey.

371
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:32,969
Ndugu's picking up the liver

372
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,730
since he's already on his way
for the heart.

373
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:36,801
- I'm booking us an OR.
- I thought it was too big.

374
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:40,080
I can make it work. Her encephalopathy
is only gonna get worse if we wait,

375
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:41,598
so we gotta do it.

376
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,360
Scans are in. New labs too.
Let's take a look.

377
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,812
Okay, her biliary tree
is draining. That's good.

378
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,987
The stents still seems to be working well.
LFTs are elevated, but...

379
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,300
Not high enough
to cause altered mentation.

380
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,889
What if it isn't encephalopathy?
What if it's a stroke?

381
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,753
If it's acute,
we shouldn't do the transplant.

382
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:00,203
- We should scan her brain.
- We should consult Evynn first.

383
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,412
We don't need her consent.
She's in the scanner already.

384
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,518
Tasha isn't in a position
to understand.

385
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,279
We should talk to her caregiver.

386
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,695
Will you stop walking out on me?

387
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,560
You stop giving me reasons
to walk out.

388
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,651
Remember, the goal is
to build the tallest tower

389
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:21,102
that can support
a marshmallow on top.

390
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,243
Wait, is this one spaghetti
or two?

391
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,382
Two. I spilled water
on the blueprint.

392
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:28,074
Or should I say "Bluecas" print.

393
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,697
God.

394
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:32,114
Yeah, we don't think your jokes
are funny like Molly does.

395
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,218
We should've drawn a plan.

396
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,083
Well, ours is almost
as tall as theirs.

397
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,015
Yeah, and they're building faster
because they have a plan.

398
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,052
Okay, well, here's a plan.

399
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,158
Why don't you stop complaining
and stick more of these things together?

400
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,091
Okay, this is too wobbly. I'm...

401
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,783
It's made of spaghetti.

402
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,509
Okay, time's almost up.
You might wanna stop debating and...

403
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,821
Resolving conflict
is also part of this.

404
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:53,065
...figure it out yourselves.

405
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,825
Fifteen seconds.

406
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,379
We need to figure out where
to put the last marshmallow...

407
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,451
Why don't we just
put this here, like...

408
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,245
- I have it...
- Ah!

409
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,385
Should've seen that coming.

410
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:03,731
What's that supposed to mean?

411
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:05,560
It wasn't secure. So, it fell.

412
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,941
We built this together.

413
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:09,184
- It's not just my fault.
- Right, it's never your fault.

414
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,395
- Are you done?
- Okay, time.

415
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,328
Okay, uh...

416
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:16,848
We have a winner.

417
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,749
Good job, gents,
and, uh, good teamwork too.

418
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,408
I texted Marsh to let him know
that we're on our way back.

419
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:29,309
You ever consider using
a professional matchmaker?

420
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:33,106
I will be quiet.

421
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,178
- Stop! I need help...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pull over. Pull over.

422
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,732
Thank you. Thank you.
My dad, he's...

423
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,734
Just take a breath,
take a breath. Try again.

424
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:44,255
My dad, his bike skidded off
the road and it crushed him.

425
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,360
And I called the paramedics,
they're on the way but he looks so bad.

426
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,741
- He looks so bad.
- We're doctors. We can help.

427
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,986
We gotta be quick.
We got organs on ice.

428
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,507
Yes, they're doctors.
Thank you.

429
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:57,751
Okay.

430
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,304
We're doing
a father-daughter ride.

431
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,099
We do one state every year,
five so far.

432
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,963
- No problems until now.
- Carrie? Carrie?

433
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:06,932
I'm here. I'm here. These men are doctors.
His name is Arash.

434
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,072
I'm Dr. Ndugu. This is Dr. Warren.

435
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,625
His chest looks crushed.

436
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,627
Multiple contusions,
crepitus on palpation.

437
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,560
He must have an injury
to his lung or his airway.

438
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,804
How long until
the paramedics get here?

439
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:19,048
They just said that they're on their way.
You're not leaving, are you?

440
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,636
We got patients waiting
for lifesaving organs.

441
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,468
The heart's good for a few hours,
the liver even longer.

442
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,954
Okay, all right,
let's stabilize this neck,

443
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:32,579
- check the leg and go from there, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

444
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:36,340
Here we go. We got you.
We got you, Arash.

445
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,618
All right.

446
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,448
There we go.
Nice and tight.

447
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,208
We got you.

448
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,588
Tourniquet is on.
Bleeding's stopped.

449
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:48,108
When's that ambulance getting here?
Can you call 911 again?

450
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,378
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,650
His pulse is getting thready.
Do you see any more sources of bleeding?

452
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:54,721
- Is that JVD?
- Could be cardiac tamponade.

453
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,069
Dad! Dad!

454
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:59,174
Why aren't you guys
still helping him?

455
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,211
We have no supplies.

456
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:03,040
We've done all we can do.
Now we have to just wait for the paramedics.

457
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,730
But they're still
five to ten minutes out.

458
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,116
We've lost pulses.
Starting CPR.

459
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,258
Dad.
Dad, don't die. Please.

460
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:15,364
Breathing.

461
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:20,885
- Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:24,750
I reviewed your most recent labs.
Everything looks normal.

463
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,753
- Oh.
- Any pain or nausea?

464
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:30,758
I feel exactly the same way
I did when you asked two weeks ago.

465
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,932
Lord. Okay. No pain, no nausea.

466
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,313
- Happy now?
- Mm-hmm.

467
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,316
Where's the rest of your team?

468
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,834
We're dividing and conquering.
Nick is studying the donor liver.

469
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,252
And Richard?

470
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:44,530
You can't be mad at me.

471
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,670
He's upset because
I was keeping your secret.

472
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:52,262
You know, Evynn's first ever surgery
was on my service.

473
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:56,645
We were doing a hernia repair,
and I cut the vas.

474
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:58,440
It took me a moment to notice.

475
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:01,133
We repaired it, but later on, I found out
she saw it all happen.

476
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,998
She didn't say anything.
She was worried that I would be mad.

477
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:10,625
That's when I taught her to speak up,
to call people out, even me.

478
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,903
She seems pretty comfortable
with you now.

479
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,423
Maybe too comfortable.
She's like family.

480
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:18,184
When you nurture family,
when you train family,

481
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,324
the lines become blurred,

482
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:24,122
especially when they use the skills
you taught them against you.

483
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:28,885
It hits harder. That means
it takes longer to get over.

484
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:33,131
All right,
get your team together.

485
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,456
Hydrocelectomy consult.
Don't judge me.

486
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:51,906
I know I should be taking time off,
but that's how I cope.

487
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,737
You really are
Catherine's protégé.

488
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:56,741
When I was a resident, they called me Kit.
Like we were KitKat.

489
00:22:57,396 --> 00:23:00,123
Not that we'd ever call her Cat
to her face.

490
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:02,401
Tasha's scans
still aren't done yet?

491
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,644
Mmm, Dr. Grey didn't find you?

492
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,093
No. Is there a problem?

493
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,546
Uh, Tasha's tests
aren't adding up.

494
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:12,342
We're concerned that she's had a stroke.
Dr. Grey wants another MRI.

495
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:15,275
No. Tasha's already been through
hundreds of tests. We're not doing that.

496
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,900
Absolutely not.

497
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:19,660
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,388
She'd been managing her PSC
just fine for 12 years,

499
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,046
but lately, I'm scared for her.

500
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,703
I don't blame you.

501
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:31,395
Two years ago, she was accepting
the Margeaux Prize for Distinguished Faculty,

502
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,397
publishing her third book,

503
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,468
doing political commentary
for the local NPR station.

504
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:38,609
She's deteriorating
before my very eyes.

505
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:42,476
I'd do anything to save her.
Anything.

506
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:49,586
All right, no displaced
bone fragments or swelling.

507
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:52,278
No need for decompression.
Let's move on to fixation.

508
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,624
We'll place the first screw.

509
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,628
Now her vertebrae
will be bonded forever.

510
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,042
Better than being paralyzed.

511
00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:01,045
Yeah, well, she'll have scar tissue
and less flexibility.

512
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:03,185
Some unions are just not meant
to be permanent.

513
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:06,257
That's why I'm never getting married.
I mean, look at what you...

514
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:09,364
um, uh, a lot of people
have avoided.

515
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,745
I think it's best to say no,
no matter how many proposals

516
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:13,300
or rings are involved.

517
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,855
You spilled your guts to Wilson back then.
She had to talk to someone.

518
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:20,134
- You?
- Schmitt.

519
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,070
Okay, I recommend more work,
less chatter.

520
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:32,317
Oh, they're here, finally.

521
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:35,182
Swap out with me. Thank God.

522
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,461
- What's going on?
- He's got blunt trauma to the left chest.

523
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:39,670
No palpable pulse.
Let's try decompressing him.

524
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,707
- Here's a needle.
- All right.

525
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,398
- Dad! You have to help him.
- I'll grab the Lifepak.

526
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,712
- Can you get me an LMA?
- On it.

527
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:49,784
No rush of air. No pulse.

528
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,442
Still has JVD. I need a stethoscope.
Give me that.

529
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,205
Is he gonna be okay?
Tell me he's gonna be okay.

530
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,966
It's definitely
cardiac tamponade.

531
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:00,864
I think we should
open him right here.

532
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,244
- What do you mean "open him"?
- His chest injuries

533
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,557
have caused blood to fill up
the sac around his heart.

534
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:06,489
That pressure is keeping his
heart from pumping properly.

535
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,768
In the ER, we would cut open the sac
to relieve the pressure.

536
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:09,976
You want to do that here?

537
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,494
He won't make it
to the hospital.

538
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:13,255
Carrie, your dad is
moments away from death,

539
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,223
but we can do this procedure
right here, right now.

540
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,294
- We just need to move fast.
- You really think that this will work?

541
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:20,125
It'll give him a chance.
If they take him, his chances are zero.

542
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:24,819
- Okay, okay. Do it.
- Get a scalpel, OB pack and gloves.

543
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,649
Hang on, Dad.

544
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:31,135
- Silver Linings might be
my favorite exercise. - Mm-hmm.

545
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:37,487
When we're facing a challenge, this can be
a helpful tool to remind ourselves

546
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:41,869
how well equipped we are
to handle tough situations.

547
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,528
So, who wants to start?

548
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,496
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm?

549
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,638
All right, someone volunteer
before they're volun-told.

550
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:52,881
Um...

551
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:58,129
I-I was struggling to connect
to a gunshot wound patient.

552
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:01,890
But now that
I've experienced it myself,

553
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,891
I think maybe
I'll be able to help more.

554
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,517
- You were shot?
- Grazed.

555
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:13,971
- Kwan and I talked
a med student off the ledge. - Yeah.

556
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,872
It was a good reminder that we can save lives
both in and out of the OR.

557
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:21,151
- Uh, this ledge is metaphorical or...
- Hospital roof.

558
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:22,394
Oh.

559
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,326
Well, this is some heavy stuff.

560
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:27,158
Um, next? Uh...

561
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:31,989
Uh, yeah, I'm actually
feeling pretty great.

562
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:33,438
Oh.

563
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,546
But it's nice to have
a moment to reflect.

564
00:26:36,822 --> 00:26:38,065
Right.

565
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:42,034
Uh, I-I don't wanna do this.

566
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,830
Listen, this is a safe space if you have
an aversion to public speaking.

567
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:48,488
I, um, just don't want
to put a positive spin

568
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,353
on terrible things.
I mean, we lost a classmate.

569
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,666
- Oh, my God.
- She's still alive.

570
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,634
She-She's still alive.

571
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:57,290
She dropped out of the program

572
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,430
and everybody's acting
like nothing has changed

573
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,467
and everything has changed.

574
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:03,919
- No, Millin, that's not true.
- We're playing games.

575
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,955
I mean, these two are
making out all over the place.

576
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:10,821
Blue is texting his ex or his girlfriend
or whatever she is.

577
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:12,961
And you're only doing this
to protect yourself

578
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:17,276
in case another one of us
flames out or kills someone in the OR.

579
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:21,384
What's the point in team bonding
if we don't have a team?

580
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,318
Our team is broken. I'm sorry.

581
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,963
All right, almost there.
Help me retract the chest.

582
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,656
All right. When we get through,
I'll release the pressure

583
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:41,933
around the heart.

584
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:45,281
Wait, what is that?
What are you doing?

585
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:49,215
We're opening the sac around his heart
to get it pumping again.

586
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,286
Oh, my God.

587
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:51,978
You might want to look away.

588
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,051
Making the incision
on the pericardium.

589
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,709
All right, done. I see a small hole
in the heart. Give me a suture.

590
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:02,297
Wait, a suture? Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

591
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:04,817
I'm the chief of cardiothoracic surgery
at Grey-Sloan.

592
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,232
That means yes.

593
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,857
Just a quick
figure-of-eight stitch.

594
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,135
All right.

595
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,070
Warren, cut for me.

596
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:19,661
Bleeding's stopped.
Start cardiac massage.

597
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,286
Yeah, BP's coming up.

598
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:28,083
Does that mean you did it?
Please say you did it.

599
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,088
We got a rhythm. We did it.

600
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,164
Where is T's liver?

601
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:42,510
It got delayed.

602
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,547
What's taking so damn long?

603
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,067
The doctors transporting it stopped to save a life
on the side of the road.

604
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,965
You know I don't care
about anyone else right now.

605
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,416
Getting mad is not gonna
make it get here any faster.

606
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,384
Uh, Ndugu says that the liver should be here
within 30 minutes.

607
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,663
I stand corrected.

608
00:28:56,664 --> 00:29:00,529
- Oh, my God. It's actually happening?
- It is. Mm-hmm.

609
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,774
- Thank you.
- I told you it would.

610
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:07,984
- You gotta learn to trust.
- I know, I know.

611
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:09,537
Okay, I'm gonna go get ready.

612
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:11,610
Would you mind
if I watched from the gallery?

613
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:15,060
I just wanna see the first incision
so I know it's actually gonna happen.

614
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:19,203
Uh, um, I mean, it's not typically
how we, uh, um...

615
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,688
Fine with me. Absolutely.

616
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,310
- Thank you.
- Sure.

617
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:39,845
How is she doing?

618
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,330
Um, she's fine.

619
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,476
Okay, you want to
yell at somebody.

620
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,237
Yell at me. Come on.

621
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,619
Come on.

622
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:59,036
I know you're still angry
with me.

623
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,692
I never said that.

624
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:03,592
You don't think
I can see the anger?

625
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:05,525
The hurt?

626
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:07,666
The frustration?

627
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,634
Th-That's why I scheduled
this retreat.

628
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:16,640
I-I thought we could have a day
away from the hospital.

629
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:19,919
Polish up on some skills.

630
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:22,301
Have some fun.

631
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:25,200
Cook a meal.

632
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,239
It may be too soon,
but I had to do something.

633
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:34,762
Because...
I'm feeling all of that too.

634
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:39,559
You were right.

635
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:42,838
Your team is broken.

636
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,602
And I wanna...
I wanna help fix that.

637
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,710
Do you?

638
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,067
This is the patient
we called in for Beckman.

639
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:07,966
I'll get this liver to Marsh's OR
and then prep Ms. Ramsey.

640
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,728
Hey, great work today. I'll be sure
to tell Altman when I see her.

641
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:13,490
Thank you. You ever do
anything like that before?

642
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,319
Nope.

643
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:19,806
Are you sure you can't stay?
We planned a few more activities.

644
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,912
Listen, your interns have been
through way more than I'm equipped to handle.

645
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:25,087
What about all those
CEOs you helped?

646
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:28,607
There are psychologists who specialize
in workplace stress or trauma.

647
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:31,025
I'd go to one of them.
Good luck.

648
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,447
Silver lining,
the traffic should be light.

649
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,796
Thank you for hosting the retreat.
Your home is lovely.

650
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:47,489
Uh, the bagels were good.

651
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:52,218
Uh, yeah, no, I've never done
the human knot before.

652
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,462
Also, uh, honestly,
what Kwan said.

653
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:58,017
The bagels were fine. Go home.

654
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:03,851
Um, I thought we were going
to make a meal together.

655
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:07,509
Yes.

656
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,684
Yes, we are.

657
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:11,824
Okay.

658
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,863
It's not optional.

659
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,810
I scanned Tasha's brain.

660
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,397
- Meredith...
- Hear me out.

661
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:35,916
Her brain is atrophied.

662
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,920
The confusion, the memory loss,
the disorientation.

663
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,369
I think it's dementia.

664
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,820
I don't need to see it,

665
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:43,891
because I have these.

666
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,997
After speaking with Evynn,
I had some questions.

667
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:51,657
So I had Tasha's full medical records
faxed to me from Portland.

668
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:55,730
She was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's two years ago.

669
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:59,354
It's probably why the hospital's transplant
committee rejected her.

670
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:02,736
Evynn was mentioning
Tasha's recent accomplishments.

671
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,498
The awards, the books,
the public recognition.

672
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:08,363
It made me think of your mother.

673
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,195
Do you think Catherine
knows about this?

674
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:13,955
You think she doesn't?

675
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,617
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm pissed at Kwan's pile of onions.

676
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:26,929
We don't need that many.

677
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,036
The recipe said two,
so I cut two.

678
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:34,869
I'll take those.
Use them for the chili.

679
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,055
Oh, uh, I'll wash it.

680
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,057
I'll dry.

681
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,720
If you wanna visit her,
I have airline miles.

682
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:03,105
It might not be enough,
but you can have 'em.

683
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:09,111
Um...

684
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:13,081
I was trying to plan a visit,

685
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,084
but she said she needs space.

686
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,327
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,781
- Here.
- Yeah.

688
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:28,750
The surgery worked.

689
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:31,478
We were able to fuse your spine
and stabilize your fracture.

690
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:33,548
How long until I can walk?

691
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,171
PT starts tomorrow.

692
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,864
It might be painful,
but it's good for you.

693
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:41,142
You sound like my friends telling me
to get back in the dating pool.

694
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:43,663
Sometimes you just
gotta dive in, you know.

695
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:45,630
Right, sorry.

696
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:48,806
Guess what the Seattle
Fire Department found?

697
00:34:49,427 --> 00:34:50,807
Oh, my God, is that...

698
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:52,533
We got the box
at the hospital gift shop.

699
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:55,915
It's ready to sell, then Cabo.

700
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,746
Mm-hmm.

701
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,541
I'm sorry for your divorce.

702
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,199
Mmm. It's for the best.

703
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,614
No, I don't doubt that.

704
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:07,031
You were married, I'm sure at some point
you loved him and he loved you.

705
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,378
It's okay to mourn that loss.

706
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,865
He was an ass
from the start though, right?

707
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,833
Like really horrible.

708
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,732
He made you split the check on your first date
at that sandwich place.

709
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,493
He never remembered
your birthday.

710
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:25,082
He texted me the day of,
asking for gift ideas under 50 bucks.

711
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,189
He wore sandals at my wedding.

712
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,847
You don't need him.
We're your besties and your soulmates.

713
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:32,538
We'll trade off
taking care of you.

714
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,851
I'm this week. Get ready
to watch a lot of <i>Housewives.</i>

715
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:38,199
All right, um, check her labs
and write her post-op notes.

716
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,409
And, um, when you're ready,
Jeremiah's Jewelry downtown.

717
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,860
Pays good prices.

718
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,758
Thanks.

719
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:49,176
I always wondered
what happened to those rings.

720
00:35:49,177 --> 00:35:51,902
Yeah, two of the jewelers
let me return it.

721
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,387
The other guy was a jerk.

722
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,838
- Well, thank goodness for Jeremiah.
- Yeah.

723
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,187
Hey, for what it's worth,
I thought what you said was nice.

724
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:03,812
A friend of mine promised me

725
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:07,332
that if I took time to grieve
a broken relationship,

726
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,543
it'd eventually be okay,
and it'd eventually be better.

727
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,062
Yeah, sounds like a good friend.

728
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,585
Um, would you watch
Marley's post-op?

729
00:36:19,586 --> 00:36:22,037
- Yeah. Everything okay? All right.
- Okay. Yeah.

730
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:30,839
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

731
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:33,221
Jackie just fell asleep.

732
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,878
Does she need a procedure?

733
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:39,123
No, I was actually
looking for you.

734
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,020
Do I need a procedure?

735
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:44,921
No. I'm about to, uh,
transplant that heart I mentioned.

736
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:50,168
- Oh. - I wanted to ask if maybe you'd
like to have dinner sometime.

737
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,723
You know, um...

738
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:56,174
if this were a few months ago,
I would've loved that.

739
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,212
But Jackie knows you now and...

740
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:04,321
That just creates a set of expectations
I'm not sure you're ready for.

741
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:09,257
Okay, yeah. I...
I respect that.

742
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,295
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

743
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,649
Catherine.

744
00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:25,721
Aren't you two
supposed to be in an OR?

745
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:29,034
We had a few issues
to work out first.

746
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:30,415
Like why you lied.

747
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,658
I told you
I didn't want you to worry.

748
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,109
This is not about the cancer.
It's bad enough.

749
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,801
Now you're implicating
Grey and me in God knows what.

750
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,770
Fraud?
Falsifying medical records?

751
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,152
What are you talking about?

752
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:46,363
Tasha's Alzheimer's.

753
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,123
Her what?

754
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,573
Tasha has Alzheimer's.

755
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:52,989
- What?
- Evynn left it off the electronic records

756
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,680
she gave us.

757
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:58,650
No. She had me vouch for Tasha
to the transplant committee.

758
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,550
If they had known, they might've made
a very different decision.

759
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,759
Evynn played all of us.

760
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,004
Well, she learned from the best.

761
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:09,972
Where is she now?

762
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:16,945
Page Grey and Webber again.

763
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:20,361
- Hey, where you been?
- We need to talk.

764
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:23,917
- Uh, I'm just about to...
- I know. Stop. We need to talk.

765
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:25,954
Okay.

766
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:32,201
<i>They say patience is a virtue.</i>

767
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,378
<i>But it often feels overrated...</i>

768
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,521
<i>...especially
when we're in pain.</i>

769
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,354
<i>When we're recovering
from a fractured leg,</i>

770
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:49,770
<i>a bruised ego, a broken heart,</i>

771
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:52,013
<i>all we want
is to feel better now.</i>

772
00:38:52,014 --> 00:38:53,464
How are you still eating?

773
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:56,708
It's cereal.
It goes in a different stomach.

774
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:02,370
Now I know
where all our cereal goes.

775
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:06,408
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:10,894
Uh, do you...
do you want a drink?

777
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:15,590
Maxine's hosting canasta at our place
and it's kind of a lot.

778
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,626
Sure. Come in.

779
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:24,667
<i>We can look for
shortcuts to speed things up.</i>

780
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:27,394
- Is he still eating?
- That's what I said.

781
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,775
Different stomach.

782
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:31,432
<i>But more often than not,</i>

783
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:35,057
<i>it's best to let things
play out in their own time.</i>

784
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:37,681
Hey.

785
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:41,442
So, uh, dinner is
on the counter,

786
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,237
but you might have to reheat it.

787
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:45,239
This bedtime took forever.

788
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,761
Luna started crying and then Scout started
sympathy crying and it was...

789
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,108
What?

790
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,179
You are my best friend.

791
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,112
- Are you making fun of my hair?
- Will you just let me talk?

792
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:58,495
Okay, but can you make it quick?
'Cause I have to shower.

793
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:01,393
Marry me.

794
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:09,644
What's happening?

795
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:12,266
You said make it quick, so...

796
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:13,751
I love you. You love me.

797
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,823
And I know that it takes more than
that to make a marriage work,

798
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:21,483
but what do couples who have been together
for a long time say?

799
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:24,452
"I've married my best friend."
That's us.

800
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:27,455
It's been us.

801
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:31,838
Since you sprained your ankle
and I dropped you on Cannon Green.

802
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:38,742
You know? Since we stayed up all night studying,
eating Jimmy's cheesy bread.

803
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:41,778
It's been us since that summer
of epic phone calls

804
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:44,472
- when you nannied in West Windsor.
- Yeah.

805
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:46,474
It's still us.

806
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,685
You're my soulmate.

807
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:56,103
And years from now,
we'll tell our kids,

808
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:57,795
our grandkids,

809
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:00,177
that the secret
to our marriage...

810
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,421
is that we were best friends.

811
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,427
So...

812
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,742
- Josephine...
- Yeah.

813
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:15,503
Yes.

814
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:27,100
Sorry.

815
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,656
- Oh.
- Um...

816
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,761
Based on my experience,

817
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:35,798
it's probably better
if you picked your own ring.

818
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:38,526
Mm-hmm.

819
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:43,289
<i>It's usually worth the wait.</i>

820
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,655
- -

821
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,880
-
