1
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,288
Meredith: <i>Every time
a surgeon operates,</i>

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:07,101
<i>it's for the first
time all over again.</i>

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,125
Ohh! Wha... What
are you doing?!

4
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:15,540
Huh? I'm hiding from James.

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,921
I just saw his car pull up.

6
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:18,060
I thought you liked him.

7
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,791
I did. We had sex.

8
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:20,545
Oh. Twice.

9
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:23,963
And then I find his
wedding album. To Ryan.

10
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:25,827
I had sex with Ryan's husband.

11
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:27,449
- How did I miss this?
- This is not a problem.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,692
He is a man of God who cheats.

13
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:32,351
I'm pregnant with twins.

14
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:35,353
Hey. I... I can see you!

15
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:36,872
Can we talk?

16
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,184
- Whoa!
- Brought you tea!

17
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,186
Oh. I can't hear you!

18
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:41,912
Ask him if it's caffeinated.

19
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:43,637
Fine. I'll get
coffee from the cart.

20
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:46,192
Look, I know this is a lot,
but we'll figure it out.

21
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:47,434
We're gonna get a night nurse.

22
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:48,988
My mom can move in for a while.

23
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,612
- Where are we going?
- The other entrance.

24
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:55,132
<i>Even if you've done hundreds
of kidney resections</i>

25
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,547
<i>or heart transplants,</i>

26
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:58,342
<i>you've never
resected</i> this <i>kidney</i>

27
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,689
<i>or transplanted</i> this <i>heart.</i>

28
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,656
<i>Past experience usually helps,</i>

29
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:05,452
<i>but for unique cases,
you fake it first.</i>

30
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:06,833
No. Sorry.

31
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,179
Then who are those for?

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,801
Me. I'm going to put
them in the fridge.

33
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,148
I don't have time
to come back here.

34
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,528
Hope you made time for an EKG

35
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,703
after consuming 400
milligrams of caffeine.

36
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,705
I have taken two of
Yasuda's shifts this week.

37
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,328
Same. She and her sister
really appreciate it.

38
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,193
Well, not enough to share her
mom's cookies she sent her.

39
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,023
I'm just glad that Chloe
seems to be recovering well.

40
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,541
Woman: Excuse me. Have
you registered to vote?

41
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,302
- Already registered.
- Yeah, me too.

42
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,545
Same. Not my thing.

43
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:32,203
<i>You rehearse on replicas
for hours on end,</i>

44
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:34,550
<i>and hopefully when the real
patient is on the table,</i>

45
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:36,000
<i>you know what you're doing.</i>

46
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,209
Lots of people put
sex on the calendar.

47
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,073
Marsha: When you're
juggling two busy schedules,

48
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,696
it's perfectly normal
to schedule intimacy.

49
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:44,906
Okay. You schedule a haircut.

50
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:48,116
I do <i>not</i> want to have to
schedule sex with my wife.

51
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:50,221
Why do you think
this bothers you?

52
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:53,017
It feels like she's not
trying to fix anything.

53
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:54,570
You know? We are hemorrhaging,

54
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,227
and she's just reaching
for a Band-Aid.

55
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,402
So if I don't want
to fix our problems

56
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:01,405
the same way that you do, that - means that I'm not trying?
- No, no, no.

57
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,751
Unfortunately, we have
to stop for today,

58
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:04,649
but I want you to
see this through.

59
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,169
Have scheduled sex this
week and see how it feels.

60
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,552
It might not be what you
think. For either of you.

61
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:14,418
Well, I guess I'll see you
at 10:00 tomorrow night.

62
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:18,008
Um, would this be a
bad time to tell you

63
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,942
that I have to reschedule?

64
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,775
Hey. Haven't seen
you in a while.

65
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:29,605
I know. Yeah. Sorry.
It's been... busy.

66
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,367
Been meaning to give
this to you. Oh.

67
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:34,301
Yeah. Left it at
my place, so...

68
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:37,303
Yeah. Oh!

69
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:39,236
Mm-hmm. Ha-ha. Yeah.

70
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:42,309
I guess you <i>have</i> been really
busy. Because this is not mine.

71
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,587
You sure?

72
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:46,691
Yeah.

73
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,107
It's a really nice
color, though.

74
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,177
She has good taste.

75
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:50,902
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

76
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,285
Hey. You needed a consult?

77
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:56,011
Uh, I have a patient coming in

78
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,840
from Friday Harbor
with a head injury.

79
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,636
The local hospital's
sending in the scans.

80
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,086
Should I come back? No.

81
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:03,329
I was just leaving.

82
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,262
I'm gonna go.

83
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:08,644
Have the nurses page me
when the scans are in. Heh.

84
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,715
Hm.

85
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,617
Ben: Schmitt is with
Dr. Beltran today,

86
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,308
so <i>I've</i> got your assignments.

87
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:20,311
Let's do a lineup. A lineup.

88
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:23,004
It's something we did at the fire
station to get the day started right.

89
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:25,006
Discipline, organization.

90
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,111
Or you can stay exactly where
you are. That works, too.

91
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,458
So, Yasuda's out on PTO today.

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,323
But, Adams, you're with
Schmitt on Beltran's service.

93
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,153
Millin, you're
with me and Ndugu.

94
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:36,327
Griffith, with Lincoln.

95
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,743
Um, you forgot someone.

96
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,504
And you've forgotten
your dictations.

97
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,369
There are over 100 incomplete
records with your name on it.

98
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,992
Have fun staring at a computer
all day playing catch-up.

99
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:48,788
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Orderly to 6 East.</i>

100
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,066
<i>Any available orderly to 6 East.</i>

101
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,551
Are you lurking?

102
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,864
Okay. Your...

103
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,832
Your evaluation forms
were sent out today.

104
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,662
I know. Ndugu will
be the first one

105
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:02,353
who will officially assess me.

106
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:04,735
You know? How do you know?!

107
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,221
Um, you left your laptop open
on the kitchen counter today.

108
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,223
Hey, hey, hey.
You lurk, I snoop.

109
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:14,055
Okay. Just... Just...
Mnh. Just be yourself!

110
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,195
I've never been
to Friday Harbor.

111
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,369
I went on a field
trip in seventh grade.

112
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,199
We picked apples.

113
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,029
Hey. Today you are
picking up Ofelia Lopez.

114
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,204
She's 10 years old. She
fell off a moving tractor.

115
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,481
Her vitals are
stable, but she's got

116
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,138
a bad leg injury and a TBI,

117
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,863
so she needs a
higher level of care

118
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,382
than her community
hospital can provide.

119
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:33,557
I would go myself, but I
got a full patient roster.

120
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:35,352
I don't mind getting
out of the hospital.

121
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:36,905
- It's a nice drive.
- I'm sure it is.

122
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,079
But you're taking a helicopter.

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,701
No! Nice!

124
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,737
Taking an ambulance would
be more cost-efficient,

125
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,567
m-more environmentally friendly.

126
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,155
And it's not up in the sky.

127
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:46,639
Update me when you arrive!

128
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,957
Morning, Mr. Riley.

129
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,340
No, no. Left, right, left.

130
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,102
The <i>other</i> left, Kenneth. Ugh.

131
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:03,621
Instructions go in one
ear and out the other

132
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:04,967
with this kid.

133
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,555
Maybe he's missing
his director, huh?

134
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,074
He's missing <i>something,</i> alright.

135
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,731
Go ahead.

136
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,733
Uh, Darren Riley,
55, presented with

137
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,976
antibiotic-resistant
pneumonia with a concern

138
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,255
for a rapidly progressing
necrotizing infection.

139
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,119
Was intubated but
couldn't oxygenate

140
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,948
despite maximal
ventilation settings.

141
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,606
Placed on VV ECMO and
was extubated last night.

142
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,401
Mr. Riley's X-rays
from this morning.

143
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,610
Left lung's
completely whited out.

144
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,508
Winston: Let's order
him a CT with contrast.

145
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,338
Mr. Riley, I'm gonna change
your cannula dressing.

146
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,891
Well, I can take care of that
as soon as I place this order.

147
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,617
We'll just meet
you in radiology.

148
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,137
That's not necessary. I want
to help with transport anyway.

149
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,276
Oh, but we can handle that.

150
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:38,725
Moving a patient on
ECMO can be tricky,

151
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,107
so I'd like to be there for it.

152
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,386
Okay. Uh, great.

153
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,388
All risks and benefits
were explained

154
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,908
and patient agreed to
sign informed consent...

155
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,806
Hey. Are you okay?

156
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,326
Yeah. Yeah. Good.
Must have slept funny.

157
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:59,505
The patient was taken to an
operating room and placed...

158
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,301
Hey. Are you sure you're okay?

159
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,647
I could take a look if you want.

160
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,480
Someone get me a gurney!

161
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,603
Mr. Wheeler, how
are you feeling?

162
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,008
Fit as a fiddle.

163
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,267
Think I'm about ready to go home?
Not quite yet.

164
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,431
I saw some fluid building
around your heart

165
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,587
on this morning's echo.

166
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,775
It's a common complication
after heart surgery.

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,628
We might have to do a
procedure to drain it,

168
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,998
in which case we'd have to
keep you a little bit longer.

169
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,335
Oh, no. I can't stay longer.

170
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,843
I have to be home next week.

171
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,869
It's my 40th
wedding anniversary.

172
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,501
Congratulations.
That's a big milestone.

173
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:46,319
Hey, why don't we watch it and
see if it resolves on its own

174
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:47,962
before we jump into
a new procedure?

175
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,814
Macie and I got engaged
when we were 19.

176
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:53,955
She wanted this
big church wedding,

177
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,642
but our parents didn't approve,
so we eloped at city hall.

178
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:58,822
We know how that goes.

179
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,685
We wanted to get
married in the park,

180
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,170
but we wound up
doing it in a bar.

181
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,517
Every year, we recreate
our wedding dinner...

182
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:06,519
hot dogs from the
cart on the corner.

183
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,142
You know, we should go to
Joe's for our anniversary.

184
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:11,282
It's the only place we <i>ever</i> go.

185
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:12,974
Look, I want to run
another set of coags,

186
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,839
and we will take it from there.

187
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,807
Get her flowers
on your way home.

188
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:19,843
Works every time.

189
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,568
- Thanks for the tip.
- Yeah.

190
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,649
Woman on P.A.: <i>Dr. Horowitz,
6-2-9-6. Dr. Horowitz...</i>

191
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,987
Thanks for making the
trip. She's got severe

192
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,678
left lower extremity trauma,

193
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,508
extensive soft-tissue damage,
as well as vascular injury.

194
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,855
Suffered some head trauma

195
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,580
with multiple contusions
and lacerations.

196
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:36,169
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi.

197
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,999
Levi: Her respirations
look a bit labored.

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,793
Her sats were in the
80s when she arrived.

199
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,864
The oxygen's helped.

200
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,003
But you didn't intubate?

201
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,521
Our only ventilator's in use,

202
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,454
and we don't have the
resources to manually bag her

203
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:47,008
if we did RSI.Okay.

204
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,595
Nanette: We rushed her
here as soon as we could.

205
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:51,012
This doctor said you'll
be able to help her more?

206
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,877
Will her leg be alright? She
loves to play in the fields.

207
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:56,189
I'm Dr. Schmitt.
This is Dr. Adams.

208
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,227
We'll have a better idea - once we examine her, okay?
- Okay.

209
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,918
We temporized with a
splint and tourniquet.

210
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,646
Ischemia time is
about 45 minutes.

211
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:06,890
Um...

212
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,513
Hi. I'm Levi.

213
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:11,067
Your name's Ofelia, right?

214
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:15,313
My friend Lucas and I are gonna
help make you feel better, okay?

215
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,798
Okay.

216
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,732
Okay. This is my number.

217
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,699
We're gonna get to
Grey-Sloan before you,

218
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,391
so once you get
there, give me a call.

219
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:27,048
Wait. We can't go with you?

220
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,878
I'm so sorry. There's not
enough room in the helicopter.

221
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,950
But I promise we'll take
excellent care of her, okay?

222
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

223
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,761
Jose: We love you, <i>mija.</i>

224
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:01,254
We're gonna have to amputate the
leg if we don't get back fast,

225
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,256
so let's intubate
for transport ASAP.

226
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,430
Okay.

227
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:06,812
Back to the helicopter.

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,095
Dr. Kwan? Aren't
you supposed to...

229
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,993
Look, I know I'm
behind on charts...

230
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,443
and when I'm behind, it
becomes your problem,

231
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:18,927
and you don't like problems.

232
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,964
Uh, is that Zayne
from custodial staff?

233
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,275
Yeah, he, uh, collapsed

234
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,139
with a severe
abdominal and hip pain.

235
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,796
Mr. Johnson, I see you took

236
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,591
that whole rack down
with you. You okay?

237
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,455
Pain started way
before that rack fell.

238
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,008
I've been managing it
fine for months now.

239
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,458
Alright, well, we need
to get you to the E.R.

240
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,011
to get you checked
out. Hospital rules.

241
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,633
I'll just take something
once my shift ends.

242
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,808
Let me save you the trouble.
You can fight her on this,

243
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,466
but you will lose. We all do.

244
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,777
Can you make it quick?

245
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,124
I will make it thorough.

246
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,297
Come on. Let's go.

247
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,128
You too, Kwan!

248
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,994
Doctor should be in soon.

249
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,754
Okay.

250
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:55,136
We are never going to fit

251
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,483
four car seats in
either of our cars.

252
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,071
Are we gonna have
to get a minivan?

253
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:01,487
You know what's transporting
those babies right now?

254
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:02,971
Me!

255
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,836
Every horrible pregnancy
symptom, double it!

256
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,596
Twice the... the reflux,

257
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,150
the weight gain, the exhaustion.

258
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,635
And then after all that,
I'm gonna return to work,

259
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,016
delivering other
people's babies,

260
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,156
taking care of not
one, but two newborns.

261
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:19,022
But, sure, by all means,
you go test-drive minivans.

262
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:21,300
How can I help?

263
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,026
I wish I could tell
you, but all the energy

264
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:24,234
that used to go to my brain

265
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,511
is now being diverted
to my uterus.

266
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:26,822
You know what?

267
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,652
I really need this to
not take a long time.

268
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:30,136
I have a patient who is 29 weeks

269
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,862
and she's about to
deliver triplets.

270
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:34,140
Three babies. Hmm?

271
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,349
Could be worse! Heh!

272
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,730
You want three?

273
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,975
A Consult in the E.R.

274
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,701
Just go.

275
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,082
I'm staying for the ultrasound.

276
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,119
It's gonna show the same
as it did yesterday,

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,328
and then you're gonna smile
and say, "We've got this."

278
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,674
And right now I really...

279
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:54,092
I frankly don't...
really don't need that.

280
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,137
Did you play? Marching band?

281
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,345
No.

282
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,589
Cool. Me neither.

283
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,695
Oh, I didn't do sports.

284
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:12,972
But it's band.

285
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,732
Do they wear uniforms?

286
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,355
Then I didn't do it.

287
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,152
Oh. Damn it.

288
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,912
His lung is completely liquified

289
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,190
from all the necrotic tissue.

290
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,778
What's your recommendation?

291
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,883
Chest tube and change
the antibiotics.

292
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:29,678
Oh, a chest tube
won't drain this,

293
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,197
and the antibiotics
aren't penetrating,

294
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,580
so we'll need to completely
remove the source.

295
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,617
The source is his lung.

296
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,241
Book an O.R... I'm gonna
get him off the table.

297
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,382
Well, don't you want
us to get him...

298
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,556
Does he normally have to
do everything himself?

299
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:49,112
Well, he let me sew a patch
graft angioplasty once.

300
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,045
Maybe it's <i>you.</i>

301
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,809
Simone: When you say
it's "not your thing,"

302
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,776
you don't mean like
you never vote, right?

303
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,503
Like it's a recent thing?

304
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,437
What about in 2016?

305
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:06,232
What do we got?

306
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,924
Uh, Zayne Johnson, 32.

307
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,341
Diffuse pain, greatest in
his abdomen and right hip

308
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:13,205
after a supply rack fell on him.

309
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,447
We're still working
on his history.

310
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:15,931
Do you take any medication?

311
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,899
How much room do you
have on that thing?

312
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,971
I take folic acid,
hydroxyurea, ibuprofen,

313
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,283
and tramadol as needed.

314
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,974
- You have sickle cell?
- Yeah.

315
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,941
And I know about that new
gene therapy that cures it,

316
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,426
but my insurance won't cover it

317
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,186
and I don't have $3
million laying around,

318
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,774
so I still got it.

319
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:33,294
FDA approves a cure, and
nobody can afford to get it.

320
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,675
If I had three mill, I wouldn't
want to spend it on treatments.

321
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,988
I'd buy a boat and
sail around the world.

322
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,887
I was kind of in the middle
of another patient upstairs.

323
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,166
Yeah, I brought you
here for that hip.

324
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,031
The articular surface
is completely destroyed.

325
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,068
Griffith, take him
upstairs for an MRI.

326
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,277
And we should also
get an abdominal CT.

327
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,521
- No, no. I...
- Ah. It won't take long. Okay?

328
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,489
If there's anything you need,
you let these interns know.

329
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,698
Don't be shy.

330
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,083
Pilot: We've hit a
bit of rain and fog.

331
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,016
I'm trying to
steer us out of it.

332
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,604
Think about puppies.

333
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,677
Gravity blankets.
Wizards and adventure.

334
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:16,440
Well, either somebody died
or you're ghosting someone.

335
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,304
I am ignoring a mistake.

336
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,685
And don't look at my phone.

337
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,480
Is it the guy from the hallway?

338
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,860
So what? Does he hate dogs?

339
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:24,345
Puts the toilet paper on wrong?

340
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,863
Does he not know how
to cook a real meal?

341
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:27,865
Do <i>you?</i> I'm just saying.

342
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,316
Just because it's a bad match
doesn't mean it's a mistake.

343
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,042
You're right. It
wasn't a mistake.

344
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,699
It was a giant failure!

345
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, my God.

346
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,324
Her blood pressure spiked.
She might be herniating.

347
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,463
Okay.

348
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,915
Her pupils aren't blown.

349
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,400
Actually, they're pinpoint.

350
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,782
Her heart rate's in the 50s.

351
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,267
- Okay.
- Okay. We got you.

352
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,581
Okay. We got you. We got you.

353
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,723
She's diaphoretic, bradycardic.

354
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:58,896
Her eyes are tearing up.

355
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,933
We keep having to suction her.

356
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,073
Her parents said that she likes
playing in the fields, right?

357
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:04,592
The farm probably
uses pesticides.

358
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,076
Are you thinking
organophosphate poisoning?

359
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,526
Yeah. Let's get
her on atropine.

360
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,253
Okay. Oh. She's seizing!

361
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:13,911
Oh! Oh! Okay.

362
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,259
Damn it. The tourniquet.

363
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,536
Did it come loose?

364
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:18,916
No. The clasp is broken.

365
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,263
We have to stop this bleeding!

366
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:22,092
Holding pressure!
Yeah, I got her leg!

367
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,819
Find the atropine!

368
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,220
Hey, uh, Aurelio's
labs are back.

369
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,764
Okay. Great. Thank you.

370
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,680
Can I get an ultrasound and
a pericardiocentesis kit?

371
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:39,508
I just need to finish
reviewing these scans.

372
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,016
Teddy, it's still
a small effusion.

373
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,777
He's coagulopathic. I
mean, we can either do

374
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:45,711
the pericardiocentesis now or
we can wait till he crashes

375
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,575
in the middle of the
night and do it then.

376
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,128
We don't know
that's gonna happen.

377
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,750
Didn't you accuse me
of... what was it...

378
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,546
putting a Band-Aid on a
hemorrhage this morning?

379
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,134
What does that have
to do with this?

380
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,619
So now I am trying to
face this problem head on,

381
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,242
and that doesn't seem to
be good enough, either.

382
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,106
I mean, forget about
my years of experience

383
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,797
treating pericardial
effusions. Teddy...

384
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:06,732
Uh, I was just
getting a cup of tea.

385
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,596
Oh, well, um... Well,
we were just, um...

386
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,736
We were just
discussing a patient.

387
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,427
Look, I can give
it another hour,

388
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,705
but then we're gonna
need another set of scans

389
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,949
and a repeat echo.

390
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,296
Okay.

391
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,956
Oh, you should try
the Moroccan Mint.

392
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,787
It's very, uh...
refreshing. Hm!

393
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,964
Simone: What about
local elections?

394
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,658
State propositions?
Or public surveys?

395
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,557
I send those straight to spam.

396
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:39,972
Link: Griffith, what
are we looking at?

397
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,698
Studying his abdominal CT.

398
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,424
His hip MRI is about to come up.

399
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,908
<i>You can relax, Zayne.</i>

400
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,841
<i>Pretend you're in
that $3-million boat.</i>

401
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,292
That's not relaxing.
I get seasick.

402
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,879
<i>But you want to sail
around the world?</i>

403
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,606
No, but my son does, and
I'd do anything for him.

404
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:56,299
Simone: Is that his
spleen? It's so small.

405
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,784
Pretty much nonfunctional
at this point.

406
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,958
Also, those are iron
deposits in his liver.

407
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,512
Should we take care of
his gallstones, too?

408
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:05,308
The gallbladder wall's
not acutely inflamed.

409
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,483
The sickle cell has
basically ravaged his body,

410
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,036
including... His
hip, which you all

411
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,177
would have seen if you
noticed his MRI was up.

412
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,489
He's got subchondral collapse and
flattening of the femoral head.

413
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,835
We're gonna have to
replace the whole joint.

414
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,630
Oh, he's not gonna like that.

415
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,563
We don't have a choice... if
he wants to stop this joint

416
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,945
from completely degenerating.

417
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:28,503
Hey. Did you get the films
from my transfer patient?

418
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,849
Schmitt and Adams are
worried about the leg.

419
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,438
My fellow will need to take it.

420
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,681
Okay.

421
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:36,097
Hey. I took a look
at Ofelia's scans.

422
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,995
Minor subdural. No
swelling, no shift.

423
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,205
I'm not terribly worried, but I
will re-evaluate when they land.

424
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:42,034
Their ETA is 25 minutes.

425
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,311
Okay. I'm gonna
check on a patient.

426
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,519
Text me if they get here sooner.

427
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,211
Hey. A-About earlier,

428
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,040
it wasn't exactly
what it looked like.

429
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,662
Uh, none of my business.

430
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,871
Okay.

431
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,597
Lucas: The tourniquet's
completely broken.

432
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,081
I can't get it to
hold tight enough.

433
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,393
I'm gonna need another one.

434
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:57,705
Oh, it looks like
there's an injury

435
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,362
to her superficial
femoral artery.

436
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,018
There's another
tourniquet in this bag.

437
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,366
Hold as much pressure
as you can. Got it.

438
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,954
Here.

439
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,266
Alright.

440
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,720
Once we get a signal, we
need to update Beltran.

441
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,241
Got it.

442
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:19,934
Damn it.

443
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,246
It's basically beyond repair.

444
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,558
She's gonna need an amputation.

445
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,767
Well, we have I.V. tubing.

446
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,700
What if we make a
temporary shunt,

447
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:30,565
see if we can reconnect the
femoral artery with the tubing?

448
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,085
If the pilot is re-routing,

449
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,018
it's gonna take us a
lot longer to get back.

450
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,262
The tourniquet's been
on for almost two hours.

451
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,573
The leg looks ischemic.

452
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:41,404
If we do nothing,
she'll lose it.

453
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,237
Okay. Yeah. I'm in.

454
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,964
Okay. Alright.

455
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:56,522
So, if you take my lung, I'll
be rid of this thing here?

456
00:17:56,523 --> 00:18:00,077
Unfortunately, due to
your smoking history,

457
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,907
your other lung won't be
able to oxygenate your body

458
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,322
well enough by itself.

459
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,082
You'd have to stay on ECMO

460
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,464
until we can get you
a lung transplant.

461
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:11,330
Any chance that happens before
the NorthPac Band Review?

462
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,746
Jules: We don't know.
It could be tomorrow.

463
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,576
It could be weeks from now.

464
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,612
There will be
other performances.

465
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,166
I was thinking
about my alto sax.

466
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,135
First instrument
I ever picked up.

467
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,000
Thing was nearly bigger than me.

468
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:30,315
But once I got the hang
of it, I fell in love.

469
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:32,524
I haven't been able
to play in weeks.

470
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,325
What if I can't ever play again?

471
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,983
Or, worse...

472
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,539
what if I can't teach?

473
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,474
The band's more
than just my job.

474
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:54,167
It's my life.

475
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,413
Well, music and teaching,
it's in your bones.

476
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,347
Losing a lung won't change that.

477
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,694
Just might need a little
extra practice after surgery.

478
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,213
That's all.

479
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:10,355
Let's get you prepped.

480
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,327
Mr. Johnson?

481
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,018
Dr. Bailey and Dr. Lincoln
would like to talk to you.

482
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,503
I have to finish work
so I can get home

483
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,815
for dinner with my son.

484
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,404
Uh, your scans show
something called

485
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,199
avascular necrosis in your hip.

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,821
I'll make an appointment
to come back.

487
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,202
My son needs extra attention,

488
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,893
and my sister's had him all day.

489
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,895
Your pain is only
gonna get worse.

490
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,656
The sickled cells
in the joint cut off

491
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,899
the blood supply to the bone,
which is causing it to die.

492
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,970
But we can replace
the joint today,

493
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,214
and your insurance covers it.

494
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,871
And then I won't feel pain?

495
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:45,838
Well, we can at least help
with the pain in your hip.

496
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,530
So instead of curing my pain,

497
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,946
they're gonna let
every joint and organ

498
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,535
in my body deteriorate and
then they'll pay to fix it?

499
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:57,332
I know. It doesn't make
sense. And the system sucks.

500
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,404
Maybe I shouldn't
say that, but...

501
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,682
I've been through this before.

502
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,409
I know the frustration of
trying to fight a system

503
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,826
that doesn't care if you suffer
or even if you live or die.

504
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,242
They only see you
as a code or a cost

505
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,348
or some number in
a sea of numbers.

506
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,454
The system couldn't
care less about you.

507
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,975
But if you care about yourself,
you should get the surgery.

508
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,117
Simone: Think about your son.

509
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,603
If you weren't able to walk
or continue to do your job,

510
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:29,503
it'll be a lot harder
to take care of him.

511
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:41,412
Okay.

512
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:43,965
What's next?

513
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,071
I'll go tell Dr. Lincoln.

514
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,557
Don't bother. I'll do it.

515
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:58,492
Oh. Uh, I'm about to
meet with Balcom Medical.

516
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,868
You know, I've always
had a great relationship

517
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:01,968
with Ethan Chen,

518
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,131
so if there's anything
the hospital needs,

519
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:04,941
I'm your man.

520
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,701
Oh. Ethan is retired.

521
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:08,634
Oh. Well, good for him.

522
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah, the new CFO
is Erika Desai.

523
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,913
She is great.

524
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,984
But her husband Nirav's

525
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:15,675
also very prominent
on the board,

526
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:18,471
and he only hears what he wants
to hear, which is himself.

527
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:20,611
Ooh. It sounds like a
communication issue.

528
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,305
And he often overlooks
how hard I am trying

529
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,100
to make everything work!

530
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,034
And then he insinuates that I only
care about what is best for me,

531
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,070
regardless of what
anyone else wants.

532
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:34,177
You mean what's best
for the hospital.

533
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,766
This isn't about Balcom, is it?

534
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:42,910
So... you want
advice or a pep talk?

535
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:45,360
Is there one that's less
irritating than the other?

536
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:47,742
You've already been
through a war together.

537
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:48,950
You can do this.

538
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,228
That's the least
irritating one?!

539
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,577
Winston: Tissue's
very fibrotic.

540
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:57,407
Millin, suction?
Jules: Got it.

541
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:59,581
Ben: My mom really wanted
me to learn an instrument.

542
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:02,170
Then my fourth-grade class
got sent home with recorders.

543
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,896
My brother and I were
learning the accordion

544
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:05,760
- for a few months.
- Didn't stick with it?

545
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,314
Our teacher didn't want to be
paid in lemons from our yard.

546
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:10,523
I'm at the hilum.

547
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:11,869
You need more retraction?

548
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,080
That'd be great.
Harrington, please.

549
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,461
Ben: Oh.

550
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:20,188
Could you hold that
right there, Warren?

551
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,502
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you, Bokhee.

552
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,987
With all due respect, I
may be on a trial basis,

553
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:28,093
but I'm coming in as a
<i>fourth</i> year resident.

554
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,577
I'm perfectly
capable of retracting

555
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:30,992
and prepping patients
for transport

556
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,511
and moving them to the CT.

557
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:34,444
Hell, I'm capable of
a lot more than that.

558
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,447
Alright. Specimen.

559
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,761
Here we go.

560
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,463
How's he doing?

561
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,843
Simone: Feels like
this could have been

562
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:56,811
a much less extensive
surgery years ago.

563
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,917
Bailey: Well, seeking treatment
when you have sickle cell

564
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:03,473
is a minefield of stigmas
and misunderstandings.

565
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:04,646
That's not on Zayne.

566
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,096
Kwan, careful with the drill!

567
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:08,029
This bone is like stone!

568
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:11,446
You know... I'll take over.

569
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,001
Bailey: Oh, let him give
it another try. Go again.

570
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:15,658
Easy this time.

571
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:23,010
Put... Put the drill down!

572
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,667
Bailey: If he doesn't try
again, he won't learn.

573
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:27,842
We're not doing second
chances right now.

574
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,327
This man is in constant,
agonizing pain.

575
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:32,467
And I'm just talking
literal physical pain,

576
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,262
not the hell of
suffering in silence

577
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,368
because nobody cares
or believes in him.

578
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:37,886
It's the only way he can get by,

579
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:40,855
even though it causes more
pain and more suffering!

580
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,375
Damn it!

581
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,516
Someone get me a new drill bit!

582
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,312
Bailey: Are you done?

583
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,868
Yeah. Whatever
you're going through,

584
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,181
go through it on your own time.

585
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:58,700
We are taking care
of Zayne right now.

586
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,358
I cannot take care of you, too.

587
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:18,513
Suction, please.
Adams! Suction!

588
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:19,825
I'm trying!

589
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,516
I just have one more tie.

590
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,796
Oh! Oh, my God! Ohh! Okay.

591
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,936
Whoa!

592
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:31,906
Let's do this fast. Alright.

593
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:32,977
Okay.

594
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:37,118
Ah! Damn it! Can't
get it to stay.

595
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,292
Can you hold it, please?

596
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:39,707
Yeah.

597
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:49,786
Okay.

598
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,719
I think that's it. Okay.

599
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,618
Tourniquet coming off.

600
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,380
Okay. Okay.

601
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,212
It's holding.

602
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:03,835
We did it.

603
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,459
Ohh! What's happening?!

604
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,908
I don't know! I
can't see anything!

605
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,703
Pilot: I can't get
around this storm!

606
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:13,361
I'm gonna attempt an
emergency landing!

607
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,613
Macie. Macie.

608
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:25,373
How long has he been like this?

609
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,892
15 minutes. Muffled
heart sounds.

610
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,446
Low BP, JVD.

611
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,277
Cardiac tamponade. This is why I
wanted to do the procedure earlier.

612
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,106
He wasn't - this symptomatic.
- Alright.

613
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,901
We're gonna need to reopen
him and relieve the pressure.

614
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,041
We're doing a needle aspiration
bedside. We're already prepped.

615
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,422
It's much more
controllable in the O.R.

616
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:40,871
Macie: I'm his wife.
Let me through!

617
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,321
There's blood seeping out
of his incision already.

618
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:43,667
We don't have time. Scalpel.

619
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,911
I'm right here, dear.

620
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,500
Oh, my God! Whoa!

621
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:53,898
I need a crash cart! Prepare
for open cardiac massage!

622
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,941
Someone get her out
of here, please!

623
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:58,012
No!

624
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:02,775
I feel so... much better now.

625
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,777
- He's alive?!
- Aurelio: Ohh.

626
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:06,192
Owen: His vitals
have stabilized!

627
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:07,849
We need to get him
to the O.R. now!

628
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,540
What's happening?!
My husband's okay?!

629
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,646
It was a buildup of pressure
from fluid and blood,

630
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,648
but it was around the
heart, not the heart itself.

631
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:16,513
We're gonna know more when we get him
in there, but we need to move fast!

632
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:18,861
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go! Let's go!

633
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,968
What would you do
with $3 million?

634
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,832
Fund voter-registration drives.

635
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,834
How do you think the
system gets fixed?

636
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,353
Well, it's my game. You have
to spend it on yourself.

637
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,976
I'd hire an at-home nurse,

638
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,840
and my granny wouldn't
have to live in a facility.

639
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,704
Pay off my loans.

640
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:37,534
Start a maternal-health
nonprofit.

641
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:39,639
Boring!

642
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,780
Let me guess. You'd
buy an obnoxious car.

643
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,851
Oh, for starters,
I'd get my own place

644
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,542
so I don't have to live
with you fools anymore.

645
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:48,096
I'd travel, and, yes,
buy an obnoxious car.

646
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,649
Mm-hmm.

647
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,686
But if I had a curable
disease, you'd be damn sure

648
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,515
I'd spend every
penny to heal myself.

649
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:55,759
What's crazy is he
works at a hospital...

650
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,589
and he can't even get the
treatment he needs covered.

651
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,075
And he'd probably be a
great candidate for it.

652
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:02,732
It's out there.
It's available.

653
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,873
We have everything we need
to cure his sickle cell.

654
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,358
Everything except the money.

655
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,364
Jose: What do you mean
we beat them here?

656
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,538
- It's a three-hour drive.
- When the weather is bad,

657
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,230
they often re-route to
get around the storm.

658
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:19,852
And how much longer
until they arrive?

659
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:22,544
And is Ofelia still okay?

660
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:24,408
This doesn't necessarily
mean anything,

661
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,721
but at the moment, we've
lost contact with them.

662
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:28,758
No. No.

663
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,414
I'm calling Dr. Schmitt
and Dr. Adams.

664
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,900
We will also keep trying
them until we get through.

665
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,041
We trusted your team
with our daughter.

666
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,837
They promised to take
care of our little baby!

667
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,528
Amelia: I know that
this is terrifying.

668
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,081
We are closely
monitoring the situation.

669
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:44,566
Dr. Beltran has a whole staff

670
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,223
that is prepared to treat Ofelia

671
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:48,847
as soon as she arrives.

672
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:51,332
Come on. Let's go
take a seat. Come on.

673
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,897
Oh. Kwan, Griffith.

674
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,106
Yeah, yeah, sorry to bother
you, but this is important.

675
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,074
It's about a patient,
and it's urgent.

676
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,282
Can you page another attending?

677
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:12,077
We need you... or Dr. Altman,

678
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:13,457
but she's headed to
emergent surgery.

679
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,632
Our patient has
sickle cell disease,

680
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,945
and there's a new gene
therapy that could cure him,

681
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,326
but it's expensive and his
insurance won't cover it.

682
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:22,432
We know the hospital can't
treat everyone pro bono,

683
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,123
but this man works here.

684
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:25,642
H-He walks the same halls as us

685
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:27,264
and eats the same
cafeteria food.

686
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:28,645
How can we look him in the eye

687
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,129
knowing we're not gonna help him

688
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,442
just 'cause some idiot
suit in an insurance office

689
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:34,133
says we can't?

690
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,211
Doctors, these are
some of our partners

691
00:28:43,212 --> 00:28:45,317
from Balcom Medical.

692
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:47,595
These are two of our
surgical interns...

693
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,494
who I believe have rounds?

694
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,358
- We... We do.
- Thank you for your time.

695
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:57,501
His chest tubes are
putting out minimal fluid,

696
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,642
and he's stable on ECMO.

697
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,687
Yeah, he knew he was
sick for a while,

698
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:12,551
but he's been trying
to work through it.

699
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,346
He said if he's gonna drop,

700
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:17,521
he'd rather do it around
people than at home by himself.

701
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,489
And all I've done
since he showed up here

702
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,838
is give him bad news, and he's
had to take it all on by himself.

703
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:27,738
He doesn't have any family.
And his students can't visit.

704
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:31,501
So my personal interest in
providing Mr. Riley's care

705
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,229
has nothing to do with
anyone's capability.

706
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,369
I just don't want
him to feel alone.

707
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:42,201
So, um, Millin, put
in the post-op labs.

708
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:43,720
- Of course.
- Great.

709
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,998
Warren, start to
wean him off sedation

710
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:48,725
and extubate him when
you think he's ready.

711
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:52,729
You got it. Alright.

712
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,840
I...

713
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,534
Amelia: Anything new?

714
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:06,881
Just my increased
blood pressure.

715
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,434
They should've connected
with an ambulance

716
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,265
when they made it down...
<i>if</i> they made it down.

717
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:15,786
Hello?

718
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:17,098
This is Grey-Sloan Memorial.

719
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,720
Is there anyone
there? Come in.

720
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,867
I sent them. I specifically
sent Schmitt in my place.

721
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,800
I sent your nephew.
If something happens,

722
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,388
I'm gonna have to
call Schmitt's family

723
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:33,632
and tell them that <i>I</i> put
him on that helicopter.

724
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:36,290
And your family.

725
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,088
I-I just had to go to the
worst case scenario in my head,

726
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,641
and it's really hard not to

727
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,437
when they're flying
right now over water

728
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:48,474
and other things that
could spell disaster.

729
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,890
Well, I've experienced enough

730
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,721
that I <i>always</i> go to the
worst case scenario.

731
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,930
And sometimes you've just
got to accept the situation

732
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:58,553
at face value...

733
00:30:58,554 --> 00:31:00,867
so you can keep moving forward.

734
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,356
Hello?

735
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:07,048
His heart exploded, and
now he's completely fine.

736
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,782
That poor wife!

737
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,706
She was <i>covered!</i>
Covered in blood.

738
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,366
It was...

739
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,537
This is terrible! Ohh!

740
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,086
I can still feel it in my socks.

741
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,334
Ohh!

742
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:32,510
Ohh...

743
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,238
Owen, we don't have
to schedule sex.

744
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,240
Well, technically,
it's now our homework,

745
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,865
and I have always been a
straight-A student, so...

746
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:46,178
We're gonna get through this.

747
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,490
We have gotten
through a lot worse.

748
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,232
I'm not sure if you're talking
about Iraq or the kids.

749
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:55,635
Teddy... can I
take you on a date?

750
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:57,993
Somewhere that's not Joe's.

751
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,193
I'd really like that.

752
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:11,341
Is it over?

753
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:14,033
Oh, yes. Your surgery
went very well.

754
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,000
- How do you feel?
- Really tired.

755
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,519
Blue: The paid meds
are still working.

756
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,936
So, is this Zayne Johnson?

757
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:22,800
Zayne: Either these pain
meds are really strong,

758
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,216
or you're not Dr. Lincoln.

759
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:27,184
I'm Dr. Webber. I
have some good news.

760
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:30,463
There's a possibility you could
get sickle-cell gene therapy.

761
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,258
What? H-How?

762
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:34,329
We're doing it pro bono?

763
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,194
No, my partners and I at
Balcom heard your story,

764
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,885
and we'd like to
open a discussion

765
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:41,234
about how you can apply
for a grant we have.

766
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:45,547
I can't believe
this. Thank you.

767
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:49,379
Thank your advocates. They
really made an impression.

768
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,381
Okay. We're talking
about <i>that</i> later.

769
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:53,900
Richard: If you get to go-ahead,
we need to get you started soon.

770
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,730
This whole process could
take almost a year.

771
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:58,284
- A year?
- Well, sometimes as soon as eight months.

772
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:01,494
You'll get blood transfusions,
then you'll stay in the hospital

773
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:02,909
to collect your stem cells.

774
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,843
And after gene therapy,
you'll be given chemo

775
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,052
and kept in isolation
for about a month

776
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,985
until your immune
system recovers.

777
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,886
I don't think I could do that.

778
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:18,097
My son has special needs, and
I can't afford a caretaker

779
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,375
or to be away from
him for that long.

780
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,657
Okay. Um... Well,
you think about it,

781
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:29,315
and, um, maybe you'll
figure something out.

782
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:41,879
The system still sucks.

783
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,848
Yeah, if only there was
something we could do about it.

784
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:02,314
Monica: She's still
in critical condition,

785
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:03,798
but she should be okay.

786
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,282
And... And her leg?

787
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:06,594
We were able to save it.

788
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:07,974
She'll likely need more surgery,

789
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,597
but hopefully with
some physical therapy,

790
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:10,805
she'll regain function.

791
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:12,047
Thank you. Thank you.

792
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,290
Thank you. Thank you, Doctors.

793
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,981
Dr. Adams will take you in.

794
00:35:22,438 --> 00:35:25,337
Do you think peds
was your calling?

795
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:27,269
You know I applied
for the fellowship.

796
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,443
I don't mean your interest.

797
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:29,996
I've heard all
about your interest.

798
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:32,930
I mean, do you truly believe

799
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,622
that it's what
you're meant to do?

800
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:39,489
When I was a kid, I was
obsessed with helicopters,

801
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,180
so for my fifth birthday,

802
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,046
my mom splurged on an
aerial tour of Seattle.

803
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,703
Got to take pictures
with the pilot,

804
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:49,361
put on the cool headphones.

805
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:52,226
Then we got up in the
air, and I freaked out.

806
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,539
I rode the entire trip
with my eyes closed.

807
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,061
That was my only helicopter
ride until today.

808
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,204
I pretended to nap the
whole way to Friday Harbor,

809
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,897
but on the way back, when
she started to deteriorate,

810
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:12,349
all I could think
about was Ofelia.

811
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,351
Even when we were going
down in the storm,

812
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,595
I only wanted to keep her safe.

813
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:20,219
I <i>know</i> peds is my calling...

814
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,741
but I don't know how to
prove that to everyone else.

815
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:27,053
Well, I've never
been more certain

816
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,228
that a resident belongs in peds.

817
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:33,578
I want to help.

818
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:36,062
I think that ship has sailed.

819
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,857
Hm. For now.

820
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:39,480
But I have a lot of friends

821
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:41,413
who got their fellowship
after doing research.

822
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:44,070
And I have a colleague in Texas

823
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,418
who's looking for help
with a clinical trial.

824
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,593
You interested?

825
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,907
Sure. Great.

826
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:56,290
'Cause I already told him you'd
call him to schedule something.

827
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,292
You know more than
you think, Schmitt.

828
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:01,260
Trust yourself.

829
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,546
Check on Mr. Riley?

830
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:13,099
Yeah, he's stable for now.

831
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,929
I asked the nurse to let us
know if anything changes.

832
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,759
Alright. Thanks. If it
does, I'll handle it.

833
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,244
Not because you can't.

834
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:21,729
I'll just be across the
street at Joe's, so...

835
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,558
Are you meeting folks?

836
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,940
No. Just, uh,
grabbing some dinner.

837
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:28,287
Maybe watch the game.

838
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,116
I like the noise.

839
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,601
You ready?

840
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:33,775
I just told Tuck to put
the casserole in the oven

841
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:37,296
and Pru to clean
up her Play-Doh.

842
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,919
Actually, I think
I'm gonna head over

843
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,300
to Joe's with Ndugu.

844
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,302
Oh, I don't want to go to Joe's.

845
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,269
Well, it's a good thing
you weren't invited.

846
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,788
Have a nice time.

847
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:49,584
I'll see you at home.

848
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,310
Meredith: <i>The old
saying goes...</i>

849
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,933
<i>fake it till you make it.</i>

850
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,798
<i>Because sometimes pretending
you have confidence</i>

851
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,766
<i>helps you find the real thing.</i>

852
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,354
Okay.

853
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:06,636
You can go home. I can
stay and monitor Ofelia.

854
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,603
Are you still avoiding that guy?

855
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:10,812
Just because we shared
a near-death experience

856
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,331
doesn't mean I
have to answer you.

857
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,816
Sure, but he's following us.

858
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:17,992
- Oh, God.
- Hey, Levi. Hi. Can we talk?

859
00:38:17,993 --> 00:38:20,339
I know about Ryan.

860
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,789
Okay.

861
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,101
I thought what we had was real,

862
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,447
something deep.

863
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:26,897
I'm sorry I didn't say anything.

864
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:28,796
I'm sure you are.

865
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,970
It's hard to know
when to tell people

866
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,627
about your dead husband.

867
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,353
What?

868
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,182
Oh, I d... I didn't realize.

869
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:37,529
I'm so sorry.

870
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,531
It'll be four years this summer.

871
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,981
Um, I just haven't done a
lot of dating since then,

872
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,327
so this is all new to me.

873
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:45,019
Yeah, yeah.

874
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,676
Wait. Did you think
I was cheating?

875
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:48,194
No! No.

876
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,300
I m... I mean, may...
maybe a little bit.

877
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:55,271
I think what we have is real.

878
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:58,342
Okay? You're kind
of the best thing

879
00:38:58,343 --> 00:39:00,898
that's happened to me
in a really long time.

880
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:04,590
<i>When it doesn't work,</i>

881
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:06,558
<i>when life doesn't
give us second chances</i>

882
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,905
<i>or dress rehearsals...</i>

883
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:11,424
<i>you can walk away...</i>

884
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,703
<i>or you can go all-in.</i>

885
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:17,361
Hey. Ofelia's vascular
checks look good.

886
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:19,087
Mm. Nice.

887
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,537
Yeah.

888
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,574
Thanks for your help today.

889
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,576
I just did a neuro exam.

890
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,889
No, I was freaking out,
and you calmed me down.

891
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,408
Oh.

892
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,858
I'm being genuine!

893
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,998
No, I... It's not
you. It's the irony...

894
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,620
that you would see if
you knew me better.

895
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,865
Listen. The thing
with Ndugu...

896
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:40,488
It's just casual. We were just
going through something similar.

897
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:43,422
You don't owe me an
explanation. Really.

898
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,044
You and I are good.

899
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,574
Good night.

900
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:49,084
<i>We tell ourselves we don't care.</i>

901
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,879
Hey! Hey.

902
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,434
Ultrasound showed two
strong heartbeats.

903
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,608
Equal fluid level.

904
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:58,195
DeLuca saw nothing
to worry about.

905
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:01,267
Great.

906
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:05,133
I'm sorry.

907
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,517
I was so freaked out over
one baby, and now it's...

908
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:11,623
And I'm exhausted.
You know, I worked

909
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:13,417
20 hours straight last week.

910
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:16,662
I delivered eight
babies with no caffeine.

911
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:18,906
I told you you should
rest after that.

912
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:20,908
Are you mad at me?

913
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:27,328
You... locked me out of
your car this morning.

914
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,675
You kicked me out of the
ultrasound appointment.

915
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,091
I didn't kick you out. I...

916
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:35,198
I was overwhelmed and hormonal.

917
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,993
This is a high-risk pregnancy!

918
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:39,961
The odds of making it full
term with two healthy babies?!

919
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:41,480
I'm scared!

920
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,482
Yeah, and you think I'm
just worried about cars?

921
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,484
No, I d... I'm scared
out of my mind!

922
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,763
I'm scared for them.
I'm scared about you.

923
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:53,354
We're supposed to be partners.

924
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:56,668
If we're falling apart just
<i>thinking</i> about having twins,

925
00:40:56,669 --> 00:40:58,462
what's gonna happen when
we actually have them?

926
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:09,611
<i>We can try to hide
our doubts and fears.</i>

927
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,838
<i>Or we can accept the unknown...</i>

928
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,736
What's this?

929
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:32,151
<i>And dive in.</i>

930
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:48,237
I've had... an
extremely long day.

931
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:52,033
I just wanted to
end it with you.

932
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,794
And a real meal.

933
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:55,485
Mm-hmm.

934
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:56,827
Are you hungry?

935
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:58,025
Starving.

936
00:42:01,658 --> 00:42:03,625
<i>The real thing is better anyway.</i>
