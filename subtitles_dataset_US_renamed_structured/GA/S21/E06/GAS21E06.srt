1
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,742
Meredith:
<i>Despite its complexity,</i>

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:09,152
<i>the human brain can only focus
on about one thing at a time.</i>

3
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,979
How about we share the pâté?

4
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,481
Teddy, I thought we said
no screens.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,816
I'm sorry. It is my last
CABG patient,

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,953
and the nurses
needed an order for a bolus.

7
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:20,421
Maybe use an intern.
Tell them to call... Beckman!

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,291
Well, she is my patient.

9
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:24,259
Hunt.
Oh!

10
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:26,427
- Altman. - How are you?
- Hi.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,998
David, hi. Of course, you
remember my incredible wife, Cass.

12
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,901
We met at that boring
dinner last year. Right.

13
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,603
That might have been the last time
we had a sit-down dinner together.

14
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,471
It might be.

15
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,275
Oh, there's a trauma coming.
Oh, yeah. Multiple victims.

16
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,742
Including this dinner.

17
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,012
Um. Hey, wait.
Listen, why don't you two stay?

18
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,948
At least somebody
can have fun. Oh...

19
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:47,316
Please, take my seat.

20
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,018
Um...

21
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:53,188
Why not? Sure. Yeah.
Of course. Please.

22
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,990
What?
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,824
Meredith: <i>Mono-tasking
reduces distraction,</i>

24
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,826
<i>sharpens attention,
and allows us</i>

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,429
<i>to operate at peak performance.</i>

26
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,934
Meredith: <i>But surgical residents
don't have that luxury.</i>

27
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:08,469
<i>One thing? Try 30.</i>

28
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,006
Luna's fever's still 100,

29
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,507
but thankfully,
Scout has taken some Pedialyte,

30
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,311
so that's something.

31
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:19,348
Maybe I should call
and tell him I can't make it in.

32
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,316
You think I can't handle
two sick kids?

33
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,552
You're on call. Go.

34
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,326
I thought I was charging
my computer.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,028
Yeah, my phone was at 2%.

36
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,230
So you couldn't have used
one of the other 50 chargers

37
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,165
we have in the house?

38
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:40,668
Next time, I'll ignore
the vomiting kid to go find one.

39
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,306
Can you move your bag?
I'm trying to clean.

40
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,883
Meredith: <i>They order labs,
dictate notes, take vitals,</i>

41
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,752
<i>check drains,</i>

42
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,587
<i>make split second-decisions
while on the move.</i>

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,223
<i>It's chaos.</i>

44
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,825
Fresh from the warmer.

45
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,894
Chloe, how are you feeling?

46
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,596
Like I got chemo today.

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,198
Hopefully you'll feel
a little better

48
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,234
after a night's sleep.

49
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,369
Thank you.
Yeah.

50
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,271
I brought one for you, too.

51
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,407
Thanks.

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,608
I'm not sure who's more tired,
her or me.

53
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,543
You have been working a lot.

54
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,446
Yeah, well, making up
for the time I took off.

55
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,449
Thanks for that, too.

56
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,583
I'll swing by in a bit.

57
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,852
And you had better
be sleeping. Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,890
She's quality.

59
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,591
Shut up.

60
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,560
Meredith:
<i>But a brain can adapt</i>

61
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,898
<i>and thrive in just
about anything, even chaos.</i>

62
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:46,301
Hey. I thought you were
on trauma tonight.

63
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,602
I am, but I've been playing
chess with Ophelia,

64
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,604
and it was my turn,
so I came to check in.

65
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,607
Her leg looks good. Yeah.
Her parents are on their way.

66
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,211
I heard it's pretty backed up, but
hopefully she gets moved into rehab tonight.

67
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,547
Yeah, she told me
at least five times.

68
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,949
I said I'd come by and
see her again before she goes.

69
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,751
She's very excited. Hey,
speaking of excitement,

70
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,620
I heard you got the research
position with Wilkinson. Congrats.

71
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,957
Oh, I, um, I haven't
officially accepted yet.

72
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,959
That's smart.
Take your time deciding.

73
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,495
You think that I shouldn't take
it? You told me about it.

74
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,097
No, no,
it's a great opportunity.

75
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,433
It just... It doesn't guarantee
a peds fellowship.

76
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,402
So I don't want you
to feel resentful

77
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,603
if you spend a year in Texas
and it doesn't work out.

78
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,805
Um...

79
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,475
It's Webber.

80
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,910
Um, if you were me,
would you take it?

81
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,913
Yeah.
But I really love Tex-Mex.

82
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,122
Hey.
I heard you're going home.

83
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,090
Yeah, yeah,
I hit my 80 hours this week,

84
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:43,858
so Bailey tagged me out.

85
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,927
I'm just gonna crash
in an on-call room.

86
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:49,097
E.R. consults... drunk guy
with an arm lac,

87
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:54,302
drunk guy with a head lac,
and drunk guy just drunk.

88
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:55,437
You can pick first.

89
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,671
Have fun.
Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,274
I'll catch you
in the morning, yeah?

91
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:00,774
Yeah. Love you.

92
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:08,883
Did that just happen?

93
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,784
It's on replay in my head.

94
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,197
Was I hearing things,
or were you listening to

95
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,999
the "Final Fantasy" theme
yesterday?

96
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,535
Good ear. Yes.

97
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,638
I love how the instrumentation
gives the franchise

98
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,673
that bright, regal feel.

99
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,076
How we doing, maestro?

100
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,079
Oh, teaching Dr. Millin
the joy of orchestration.

101
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:40,649
Can you keep a beat,
Dr. Ndugu? Of course.

102
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,984
I'm a heart surgeon.

103
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,920
How's he doing? Uh,
hemodynamically normal,

104
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,887
except for the past hour.

105
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,191
He's a little bit tachycardic,
in the low hundreds.

106
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,060
Chest tube put out 50 CCs
overnight.

107
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:57,532
I did walk to a chair today,
but I can also use a new lung.

108
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,169
Well, how about
I go get you one?

109
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,572
Don't play with me, now.

110
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,373
I'm going right now
to procure it.

111
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,875
Dr. Millin will take care
of you until I get back.

112
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,844
Let's, uh, see how his heart
rate does on a 500 CC bolus.

113
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:14,015
And call me if you need me. You
got the whole floor tonight, okay?

114
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,117
Rest up. Okay?
I'll be back.

115
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,256
Am I in trouble?

116
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,858
We know about the peds
research position in Texas.

117
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,795
They called to get a letter
of good standing.

118
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,863
Oh.

119
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,200
Um, I was going to tell you.

120
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,802
Well, actually, we're glad
they gave us a heads-up.

121
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,305
We'd like to extend
an offer, as well.

122
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,807
General surgery attending.

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,976
I mean, you'd have to
finish your residency,

124
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,810
but we wanted
to let you know now

125
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,679
while you're making
this decision. Okay.

126
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,985
Most attendings start
at this salary,

127
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,153
but there's room to negotiate.

128
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,055
Mm-hmm.

129
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,790
Uh, plus, there's seed money
for research,

130
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,395
a signing bonus, healthy
student loan repayment.

131
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:03,665
I, uh, I... I really
wasn't expecting this.

132
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,899
Um...

133
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,436
I'm not sure what to say.

134
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,803
Think about it.

135
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,440
Uh, better yet,
let's try it out.

136
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:14,242
You're on my service tonight

137
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:16,177
but as the attending.

138
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,448
Yeah? Okay. Let's go.

139
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,254
Oh, hey. My last surgery
pushed until tomorrow.

140
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,756
How's Scout?

141
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,691
Still sick.
He threw up on his bed.

142
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,360
Oh, poor thing. He
seemed better when I left.

143
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,296
I meant Jo.
I'm going to go pick him up.

144
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,264
That'd be great. Yeah.
Okay.

145
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,099
Oh, but don't tell Jo
I said that.

146
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,701
She's trying to do it all.

147
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,303
Okay. Yeah.

148
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,308
Woman: <i>Doctors Luke to the E.R.
Doctors Tommy and Martha Luke.</i>

149
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,511
What if I say it again but give
him more time to say it back?

150
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:52,047
Uh, I don't think lack of time
is the problem.

151
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,149
Is it going to be weird now?

152
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:59,354
Well, you told him you loved him
at work and he left you hanging.

153
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,556
Yes is my answer.
I hate everything.

154
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,458
Except Adams.

155
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,026
Kwan, Griffith,
finish up and let's go.

156
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,995
Multiple traumas arriving.

157
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,063
Uh, you go ahead first.
I'll catch up.

158
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,130
Okay.

159
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:11,700
Love you.

160
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:15,370
Woman: <i>Dr. Laura to the NICU.
To the NICU.</i>

161
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,207
Looks like someone
promoted themselves.

162
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,077
Webber and Bailey offered me
an attending position.

163
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,012
What?
That's amazing.

164
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,147
Did they say anything about me?

165
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,416
Well, it was an early offer
because they know about Texas.

166
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,205
I'm just doing a trial run
tonight.

167
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,084
Where do I apply for a crappy
research job that I can leverage?

168
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:35,611
Well, it's clinical research.
I'd be with peds patients.

169
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,726
And how does James feel
about you chasing

170
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,094
your peds dreams in Texas?

171
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,029
I'm not sure.

172
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,231
He got paged to a code
after I told him,

173
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,200
and that was the last time
we talked.

174
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,735
I-I-I don't even know what
I'm going to do yet.

175
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,503
Well, you got two job offers
and a boyfriend.

176
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,338
You get zero sympathy.

177
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,741
Blue: Trauma's here.

178
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:57,212
Monica: Schmitt!
Schmitt! Oh, he's with me.

179
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,580
Official business.

180
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,017
Navy scrubs. Kind of bold.
Isn't it?

181
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,786
Should I go change?

182
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,455
Scaffolding collapsed
at a concert venue.

183
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,859
17-year-old female, GCS 15,
unstable pelvis.

184
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,061
Binder was placed at the scene.
Vitals are stable.

185
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,729
Given four milligrams
of morphine en route.

186
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,431
I'm Dr. Beltran.
Can you tell me your name?

187
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:18,633
Joni. But where's Vaughn?
He was onstage.

188
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,602
We'll find him for you.
He's your friend?

189
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,704
My boyfriend.
And incredibly talented.

190
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,472
Let's get her to trauma three.

191
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:25,974
Okay, Schmitt,
whatever's in this rig,

192
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,642
we're following your lead.
Alright, let's go.

193
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,711
If you're giving
away promotions,

194
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,864
can I be a fifth-year?
What do you think?

195
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,649
19-year-old male.
Penetrating abdominal injury

196
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,584
after a fall from
a two-story scaffolding.

197
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:39,220
GCS 15.
Systolic in the low 100s.

198
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,989
Received two liters of fluid.

199
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,458
Well, that's going to be tricky.
Trauma one.

200
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,826
Get him inside.
Let's go.

201
00:08:58,652 --> 00:08:59,920
Oh...

202
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:02,613
I don't know what I want.

203
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,864
Thank goodness no one's asking.

204
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,153
Do you know what panisse is?
It comes with the lamb.

205
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,155
No, um, I don't. Do you
want me to look it up?

206
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:12,925
No.
If it was any good,

207
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:15,092
they'd probably be more upfront
about it on the menu.

208
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,795
Honestly, I think the best meal
I've ever had is when

209
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,098
Owen and I shared a can of
refried beans on flatbread.

210
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,201
During the Great Depression?

211
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,336
We served in the Army.

212
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:28,039
It turns out, everything tastes
better after military rations.

213
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,041
You were in the military?

214
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,976
Yeah, that's where we met. Wow.

215
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,545
You just look so poised
and put together

216
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,181
in your boss-lady heels.
Who knew?

217
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:40,184
Thanks. I would prefer
a t-shirt and combat boots,

218
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:44,789
and I would take a burger
over this menu any day.

219
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,158
Do you want to ditch this place
and go somewhere

220
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,962
that serves fries
instead of pomme frites?

221
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,129
Yes. Please.
Oh, great.

222
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,566
Wonderful.

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,401
Okay,
just take a little... No?

224
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,337
No.
Just a little sip?

225
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,305
Good job, good job, good.

226
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,241
"Great job.
You did so"...

227
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:07,678
Hey.
Hey.

228
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:10,181
Oh, wow, I thought that you
had a late surgery. Mommy!

229
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:13,251
Um, wait, did Link tell you
to come rescue me?

230
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:18,055
Uh, I was gonna ask
how everybody is doing,

231
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,558
but I think I got it.

232
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm fine. Hey, sweetie.
I'm sorry you're sick.

233
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,062
I'm just gonna take you home.

234
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,731
Ooh! Hey,
do you have his lovey?

235
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:28,566
I'm just gonna take him home.

236
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,735
Despite what Link may have
told you, I'm not incompetent.

237
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,939
Uh, no. He... Uh,
he never said that you were.

238
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:35,908
You know, I just want to
take care of my sick kid.

239
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,441
Everything is under control.
I've got it. I'm fine.

240
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,876
Okay.

241
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,746
Well, I think
we're just gonna go.

242
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,282
Ooh!

243
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:49,086
Or maybe we will change first.

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,956
Luna:

245
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,757
I'm coming, sweetie.

246
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,125
Mama!

247
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,093
I'll run him a bath.

248
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,630
Joni, I'm Dr. Lincoln.

249
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,034
Have you seen Vaughn?
W-Where is he?

250
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,768
Vaughn is?
Boyfriend. Trauma one.

251
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,803
He's got a pink stripe
in his hair.

252
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,371
Ice-cold eyes.

253
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,240
The skull pinky ring
that I gave him.

254
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,043
He was performing
at the concert. Clear.

255
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,878
No pneumothorax or fractures
in the chest X-ray.

256
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:15,313
What instrument
does Vaughn play?

257
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,949
Ugh! Air.

258
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,883
She's on morphine.

259
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,384
Try and hold still.

260
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,620
No, he plays air <i>guitar.</i>

261
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:25,057
Tonight was
the regional championship.

262
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,624
She's got a bad pelvic fracture.

263
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:28,626
The scaffolding
from the performance

264
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,762
fell right
into the crowd.

265
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,664
He was supposed
to make it to the finals.

266
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:36,133
He could have taken Scissor's
title. No, he <i>would</i> have.

267
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,004
Yeah, I'm sure he's great
at... air.

268
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,306
FAST was negative.
Systolics are stable at 110.

269
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,408
All right, let's get her to
CT. Parents are on their way.

270
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,777
Oh! Uh, they're... they're not
the biggest fans of Vaughn.

271
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,413
Could you maybe not mention
that he's here?

272
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,816
Patient privacy laws.
We couldn't if we wanted to.

273
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,651
Griffith, would you put in
the trauma scan orders,

274
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,453
meet us in CT?

275
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:56,955
Owen:
What have we got?

276
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:59,490
Ah, this is Vaughn,
19-year-old male.

277
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,859
Thoracoabdominal impalement.

278
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:05,429
Systolics in the low hundreds.
Responding to fluids.

279
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:08,432
Pleasure to meet you, sir. Try
not to move. Save your energy.

280
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,936
Help get another IV.
Give 20 of fentanyl.

281
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,938
We need to type and cross
and hang two units of O-neg.

282
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:14,438
Schmitt's running point
on this one.

283
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,108
Copy that.
Where'd you need me?

284
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,442
Put in the orders for CT.
If we can stabilize him more,

285
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,211
we might be able to run him
through the scanner

286
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:21,947
on the way to the O.R.

287
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,648
Can somebody get a message
to my girlfriend, Joni?

288
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,484
Try not to talk. Frankly,
It's a miracle you can even...

289
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:29,021
Uh, his pressure's tanking.

290
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,056
Owen: There's blood
in the Foley catheter.

291
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,391
Change of plans. We need to
get him to the O.R. now.

292
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:36,394
Am I good?
Uh-huh.

293
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:37,528
Alright, let's go.

294
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,500
We got here as fast as we could.

295
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,502
Where is she?
Can we see our Joni?

296
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:45,703
She's on her way to radiology,

297
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,139
but I will let her know
you're here.

298
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,572
Thank you so much.

299
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,474
My roommate's here.

300
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,809
Vaughn Bishop...
rad riffer, sick hair.

301
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,644
Gish?

302
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:56,414
Mr. and Mrs. F!
Dude, crazy night, right?

303
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,150
All those people in the crowd,

304
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:01,019
and Vaughn falls and...
bloosh... crushes Joni.

305
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,088
I mean, coincidence
or true love?

306
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:06,158
How about true stupidity?
I'm going to strangle that kid.

307
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,526
Let's not invoke violence
in the emergency room.

308
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,661
It was my idea for him
to climb the scaffold.

309
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:13,065
I built them so
he could shred off the rafters.

310
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:15,666
If you're going to be cheesed
at anyone, it should be me.

311
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,535
I don't get it.
She's a smart kid.

312
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,437
Where did we go wrong?
Sir, look.

313
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,439
No, this is gonna live
on the Internet forever.

314
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,108
Everyone will know
she's the girl

315
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,875
who got crushed by
an idiot guitar mime.

316
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,912
All due respect, air musician.

317
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:29,680
Why don't I show you both
to the family waiting area?

318
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:31,782
And... Gish?

319
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,185
I got this guy.

320
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:35,120
Right this way.

321
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,588
I'll show you where the other
air musicians are waiting,

322
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,690
uh, Mister...
Gish.

323
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,792
Just Gish. Like Slash.

324
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,595
Yeah.
Yep, that makes sense.

325
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:47,531
Woman: <i>Dr. Stephanie Russell to
cardiology. Dr. Russell to cardiology.</i>

326
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:51,970
You're supposed to be sleeping.

327
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,804
Well, in a dumb moment
of exhaustion,

328
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,141
I gave Mr. Donovan in 2114
my cellphone number,

329
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,476
and he texted me "911"
times in a row.

330
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,811
What did he want?
A hot dog.

331
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,081
He called it a hot dog sandwich.

332
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,585
Also, um, every time
I close my eyes,

333
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:10,421
I see the worst possible
outcomes for Chloe.

334
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,958
She's here.
She's getting the best care.

335
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,726
And you being sleep deprived
won't change anything.

336
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,064
Also, isn't Mr. Donovan
on a liquids-only diet?

337
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:24,802
Woman: <i>Rapid
response, second floor, ICU.</i>

338
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,172
<i>Rapid response,
second floor, ICU.</i>

339
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,640
<i>Rapid response,
second floor, ICU.</i>

340
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,076
<i>Rapid response, second floor...</i>

341
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,246
Mr. Riley, are you okay?
You tell me.

342
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:36,814
Uh, the pump isn't working.
There's low flow in the circuit.

343
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,415
We need a new pump ASAP.
Karen: On it.

344
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,985
We need to switch over to
the emergency hand crank,

345
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,619
or he'll code.

346
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:43,420
Okay.

347
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,623
Cannula flow.
Am I... Am I dying?

348
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,259
Just some
technical difficulties.

349
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,626
That's all.
Do your best to stay calm.

350
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,427
Karen:
Dr. Millin, I'm sorry.

351
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,797
Best-case scenario on
a new pump is a couple of hours.

352
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,167
The ECLS coordinator
accidentally left with the keys

353
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,767
to the supply closet.
What?

354
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,939
Ugh! Dr. Ndugu's triple A
patient is tachy.

355
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,439
Yeah, and his quadruple bypass
next door

356
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,276
has blood in the pleurovac.

357
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:05,977
Wait, you're both leaving?

358
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,479
Go.
I can take over you.

359
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:10,347
You don't... You're supposed...
You need help. Chloe's down the hall.

360
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:11,682
I've got this.

361
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:17,822
Go.

362
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,137
So, I have to reconstruct
this guy's entire face,

363
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:30,947
which is barely a face

364
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,606
after busting through
the back windshield.

365
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,386
Insert seatbelt PSA here.
Exactly.

366
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,275
I get home, and I just
want to crawl into my bed...

367
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,868
Mm-hmm.

368
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,876
And David has taken apart
our kids' marble run,

369
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,226
and my son is freaking out,

370
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:46,821
so now I have to reconstruct
that, too.

371
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,188
Of course you do.

372
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,690
And he wonders
why I'm not in the mood.

373
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,559
Well, we're scheduling sex,

374
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:54,260
and it's going about
as well as you could imagine.

375
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,431
I'm sorry. That was just
way more information

376
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,999
than you needed to know.
No. You're fine.

377
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,536
We're not at work. You have to
get it out somewhere.

378
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,070
Isn't that what therapy is for?

379
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,072
Sure.

380
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:08,208
Listen, a few years back,

381
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,276
David and I went through
a really rough patch.

382
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,613
We couldn't talk
without arguing.

383
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,347
The spark was gone.

384
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,684
I didn't know if we were
going to make it.

385
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,619
So what did you do?

386
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:21,254
We opened our marriage.

387
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,256
Opened as in...?

388
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,593
Yeah, we date
and sleep with other people.

389
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,762
Oh!
Mm-hmm.

390
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:30,464
I mean, with boundaries,
of course.

391
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:33,066
And it's not for everyone,

392
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,536
but it worked wonders for us.

393
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,104
But you're a trauma surgeon at
Seattle Presbyterian with two kids.

394
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:40,441
How do you find the time?

395
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:43,711
Hot single tennis pro.

396
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:46,079
You have time for tennis?

397
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,481
I do.

398
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,984
Do you want another round?
Yes, please.

399
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,952
Excuse me.
Can we have another?

400
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,388
He's changed and bathed.

401
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,056
And I'm just going to
let him sleep for half an hour

402
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,893
before I take him,
if that's okay.

403
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,293
Yeah, sure.

404
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:02,630
Also, thank you
for your clothes.

405
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,833
Hey.

406
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,635
You can tell me
where to shove it,

407
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:10,336
but, I mean,
give yourself some grace.

408
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,773
It's impossible to do it all
on a good day,

409
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,776
let alone
when there's a sick kid.

410
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,344
You know what?
Forget the half-hour.

411
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,180
Clearly, you do not
want company. That's fine.

412
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,148
I'm going to grab him.
It's not you.

413
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:25,285
When Luna woke up sick
this morning,

414
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,589
she started crying,
and she asked for Jessica,

415
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,323
her daycare teacher.

416
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:32,125
Yeah.

417
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:33,928
That sucks.

418
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,597
I'm at the hospital
working 80 hours a week,

419
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,467
and I don't have time to make
the... the cute lunches

420
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,269
or, um...

421
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:46,640
take her to, you know,
story time at the library

422
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,710
or do any of the good things
that parents are supposed to do.

423
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:52,646
All I ever do is...

424
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,616
feed her and clothe her
and bathe her.

425
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:03,457
Well, if it helps,
we don't even have the robust,

426
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:06,894
explicit memories
until about 7 years old.

427
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,164
I just...

428
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,301
I really wanted to give her
the mother that I never had,

429
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,370
and instead, she's
at daycare all day

430
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:21,307
developing a secure attachment
to Jessica.

431
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:24,210
And this is all
while I have just one kid.

432
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:25,746
What's going to happen
when I have two more?

433
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,517
You and Link...?

434
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,586
Oh, my God.

435
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:35,422
Do you want me?

436
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,691
No, I've got it.

437
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,564
Clamp.

438
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:48,002
Schmitt, you want to
ask Kwan what he sees?

439
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,704
I can just answer you.

440
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,840
Or wait to be asked.

441
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,675
Kwan, what do you see?

442
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,111
Um, perforated small bowel.
Right.

443
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,514
Kidney seems involved.
Maybe a small liver lac.

444
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,348
There's probably more.
How do you want to handle that?

445
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:05,051
Let's pack first,
then go quadrant by quadrant.

446
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,086
We'll save the scaffold
for last.

447
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,956
Dr. Hunt,
you can pull it out slowly.

448
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,090
And the rest of us will attack
any problems as we go.

449
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:12,760
Alright.
You heard the man.

450
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,762
Owen: Let's get packing.

451
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,866
I know it's basic,
falling for the musician.

452
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,568
He is not a musician.

453
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,803
My parents say I'm making
a fool of myself,

454
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,204
but they're just jealous.

455
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:27,741
I'm kissing my boyfriend
onstage at his concerts,

456
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,276
and they don't even
hold hands anymore.

457
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,046
They're probably just worried.

458
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,747
They don't want you
to have regrets.

459
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:36,483
He's Van Vaughn Bishop.
What would I regret?

460
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:38,084
Haven't a clue.

461
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:39,587
Type three pelvic fracture

462
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,589
with active extrapolation
of the contrast.

463
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,323
Yeah.
She's bleeding.

464
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,892
We should embolize
before you repair it.

465
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,392
Does anyone know about Vaughn?

466
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:49,630
I'm sorry I keep asking
about him. I just love him.

467
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:52,332
I love him so much, I'm even
willing to put up with Gish.

468
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,668
What's gish?

469
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:56,770
You don't want to know.

470
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,743
How's it going?

471
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,945
Took me a while
to find the right speed,

472
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:08,114
but now I'm in a groove
and he's stable.

473
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,350
Well, I can take over for you.
You can go be with Chloe.

474
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,986
I want to stay.

475
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,521
Gives my mind something useful
to focus on.

476
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:15,990
Plus, you've done
so much for me.

477
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,858
I'd like to do something
for you.

478
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:19,325
Oh, I-I wanted to help you.

479
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,355
You don't owe me anything.

480
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,344
I know.

481
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,935
Uh, the pump is on its way.

482
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,870
I'm going to go do my rounds,

483
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:31,839
and I'll be back by the time
it gets here.

484
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,474
Are you sure you're good?

485
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,676
I'm single-handedly
keeping this guy alive.

486
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,911
What's better than that?

487
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,650
I'm almost done with
the small bowel.

488
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:45,686
Almost out of the abdomen. It's
going to take weeks of recovery.

489
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,821
Should have climbed
air scaffolding.

490
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,990
Okay, this isn't
the time for judgment.

491
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,059
Would you go to an air guitar
concert, Dr. Bailey?

492
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,527
I don't do crowds,

493
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,229
unless it's Beyoncé.

494
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:58,565
Alright, last serosal tear
is repaired.

495
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,467
We can run the bowel again
at the end.

496
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:02,136
You can continue
pulling out the pipe.

497
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:04,438
Okay, here we go.

498
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:08,241
There we go.

499
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:10,209
Bailey: Okay,
he's hemorrhaging.

500
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,245
Looks like the rod went through
the kidney and his blood supply.

501
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:14,380
Alright, I need suction.
Lap pads. Kidney's shot.

502
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,050
Owen: Well, luckily, he can
survive with only one.

503
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,217
Schmitt, do you want
to do the honors?

504
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,687
Well, what if the other kidney
ever gets damaged?

505
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,021
What, do you want
to try and salvage it?

506
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,872
If we did,
he'd be open for longer.

507
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:26,117
If we can't save it, we'd be risking
him becoming unstable for nothing.

508
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:30,263
You can resect it or salvage it,

509
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:32,773
but you don't have
much longer to debate it.

510
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,317
Schmitt.

511
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,841
Do you or Dr. Hunt
want to step in?

512
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:43,043
I want to salvage it.
Are you sure?

513
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:45,179
Is he sure?
Isn't the hilum injured?

514
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:47,081
We can repair the renal artery
and then do a renorrhaphy.

515
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,849
And you think that'll work?
I don't know, but ..

516
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,751
It's the plan.
I'm still an attending, right?

517
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,854
You're damn right you are.

518
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,957
Alright.
We're saving a kidney.

519
00:21:58,365 --> 00:21:59,358
6-Oh prolene.

520
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:03,564
Beats the hell out of research.

521
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:11,637
What's that?

522
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:14,675
Well, it was going to be
the best grilled cheese sandwich

523
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,582
you ever had, but I couldn't
find cheese,

524
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,949
so it's toast.

525
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,125
Thank you.

526
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,888
You're a mom and a resident.

527
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:27,630
That is two impossible things
at the same time.

528
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:31,810
I know it's going to be hard
in the beginning and the middle,

529
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:35,060
but I really want
that big family.

530
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,432
And I want it for Luna,
too, for all of us.

531
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:41,837
I'm just... I'm so worried
that I'm gonna mess it up.

532
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,073
Maybe I already have.

533
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:45,941
You haven't messed anything up.

534
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,209
Where's Link in all of this?

535
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:48,944
Can you lean on him more?

536
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:52,047
We haven't been
in the best place lately.

537
00:22:56,552 --> 00:23:00,421
When he and I were together,
I would be lying if I said

538
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,058
that the years of friendship
between the two of you

539
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,727
didn't bother me.

540
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,696
But I think it was Link
who was lying all along,

541
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,265
to himself.

542
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,433
I think, underneath it all,

543
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,435
he always wanted you.

544
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:17,606
He proposed to you
with three rings.

545
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,076
I had to listen for months about
how he was so in love with you.

546
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,745
Maybe.

547
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,615
Or maybe he was trying
to force us into something

548
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,484
because he was scared to leave.

549
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:32,521
I'm going to check on Scout.
You eat the toast.

550
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,894
You think there are
air guitar teachers?

551
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,596
Why? You want lessons?
Fluoro.

552
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,131
I'm just wondering
how you get good at it.

553
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:43,899
A lot of hours
in front of the bathroom mirror,

554
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,466
which, honestly,
is really where it belongs.

555
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,770
I don't know,
I think it's sweet.

556
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,805
I mean, they know what they
want, and they're not holding back,

557
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,507
no matter how bonkers it is.

558
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,809
Alright, another bleeder down.

559
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,744
Griffith, go for the next one.

560
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:05,621
Now, advance
until you see the extrav.

561
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,924
Good.

562
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,193
Now flip the guide wire.

563
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:12,995
And advance again.

564
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:14,863
Good.
Deploying the coil.

565
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,334
Ah, you make it look easy.
Been practicing.

566
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,602
It shows.
Go for the next bleeder.

567
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:23,939
Okay. Thank you. Well,
the new pump is working. Ah!

568
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,308
I can't believe
you cranked that for so long.

569
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,010
I'm used to it.

570
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:31,113
Grandma Servino had
an old-fashioned butter churn.

571
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,984
His stats are dropping.

572
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,986
But the O2 on the ECMO
circuit's maxed out.

573
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,688
Call a rapid response.
We need to intubate.

574
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:42,624
Woman: <i>Rapid response,
second floor, ICU.</i>

575
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:44,126
<i>Rapid response, second floor,
ICU.</i> Okay, I know it's a little scary,

576
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,962
but this will help you
to breathe.

577
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,731
<i>Rapid response, second
floor, ICU.</i> Okay. Oxygen.

578
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,733
<i>Rapid response,
second floor, ICU.</i>

579
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:51,900
All right,
we need X-ray in here.

580
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,636
1, 2. Okay.

581
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,839
Careful. He only
has one lung. Yeah.

582
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,978
Okay. Can you get the
ambu ready? Mm-hmm.

583
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:06,248
I can see the cords.
I... I'm in.

584
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,519
We need to confirm placement.

585
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:14,223
I think we're okay.

586
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,096
His pressures are dropping.

587
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,098
Karen: I don't understand.
The pump's on,

588
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:25,034
but the flows keep cutting out.

589
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,770
Get us a visual of the chest.

590
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,738
I'm calling Dr. Ndugu.

591
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,843
Come on, answer, answer.

592
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:36,412
Winston: <i>Millin, tell me
he's still alive.</i>

593
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:37,946
He's still alive.
But we had to intubate him.

594
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,882
I think he's going to code.

595
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,518
There's not enough blood
moving through the ECMO machine.

596
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,385
Is that Yasuda?

597
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,621
She's helping me.
Pressures are plummeting.

598
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:50,459
Alright. X-ray's up.

599
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:53,195
Okay. Damn it.
His heart's herniating

600
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:55,230
into the right chest cavity
where his lung used to be.

601
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,866
So what do we do?
<i>Alright. You'll need to...</i>

602
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,235
<i>to... to pump air, okay?</i>

603
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,737
What?
Dr. Ndugu?

604
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,874
Dr. Ndugu?
I hate the night shift!

605
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:07,309
It's fine. We're fine.

606
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:08,545
He said to pump air
into the chest. Right?

607
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:10,312
Chest tube.

608
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:11,580
Right.

609
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:17,486
Okay, I have the
syringe. Uh-huh.

610
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,922
Don't go anywhere. Maybe
you should wait for an attending.

611
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,623
Everyone's operating.
If we wait, he dies.

612
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,727
She's going to need
a new image after every pump.

613
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:30,866
Okay.

614
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:35,170
Did it move?

615
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,972
Uh, maybe a little.
Go again.

616
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,147
It moved! It moved!
Pump again! Okay.

617
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:51,086
Pressure's coming up.

618
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:00,018
He's stabilizing.

619
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,697
Oh, my God.

620
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,199
We did it!
Yeah.

621
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,593
It's insane.
I know!

622
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:12,788
I get more emails
from my kids' school

623
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,707
than everyone else in my life
put together.

624
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,159
And Don't get me started
on the parent portals.

625
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:18,784
Oh, no, I lost my password.

626
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:23,377
I mean, who needs a portal
when you have all those emails?

627
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,643
This is crazy.

628
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:25,866
Mm!

629
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,859
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time.

630
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,761
Oh!
Me neither.

631
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,130
When Owen got paged, my first
inclination was to go home

632
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:35,133
and put on a pair of
sweatpants. I'm glad you stayed.

633
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,302
Oh, me too. You know what?
At first, I felt like

634
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,638
maybe Owen and I needed
a break from the kids.

635
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,374
But maybe I just needed
a break from Owen.

636
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:44,009
Mm-hmm.

637
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:47,245
Mm. Whoa. Um...

638
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,613
Oh.

639
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,216
Sorry. I misread.

640
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,151
Yeah. No.

641
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:56,154
I mean, your marriage
might be open,

642
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,424
but me and Owen,
it's... it's... we...

643
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,792
It's closed.
It's very closed.

644
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:02,495
Understood.

645
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,596
Again, I'm... I'm sorry.
Yeah.

646
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,332
Let's forget it ever happened.

647
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,604
Mm, you know what?

648
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,073
It's late,
so I think I'm just, um...

649
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,342
I'm just gonna get
a ride home. Sure.

650
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:24,450
Hi! Were you in surgery?
Hey!

651
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,917
No, I just like to wear the hat.

652
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:28,320
Okay.
How'd it go?

653
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,122
I saved a man's kidney.

654
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:32,357
How's your night?

655
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,827
I spent it talking to
an adult leukemia patient.

656
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,330
The one that you were
going to see five hours ago?

657
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,500
Yeah. She was working
through some stuff.

658
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,502
Didn't want to leave.

659
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:44,936
So, have you thought
any more about Texas?

660
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,440
Actually...

661
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:51,276
I'm thinking there might be
more for me here.

662
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,044
Really?

663
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,813
Webber offered me
an attending position.

664
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,848
Oh, congratulations!

665
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,684
Also, there is this guy.

666
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:01,319
Oh, a guy?
Mm-hmm.

667
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,854
Okay.
He's very nice.

668
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:04,956
Okay.
I like nice guys.

669
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,626
So as the pain meds wear off,

670
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,127
there's going to be
bad days and good days.

671
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:11,497
Stick with the P.T.
It helps.

672
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:14,232
And maybe skip the
air guitar concerts for a while.

673
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,636
Hey, you hear that?
Doctor's orders.

674
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,070
Will you order the labs
for the morning

675
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,506
and finish the
post-op now? Okay.

676
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,475
Get some rest, okay?

677
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:26,378
Oh.
Could you answer it for me?

678
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:28,180
Of course.

679
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:32,050
<i>Hey, babe.
Are you okay?</i>

680
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,853
I'm good.
I was worried about you.

681
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:36,221
I dreamed about you
during surgery.

682
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:38,056
Can't dream under anesthesia.

683
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,025
<i>Aw, that's so sweet.</i>

684
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,730
Dude, what are you
doing? It's mood music.

685
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,500
Vaughn: <i>I wish I could play it
for you right now.</i>

686
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,768
Oh, my God. Let's
give them some privacy.

687
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:20,980
I taught her that riff.

688
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:22,761
Oh, I bet you did.

689
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,537
Yeah, you did.

690
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:30,351
Winston:
Meet you in the O.R.

691
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,413
Good work, Millin.

692
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:35,994
I'd say 9 times out of 10,

693
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,923
that man would have died
tonight.

694
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,961
Scrub in. You can do
the bronchial anastomosis.

695
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:42,820
Really?
After what you did tonight,

696
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:46,091
you deserve it.

697
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,127
Actually, there's... there's
something I should tell you.

698
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,096
Uh, when Mr. Riley...

699
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:52,950
Did I miss her?

700
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,572
You're in luck...
Transfer took forever,

701
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,600
so they're just packing up.

702
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,169
Okay. Hey.

703
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,303
Dr. Schmitt! I'm leaving.

704
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:01,173
Well, I'm glad you didn't
before I could say goodbye.

705
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:02,774
We couldn't have left.

706
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,275
She's been talking about you
the whole night.

707
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:07,980
I have something for you.

708
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,915
We can't thank you enough
for taking care of our daughter.

709
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:12,184
Of course.
Here.

710
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,153
That's you fixing my leg
on the helicopter,

711
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:17,789
so you always remember.

712
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:20,259
I love it. Thank you.

713
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,262
Hey, I-I wish I had something
to give you.

714
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,998
It's okay.
I'll never forget you.

715
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,333
Thank you so much.

716
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,435
Thank you, Doctor.

717
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,787
I heard I might
find you in here.

718
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,531
Mika: And I heard I'm here
because of you.

719
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,692
You didn't have to give up
this surgery for me.

720
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:57,656
You said you were trying
to catch up on your case logs.

721
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,174
And you deserve it.

722
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,833
I'm gonna go home.

723
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,069
I miss you.

724
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,837
I miss us.

725
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,873
I mean, I don't even know
if we were an us.

726
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,211
But that thing we started,
it made me feel...

727
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,348
You shook me up.

728
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:20,518
In a good way. In a way
I didn't even know I needed.

729
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:23,922
And as much as I like your face,
it is pretty impossible to read,

730
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:27,059
so I'm gonna shut up now.

731
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:31,596
Really wish
you hadn't scrubbed in yet.

732
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:32,763
You want your surgery back?

733
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:35,833
No.

734
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,436
I really want to kiss you.

735
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:42,174
Right now, for a very long time.

736
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,744
But, um...

737
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:50,848
Rain check?

738
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:52,918
Hell yeah.

739
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,823
Mika: Thank you.

740
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:29,207
Schmitt, I heard you were
quite a hero last night.

741
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,968
Dr. Webber's
patting himself on the back

742
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:32,695
for offering you
the attending position.

743
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,188
It was both our idea.
And it was an excellent one.

744
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:39,018
I remember walking down
these halls as a sub-I with you,

745
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,378
dreaming that I might be
an attending here one day.

746
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:43,673
You've come a long way
since then.

747
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:47,368
Thanks to both of you.

748
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:51,536
I think I would really like
being a general attending here.

749
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:55,429
But my love is peds.

750
00:34:55,454 --> 00:35:01,128
I love the highs and the lows
and the goofy things they say,

751
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:03,523
and that when I save a kid,

752
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:06,319
I'm... I'm not just
saving a life.

753
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:10,048
I'm saving a lifetime.

754
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:12,859
And if I've learned
anything from the two of you,

755
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,374
it's to be passionate
about your work.

756
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:17,656
So...

757
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,110
I accepted the research position
in Texas.

758
00:35:24,662 --> 00:35:29,567
Then I guess the only thing
left to say is...

759
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,795
congratulations.

760
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:36,850
Go make us proud.

761
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,904
How's Luna?

762
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,003
Did you get some sleep?

763
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,873
She's better.
She's still down.

764
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,274
Good.

765
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,049
I know this isn't
what you wanted.

766
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,217
What?

767
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:14,722
I don't want to force you
into something.

768
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,757
It's never going to be
just us again.

769
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,094
It's going to be chaos, and I...

770
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,897
I don't know.
What if you leave me?

771
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,035
W-Why would you say that?

772
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,104
Everyone else has.

773
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:34,074
I don't want to do this alone.

774
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,210
That's what you think of me?

775
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:39,445
You... You're gonna put me

776
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:43,549
in the same group as all
the other people in your life

777
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:47,721
that have been so awful to you?

778
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,891
Well, it's never been
just us, Jo.

779
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:53,994
And the fact that you think
I would back out

780
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,629
just because we have two more?

781
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,268
Meredith: <i>Scientists call
the conscious thought</i>

782
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,304
<i>needed to complete
everyday tasks</i>

783
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,905
<i>"working memory."</i>

784
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:11,779
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

785
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,814
I should get up.

786
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,481
How was dinner?
Oh, we ditched the restaurant

787
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,483
and went to the bar next door.

788
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:20,020
Get this...
Cass Beckman kissed me.

789
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:23,924
What?
Yeah, she'd had

790
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,827
a-a couple glasses of wine...
I mean, we both had a couple.

791
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,662
Wait, so you both...

792
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:33,033
You were both drunk? Did you...
Did you kiss her back?

793
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,002
No. She just...
She got the wrong idea, huh?

794
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,870
How?

795
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:40,274
How?
Yeah, how?

796
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,710
Do you think
that I provoked this?

797
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:44,677
I don't know, Teddy.
Two minutes ago, I was asleep,

798
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,479
and now you're telling me
that some women kissed you?

799
00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:48,349
You know what?
I have to go do rounds.

800
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:50,451
Owen, I...

801
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,786
<i>That memory is always there,</i>

802
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,990
<i>always busy, getting you
through the chaos of life</i>

803
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,690
<i>one task at a time.</i>

804
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:58,993
Morning.

805
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,961
Is it time to go home?

806
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:04,198
This bed's really comfy.

807
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,632
How was the chair?
Irrelevant.

808
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:09,370
I wound up working.
Mm, I'm sorry.

809
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:12,806
Actually, I had
a pretty great night.

810
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,742
Let's go home.

811
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:20,580
<i>In some ways,
that's all life really is,</i>

812
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:22,416
<i>all the things we do
strung together.</i>

813
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,224
Molly: <i>Hi. You've reached
Molly's voicemail.</i>

814
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:31,859
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

815
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,495
Meredith:
<i>This patient. This diagnosis.</i>

816
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:41,368
Morning.

817
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,906
<i>This night. This moment.</i>

818
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:48,275
How'd you sleep?
Oh, great.

819
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:49,910
Some alarm kept going off...

820
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,945
I'm normally self-assured,
very poised.

821
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,048
I'm on fire
when I'm in the O.R.

822
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,285
But when I'm around you,
my entire brain scrambles,

823
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:02,688
and sometimes I just...
say things.

824
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:05,359
You were tired and busy.
It happens.

825
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:09,463
But I do love you, Lucas Adams.

826
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,865
I love you.

827
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:15,035
It's okay i-if it's too soon.
You don't have to say it back.

828
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,804
But that's how I feel.

829
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,084
Crap. I'm late for rounds.

830
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:39,493
Oh, uh...
I love you, too.

831
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:51,071
<i>This connection.
This family. This friendship.</i>

832
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,107
The best part
about the night shift

833
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,075
is having breakfast
like it's dinner.

834
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,844
Let's get fries at Joe's.

835
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,346
Oh, actually, I have to round
before I go home.

836
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,948
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.

837
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,015
What are you doing here?

838
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:05,085
Uh, waiting for you.

839
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,021
I have to tell you something.

840
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,090
I took the job in Texas.

841
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,461
Hey, no, no, no, no.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

842
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,864
It's okay. We...
We will text all the time.

843
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:20,666
And we can FaceTime
and watch our trashy TV shows.

844
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,637
And... And you'll visit,
and I-I'll take you for Tex-Mex,

845
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,273
assuming that I like it.

846
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,543
Hey, hey.

847
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:31,445
Damn it, Levi.

848
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:39,119
Do you know what I said
to... to Bailey and Webber

849
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,722
in my residency interview?

850
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:43,957
That I-I wasn't here
to make friends.

851
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,494
I was like
a reality TV contestant.

852
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,797
I was... I was focused
and cutthroat.

853
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,369
And then I met you.

854
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:59,406
You're my best friend.

855
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:02,242
Hey, we... we will always
be besties.

856
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,077
You do not
need to be sad. I...

857
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,914
I know, dummy, I know.

858
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,715
These are happy tears.

859
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,857
So you're not mad?
Of course not.

860
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,726
You're following your dream,
or whatever.

861
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,228
Okay, that's such a relief,

862
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,330
'cause I was... I was
very nervous to tell you.

863
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:24,998
Seriously?
Yeah.

864
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:27,167
Well, I'm easy.

865
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,337
Think about how hard
it'll be to tell James.

866
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,046
<i>And somewhere in all of that,</i>

867
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,949
<i>sleep and wake up.
Sleep and wake up.</i>

868
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:45,219
Can we stop for doughnuts?
I want powdered sugar.

869
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,853
Like, actually just the sugar.

870
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,623
Is that weird?
Or a waffle.

871
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:50,958
Maybe we should get
real breakfast.

872
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,527
That's healthier, right?

873
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,696
Mimi?

874
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:58,031
Mimi.
<i>Sleep and...</i>

875
00:41:58,065 --> 00:41:59,566
Mika!

876
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,401
Mika: <i>Wake up.</i>
