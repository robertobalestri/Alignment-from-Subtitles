00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,675
<i>When a patient receives</i>
<i>a terminal diagnosis,</i>

2
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:08,877
<i>a clock starts.</i>

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>In an instant,</i>
<i>the future becomes finite.</i>

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,083
<i>Doctors do their best</i>
<i>to predict life expectancy</i>

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,719
<i>based on median survival,</i>

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,087
<i>the period of time</i>
<i>after diagnosis</i>

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,423
<i>when half of patients</i>
<i>with the disease</i>
<i>are still alive.</i>

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,861
<i>But statistics</i>
<i>can't tell you if you'll host</i>
<i>Thanksgiving dinner...</i>

9
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:29,263
<i>...or attend</i>
<i>your grandkids' recital.</i>

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,266
Evynn has just lost
her damn mind.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,401
Who the hell does
she think she is?

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,537
Your protégé.

13
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,073
This is not the time for you
to throw that up in my face.

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,341
Read the room.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,812
I need to inform
the transplant committee.

16
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:47,414
Alzheimer's is not
a contraindication
to transplant.

17
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,317
I understand that,
but they approved her
under false pretenses.

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,754
They thought the dementia
was encephalopathy.

19
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:54,989
Okay. Uh, Tasha's being
moved back to her room,

20
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,660
and we've connected the liver
to a normothermic
perfusion machine.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,763
Buys us some time
to figure this out,
but not much.

22
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,998
I mean, you must be able
to explain the situation

23
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,667
to the transplant committee,
yes?

24
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:09,436
I vouched for Tasha once.
I can't do it again.

25
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,507
Well, they factor in
life expectancy as well.

26
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,441
Yes, of course I know that.

27
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,512
Someone without Alzheimer's
would live much longer
with that liver.

28
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,514
I'm sorry,
we can't assume that.

29
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,783
I mean, people are getting it
earlier and earlier,
especially women.

30
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:25,385
You think they should all be
denied life-saving transplants?
I don't.

31
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,426
Meredith's right.
We'll tell the committee.

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,596
They deserve to know.

33
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:36,831
I'll tell them myself.

34
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>You're left to wonder,</i>

35
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,402
<i>how is it possible to</i>
<i>feel alive when science</i>
<i>tells you you're dying?</i>

36
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,645
Sunny-side up, right?

37
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,113
Uh, yes, please.

38
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,951
Wow. Someone is really trying
to get ahold of you.

39
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,787
It's Dave. He's having
a hard time with the breakup.

40
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,557
I honestly
feel bad for him.

41
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,292
I know what it's like
to lose you.

42
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,463
Morning.

43
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,398
Oh, something smells good.

44
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,069
Pancakes and eggs.
Oh, man, you can stay
as long as you like.

45
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,771
You don't live here.

46
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,174
- Molly? Molly!
- She's seizing.

47
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,977
We got you, Molly.

48
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,990
Catherine told me to make
my board presentation engaging.

49
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,026
It's about
the hospital's endowment.

50
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,762
My eyes glaze over
just thinking about it.

51
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:42,697
Who's that?

52
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,498
Nora Young.

53
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,067
Said she's been doing
the cardio exercises
you gave her,

54
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,235
and she was able
to jog a full mile today.

55
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,104
Hmm. Good for her.

56
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,907
I wish all of my patients
were that diligent
about their recovery.

57
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,876
-Go, Union!
-Hurry, let's go this way!

58
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:58,178
-Oh, here we go.
-Washington Union
scavenger hunts.

59
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,748
Every year, lacerations,
broken bones--

60
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,450
Memories that last a lifetime,
bonds that can't be broken.

61
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,120
Third place finishes
that still sting?

62
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,288
We were robbed.

63
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,058
There must be a few items
on the list in the hospital
this year.

64
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,359
Mmm. So college students
are here to steal stuff.

65
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,761
Hey, they're here to win.

66
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,797
Or cause me
a security nightmare.

67
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:18,032
- Wha--
- Help! Help!

68
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,433
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,468
-She needs help.
-Yeah, she just collapsed.

70
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,971
-Does she have
any medical conditions?
-I don't think so.

71
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,473
- Okay,
let's get her...

72
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,142
Oh! Security!

73
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,310
- We're gonna need a gurney.
-  -Yeah.

74
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,213
-Feeling better. Gotta go.
-Hey...

75
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:37,785
I guess my presentation's
gonna have to wait.

76
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,219
Y'all got this!

77
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,294
Bailey, you wanted to see me?

78
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,064
- What's the look?
Am I in trouble?

79
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,768
I am reading
resident evaluations.

80
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,970
-Was I supposed to
turn something in?
-No.

81
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,008
Uh, these are specific
to the resident
who is still in a trial period.

82
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,544
-The one I am married to.
-Oh.

83
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,982
From the look on your face,
I take it they're not
what you'd hoped.

84
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,785
I've been trying to
stay out of his way,

85
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,286
so I haven't
supervised him directly,

86
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:18,425
and therefore, don't know how
to evaluate his evaluations.

87
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,494
Are you asking for my advice?

88
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,830
So Ben is
supposed to be on your service.

89
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,299
I wanted to ask
if we can swap residents today.

90
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,872
-Oh. Oh, yes.
Of course. Yes. Yes.
-Okay.

91
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,041
Did you not want him
on your service?

92
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:38,045
I do not have good advice
about working with family.

93
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,814
No. No.

94
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,685
"Critical incision
along the pericardium
to release the tamponade"--

95
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:47,188
Rob's hosting intern trivia
tonight at Joe's.

96
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,124
-You wanna go?
-Uh, will we have to be
on the same team?

97
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,859
I am really good at trivia.

98
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,795
I will mop the floor
with the other teams.

99
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,997
Yeah. Some of the guys
still don't talk to me
after last time.

100
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,165
Oh. Millin?

101
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,002
Um, I'm on cardio all day,
and then I am going home.

102
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,639
Warren, you're on
Shepherd's service, right?

103
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,306
I was... Uh...

104
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,475
I have a friend
who needs a neuro consult.

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,377
Well, page neurology.

106
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,345
I was hoping you could have
Shepherd take a look at her.

107
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,481
- She had a grand mal seizure
this morning.

108
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,754
Griffith, um, Dr. Marsh needs
an intern upstairs to monitor
a transplant patient.

109
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,824
Warren, you're on
my service now.

110
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,859
And, Adams,
you are with Shepherd.

111
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:28,830
That's a nice surprise.
Maybe we can grab lunch
or something?

112
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,833
I am not your wife today.
I am your attending.

113
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,002
All right then.
Tell me where you need me.

114
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,677
I can't ask my aunt
to squeeze Molly in today.

115
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,545
Her schedule's insane.

116
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,681
-Can't you just go to the ER?
-But you're on
neurosurgery. I...

117
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,850
You can do a workup yourself.
I can help.

118
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,854
If we get caught,
I'm throwing you under the bus.

119
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,524
Hi, Lisa, I'm Dr. Bailey.
This is Dr. Warren.

120
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,926
Go ahead.

121
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,096
Oh, uh, Lisa Saito, 63,
admitted for jaundice

122
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,899
and abdominal pain
from acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity.

123
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,300
Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,202
-Do you mind if we examine you?
-Oh, please.

125
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,738
Doc...
...I've been taking
acetaminophen for years.

126
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm-I'm a high school
librarian,

127
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,775
so shelving books does a number
on my back.

128
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,278
Sure it's not
the high school students
hurting your back?

129
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,446
I've got one that hurts mine.

130
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,349
No, they're keeping me young.

131
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:25,820
Yesterday, I helped a sophomore
with her biography on Jackie O.

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,223
And then I led
a student podcasting club.

133
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,626
Yeah, we're, uh, cracking
a cold case this season.

134
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,461
Well, sounds like
rewarding work.
Take a deep breath for me.

135
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,797
Oh...

136
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,967
I wish my back loved it
as much as I do.

137
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,137
We were just moving
some encyclopedias
back into storage.

138
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,572
No one uses them anymore.

139
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,743
I went and bought some
extra-strength caplets
for the extra pain.

140
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,746
Uh, I didn't realize
that the doses were different.

141
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,648
Uh, it's an easy mistake.

142
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,317
So we are giving you medicine
to prevent more damage
to the liver,

143
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,387
and we'll monitor you
and see if it recovers.

144
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,523
-What if it doesn't?
-Let's not worry
about that yet.

145
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,259
-Okay, you can lay back now.
-Okay.

146
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,328
-All right.
-All right, Dr. Warren.

147
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,866
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, let's get a repeat
acetaminophen level, ALT,

148
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,769
-AST, potassium--
-You can just say CMP.

149
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,643
And INR.
Order exactly what I asked for
and get a rush on the labs.

150
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:31,552
Tasha Lawson, 41,
diagnosed with
primary sclerosing cholangitis

151
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,321
and Alzheimer's disease.

152
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,723
Status post-stent
for biliary stricture.

153
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,559
On lactulose for liver failure
while waiting for a transplant.

154
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,862
I can't stay.
I have to go to class.
Have you seen my bag?

155
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,197
-Where are my things?
-Yo, yo, yo. T. T. T.

156
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,497
-What's going--
-It's okay.

157
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,033
We rescheduled it. We can stay.

158
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,202
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I promise.

159
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,403
Just breathe.

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,807
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Okay.

161
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,880
Does Dr. Fox know there's
a liver in a box somewhere
that could save my wife's life?

162
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,382
She knows.

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,784
She hasn't responded
to my texts. Where is she?

164
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,988
Where is she?

165
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,256
She's pretty upset
on how you handled all of this.

166
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:11,993
I didn't have a choice.
We're talking about
my wife's life here.

167
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:16,831
Withholding medical history
is unfair to other people
on the transplant list.

168
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,498
What about Alzheimer's is fair?

169
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,168
Well, look,
as Tasha's transplant surgeon,

170
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,704
I'm gonna strongly recommend
to the committee
that we proceed.

171
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,573
Thank you.

172
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,975
At least one of you is fighting
for your patient.

173
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,453
Meredith.

174
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,223
Hey, Meredith. Wait.

175
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,462
Who are you?

176
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,698
Visitors.

177
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,668
Uh, we're just, uh, looking
for this.

178
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,837
Okay.

179
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,642
I know what you're doing.

180
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,978
I just followed you
into a closet.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

181
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,281
When you look at Tasha,
you see a possible future me.
I don't need saving.

182
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,617
Okay. First of all,
not everything is about you.

183
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,318
And have you considered,
even for a second,

184
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,320
that someone may have
gotten this wrong?

185
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,923
-She is 41 years old.
-That doesn't mean
it isn't Alzheimer's.

186
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,759
Okay, that's fine.
All I'm saying is, let's do
our own neuro workup

187
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:22,730
before she's denied
life-saving treatment based on
another hospital's diagnosis.

188
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,232
I wanna talk to Shepherd.

189
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,836
You don't trust that
I know what this looks like?

190
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,104
This is my life's work.

191
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,573
Yeah, and transplants are mine.

192
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,347
Okay. Well, see,
the infection is spreading
to the mediastinum.

193
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,849
-Mm-hmm.
-What's the plan?

194
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,984
Broad-spectrum antibiotics
and blood cultures.

195
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,853
Yes, good. Place the order.

196
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,824
"Do not allow unauthorized
persons into secure areas."

197
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,593
Must be the scavenger hunt.
What an epic waste of time.

198
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,129
Okay, you didn't
do stupid stuff like that
in college?

199
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,665
Organized forced fun,
not my thing.

200
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,667
"Work hard, play harder."
That was my motto.

201
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,169
My motto was "Work hard
so you don't have to live
with your hippie parents

202
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,671
until you're 30."

203
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,172
Crap, security!
Cameron, hide in here.

204
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,541
Oh, hey, hey. This thing's on.

205
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,510
Cameron! Oh, my God!

206
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,678
-Oh, my God.
-We need help in here!

207
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,048
Wait, don't turn it off
until we can brace him.
Page trauma right now.

208
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,718
Stay calm. I got you.

209
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,624
Push the magnet stop.

210
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,126
Please, help him!

211
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:28,095
Oh. Oh.

212
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,197
Let's lay him down.

213
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,632
Nice and easy.

214
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,968
We need
a C-collar, now.

215
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,704
- What just happened?
-  -Let's take care of your friend,

216
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:39,807
and then we'll go over
physics 101. What's your name?

217
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,842
Not Teddy Altman.

218
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,044
-It's Cameron.
-Andrea, are you hurt?

219
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,714
-I'm fine.
I'm worried about you.
-Any neck pain, Cameron?

220
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,483
Oh, no, my left side hurts
and my chest.

221
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:51,485
This is what you call fun?

222
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,555
What do we got?

223
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,756
He brought a metal IV pole
into the MRI room.

224
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,659
The magnet pulled in the pole
and pinned him at the midline.

225
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,695
Abdominal bruising.
Let's get him to
a trauma room for an exam.

226
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,865
- On my count, ready?
- One. Two. Three.

227
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,602
Is he gonna be okay?

228
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,104
Don't worry about me.
You have to go on.
Finish the hunt.

229
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,406
Is there some kind of
big cash prize or something?

230
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:15,209
-Just pride and glory.
-Wait. You went to
Washington Union?

231
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,379
- Yeah. Third place
in my senior year.

232
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,683
The last clue. "Find
and retrieve the identifier

233
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,654
for something that looks
like itself but no longer is."

234
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,924
-Go.
-Okay.

235
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,158
Let's go.

236
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,361
- Okay.
-  -Dev, let's go this way.

237
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,600
Okay. I'm gonna go give
security a heads up on that.

238
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,435
But first, can you inform CT
that we'll likely head there

239
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,404
right after trauma?

240
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,308
Sure, Dr. Hunt.

241
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:51,478
Doesn't hurt to give them
a little head start, right?

242
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,282
You're sure
we won't get in trouble?

243
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,218
Oh, we might,
but you'll be fine.

244
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:58,819
Don't worry about it.

245
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,692
-Let me help you here.
-Oh.

246
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:05,627
There you go.

247
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,329
Hi, I'm Dr. Kwan.

248
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,197
Molly.

249
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,301
Yeah. I'm gonna jump ahead.

250
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,270
Uh, Molly, can you tell me
about your seizures?

251
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,140
Um, I've had them
since the accident,
a little over four years.

252
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,309
You've had grand mal seizures
for four years?

253
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,113
On and off.
 Some meds work for a while, but eventually they stop.

254
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,684
Right now I'm on phenytoin,
but I guess that's not working
anymore either.

255
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,219
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

256
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,357
Okay, we'll run an EEG
and see if we can classify
your seizure activity

257
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,025
and go from there, all right?

258
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,939
Between her multiple scans,
mental status exam,

259
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,308
and previous clinical findings
and tests,

260
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,444
I have no reason to say
it's anything other than
Alzheimer's.

261
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,115
Mmm. Tasha is the youngest
person I've seen with it.

262
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:04,118
-It happens.
-Yeah, it shouldn't.

263
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:11,726
No, but younger patients do
hold clues to the disease that
we didn't even know existed.

264
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,861
Maybe we will find some.

265
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,798
If Meredith and I
ever retain funding again.

266
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,237
Yes. Okay, thank you
for the consult.
I appreciate it.

267
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,679
A scavenger hunt kid stole
my badge and I haven't had time
to get a new one.

268
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,246
Thank you.

269
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,918
Cass? What are you doing here,
and how did you get in here?

270
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,355
I kept this
from when I filled in here.
Don't tell the Chief.

271
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,857
I think she'd give you a pass.

272
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,160
I had the day off and thought,

273
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,731
"Where can I go
for harsh lighting
and free coffee?"

274
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,232
David's getting a colonoscopy,

275
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,168
which is its own kind of
scavenger hunt.

276
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,571
Well, I hope his is
less eventful than the one
I'm dealing with.

277
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:00,841
Between kids stealing stuff
and crashing into MRI machines,

278
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,043
somehow I have to find the time

279
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,715
to make a slideshow
about the hospital's endowment.

280
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:11,251
I did one last week
for my sixth grader's
biology class on metamorphosis.

281
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,288
-Got an A-plus.
-Congrats. You wanna make mine?

282
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,124
-Sure, I love slideshows.
-I was joking.

283
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm not. Catch me up to speed.

284
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,294
I'll make you the best one
you've ever seen.

285
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,229
Really? Thank you so much.

286
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,132
You-You can work
from my office.
The coffee's so much better.

287
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:29,838
Can we use your badge?

288
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,407
Keep it.
You need it more than I do.

289
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,714
- Uh, Lisa's labs are up.
- Oh.

290
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,317
-No, no, no.
-I ordered exactly
what you asked.

291
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,521
-Look,
her transaminases quadrupled.
-Yeah.

292
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:50,625
Oh, and her INR doubled from
her last lab draw. Damn it.

293
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:54,495
- I don't want this!
- Calm down, Ms. Saito,
I'm just trying to help you.

294
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,063
I was just trying
to give her mucomyst.

295
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,998
I don't want that.
Get it away from me.

296
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,802
-What are you doing here?
-Well, we're trying
to help you, Lisa.

297
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,137
-No. Why are you
keeping me right now?
-No, no.

298
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,808
I have to go.
I need to go! I...

299
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,177
-She's encephalopathic.
-That happened fast.

300
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,815
Okay, so we need
to get her to the ICU.
Start her on IV mucomyst.

301
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,786
Uh, consult nephrology
for possible dialysis. Oh.

302
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:20,988
And get UNOS on my phone.

303
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,791
Okay. Okay.

304
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,458
You're okay.

305
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,197
Uh-huh. Yes, status 1A.

306
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,435
Y-Y-Yes.

307
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,204
Oh. Okay...

308
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,607
Yes, we're interested.
Yes, thank you.

309
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,177
UNOS says there's
a possible match for Lisa.

310
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,680
-Now?
-No, in this hospital.

311
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,882
- She should go to Vegas
with those odds.
- Yeah.

312
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,317
Well, I mean,
the liver isn't hers yet.

313
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,019
There's still
some deliberating...

314
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,822
-Get her chart and tell Marsh.
-Will do.

315
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:55,222
-Meredith.
-Hi.

316
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,859
Hey, I heard
that you and Marsh were here.

317
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,361
I was hoping
to speak to him
about a liver transplant.

318
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,363
We're still waiting
for the committee to decide

319
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,867
whether to allocate the liver
to another patient.

320
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,836
Excuse me?

321
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,871
You're talking
about Catherine's friend
who needs the liver transplant?

322
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,338
No.

323
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:15,510
-Oh, you... You know...
-Yeah, cancel Vegas.

324
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,913
She may not get it.
There was a big mix-up
with her medical history.

325
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,316
The committee should
make their decision soon.
They're meeting now.

326
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,490
Lisa needs that liver.
Should we talk
to the committee?

327
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:33,193
About Grey's patient
who's Catherine Fox's friend?

328
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,029
No, that is not our business.

329
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,031
It's the committee's decision.

330
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,668
You get Lisa
settled in the ICU.

331
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,611
Well, am I broken
beyond repair?

332
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,914
Uh, there's definitely
increased delta wave activity,

333
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,049
and it looks like sharp wave
complexes in the region.

334
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,286
-Even when I'm not seizing?
-Well, it's like an earthquake.

335
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,255
There's seismic activity
all the time, but...

336
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,257
...you only feel
the big ones.

337
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,926
So what do we do about it?

338
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,895
Uh, we could try
adjusting your medication.

339
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:09,229
Hmm. We should talk
to her neurologist first.

340
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,135
You're supposed to be updating
my post-op notes.

341
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:19,172
And I don't know where
you're supposed to be,
but it is definitely not here.

342
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,543
Are you running an EEG?

343
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,479
This is Molly.

344
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,115
She had a grand mal seizure
this morning.

345
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,553
-Hi.
-Is she a patient?

346
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,022
Who is her doctor?

347
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,892
-Uh...
-We are.

348
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,362
Both of you, follow me.

349
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,599
Now.

350
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,201
It's okay.

351
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:54,174
This is my department.
You are interns.

352
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,977
Do you know
what this looks like?

353
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,745
-I'm sorry. We just thought--
-When you sneak patients in,

354
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:00,113
put them in the farthest room
from the nurses' station,

355
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,416
otherwise you are begging
to be caught.

356
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,619
Yeah. We'll be more careful
next time.

357
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:07,755
- Uh, he means
there won't be a next time.

358
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,257
I thought you were
slammed today.

359
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,727
Do you want my help or not?

360
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,462
-Yeah.
-Okay.

361
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,100
Uh, still no decision
about the liver?

362
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,003
No, not yet.

363
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,271
No. If they don't decide soon,
the liver won't be
viable anymore,

364
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,541
- and then no one's
gonna get it.

365
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:30,712
- What...
- Oh.

366
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,314
I told you
to leave that alone.

367
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,951
I just volunteered
to answer any questions
the committee might have

368
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,887
-about Lisa's case.
-You just volunteered.

369
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,455
Yeah.

370
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,625
- Anything?
-  -No, we're still waiting.

371
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,793
Warren might know something.
Apparently he was just speaking
with them.

372
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,863
I'm sorry, how did you know
the committee was meeting?

373
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,965
-Well, I...
-I told them.

374
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,102
It's not exactly a secret.

375
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:59,339
The liver...

376
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,308
...will go to Lisa Saito.

377
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,245
What? Okay...

378
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,082
Sorry.

379
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:12,720
You know what?
I just don't get it.

380
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,389
You've made a career
out of finding your ways
around protocols.

381
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,392
-I don't get it.
-It was the ethical thing
to do.

382
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:22,630
Okay, well then you can
go tell Evynn her wife's
not getting the liver.

383
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,074
Hey. How's he doing?

384
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,777
Uh, still waiting on the scans,
and I'm trying to
crack this clue.

385
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:39,580
"The identifier is something
that looks like itself
but no longer is."

386
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,716
A portable X-ray machine?

387
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,184
You think the people that
made these clues know there's
a portable X-ray machine?

388
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,721
My sophomore year there
was a pleur-evac on the list.

389
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,623
Millin, what do you think?

390
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,290
Has anyone seen Andrea?
 She really wants to win this thing.

391
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,759
Glad she has goals,
and I don't play.

392
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,194
-The scans are up.
-Hmm.

393
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,732
Yeah, he has
a grade three splenic lac
with active extrava.

394
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,600
Hemodynamically stable.

395
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,401
All right, Millin,
let's get him to the IR suite
to embolize.

396
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,437
-All right.
-Looks like itself
but no longer is.

397
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,908
An ID badge.
No, that's too easy. Right?

398
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,444
That liver was hers.
She was on the OR table.

399
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,980
Because you didn't tell us
all the information.

400
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,116
I also didn't tell you
she loves animal crackers,

401
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,250
the old-school kind
in the box with the handle.

402
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,154
Or that she's seen
every episode of <i>Gossip Girl</i>
at least twice.

403
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,289
Or that she talked to her dad
every night on the way home

404
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,625
until she had to stop working
because of the Alzheimer's.

405
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,327
-I understand why you're upset.
-I don't think you do.

406
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,963
You're so focused
on your research,

407
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:30,798
you've forgotten about
the people living with it.

408
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,232
That's not true.

409
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,569
You helped hand her
a death sentence.

410
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,339
Evynn, these lights
are hurting my eyes.

411
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,242
- When are we going home?
- Soon, babe. Soon.

412
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:45,513
You said we were
gonna go home soon already.

413
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,816
-I don't wanna be here anymore.
-Me either.

414
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,219
You do know
it wasn't my decision?

415
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,622
Whatever helps
you sleep at night.

416
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,932
Any news from the team?

417
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,101
I didn't feel
the need to check.

418
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:10,138
So, Cameron, the risks
of the embolization
include bleeding,

419
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,439
-infection and kidney damage.
-Signed.

420
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,676
And we can also call
your girlfriend and give her
an update if you'd like.

421
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:18,012
Andrea? She's just my roommate.

422
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,782
Is there a reason you thought
she was my girlfriend?

423
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,618
I didn't seem, like, in love
with her or something, did I?

424
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,387
I-I was really focusing
on your injuries.

425
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:31,225
Oh, it's obvious, isn't it?
Crap. This is bad.
Do you think she knows?

426
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,326
The only way to know for sure
is to tell her.

427
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,730
Is it?
She's the roommate, friend.
You know, it's kind of risky.

428
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,199
You and Altman were friends
before you got together, right?

429
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,002
Yeah, we were friends
for 20 years
before we got together.

430
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:43,638
That's my entire life.
I don't wanna wait that long.

431
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:46,641
You could always join
the rest of us
who think that love sucks.

432
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,308
Take your shot, man.

433
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,845
Just be prepared for it to,
you know, not go your way.

434
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:54,148
I'm gonna do it.

435
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,151
-Can I borrow your phone?
-No.

436
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:00,021
- Oh, hey. Don't move.
- All right.

437
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,322
-Hey.
-I'll tell you what,
we'll find Andrea.

438
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,892
We'll bring her to you
before the procedure, okay?

439
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,527
Okay.

440
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,532
Be right back.

441
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,573
Oh, don't mind me.
Just saving your ass.

442
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:21,175
Oh, I owe you, seriously.

443
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,945
- Feel free to
gift me a spa day.

444
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,680
-You still swamped?
-Yeah.

445
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,416
The... The kid who crashed into
the MRI needs surgery.

446
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,053
I can't decide
if I'm more upset about that

447
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,256
or the fact that
I am currently out
an MRI machine

448
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,358
until we pay $50,000
in repairs.

449
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,360
They had to push
the red button.

450
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,364
I have always wanted
to push that button.

451
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,535
How is it that you are
always here when this hospital
is falling apart?

452
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,604
I've seen hospitals
that are falling apart.

453
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:50,738
I work in one of them.

454
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,540
This place is great.

455
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:57,044
-Flattery will get you
two spa days.
-I only need the one.

456
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,915
You should give yourself
the other one. You deserve it.

457
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,754
It's, um, been a little quiet.

458
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:09,422
I am gonna go
check on security.

459
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,058
Thank you again.

460
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,593
It's my pleasure.

461
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,034
How do you know Molly?

462
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,103
I'll let Kwan take this one.

463
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:27,742
We were engaged.
Now... I don't know.

464
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,280
Molly, you did great.

465
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:35,415
-Why don't you go ahead
and get her out?
-Yeah.

466
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:40,154
All right, you see how it is
lighting up in the hippocampus?

467
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:44,358
- That is temporal lobe epilepsy.
-  -Can you help her?

468
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,361
Oh, I can try.
It doesn't always work.

469
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:48,963
Let's go.

470
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,669
Molly, the focus of
your seizure activity is coming
from the hippocampus.

471
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,271
That coupled with
your developed tolerance
to drugs

472
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:59,173
makes me think
that surgery is your best bet.

473
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,975
Deep brain stimulation?

474
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:03,177
I've had quite a bit of success
with DBS in epilepsy patients.

475
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,912
I'm-I'm sorry. Um...

476
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:09,383
I'm not interested.
I don't want
any more surgeries.

477
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,319
You'd rather live
with debilitating seizures?

478
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,587
Well, I have been
living with them for years.

479
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:15,823
And yes,
they can be terrifying,

480
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,391
but you don't know
what it's like

481
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,393
to have entire years
of your life just disappear.

482
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,129
And I can't start over.
I can't.

483
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,998
-That's not going to happen.
-Dr. Kwan.

484
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,233
Molly, You can't let your fears
get in the way of your future.

485
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,437
Dr. Kwan,
why don't you wait outside?
We will finish with Molly.

486
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,807
I'm not asking.

487
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,886
Bailey, just making sure
you saw the graft on the...

488
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,688
on the donor's CT.

489
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:51,826
Uh, the distance between
the portal vein and IVC.
Yeah, I saw it.

490
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,327
Okay, good.

491
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:56,530
I'm sorry that your patient
isn't getting a liver.

492
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,265
No, no, no.
You did nothing wrong.

493
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,801
-Good luck
with Lisa's transplant.
-Mkay.

494
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,338
Griffith, did you finish
Tasha's discharge papers?

495
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:08,042
I need to go over them
with Evynn, but I think
she went to the cafeteria.

496
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,411
So, uh, Tasha doesn't know?

497
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,047
Tasha kept saying
she went to lunch with Reggie.

498
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:14,515
Extrapolated the rest.

499
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,784
-And who's Reggie?
-No idea. It could be you.

500
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,119
Yes.

501
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:21,722
Dr. Marsh, how is
Dr. Grey's research going?

502
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,357
They're looking
for more funding.

503
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:25,393
-Really hope they find it.
-Yeah.

504
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,028
My grandmother has Alzheimer's.

505
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,764
I'm sorry. How advanced is she?

506
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,532
Just moved her into
a memory care facility.

507
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:34,635
-Does she like it?
-She has a friend
named Isaac.

508
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,805
She loves the coffee cake.

509
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,373
Yeah, she's happy.

510
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:44,111
That could change any day,
but we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it. Thank you.

511
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,581
-I'll print Tasha's paperwork.
-Okay.

512
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,325
Hey, did Millin respond
to your page?

513
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,294
-Not yet.
-I feel nauseous.

514
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,364
- Cam, are you okay?
- He is in a lot of pain.

515
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,867
Do I have to be here for this?
I wanna die.

516
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:10,171
Dev, can you leave?

517
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:13,040
Uh, where am I supposed to go?

518
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:15,876
Fine.

519
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,412
Just turn around.

520
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,915
You want me to...

521
00:26:21,516 --> 00:26:22,950
Yeah.

522
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,556
I'm in love with you.

523
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,490
I have been in love with you
from the moment we met,

524
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,460
carrying your stupid
Harry Styles posters
into the dorms.

525
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,296
I wanna be with you.
And I don't care
that you're smashing Dev--

526
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:36,997
-Dude.
-Cameron.

527
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,333
He doesn't wanna
be your boyfriend, Andrea.

528
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,770
And I want everything with you.
I want...

529
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,672
Cam.
Cam, are you okay?

530
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:47,041
-He's getting hypotensive.
-Change of plan.

531
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,876
- Cameron!
- Is he gonna be okay?

532
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,377
- Take him straight to the OR.
- What's happening?

533
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,645
- Okay, let's move.
- Cameron!

534
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,619
Oh, right.

535
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,689
Ah. Slideshow is done,

536
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,024
and it is pretty kick-ass
if I do say so myself.

537
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,027
I can't thank you enough.
I may finally get
some sleep tonight.

538
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,898
It was fun. The hospital
endowment is a surprisingly
interesting topic.

539
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,299
Said no one ever.

540
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,168
You check out the slideshow
and then decide.

541
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:15,736
I need to go find my husband.

542
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,305
They've pushed his colonoscopy
till the end of the day.

543
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,374
He is probably
bribing nurses for food,

544
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:24,011
and I would rather not
lose my house
over a banana nut muffin.

545
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:27,815
Hey, um, how about, uh,
Saturday for the spa day?

546
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,586
Together? I don't think
that's a good idea.

547
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:32,920
No?

548
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,990
I'm trying to respect
your boundaries.

549
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:40,494
It's okay.
When you figure it out,
you let me know.

550
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,234
Pressures are still soft.

551
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,036
Let's hang two units of blood.

552
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,871
Looks like the bleeding
is isolated to the spleen.

553
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,174
Let's prepare to remove it.
Right angle and tie, please.

554
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:55,342
Okay, blood pressure's
picking up.

555
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:56,611
Okay.

556
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,679
- Millin, more suction.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,782
Has anyone ever died
on this scavenger hunt?

558
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,586
Uh, not that I know of.

559
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,954
I think if people were dying,
they'd cancel it. Let's not
give 'em a reason to. Okay?

560
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,123
At least they won't
cancel it over a broken heart.

561
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,425
- We really
steered him wrong.

562
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,894
- Had I known she was sleeping with the other guy...
-  -They're doomed.

563
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,566
It would have been a lot easier
if he just kept his mouth shut.

564
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,800
Removing the spleen.

565
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,872
Rest in peace, spleen.

566
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,709
Time of death: 16:31.

567
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,212
Cause of death:
sheer stupidity.

568
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,113
See? You can have fun.

569
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,748
What?

570
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:38,052
Oh. I think I just figured out
the scavenger hunt clue.

571
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:41,355
Millin, welcome to the party.
Glad to have you.

572
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:44,725
But I'm gonna need
to know what it is.

573
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:50,965
Hey, how'd it go with Shepherd?
Where did you leave things?

574
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,834
Shepherd doesn't want me
discussing the case with you.

575
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,336
Bro.

576
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:59,340
Molly's gonna talk
to her neurologist
about switching medication.

577
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,309
I thought we established
her epilepsy is refractory
to meds.

578
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,278
Yeah, but she doesn't
wanna do surgery,

579
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:06,313
so the only other option
is to hope that another drug
will work.

580
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,982
And you told her
how irresponsible that is?

581
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,117
No, I don't coerce patients
into getting surgery.

582
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:13,187
- She's not a patient.
- She's the love of my life.

583
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,792
-Have you told her that?
-It's none of your business.

584
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,161
Brain surgery is terrifying.

585
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:24,599
I wouldn't wanna do it
if I didn't know who was
waiting on the other side.

586
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:28,802
You're welcome, by the way.

587
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,006
<i>Okay, I'm here.</i>

588
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:34,509
Okay,
I-I-I know the committee's
already made its decision,

589
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,210
but I think I have a plan.

590
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,013
-My patient's on the table.
-Yes, okay.

591
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:41,982
And she will get a transplant,
but so can Tasha.

592
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,985
We do a split liver transplant.

593
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:46,954
Tasha would
get two-thirds of the liver,

594
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,056
and Lisa would
get the remaining third.

595
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,660
A third of the liver
can't nearly be enough
to regenerate and function.

596
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,028
It doesn't need to regenerate.
It will act as a bridge.

597
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,230
Lisa's liver failure
is reversible.

598
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,667
It just needs time
to heal on its own.

599
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,769
The graft will allow that
to happen.

600
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:07,841
It could save Lisa from having
to take immunosuppressants

601
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,678
-for the rest of her life.
-Yes, it would.

602
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,514
And you did say that the liver
was too big for Tasha.

603
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,716
- So, the split is a great fix.
- Yes.

604
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,984
We do that preemptively,
we save two lives.

605
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,187
It's a win-win.

606
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,827
Well, what the hell
are we waiting for?
Let's go give everybody livers.

607
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,002
-You wanna tell Evynn
the good news?
-Let's go do it together.

608
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,470
Her post-op ultrasound
looks great.

609
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,105
We should be able
to extubate her soon.

610
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,141
-Oh, that's good.
-Evynn's waiting for an update,

611
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,711
- so I'm gonna let her know.
- Um...

612
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:54,948
You know I... I didn't agree
with what she did,
but I understand it.

613
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,684
She was in a tough spot.

614
00:31:56,785 --> 00:32:00,020
She did
what she thought was best,
given the circumstances.

615
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:02,956
And I know you did too.

616
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,728
Thanks.

617
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:30,552
-Are we supposed
to be down here?
-Now you care about the rules?

618
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:33,888
Well, it's dead bodies,
so, yeah.

619
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,723
Dead bodies or...

620
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:39,193
something that looks
like itself but no longer is.

621
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,696
-We're supposed to
bring back a body?
-What? No.

622
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:45,567
No. You're... You're supposed
to bring back the identifier.

623
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,235
Toe tag.

624
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,571
Yes!

625
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,739
-Wow. You're really smart.
-Yeah, I know.

626
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,373
You know
what this means, right?

627
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,543
No one else is gonna be able
to get in the morgue.

628
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,377
We did it!

629
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,480
Hey, hey, hey,
you're surrounded
by the deceased.

630
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:00,682
Show a little respect.

631
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:02,382
-I'm so sorry.
-Sorry.

632
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,485
Get out of here
before we get caught.
Go, go, go.

633
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,997
Her vitals look good.

634
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,999
Post-op labs are reassuring.

635
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:23,872
- Yeah, things...
worked out today.
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,841
-But I need to tell you--
-You really don't.

637
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,142
Altman's evaluation came in.

638
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,379
Yeah.

639
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:37,384
Ben, you are still
in a trial period,

640
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:40,454
so can you just
stay in your lane?

641
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:44,091
Are you asking as my boss
or as my wife?

642
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:47,494
-What does it matter?
-Well, if it's my boss,
then, okay.

643
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,899
But if it's my wife,
then I'm gonna be honest.

644
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:53,400
If I can help someone,
I'm gonna do it.

645
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,938
Now, I am not
a 20-something-year-old
intern with no experience.

646
00:33:57,037 --> 00:34:01,676
I am going to do what is best
and hope my boss can see that.

647
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,846
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta finish rounds.

648
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,515
Oh, my...

649
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:14,622
Welcome back.
Surgery went great.

650
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:19,059
We're gonna have you on
your feet in a couple of days.
Just do me a favor.

651
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,628
Avoid giant magnets, okay?

652
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:22,462
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

653
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:25,299
-Can I come in?
-He just woke up.
He's not ready for--

654
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,134
-Can we talk?
-Okay.

655
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,169
I said everything
I have to say.

656
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,306
You know how
you don't have just one jacket?

657
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:35,510
You have a raincoat,
a heavy coat
for when it's really cold,

658
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,177
a light trench for spring.

659
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,547
I only have one jacket.

660
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,249
Okay.
Well, I have a lot.

661
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,586
He just had major surgery.
If this isn't urgent--

662
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:46,020
I'll get to the point.

663
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,556
You make me laugh harder
than anybody else.

664
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,257
I need that in my life.

665
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,628
But I also need Dev,
who makes me feel smart,

666
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,296
and Dean,
who makes me feel worldly.

667
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:57,632
There's a Dean?

668
00:34:57,732 --> 00:35:00,868
I'm 21.
I'm not ready to settle down.

669
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,870
But you are my best friend.

670
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,939
And I hope I didn't ruin that.

671
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,775
I make you laugh the hardest?

672
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,409
Don't get cocky.

673
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,779
Hey, get a little cocky.

674
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,681
We won the scavenger hunt.

675
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,449
-Holy crap.
-We won?

676
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,384
I mean, you won?

677
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,453
That's... Congratulations.
I mean, that...

678
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:21,556
You're gonna have that forever.

679
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,567
Don't get up. I'm just gonna
check her JP drain.

680
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,168
It'll just take me a minute.

681
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:39,974
She has good days and bad days,

682
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:43,611
but every second
I get to spend with her
is a gift, so thank you.

683
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,916
My mother had Alzheimer's,
so I know the hell
you're living in.

684
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:54,488
I'm sorry
if I implied otherwise.

685
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,792
Everything looks good.

686
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,863
You know, my research is
always about the people.

687
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,865
I never forget that.

688
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,265
Understood.

689
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,045
Is she still
not speaking to you?

690
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,614
-She might not ever again.
-Oh, she will.

691
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:22,083
-But it just may
take her a while.
-What makes you so sure?

692
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,251
She told me
the two of you are like family.

693
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,021
Reconciling family is
very important to her.

694
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,189
She just needs a minute, maybe.

695
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:37,965
She'll come around. Take care.

696
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,814
Hey, you want a ride?

697
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:55,717
No, I am going out tonight.

698
00:36:56,517 --> 00:37:00,621
There's a lot of people
out there having fun,
and I wanna be one of them.

699
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:03,658
- I'll be at Joe's
if you wanna join.

700
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:07,394
-Hard day?
-You could say that.

701
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,597
You wanna go to Joe's
and talk about it?

702
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:11,999
I have a bid whist date.

703
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,300
Your... Your grandma?

704
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,169
Yeah, haven't seen her
in a while.

705
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,571
You should go get a drink.

706
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,906
But what if I'd rather
play bid whist?

707
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,979
-Seriously?
-You had a hard day.

708
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,248
I wanna be there for you.
Both of you.

709
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,551
Thank you.

710
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,321
Plus, when you're tired,
you're easier to beat at cards.

711
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,592
- That is the only way
you can beat me.

712
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,299
Oh.

713
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,275
Before you drove away
that night,

714
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:58,813
I asked if you wanted
to cancel the wedding,

715
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,649
and you said
you needed to think.

716
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,055
"Wait for me," you said.

717
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,959
I am still waiting
for you, Molly.

718
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,495
As long as it takes,
whatever it takes, I'll wait.

719
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:19,133
And I'm sorry I tried
to pressure you into surgery,

720
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:22,170
but I just...
I just don't wanna
see you suffer anymore.

721
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,178
I've been doing some research.

722
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:32,213
And did you know

723
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:36,449
that there are experimental
surgeries for amnesiacs
to regain their memories?

724
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,587
What does that have to do
with your seizures?

725
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:43,090
Well, do you think Dr. Shepherd
would try it?

726
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:48,729
If I get the seizure surgery,
my brain will be open anyway.

727
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,234
You don't want
a standard procedure,

728
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,736
but you'll let Shepherd
experiment on your brain?

729
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:59,040
I know, I know.
It sounds like science fiction,

730
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,910
but more than stopping
my seizures,

731
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,181
more than anything,
I want to remember you.

732
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:15,957
So, if Dr. Shepherd will try
to get my memories back...

733
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:19,927
I'll do the surgery.

734
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,430
<i>After a terminal diagnosis,</i>

735
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:25,199
<i>it's hard to trust</i>
<i>the good days,</i>

736
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:28,468
<i>when every second,</i>
<i>the clock is counting down.</i>

737
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,175
We just got new labs in
for Tasha.

738
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,612
Okay, her lactate
is coming down.
That's promising.

739
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:41,381
Well, she still
has Alzheimer's.
That won't get easier.

740
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:44,719
No.

741
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:51,559
Listen,
I didn't see you in Tasha.

742
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:55,428
-You don't have to explain.
-No, no, no, I want to.
I, um...

743
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,501
I... I saw myself in Evynn.

744
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,238
Yeah.

745
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:08,743
Look, you just gotta know
that if I were in her position,

746
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:11,045
I wouldn't stop
fighting for you.

747
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:13,614
I wouldn't.

748
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,517
I wouldn't either.

749
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,290
I can't imagine my life
without you.

750
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:26,294
Same.

751
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,539
-I think we just
agreed on something.
-Yeah.

752
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,376
<i>But what if you stopped</i>
<i>fixating on what you will lose,</i>

753
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:45,379
<i>rather than</i>
<i>what you already have?</i>

754
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,083
-Hey.
-Hey.

755
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:54,021
Listen, I...
I need to tell you something.

756
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,756
That's ominous.

757
00:40:56,891 --> 00:41:00,728
The last time
she was at the hospital,
Nora tried to kiss me.

758
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:04,031
I didn't wanna tell you
because nothing happened.

759
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,501
I pulled away.
And I didn't want you
to get upset for no reason.

760
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,173
And she has texted me
a couple times
other than this morning,

761
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:15,142
and it started
to feel dishonest.

762
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:18,145
And I never wanna lie to you.

763
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,647
Thank you.

764
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,785
I also wanna be
honest with you.

765
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,688
I bumped into Cass today.

766
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,992
So, I... I think...

767
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,462
I think I might be
attracted to her.

768
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,334
Well...

769
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,873
What does that mean?
- I don't... I don't know.

770
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,978
I mean...

771
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:54,849
I love you.

772
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:57,852
And I love you.

773
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,391
What's gonna happen with us?

774
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:08,195
I don't know.

775
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,035
<i>Can you take this moment,</i>

776
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:17,204
<i>just this moment,</i>
<i>and breathe it in?</i>
