1
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>Before we operate,</i>

2
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:12,150
<i>we place drapes
over our patient,</i>

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,531
<i>exposing only the area
where we'll be working.</i>

4
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,159
<i>They not only help us focus
on what we need to see,</i>

5
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,299
<i>but they keep the field clean</i>

6
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:25,094
<i>and minimize debris
getting in the way.</i>

7
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,786
Incoming! And I don't
have a lot of time.

8
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,729
Do you want to use one of our
other three bathrooms to vomit?

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,583
Shh!

10
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,044
I feel decent for the first
time in weeks, so don't jinx it.

11
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,115
Oh, and don't forget we have
our first OB appointment today.

12
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,417
I thought - that was after work.
- It is.

13
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,706
- So what's the rush?
- Well, the kids are still asleep,

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,697
my charts are done,

15
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,631
and I've got just enough
time for a quick shower.

16
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,609
♪ Pull me back, let that
slingshot set me free ♪

17
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,359
How quick?

18
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:52,259
If it's too quick,
I'll kill you.

19
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:57,298
<i>Drapes are specialized to fit
the needs of various surgeries.</i>

20
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,024
<i>The challenge comes</i>

21
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:00,795
<i>when there's a complication
under the drape.</i>

22
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,476
Oh, and we switched
to a new EMR.

23
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:05,617
Now you select the
medication on top

24
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:07,388
and then scroll all the way
down to enter the dosage.

25
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:08,827
Makes no sense.

26
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:10,598
Medication up top. Dosage
on the bottom. Got it.

27
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,073
And you only allowed
two pairs of scrubs now.

28
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,350
It's all automated.

29
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,179
Miranda, I've been
a resident before.

30
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:17,743
- I'll be okay.
- You're not nervous?

31
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,803
No, I feel great.
It's like coming home.

32
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,495
Dr. Bailey, welcome back.

33
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,186
Yeah, welcome back
to the both of you.

34
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:26,465
Oh, Warren, do... do
you know a Dr. Ndugu?

35
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,374
Are you kidding? I tore up the
dance floor at his wedding.

36
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:29,582
My moves were basically a meme.

37
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:31,229
I was like, "uh, uh!"

38
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:32,437
How's Catherine?

39
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,439
Oh, feeling better every day,

40
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,210
especially now that we know the
biopsy results were negative.

41
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:38,063
Thank God. She wants
to throw a party.

42
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,445
Caviar and champagne,

43
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,250
and not the kind you get from
your regular grocery store.

44
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,345
Well, I'd expect no
less. Send her our best.

45
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,002
- Will do.
- Okay.

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,418
This... means stop talking.

47
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,731
What? Ndugu and Pierce
are getting a divorce.

48
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,146
- Oh.
- Aw.

49
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:54,700
<i>When the body's draped,</i>

50
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,255
<i>we can't see something going
pale or a leg turning blue.</i>

51
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,843
I refuse to be late on
Bailey's first day back.

52
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:01,890
Tell that to the guy who
took a 20-minute shower.

53
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,314
Says the guy who
doesn't live there.

54
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,297
Hey. There was a
fistfight on my bus.

55
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,919
I thought I was gonna be late.

56
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:09,094
Hey. Where's your sister?

57
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:11,200
We want to meet your mini-Mika.

58
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:14,306
Late, and we're
not alike at all.

59
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,205
<i>When we can't see
the whole body,</i>

60
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,517
<i>we might miss a telltale
sign something's gone wrong.</i>

61
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:20,347
Thank you.

62
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,595
Sorry. I left my
phone on the plane,

63
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,332
and the line for the
bathroom was really long,

64
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,117
and then Dumbledore
missed the freeway exit.

65
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,784
My rideshare driver
looked just like him.

66
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,293
I couldn't see it.

67
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,053
Yep. Not alike at all.

68
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,297
That's Lucas,
a.k.a. Skywalker,

69
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,438
Simone, Blue, and, uh, Jules.

70
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,060
Hi.

71
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,096
This is my youngest
sister, Chloe.

72
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,099
I have cancer.

73
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,722
Don't be late for Bailey.

74
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,448
We'll see you later.

75
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,351
Come here. It's gonna be okay.

76
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,008
Dr. Webber is the best.

77
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,114
We'll figure this out.

78
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:05,944
Come on.

79
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,117
Huh?

80
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,570
Here is the overnight
roster list.

81
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,986
You need to follow up
on Ms. Borgman's CT,

82
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:16,748
and there are two rule-out
appy consults in the ER

83
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,439
waiting for ultrasounds.

84
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,407
Good morning to you, too.

85
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:22,039
Not all of us just spent
two weeks in Paris.

86
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:24,618
Clearly. Mm.

87
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,171
This is nothing
like a café crème.

88
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,869
Will you just take
this so I can go home

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,623
and face plant onto my pillow?

90
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,832
Morning. Good morning.

91
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,249
I mean, uh, hi. I... Hey.

92
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:38,942
This is James, the
hospital chaplain.

93
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,392
<i>Enchanté.</i>

94
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,084
Taryn.

95
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,570
- You work nights?
- I work when I'm needed.

96
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,227
Is that from the coffee cart?

97
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,021
Oh, no. I drink French now.

98
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,689
It's, uh, Le Gateau
Jolie down the street.

99
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,819
Okay.

100
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,752
I could use some coffee.

101
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,513
Would you want to go for a walk?

102
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,343
<i>Oui.</i> Oh! That's
French for "yes."

103
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,091
Nice to meet you.

104
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:08,627
Welcome back, boy.

105
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,665
So Bailey's her husband's
boss. Is that allowed?

106
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,677
Oh, one of your aunts is
head of the neuro department,

107
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,127
and your other aunt's
name is on the building.

108
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,162
Heron hired him before she left.

109
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:17,371
Everyone says he's impressive.

110
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,741
Bring it. You
all slow me down.

111
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,359
Oh, my God. He's not
your competition.

112
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:22,020
He's a fourth year
on a trial basis

113
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:23,515
until the ACGME
approves him to stay.

114
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,757
Well, there's a finite
number of people

115
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,956
who can fit around
an operating table.

116
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:30,304
Everyone is my competition,
including Mr. Dr. Bailey.

117
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:33,618
Uh, it's Warren,
actually. Ben Warren.

118
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,517
Looking forward to working
with you again, Dr. Kwan.

119
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:37,775
I see you've met Dr. Warren.

120
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,520
Yes, he is my husband.

121
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:41,418
No, he will not be
getting special treatment.

122
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,352
As for the rest of you,

123
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,287
any bad habits you picked up
while I was gone... lose them.

124
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,737
You have four months
left in your intern year.

125
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,395
I want you sprinting
to that finish line.

126
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,190
Understood?

127
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,950
All right. Helm has
your assignments.

128
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,091
Any problems, she'll be
happy to hear about it.

129
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,024
Get to work.

130
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:04,959
Okay, Griffith is with Ndugu.
Warren and Kwan, to the pit.

131
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,030
Adams and Millin with me.

132
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:10,102
Ah. Oh.

133
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>Dr. Agana to PEDS ICU.</i>

134
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,592
<i>Dr. Rachel Agana...</i>

135
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,146
100 unread e-mails after
operating all night.

136
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,113
Why do I like this job again?

137
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,908
Were you in the OR? Yeah.

138
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,496
Nasty bus accident
at the airport.

139
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,922
I was called in around
4:00. Kids are at my mom's.

140
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,604
Oh, no. Why didn't
you call me?

141
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,902
I didn't want to disturb you
while you were in surgery.

142
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,067
- What's wrong?
- I had muffins and bagels delivered to the house

143
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,724
because you've been on the
morning routine so often,

144
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,070
I wanted to take care
of breakfast for you.

145
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,313
You should have said something.

146
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,546
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

147
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:40,730
Do you think that your mom could
go over there and grab them?

148
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,583
I am in back-to-back meetings,

149
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,733
and Richard wants the
quarterly budget report

150
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,965
before it goes to the board.

151
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,415
Sounds like you need a break.

152
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,382
That is the opposite
of what I need.

153
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,971
Trust me. I had your job.
You have to pace yourself.

154
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,904
This job is very
different than the job

155
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:56,148
you had 10 years ago, but,
um, thanks for the tip.

156
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,358
I'm just trying to help.

157
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,222
I have to go fire an
anesthesiologist. Okay.

158
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,261
Uh, you said we'd
be saving lives.

159
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,022
I said you'd be
helping to save lives.

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,267
You are contributing to one of
the most memorable experiences

161
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,511
in a medical
student's education,

162
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,030
providing the opportunity
to learn human anatomy

163
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,283
while developing their
own understanding

164
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,102
of what it means to be human.

165
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,519
Uh, are those... I
hate this already.

166
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,245
Cadavers for Ander-Simmons's
med school anatomy lab.

167
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,282
We scan them so
students have images

168
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,802
to help them diagnose
how their cadavers died

169
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,769
during their
anatomy-class dissection.

170
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,427
- Good luck.
- Uh, you're not helping?

171
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,187
<i>Ce n'est pas la mer à boire.</i>

172
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,675
Pretty sure that
means "we're screwed."

173
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,991
<i>Dr. Karascos to PEDS.</i>

174
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,408
<i>Dr. Vivianne Karascos to PEDS.</i>

175
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,168
Dr. Ndugu.

176
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:53,033
Am I getting out of here today?

177
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:55,587
This pneumonia's taking
up all of my field time.

178
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,107
I supposed to be out
blocking the half-time show.

179
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,178
Mr. Riley's a high
school band director.

180
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:02,525
You win the state championship
three times in a row?

181
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,701
Oh, come on, don't take the
fourth one away from me.

182
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,980
All right, well, we'll make this quick
so you can get back to it, all right?

183
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:12,293
- Dr. Griffith.
- Darren Riley, 55, history of smoking

184
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,330
and pulmonary
fibrosis, admitted for

185
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,677
multi-drug-resistant
gram negative pneumonia,

186
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:19,369
currently on seven liters
nasal cannula and Vanc-Zosyn.

187
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,165
Oh, there's music in
the voice. You sing?

188
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:23,926
No, but I marched
in high school.

189
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,928
Birds of a feather.

190
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:26,756
Which instrument?

191
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,171
Trombone.

192
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,622
Oh, former 'bone
player and a doctor.

193
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,314
- That's not bad.
- It's not.

194
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,247
SATs are low, despite
the nasal cannula.

195
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:36,777
Okay, uh, let's put
him on high flow

196
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,975
and then get him to CT.

197
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:41,471
Dr. Griffith's gonna take you - for some scans.
- More scans?

198
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,815
We're doing everything we can
to get you out of here, okay?

199
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,156
Stay close. No local family,

200
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,054
and his last ABG
came back borderline.

201
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:56,303
I reviewed your
scans with radiology.

202
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,548
There is some
suspicious-appearing lymph nodes.

203
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:02,965
It's likely stage 3B
rectal cancer due to...

204
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,346
Wait. 3B? I thought it was 2A.

205
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,142
Mimi, can you just stop moving?

206
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,938
Sorry.

207
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay. Uh, what happens next?

208
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,977
Chemotherapy? Radiation?

209
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,186
Correct. Mm, surgery
is a possibility,

210
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:18,946
depending on the
tumor's response.

211
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,260
- Will I lose my hair?
- It's possible.

212
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,744
What other side
effects are there?

213
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:26,091
Oh, it varies from
patient to patient.

214
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,301
Radiation often causes
impaired ovarian function.

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,476
There is nausea and fatigue,

216
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,272
and changes in mood and
weight are common, too.

217
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,171
I won't be able to have kids?

218
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,831
We'll have you talk to an
OB/GYN about your options.

219
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,593
Do you have any other
questions for me?

220
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,363
How long does
chemo usually take?

221
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,824
Wait. So you went from
Wyoming to Raleigh

222
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:10,998
to St. Louis to Seattle?

223
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,696
There were a bunch
of places in between.

224
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,244
I-I did the whole global-nomad
thing before divinity school.

225
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,659
I've only ever lived here.

226
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,593
But you travel, right?

227
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:23,632
Well, I used to visit my
grandparents in Illinois.

228
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,890
Well, but then how did you
end up becoming a chaplain?

229
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,948
I grew up in Wyoming with
two devout Episcopal parents.

230
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:34,021
I-I love them, but it
was, uh, complicated.

231
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,852
Was it like a... like a
hard coming-out thing or...?

232
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,821
No, not really. Um,
I'm an only child,

233
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,273
and I always felt this pressure
to be their everything.

234
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:48,104
And, uh, I don't
know, I needed space.

235
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,900
So left home, never looked back.

236
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,800
And then they died.

237
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,836
I'm so sorry.

238
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,459
Yeah, I wish I had a more noble
reason for becoming a chaplain.

239
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,290
But truth is, I only
really found my faith again

240
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,500
because of grief, guilt.

241
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,891
Sometimes you have
to help yourself

242
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,262
in order to help others.

243
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,747
That's very poetic.

244
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,818
That's my mother.

245
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,821
She's a whole
other conversation.

246
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,443
You know, I have time.

247
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,204
Wanna get lunch?

248
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:21,379
Yeah.

249
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:22,898
I called up CT.

250
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,565
They know we'll be
there in two minutes.

251
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,488
They told us to come
in in Trauma One.

252
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
Warren, nice to see you back

253
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,087
on this side of
the ambulance bay.

254
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:32,908
On a trial basis for
now. You back full time?

255
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,289
But don't go easy. I'm
just another resident.

256
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,387
Well, uh, why don't you
warm up with some sutures?

257
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,915
We have a small thigh
lac in bed three.

258
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,295
I just gave her some lido.

259
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,228
And Kwan, you can help him out.

260
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,576
After you.

261
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:50,201
Uh, Ms. Dunn.

262
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,444
I'm Dr. Warren, and
this is Dr. Kwan.

263
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:54,446
Judith is fine. Not Judy.

264
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,586
Judy is my mother, and
she talks to her plants.

265
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,140
Judith it is.

266
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,738
So it says here you have
a cut on your thigh.

267
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,246
Let's take a look.
Roll over, please.

268
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:04,422
Okay.

269
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:11,118
Okay. Uh...

270
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,706
It's my own dumb fault. Oh.

271
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:16,848
Six-inch stilettos
and tequila don't mix.

272
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:18,781
Oh. What was the occasion?

273
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,818
The tequila was for
my friend's birthday.

274
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,199
The heels were for my new peach.

275
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:26,099
I got a BBL two months ago...

276
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,997
a Brazilian butt lift.

277
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,896
Oh. We're familiar.

278
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,278
Careful, Doctor.

279
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,349
All that drool could
stain your white coat.

280
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,258
No, no, no, it's, um...
it's not what you think.

281
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:39,802
Um, I grabbed the wrong sutures.

282
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,218
Can you grab me a 4-oh-monocryl?

283
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,440
Uh, I was just getting a
better future for your cut.

284
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:48,224
How are you feeling?
You need more lidocaine?

285
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,019
I don't feel the cut
anymore, but, ugh,

286
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,022
it's my hip - that's killing me.
- From the fall?

287
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,620
I finally feel well enough to
take this booty out for a spin,

288
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,370
and now my hip's
hurting like hell.

289
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,958
Ah, it's probably just bruising,

290
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:00,512
but we'll get some labs
and X-rays just to be safe.

291
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,421
Can you grab the labs and
I'll take care of the X-rays?

292
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,861
You got it, boss.

293
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,454
Oh!

294
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,363
Oh, why is it that everybody
who donates their body

295
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,079
to science weighs
like 800 pounds?

296
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,953
They don't. They just can't
change their center of gravity

297
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,186
like live people. They're
literally dead weight.

298
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,405
Okay. Can you... Can you
hold your side up more?

299
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:21,430
I am. He's sagging.

300
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,949
I don't think he cares.

301
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,709
Oh!

302
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:29,610
Well, the good news is, uh,
we only have 29 left of these.

303
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,095
What's the bad news?

304
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:35,581
He's on feet first.

305
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,424
Uh, Griffith?

306
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,978
How busy are you?

307
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,463
I'm almost done inputting
orders for Dr. Ndugu.

308
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,604
And then I should start
rounds in about 20 minutes.

309
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,848
Oh, uh, just enough
time to run to the pit.

310
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,504
You need something there?

311
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:04,576
There are a couple of patients
on Dr. Hunt's service.

312
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,061
Can you check on them for me?

313
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,959
You need me to add
someone to my roster list?

314
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,273
Oh, no. No. Uh, just see
how things are going.

315
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,137
Like, check and
see if the patients

316
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,277
are satisfied with
their care here?

317
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,727
Um, you don't need to
<i>say</i> anything to them.

318
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:21,455
Just discreetly observe.

319
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,665
See how the patients are doing.

320
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,463
See how the
doctors... are doing.

321
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,951
Got it. And then I should
circle back with you after.

322
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,529
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

323
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,338
We typically recommend
hormone-replacement therapy

324
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,963
for the loss of estrogen
production and fertility.

325
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,655
So that would allow me to
have kids later if I want.

326
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,312
Well, there's no guarantees,

327
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,590
<i>but i</i> f you want to
increase your chances,

328
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:55,248
many patients opt to retrieve
and freeze their eggs.

329
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,974
What do you think?

330
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,352
Uh, It'll take at least a month

331
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,598
to do a round of egg retrieval.

332
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,428
That's if your body responds
to the hormones correctly.

333
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,017
The cancer could spread to a
later stage during that time.

334
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,675
There are other options, right?

335
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:12,127
At this time, egg freezing is
the most effective and common.

336
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,232
Okay. Find something else.

337
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,993
Look at other
colorectal cancer cases.

338
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:16,959
- Meet with your department.
- Yasuda...

339
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,719
There has to be a way.

340
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,411
It's okay, Mimi.

341
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,206
I'm not sure I really
want kids anyway.

342
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,384
Warren, nice to see you back.

343
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:30,179
What do we got?

344
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,397
Uh, 34-year-old female,
history of type-two diabetes.

345
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,228
Tripped and fell onto her
left thigh three days ago.

346
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,668
Sustained a thigh laceration,

347
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,166
but has pain with weight bearing
that's getting more severe.

348
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,156
- How are her labs?
- Still waiting.

349
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,330
I just called to
put a rush on it.

350
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:44,868
You think it's a
hip joint effusion?

351
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:46,447
I couldn't tell you.
This is a lateral hip.

352
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,266
I need an AP view.

353
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,166
I-I don't know what happened.
I ordered an X-ray series.

354
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,478
Oh, the system is
a little funky.

355
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:55,767
You gotta go to the dropdown - to order the AP view.
- Oh.

356
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,311
Hip joint effusions are
difficult to see on X-rays.

357
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,761
A CT scan would give
better visibility.

358
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
Kwan's right. Page us
when you've got it.

359
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,110
Mm.

360
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,432
You want me to show you how...

361
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,906
No, I-I got it. I got it.

362
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,152
- Oh!
- Oh!

363
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,948
- Whoa!
- Oh.

364
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,435
Are you okay?

365
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,610
Chloe's cancer is more
advanced than we thought.

366
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:22,922
I'm so sorry.

367
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,234
Webber asked
Dr. Sugihara to see her.

368
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:27,478
Chief of Oncology. That's
good. It's terrible.

369
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,496
She has to start chemo
and radiation right away,

370
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:31,938
which means she doesn't have
time to protect her fertility.

371
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,623
Oh. Does she <i>want</i> kids?

372
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,350
She's 22.

373
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,111
She doesn't know what she
wants for breakfast tomorrow.

374
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:43,252
She's the eighth out
of eight sisters.

375
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,771
She spent her whole life

376
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:47,256
getting dragged to our
practices, our recitals.

377
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:49,431
She only ever had hand-me-downs.

378
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,202
Always had to watch us
on the roller coasters

379
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,400
because she wasn't tall enough.

380
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,275
And now that she's
<i>finally</i> out of our shadows

381
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,060
and starting to
live her own life...

382
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,131
this.

383
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,064
Her future should be wide open,

384
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:05,102
not limited by an awful disease.

385
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,621
Well, at least she'll
still be alive.

386
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,623
What is <i>that</i> supposed to mean?

387
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,316
Nothing. I'm just trying
to look on the bright side.

388
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:15,181
My sister has cancer.
There is no bright side.

389
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,399
But you wouldn't
get that, would you?

390
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,184
Because you don't have sisters.

391
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:20,403
You have one brother who thinks
celery juice changes lives,

392
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,326
and you don't even like him.

393
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,476
So please don't pretend to
understand what this feels like.

394
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,054
You never will.

395
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,759
No. No way. You're living
in complete fantasy.

396
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,761
You asked my opinion.

397
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,014
Well, I wasn't expecting
it to be wrong.

398
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,626
I am a man of science.

399
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,628
I don't know what
else to tell you.

400
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,019
The <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
can go faster than light.

401
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,182
It has hyperdrive.

402
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,977
That thing breaks
down more often

403
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,634
than my mom's old Ford Taurus.

404
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,452
It made the Kessel Run
in under 12 parsecs.

405
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:00,295
The Kessel Run tests
navigation, not speed.

406
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,400
The <i>Enterprise</i> is
exponentially faster.

407
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,954
How do you figure? Warp
1 is the speed of light.

408
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,760
Even the original <i>Enterprise</i>
went up to Warp 5.

409
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,407
- Who are you?
- So you would rather be the captain

410
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,616
of the <i>Enterprise</i> than Han Solo?

411
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,754
Obviously.

412
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:13,836
Do you want to go
back to my place?

413
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,551
Obviously.

414
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:42,923
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

415
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,580
I thought you were
on cardio today.

416
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,617
I am. I had to run
downstairs for something.

417
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,620
Well, I'm, uh...

418
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,173
glad I got to see you.

419
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,554
Mm.

420
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:57,800
Hi.

421
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,567
Can I ask you a
hypothetical question? Yeah.

422
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,121
If you were asked to review
a colleague's performance

423
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,468
and they made an
inconsequential mistake,

424
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,263
would you mention it?

425
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,300
Are we getting peer reviewed?

426
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,406
No, more of a
informal observation.

427
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,350
- Will they get in trouble?
- I don't think so.

428
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:23,136
Okay, so, uh, nothing
major went wrong,

429
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:25,138
and there are no consequences.

430
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,588
I think you answered
my question.

431
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,351
How's your project with Helm?

432
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:34,527
Is it something
fun? Deathly boring?

433
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:35,838
Definitely the latter.

434
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,082
Mm.

435
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,055
Your sister went
outside to get some air

436
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,436
and call your parents.

437
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,681
Oh.

438
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,822
Colorectal cancer and
fertility studies.

439
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,651
Just educating myself.

440
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,215
I know you want things
to be better for Chloe.

441
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,758
She's my sister.

442
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,209
And you're also a surgeon.

443
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:04,522
We like to believe we can
solve everyone's problems.

444
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,810
I really thought there'd
be other options,

445
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,354
but Wilson's right.

446
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,666
You know...

447
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:15,982
I've seen a lot of cancer
patients in my career.

448
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,227
And no matter the type or stage,

449
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,402
the treatment process...
it's grueling.

450
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,646
Some people say the
side effects of it

451
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,096
or just as horrible
as the cancer itself.

452
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,168
Everyone has the same questions,

453
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:31,860
and they reckon with
the same concerns.

454
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,897
Cancer is universal that way.

455
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:36,830
It's universal.

456
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,739
What if I can find a precedent
for protecting fertility

457
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:41,525
when treating other cancers?

458
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,223
Then I'd be willing
to bet it's relevant

459
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:44,942
to colorectal cancer, too.

460
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,813
Oh, Jo. Jo.

461
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,849
Ben Warren. Oh, my God!

462
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,931
You missed me, I missed
you. It's great to be back.

463
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:00,337
I just gave someone a heparin
drip instead of prophylaxis.

464
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,235
How do I stop it?

465
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,306
Oh, yeah. The new EMR
system is confusing.

466
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,135
Okay, type in the
patient's MRN there,

467
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,242
and then you are
gonna click here.

468
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,830
- Okay.
- Here.

469
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:11,693
- Okay.
- You're done.

470
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,660
Okay.

471
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,120
I've had three careers.
You think I'd remember that

472
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,422
the first day is always rough.

473
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,010
- It'll get better.
- Kwan is lapping me,

474
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,402
and he's only been a
doctor eight months.

475
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,601
You'll be fine. You've
been off fighting fires.

476
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,501
I went from splicing intestines
to delivering babies,

477
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,779
and I still have no
idea what day it is,

478
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,090
and I'm a constant mess.

479
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,645
Yeah? What's new in your life?

480
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,543
Can you keep it a secret?

481
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,786
Yeah.

482
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,684
Yasuda, are you okay?

483
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,893
I need your help.

484
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,619
Okay.

485
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:47,315
Hey. Turkey burgers
from the cafeteria.

486
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,593
Listen, I think earlier
I might have, uh...

487
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:52,078
Insinuated that you know
the job better than me?

488
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,770
You're lucky I'm hungry.

489
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,565
Hey, would you ever
get a butt lift?

490
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,981
Uh, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not suggesting...

491
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,569
you are... you are perfect.

492
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,330
But there's a woman in the ER.

493
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,402
She just had one, and,
uh, I don't get it.

494
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,679
What don't you get?

495
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,819
Well, it's a surgery
with risks, and why?

496
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:10,579
So you can wear
different clothes?

497
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,375
Wait. You think that this
woman underwent anesthesia,

498
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:16,309
had surgeons cut into her
glutes, suck fat from her belly,

499
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,311
and put it back in her butt

500
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:21,141
just so that she could
wear different clothes?

501
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
I mean, why else
would she do it?

502
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:25,560
Let me break it down for you.

503
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,572
The world that you live
in, where you do a good job

504
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:28,942
and you get rewarded for it...

505
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,806
that is not the world
that women live in.

506
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:33,084
In our world, you
can be smarter,

507
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,948
you can work harder,

508
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,297
but the prettier person who
has a more desirable body

509
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,609
most always gets ahead because

510
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:43,854
the people who decide that
are almost always men.

511
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:47,616
So before we rush to judge the
woman for being so desperate

512
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:49,825
that she underwent surgery
to change her body,

513
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,413
maybe we should think about

514
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,450
how our culture prioritizes
the wrong things

515
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:55,624
and think about how
we can change that.

516
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,661
I was just asking.

517
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,801
And I was just answering.

518
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,216
Sorry. I have to take this.

519
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,907
Um, thank you for the burger.

520
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,358
Yeah. No. Um, I
want to review that.

521
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:06,784
I never thought I'd say this,

522
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,741
but I am missing Pearl.

523
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,235
Is that your partner
or your friend?

524
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,192
My booty pillow.

525
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,884
These cheeks could
use a good cushion.

526
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,506
Are you in more pain?

527
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,336
A little.

528
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,993
Well, the scans will be quick,
so just try to sit still.

529
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,454
I know what you're thinking.

530
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:23,342
<i>Trust me.</i>

531
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,585
<i>My family gave me grief
for getting surgery, too.</i>

532
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:28,208
But for 30 years, no one
blinked an eye at me.

533
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,590
I was a sidekick
with a pancake butt.

534
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:35,250
But then overnight,
I became the star.

535
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,564
I've never felt more
empowered in my own skin.

536
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:40,062
Forget the jobs
that work from home

537
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,567
and the movies on the couch.

538
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:46,088
I'm planning on taking this
beauty all across town.

539
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,263
Oh, the labs are in.

540
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,611
- White count is 18,000.
- That can't be right.

541
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:53,613
Are you sure you're
looking at the right value?

542
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,626
Yeah, I'm more than familiar
with our lab results system.

543
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,169
If you want to rerun them,
I'll let Dr. Hunt know.

544
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,309
These numbers are
off the charts.

545
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:03,209
Scans are up.

546
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,763
You see that? Extensive
signs of infection

547
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,214
to the muscle along
the fascial planes.

548
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,423
Are we done?

549
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,401
Judith, I'm gonna have
to check your hip again.

550
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,428
May I? Yeah.

551
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,466
Is that...
Necrotizing fasciitis.

552
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,191
Someone help me
with this gurney?

553
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,583
What's going on?
What's happening?

554
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,067
You have a fast-moving
soft-tissue infection.

555
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:24,989
But don't worry. We're faster.

556
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:27,140
I need you to page the attendings
and book an OR right now.

557
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,269
On my count. One, two, three.

558
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,727
I like that painting.

559
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,945
Get to wake up to the sunrise
even when it's raining.

560
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:47,909
I thought you were gonna say,
even in the middle of the day,

561
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,429
Mm. That, too. Mm-hmm.

562
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,087
I, um...

563
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,814
I got it at an
Italian restaurant.

564
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,093
Is it Nicoletti's?

565
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:04,581
No, it was a little
cafe in Cortona, Italy.

566
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,999
I was going through
a rough time,

567
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,861
so I booked a
redeye to Florence.

568
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,173
And I told myself I would
visit every art museum

569
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:14,487
between there and Vatican City.

570
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,560
I strained my neck, gazing
at Michelangelo's work

571
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:22,322
in the Sistine
Chapel, and, uh...

572
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,463
I don't know. When
I saw that sunrise,

573
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,016
it lifted something up in me.

574
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:34,334
So I asked the restaurant owner
if he would sell it to me.

575
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,648
You know how
sometimes you just...

576
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:40,237
feel a strong connection?

577
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,514
I do.

578
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,497
Page me as soon as
his ABG gets back.

579
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,015
Dr. Ndugu's asking.

580
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,193
Dr. Griffith?

581
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:11,302
So how was everything with
the patient in the ER?

582
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,132
Things seem smooth?

583
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,375
Everything appeared in control.

584
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,069
I don't think you have anything
to worry about on the case.

585
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,796
Wait. You <i>think</i> or you know?

586
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,212
Are we talking about
Big-Booty Judy, or... right.

587
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:32,013
Look, um, it's not that I
don't think he will succeed.

588
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:34,256
Um, I also want to make sure

589
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:37,018
that he has an
objective experience,

590
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:39,917
the same treatment as everyone.

591
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,644
And if <i>I</i> go down there,

592
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:48,132
my appearance in the room
takes away that objectivity.

593
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,100
I can spare another
five minutes.

594
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,308
Thank you.

595
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,590
So you'd move my
ovaries into my abdomen?

596
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:00,248
We'd move them up and attach
them to the abdominal wall

597
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,422
so they're out of the
field of radiation.

598
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,080
Has this been done before?

599
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:07,669
Ovarian transposition
is often used to help

600
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,776
preserve the fertility of
cervical cancer patients,

601
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:14,262
but there's no reason it
couldn't apply to your case.

602
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,953
I'd be able to have kids later?

603
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,232
There is a 50% to
80% success rate.

604
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,924
That's better than zero.

605
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,789
And if we can preserve
your ovarian function,

606
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:27,068
then you likely will not
need hormone replacements.

607
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,588
This is great.
Thank you so much.

608
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,762
Thank your sister. She's
the one who thought of it.

609
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,453
Can we do this today?

610
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,524
That way I can start
treatment sooner,

611
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,641
finish my last semester before
my scholarship runs out.

612
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,021
I should totally do
this right now, right?

613
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,529
I mean, just get it done?

614
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:43,084
Yeah, I'm gonna call Mom
and Dad first, but yes.

615
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:44,502
You want Dr. Weber
and Dr. Wilson

616
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:46,294
to be the ones to do it.

617
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,641
And you can be in the
operating room with me?

618
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,058
I can't, Chloe.
Family's not allowed.

619
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,716
Oh. Right.

620
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:58,444
Hey, think of it like one
of your cross-country races.

621
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,135
It'll be over
before you know it.

622
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:02,068
And I will be as close
as I can be, okay?

623
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,932
- Okay.
- Okay?

624
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,039
Okay. Let's do it.

625
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,979
Do you always eat when
you're scanning patients?

626
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,946
Well, I mean, technically
he's not a patient,

627
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:21,156
and he's in a bag and dead.

628
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,749
Oh, Yasuda's sister
is getting surgery.

629
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,164
Is it an emergency?

630
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:30,787
It doesn't seem like it.

631
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:34,100
They're waiting
for an OR to open.

632
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,654
What's going on between you two?

633
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,552
Uh, nothing.

634
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,105
Oh.

635
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:42,350
Is that her? No, it's Maxine.

636
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:43,499
Spaghetti and
meatballs for dinner.

637
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:44,904
Yasuda's not texting me.

638
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,426
She basically accused
me of having no empathy.

639
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,291
Well, her sister has
cancer. She's just stressed.

640
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,718
Well, you know what's <i>not</i> going
to make her sister get better?

641
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:55,812
Being mean to me.

642
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,607
Really?!

643
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,057
He can't hear me.

644
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,281
Heart rate's in the 140s.
Systolic's around 100.

645
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:08,505
We broadened IV antibiotics
and started low-dose norepi.

646
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,274
Judith, we're taking
you up to the OR

647
00:28:10,412 --> 00:28:12,252
to remove the infected tissue
and stop it spreading, okay?

648
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,830
You're gonna take my butt?

649
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,359
The infection seems to
have spread to your glute,

650
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:16,567
but we won't know
till we get to the OR.

651
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,903
No, I want a second opinion.

652
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:18,766
There's no time for
another opinion.

653
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,802
You <i>have</i> to trust us.

654
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,820
I don't understand. I
just fell on the sidewalk.

655
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,748
The bacteria must got in
through the cut on your thigh.

656
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:26,635
It's rare, but it happens.

657
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,406
Do you know what it's
like to be invisible?

658
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,580
If there were any other options,

659
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:31,433
we would tell you,
I promise, Judith.

660
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:33,677
Judith. Judith. Judith!

661
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:36,438
Damn it, she's septic.
Come on, come on, come on.

662
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:37,785
Okay, let's go! Let's move!

663
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,289
Mr. Riley, hold on. I got ya.

664
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,275
I need a hand in
here! Griffin!

665
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,562
He started crashing
a minute ago.

666
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,761
I need to intubate.
Push 30 of etomidate,

667
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,625
- 150 of sux.
- On it.

668
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,568
- Where is Griffith?
- I got the intubation tray.

669
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:53,912
All right, let's
get you some air.

670
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,424
Here we go. Here we go.

671
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:59,461
Ah, come on.

672
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,429
Damn it! Help!

673
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,017
Helm, get in here!

674
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:06,528
I need you to apply
cricoid pressure.

675
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,436
There? Higher.

676
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:10,162
There. You're right
there. Right there.

677
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,267
And I'm in. Al right.

678
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:15,823
Come on.

679
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,686
Oh, his sats aren't improving.

680
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,595
We need to get him on
ECMO before the hypoxemia

681
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,873
puts too much stress on
his heart and he codes.

682
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,450
I need an ECMO
machine right now!

683
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,121
What happened?

684
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,892
He was intubated, but
he wasn't oxygenating.

685
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,617
You'd know that if you were
monitoring him like I asked.

686
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:43,441
I'm sorry. I ran down
to the emergency room...

687
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,162
I don't want to hear
it. Wait outside.

688
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,577
Helm, get the tube ready.

689
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,476
Okay. I hit a pocket of fluid.

690
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:57,796
Suction.

691
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,177
Oh!

692
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,534
Oh, she's gonna be devastated

693
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,318
when she wakes up
and it's all gone.

694
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:04,250
Well, at least
she'll still be here.

695
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,607
If we can work fast enough.

696
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:07,022
I'm gonna need
another set of hands.

697
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:08,127
Warren, are you
ready to get in here?

698
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:09,946
Sure. Scalpel.

699
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:15,572
Good. Quick and intentional.

700
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,953
I can help if you need it.

701
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:18,291
Just keep up with the suction.

702
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:23,097
Actually, you know, I
could use a hand in here.

703
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,178
Kwan, you wanna help break
up some of this tissue?

704
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:26,238
Yeah.

705
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,451
Oh, I see healthy tissue.

706
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,453
Yeah, there it is.

707
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,490
Bleeding edges.
Nice work... boss.

708
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,700
Moving on to the superior
aspect of the thigh.

709
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:42,737
Last one.

710
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:46,120
Do you remember your
med-school cadaver?

711
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,847
Yeah. 68-year-old female,
lungs full of mets.

712
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:51,366
Uh, we assumed she was a smoker.

713
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,990
Named her Marge and
decided she was a trucker.

714
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:56,924
Mm. Mine was my grandma.

715
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,616
Uh, wait. You, uh,
dissected your grandmother?

716
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,308
What? God, no. No, no.

717
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,655
My dad's mom died
before I was born,

718
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:07,175
and then my mom
really hated hers,

719
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,522
so I-I kind of grew
up without a grandma.

720
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,320
But we had been dissecting
our cadaver for weeks

721
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,258
before we finally took
the towel off her face.

722
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:19,429
And I remember looking
at her and thinking,

723
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:20,948
she could be my grandma.

724
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:25,849
And I just hoped that
she didn't feel... alone.

725
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:27,947
I hoped she felt that she
was surrounded by people

726
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:30,785
who truly appreciated her.

727
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:35,134
I, uh... I never thought
about it that way.

728
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,896
Yeah. And then we cut open
her neck and her head and...

729
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:40,829
finished it.

730
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:44,833
Um... could you transfer the
scans to the CDs by yourself?

731
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,939
There's something I
really need to do.

732
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:49,528

was at 5:00, right?

795
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,806
I know. I just got so

796
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,024
- I completely forgot.
- You don't have to apologize.

797
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,811
- DeLuca had to leave.
- We were gonna see the baby.

Yeah, we'll keep you in
the ICU for a few more days

Hey. Oh, aren't you supposed
to be getting the kids?

864
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,483
Yeah, well, I thought we
could grab a bite first.

865
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,105
Oh, I can, uh,
either eat with you

866
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:02,280
or feed the kids, but I
don't have time for both.

867
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,560
- Do you not feel this?
- Feel what?

868
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,251
Ever since we got rehired,

869
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,253
we haven't had a single
meal alone together.

870
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,394
We haven't had a conversation
that wasn't about surgery

871
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,130
or the kids' schedules
in almost three weeks.

872
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:17,018
Well, work has been
busy, but, you know,

873
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:20,159
we'll get back on
track eventually.

874
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,472
It's just...

875
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,474
feels like we're not
connecting, you know?

876
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:26,787
It feels like there's
something eating away

877
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:28,582
at this relationship.

878
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,111

it more than once today...
