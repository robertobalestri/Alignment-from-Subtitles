1
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,293
You said that you
wanted to leave the house.

2
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:06,695
<i>On average,</i>
<i>the fastest your heart</i>
<i>should beat per minute</i>

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,965
<i>is 220 minus your age.</i>

4
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:11,700
Yeah, but what about
your feelings for me?

5
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,669
Why is this guy
still in Seattle?

6
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:17,373
Well, he won't leave
without her, and she
wants to wait him out.

7
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:19,276
What do you want to do?

8
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,912
Well, I want to deck the guy,
but I'm not as patient
as she is.

9
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:23,947
Are those Molly's scans?

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,514
Gotta be on my game.

11
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,416
After flying solo,
there's nowhere to go but down.

12
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:31,188
I'm assisting on
your girlfriend's surgery.
You want me to slack off?

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,688
-Carry on.
-Yeah.

14
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,491
<i>But, ideally,</i>
<i>vigorous exercise</i>

15
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:39,296
<i>is between 70 and 85%</i>
<i>of your maximum heart rate.</i>

16
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:45,302
Did you pack Allison's blanket?
Your mom says
it's not in the bag.

17
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,970
- It's in the backpack.
- Oh.

18
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:50,307
What are you gonna do with
the whole house to yourself?

19
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,608
Well, with any luck, sleep.

20
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,644
I'm jealous.
The conference agenda
is jam-packed.

21
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,546
Well, you should
skip something,

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,083
you know, get a massage
or do something else
for yourself.

23
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:02,384
<i>Exceeding your maximum</i>
<i>heart rate can result in</i>

24
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,554
<i>- dizziness, chest pain,</i>
<i>or even fainting.</i>

25
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,523
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

26
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:09,491
-You got that?
-Yeah. Here.

27
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,394
Okay.

28
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:15,431
You two have fun. You know,
what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

29
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,868
-We're going to Oakland.
-That too.

30
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,368
Bye.

31
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:23,874
<i>So listen to your body</i>
<i>and don't push your limits.</i>

32
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,045
Hey, I didn't know
you were here.

33
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,413
I'm helping Dr. Webber
with one of my old patients.

34
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:33,549
Is it weird, you're kind of
like my boss now?

35
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,253
No. I invested in
her and Meredith's
Alzheimer's research.

36
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:38,188
I'm a silent partner.
That's it.

37
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,389
Are you going to Boston?
Because I'll take Griffith
on my service.

38
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:42,758
He's salty because
she's been helping me prep

39
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,693
for an experimental procedure
all week.

40
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,796
I needed our best intern
for the case.

41
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,764
-Griffith's
someone to watch, huh?
-Yeah.

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,967
-How's Adams doing?
-Well, he's with us today.
You tell me.

43
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,735
-Okay.
-If your schedule changes, I--

44
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:53,904
She's still mine.

45
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,776
Do you know how lucky you are
you don't have to worry about
vaginal tears?

46
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,812
And good morning to you too.

47
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,048
I just sewed
a third-degree tear
encroaching on the sphincter,

48
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:08,784
and that's after the mom
labored for 24 hours
with a nine-pound baby.

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,754
You know, men have
their share of...
Yeah, that sounds awful.

50
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Oh, Wilson, hey.
While you were in L&D,
Mrs. Badgley started bleeding.

51
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:19,796
Okay, well, I will tell Kincade
she needs to move
her myomectomy to this morning.

52
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,831
Oh. Already on it.

53
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,632
I-I figured you three
wouldn't want to be
on your feet for a long surge.

54
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,869
Dr. Kincade already
approved it, so we're set.

55
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:32,175
Um, did Jo Wilson just let
a guy who calls surgery
a "surge" shark her?

56
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,443
-He saved my babies.
-Oh. Come on.

57
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,846
That's all I can think about
when I see his overachieving,
stupid prodigy face,

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,982
and if you tell anyone that,
I will punch you.

59
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:43,420
Hey, not for you.
Have you exported your cases
into the spreadsheet yet?

60
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,121
What spreadsheet?

61
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:50,827
Uh, our case logs
for our meeting with Bailey
at the end of the year. Sorry.

62
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,528
It's fine.

63
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:54,530
Well,
if it's any consolation,
I'll be able to help you

64
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:57,000
-with your case logs next year.
-Thanks.

65
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,103
-Uh, good morning.
-Good morning.
What... What's this?

66
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:03,840
It's a thank-you for saying
you would help me get
my first solo surgery.

67
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,142
- I promise
I won't let you down.

68
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:11,081
All right, lesson number one:
always under-promise
and over-deliver. Yeah?

69
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,852
Hey, Nora.

70
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:19,521
-Hi, I just got your text.
-Sorry for bugging you.
This is...

71
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,959
Liz. Hi, can we make this
quick? I have a high school
reunion to pull off.

72
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,862
I'll do my best. Follow me.
Um, how far along are you?

73
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,364
Uh, 19 weeks.

74
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:29,032
It's been an easy pregnancy
until a couple days ago.

75
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,868
I started to have indigestion,
shortness of breath,

76
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,535
some pressure
in my chest.

77
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,905
-Um, I have
an OB appointment next week.
-Okay.

78
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,409
She has preexisting
mitral valve prolapse,
so I kidnapped her here.

79
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,479
Yeah, I have to be
at this reunion tonight.
I'm the committee chair.

80
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,882
Liz runs a tight ship.
She got the boosters
to repaint the gym.

81
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,684
Finally. There's no way that
'70s paint wasn't full of lead.

82
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,787
I was a senior
when you were a freshman.

83
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,424
-Owen Hunt.
-Megan Hunt's brother.

84
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:55,557
Megan has a brother?

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,262
Okay, I'm gonna page cardio
and OB.

86
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:03,266
While we wait, I'm gonna run
some labs and an EKG.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,001
-Sound good?
-I'm pregnant.

88
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:07,203
- Only snacks and baths
sound good.

89
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,571
Thank you,
and it's good to see you again.

90
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:10,907
Yeah.

91
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,475
Allan Lewis, 50,

92
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,777
developed PTLD after
his third kidney transplant,

93
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:18,747
had eight rounds of rituximab
to reduce the tumor burden
in his retroperitoneum.

94
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:22,419
Here to debulk
the residual tumor
before resuming chemo

95
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,854
and to alleviate
the bowel obstruction symptoms.

96
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,923
Not the kidney's fault.
Don't blame the kidney.

97
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,690
No one's blaming anyone.

98
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,627
That's right. PTLD is
a real complication
caused by...

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,431
A weakened immune system
that triggers
the Epstein-Barr virus.

100
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:38,068
Of course, Allan is
in the less than 1%
of all people who get this.

101
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,936
Now it feels like
you're blaming me.

102
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,939
Okay. Shelby is Allan's sister
and the donor of
his third kidney.

103
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,875
I wouldn't have asked
if I weren't such a hard match.

104
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,111
My other two organ donors
came through UNOS.

105
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,979
Which donor drove you to chemo?

106
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:54,250
Oh. The one
who "inherited" Mom's
1969 Mercedes convertible.

107
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,618
I took care of her
all those years.
Where were you?

108
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,021
Working in Singapore.

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,323
She came through for me
when I needed a kidney,

110
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,459
but there was a time
when Shelbs and I
weren't speaking.

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,461
-They don't need to know this.
-Look, okay, it's
my medical history.

112
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:07,596
Okay, let's get some new scans
and we'll go from there,
shall we?

113
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:08,932
-Mm-hmm.
-Bye.

114
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,475
Cass,
I didn't know you'd be here.

115
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:19,943
Oh. Teddy, hi.

116
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,812
-I will catch up
with you later?
-Sure.

117
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:25,949
Friend of yours?

118
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,485
We sometimes plan
to attend the same conferences,

119
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:33,823
balance the snoozefest panels
with extracurricular
activities.

120
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:35,024
Oh.

121
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:37,093
Is David here?

122
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:40,864
I believe he's covering
his chief's cases
while she's at a conference.

123
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,165
Right.

124
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,266
What about Owen?

125
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,970
-No. Nope. Just me.
-Oh.

126
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,670
Altman.

127
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:51,374
-Oh, okay.
Can you help me? Please.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. What--

128
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,243
-Hi.
-Hi.

129
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,848
Griffith, present.

130
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,117
Molly Tran, 33, experiencing
grand mal seizures.

131
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,719
Currently refractory
to anti-epileptic medication.

132
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:06,623
Here for placement of DBS
to suppress seizure activity.

133
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:11,194
We'll make a small hole
in your skull to implant
the device in your brain,

134
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:13,863
then place the pulse generator
under your collarbone.

135
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,065
It's like a pacemaker
for your brain.

136
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,201
And what about getting
my memory back?

137
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,969
Let's take it
one step at a time.

138
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,206
Once we place the DBS,
I will put a grid on your brain

139
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,408
and then stimulate
each section one by one,

140
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:29,412
but we're only doing that
because I will already be
in that part of your brain.

141
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:33,550
It's never been proven
to retrieve memories
lost to retrograde amnesia.

142
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,751
Will the extra stimulation
induce seizures?

143
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,389
It's possible,
but my hope is that
the device will prevent that.

144
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:44,693
Are you sure you want to
do this? What did
your parents say about it?

145
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:49,365
Um, they were nervous until
I sent them Dr. Shepherd's bio.

146
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,034
Hmm.

147
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,569
I want my memories.

148
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,239
I just didn't realize so many
people would be watching.

149
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:57,907
It's a big case.

150
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,211
Excuse me.

151
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,181
All right, so you can see
the device will be implanted
in the crown.

152
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,517
It's one thing
to show up at my house,
but to come to hospital--

153
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,353
-Hey. Back off.
-She doesn't wanna talk to you.

154
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,455
Look, I don't
wanna talk to her.

155
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,258
I need to talk to you.
Molly hasn't told you
everything you need to know.

156
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,975
But when I did the test run
in the auditorium,

157
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,611
the slides looked like they
were in a fun house mirror.

158
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,546
Well, they must be formatted
to the wrong size.

159
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,082
-Right.
-That's what Ron,
that AV guy, says,

160
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:42,485
and apparently
the only way to fix it is
to redo the whole damn thing.

161
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,153
Well, how long
did the first one take?

162
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:46,889
No idea. I paid Tuck to do it.

163
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:50,793
Dr. Bailey is presenting
on her program
training OB-GYN residents

164
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,428
from states with abortion bans.

165
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,763
So important.
Now more than ever.

166
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:58,968
Well, how am I supposed to
inspire other hospitals
to start programs like ours

167
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,470
if they can't read my slides?

168
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,805
Well, Cass is actually amazing
at slideshows.

169
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,976
Sorry, I don't know
why I said "actually."
She's just... She's amazing.

170
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,447
-Uh, can you work fast?
-For this cause,
it would be my honor.

171
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,283
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Oh, thank you.

172
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,452
All right, are you ready?

173
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:21,491
Yes, aligning the MRI and
CT images to create a 3-D
representation of the brain.

174
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,461
-Which approach
would you suggest?
-Transfrontal.

175
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:28,665
Good thought. We are gonna go
with frontal temporal.

176
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:30,133
Uh.

177
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,535
-Target?
-Oh, that area of gliosis
on the MRI.

178
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,307
All right, divide it into
three separate targets,
so I have options.

179
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:41,611
What if we trigger a seizure
and have to put her in
a barb coma?

180
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,946
Isn't the whole procedure
a wash?

181
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,115
I don't let myself
think like that.

182
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,319
Yeah.

183
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,421
You really are
the one to watch, huh?

184
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,158
Just been lucky.
Get on amazing cases.

185
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:59,195
Don't do that.
You're a woman surgeon.

186
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,465
There are enough people out
there who want to dismiss you.

187
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,367
Don't be one of them.

188
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,203
Now, our patient will be awake.

189
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,908
So it is crucial
that you follow my lead,
keep your voice neutral.

190
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,179
As far as Molly is concerned,
everything is fine.

191
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,014
-No problem.
-Mmm.

192
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,717
Your labs are normal.
Same with your EKG and echo,

193
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,385
and your mitral valve
looks stable.

194
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,987
Great. See? Told you,
just regular old pregnancy.

195
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,323
So, can I get back
to reunion planning now?

196
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:30,560
While your symptoms are common,
they are new for you,

197
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:31,994
and we would like to run
a few more tests.

198
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,097
Okay, fine.
Um, where's my phone?

199
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,898
Do you have someone
we should call?

200
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:38,368
Uh, nope.
Just a second-in-command

201
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,436
who can't alphabetize name tags
to save his life.

202
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,906
Come on, Bobby.
M comes before O.

203
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,009
Liz is having this baby
on her own.
She's my personal hero.

204
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:49,011
It wasn't always
the plan,

205
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,581
but I've been on
at least one date with
every age-appropriate bachelor

206
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:54,517
in the greater Seattle area,
and some not so
age-appropriate.

207
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,920
But none of them were the one,
and I'm not getting
any younger,

208
00:09:58,054 --> 00:09:59,422
so I'm going it alone.

209
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:04,227
Liz, how long have you had
that lump on your neck?

210
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:07,430
-What lump?
-May I?

211
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,265
Millin, can you grab
the ultrasound? Thank you.

212
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:16,639
She's about to go to the OR.
Make it quick.

213
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,941
You can't let her do
the experimental part
of surgery.

214
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,943
I respect her decision.

215
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,578
Because if she gets
her memories back, it absolves
you of what you did?

216
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,213
You don't know
what you're talking about.

217
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,915
When the accident happened,

218
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,550
she tried everything she could
to get her memories back.

219
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,952
Psychotherapy, hypnotherapy,
Vietnamese herbs.

220
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,255
Her parents said that she spent
everything she had,

221
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,290
and when none of it worked,
she spiraled.

222
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:38,060
Not eating, not sleeping.
They finally talked her into
getting help.

223
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,996
She never told me any of this.

224
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,432
Okay, and why would she?
You think she wants you
to know?

225
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,669
Look, I love her,
and I wanna be able
to live with myself

226
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,971
- if anything bad
happened to her.

227
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:52,810
Coming to Seattle,
the sudden breakup,
the experimental brain surgery

228
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,410
just to get
her memories back. It...

229
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:57,246
It just feels like
the on-ramp to another crash.

230
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:02,552
She picked me. Get over it.

231
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:17,200
Hey.

232
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,135
There's pens
and extra card stock in the bag
under the welcome table.

233
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:22,271
No, under the welcome table.
Call if you need anything.

234
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:23,706
-Great.
-Thanks.

235
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,342
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, you okay?

236
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:29,947
Just Bobby,
our class secretary who
doesn't know how to CC people,

237
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,347
is now the one in charge.

238
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,516
It's like a designated survivor
situation.

239
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,285
Well, if no one
took this seriously,
there would be no reunions

240
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,621
and no one would reconnect
with old friends,

241
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:42,658
- and I guess life
would just go on.

242
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,329
Reconnecting can be...
can be pretty great.

243
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,530
Mm-hmm.

244
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:50,533
Uh, so far so good with Liz,
by the way.

245
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:55,171
Should I have taken Liz
somewhere else?

246
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,140
Why?

247
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:00,176
Well, the last time I saw you,
you didn't want to be
a part of my care team.

248
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,446
And now we're sharing a bench.

249
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:07,985
Well, you know...
You brought in a friend
for medical care,

250
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:14,123
so this is... this is
an above-board
bench-sharing situation.

251
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,392
In that case,
can you sit a little longer?

252
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:20,162
It's just hitting me
that my friend might be sick.

253
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:21,531
Sure.

254
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:30,373
There's the two native kidneys,
the two nonfunctioning
transplanted kidneys.

255
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,109
That's the working one
right there.

256
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,846
Have you ever seen
a scan of five kidneys
inside of one patient before?

257
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,080
-Is that the mass?
-Yeah, that's it right there.

258
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,716
Is it kinking the vasculature
of the working kidney?

259
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,553
No, it's close,
but fortunately, no.

260
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,221
Yeah, we should debulk enough

261
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,089
that the chemo has a shot
at killing the remaining cells.

262
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,926
Should we remove
the native kidney?

263
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,193
I could help with
the retroperitoneal
lymph node dissection.

264
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,430
Mmm. It's not necessary.
We still have good access to
the paracaval lymph nodes

265
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,066
but good to know
you're thinking ahead.
Book us an OR.

266
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,903
That was pretty bold
to ask to do

267
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,071
a nephrectomy
and a lymph node dissection.

268
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:03,706
You never know
if you don't ask.

269
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,845
-Can you do
his pre-op paperwork?
-Nope, but good try.

270
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:15,551
Poor Liz. She worked so hard
on her reunion,

271
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,287
and now some bumbling wannabe
gets to be there
for the big moment.

272
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,122
-Probably just trying to help.
-Is he?

273
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,124
Is he? Or is he a man who is
threatened by a woman in power

274
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:24,795
and he's stealing it
in the name of generosity?

275
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,629
For the record, I'm a feminist.

276
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,665
This morning,
my co-resident stole my surgery

277
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,334
so that I didn't have to
"be on my feet."

278
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:35,137
-Did you punch him?
-No, he saved my babies.

279
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,173
Well, he didn't save my babies.
What's his name?

280
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:38,574
Scans are up.

281
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,413
Oh. That's not something
you see every day.

282
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,248
Is it cancer?

283
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,484
No. Your thyroid, larynx
and lymph nodes are all fine.

284
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:52,455
It appears you have
a rare condition called
achalasia with megaesophagus,

285
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:55,458
-which is aggravated by
your pregnancy.
-Which means?

286
00:13:55,591 --> 00:14:00,463
You have a fair amount of
undigested food
sitting in your esophagus.

287
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,833
Um, how long has it been there?

288
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,369
It's hard to tell
without knowing how much
you eat in one sitting.

289
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:08,337
I had fish tacos yesterday.

290
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:12,475
Ugh, stupid Bobby gave me
a strawberry smoothie
for breakfast.

291
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,477
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're gonna run
a scope down there

292
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,345
-and clean it all out, okay?
-Yeah.

293
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,315
Oh.

294
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,357
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, bit nervous, but...

295
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,526
Your vitals are strong.
Hey, going to OR one.

296
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,529
You know, the next time
I see you, I-I could have
all my memories back.

297
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:36,532
You know,
the odds of this working
are almost impossible.

298
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,802
I just want to make sure
you'll be okay if it doesn't.

299
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,470
There must be other
experimental treatments, right?

300
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:44,340
If this one doesn't work,
I mean, we'll try another one.

301
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,710
Dave came to the hospital.

302
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,378
Oh. Uh.

303
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:50,881
Well, what did he say?

304
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,485
He just wanted to make sure
that you'll be okay.

305
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,121
I am.

306
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:00,356
I will be.

307
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,360
-You'll be here
when I get out, right?
-Of course.

308
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,397
Okay.

309
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,168
- Okay.
- Yeah.

310
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,505
Okay. Don't let Shepherd
push it in there.

311
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,442
We've seen her go overboard,
especially with
difficult cases.

312
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:21,277
You know I can't control that.

313
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,313
You're on top right now.
You have more influence
than you think.

314
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:27,416
I got you.

315
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,394
Oh, there you are.

316
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,130
I was starting to get
flashbacks to that party

317
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:42,231
where you ditched me
to make out with Scott Jonas.

318
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,401
- We just... We got some air.
- Tell me
that lump's benign.

319
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,106
-As benign as chicken pot pie.
-Oh, thank God. What is it?

320
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:50,874
Chicken pot pie.

321
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,609
Yeah, that was
yesterday's lunch.
My throat's full of food.

322
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,979
What? How?

323
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:57,814
The sphincter
connecting her stomach
and her esophagus won't relax,

324
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,248
so food's getting stuck.

325
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,917
Is this gonna be
for the rest of my pregnancy?

326
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:03,053
No, we can remove the food
with a scope

327
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,955
and then inject Botox
into the lower sphincter.

328
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,057
So it looks young
and wrinkle-free?

329
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,559
No, so it relaxes and food
can get into your stomach.

330
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,394
Okay, so this is
gonna take a while.

331
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:15,264
Will you please make sure that
someone steams the tablecloths?

332
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,167
-I'm on it.
-A nurse will
get you prepped, okay?

333
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,568
-Thank you.
-Okay. I gotta go
back to work. Okay.

334
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,140
Brush up on
your EGDs in the skills lab.

335
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,641
I thought we had
Mr. Oden's CABG today.

336
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:29,146
I am doing Mr. Oden's CABG.
You were gonna brush up on
your EGDs

337
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,313
so you can do
Liz's esophageal disimpaction.

338
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,549
I'll go practice.

339
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,418
Can you just cut and paste?

340
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:39,688
The graphics, yes,
but not the text. Will you
read me those bullet points?

341
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,958
Oh, sure. Um, okay.

342
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,661
"All trainees come from
the more than one-third
of US counties

343
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,664
that are maternity care deserts
with no OB providers,

344
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,499
hospitals, or birth centers."

345
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,169
That's bleak.

346
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,670
Didn't you win
a Catherine Fox Award
for your program?

347
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,373
I did. Felt like
an accomplishment then.

348
00:16:57,506 --> 00:17:01,777
Now, feels like I'm trying
to bail water with a thimble.

349
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,780
I get it,
but programs like yours
are a beacon of hope.

350
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,683
Thank you.

351
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,354
Now let's just make sure
your presentation is
as great as you are.

352
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:16,026
Next bullet, please. Teddy.

353
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,328
Oh. Yeah. Oh, sorry.
Uh, "following Dobbs"...

354
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,202
DBS is in place.
How are you doing, Molly?

355
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:28,972
Pretty well,
considering my head's
basically in an Erector Set.

356
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,074
Are you feeling
more discomfort?

357
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,477
I don't feel a thing,
but I can hear tools clinking
and things buzzing.

358
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:37,247
- Are we almost there?
- Yes.

359
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:40,217
Griffith,
we are ready to connect
to the stimulation panel.

360
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,718
-And that should stop
the seizures?
-It should.

361
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,388
Wow. Wait,
that's incredible. Thank you.

362
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,225
And are you starting
with the memory part too now?

363
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:50,994
-In a minute.
-Dr. Shepherd,
I see epileptiform waves.

364
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,330
All right,
adjust the frequency.

365
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,067
- They're improving.
- Okay.

366
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,671
All right, Molly,
now it is time to place
the grid for memory retrieval.

367
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,609
I'd nod, but, um,
I can't move my head.

368
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,410
Grid, please.

369
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,085
Here we go.

370
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,188
It's not that bad.

371
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,422
You were just moaning
like a dead animal.
Let him check you out.

372
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:24,861
Urine output's low. Hang on.
Let me take a quick look
with the ultrasound.

373
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:29,232
Are you wearing perfume?
'Cause it smells like feet.

374
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,634
Remember when
I gave you a kidney
and you promised to be nicer?

375
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:36,405
This is how all of our fights
end now.
Do you have a sister?

376
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:39,109
-I have four.
-Oof. I thought one was a lot.

377
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:40,709
Kidney.

378
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,946
I learned early on that I'm
better off not fighting back.

379
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,915
Oh, look at you now.
You're a surgeon.

380
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,284
See what happens when you
learn how to go with the flow?
To adapt?

381
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,254
I'm the senior VP
of human resources
at a giant tech company.

382
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:54,291
- Kidney.
- It only works when I do it.

383
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:55,892
No. My kidney. It really hurts.

384
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,260
Damn it, we need to move.

385
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,229
-What's happening?
-Am I dying?

386
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:01,331
Allan's kidney's thrombosed.
A clot's cutting off
his blood supply.

387
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,067
If we don't get him to surgery
right now, he could lose it.

388
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,103
Tell Webber and Marsh
to meet me in the OR.

389
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:10,206
Okay, breathe.

390
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:15,946
I did it.

391
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:19,082
-You... You... You did it?
-Uh-huh.

392
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:20,449
Thank you.

393
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,185
Uh...
You were right. She's amazing.

394
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,620
She's also very hungry.
Would you hand me those chips?

395
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:28,291
- Uh, you can have
whatever you want.

396
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:30,260
-Thank you.
-Uh, I'll be right back.

397
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:31,828
-Okay.
-'Kay.

398
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:35,031
Well, you saved the day.

399
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:40,804
Well, this saved me from
having to go to my boss's panel
on change management.

400
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,573
Where is her thumb drive?

401
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,678
Do you wanna skip
the afternoon lectures?

402
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:54,184
Well, we clearly have seen
Bailey's presentation.

403
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,754
-I'm supposed to
meet up with Phil later.
-So meet up with me instead.

404
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,292
You said to let you know
when I have figured it out,

405
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,128
and I have figured it out.

406
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:14,037
You are all set.

407
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,305
Oh.

408
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:19,708
Um... Would you keep it
until we get there?

409
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,812
My luck today, I'd drop it down
the elevator shaft.

410
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,216
Y... You are coming, right?

411
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:30,387
Oh, I've been having
stress dreams all week about
showing up to an empty room.

412
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:31,888
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't miss it.

413
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,789
- Okay. Here.
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,361
Okay, the renal artery is tortuous.
 IR never would've worked.

415
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,662
Agreed. Fogarty catheter.

416
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,564
Will the kidney be okay?

417
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:45,135
I don't know, but it's got
a shot thanks to you.

418
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:50,874
The embolectomy is complete.
- Heparin. Thank you.

419
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:54,144
- Now what?
-  -We wait for it to pink up,

420
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:56,012
then we go after the tumor.

421
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:59,581
- Okay.
- Nothing's happening.

422
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,257
It's still ischemic.

423
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,427
Yeah, the clot
caused too much damage.
The kidney's dead.

424
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,862
-Let's prep for a nephrectomy.
-Yeah.

425
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:15,532
But he has to be in remission
before he can go back on
the transplant list.

426
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:18,201
-That could take months.
-It's our only option
at this point.

427
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,203
He got lucky three times.
Maybe it'll happen again.

428
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:24,007
So that's it?
You just tell him good luck
and send him on his way.

429
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,943
Well, what if we give it
more time? Try papaverine?

430
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,912
You know that's not gonna work.

431
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,382
Adams, you want to
suture ligate this vessel?

432
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,419
You found the clot.
You want it or not?

433
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:41,958
0 silk.

434
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:48,498
Okay, nice and easy. Good.

435
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,337
Oh, Mr. Oden's in the ICU.
We did his CABG off-pump.

436
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:57,606
It's actually really exciting.
You should review
the surgical tape.

437
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,912
Wilson, quick update.
Ms. Badgley had a massive
uterine hemorrhage mid-surge--

438
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,248
You did a hysterectomy?
On my patient?

439
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:09,618
Technically, Kincade's patient.
But yep.
Good luck with your, um...

440
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,688
-Esophageal disimpaction.
-Mm-hmm.

441
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:14,524
I'm gonna tear him
limb from limb.

442
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,758
Millin,
you are flying through this.

443
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:19,295
At the rate you're going,
we'll be out of here
in 15 minutes.

444
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,598
My parents never sent me
to summer camp.

445
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,833
They just dropped me off
at the arcade every day,

446
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,302
and I played the claw machine
for six hours straight.

447
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,604
You know how to work those?

448
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:29,472
-Mm-hmm.
-What have you won?

449
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,740
Strawberries and fish tacos.

450
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:35,612
Stimulate S-5.

451
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,183
- Molly, remember,
if you see anything,

452
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:44,020
no matter how faint the image,
just let me know.

453
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,522
Nothing yet.

454
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:49,025
All right. Let's increase
the frequency to 180 hertz.

455
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,695
If it gets uncomfortable,
let me know and I can stop.

456
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:58,501
Okay. Let's bump it up
to 200 Hz.

457
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,573
Dr. Shepherd, she's starting
to get D waves again.

458
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:08,677
Sporadic episodes.
We still have time before
a potential seizure. W-5.

459
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:14,551
Decrease the amplitude
to two millivolts.

460
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,319
How you doing, Molly?

461
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,821
Still fine.
Just... just waiting.

462
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,491
The waves are increasing
in frequency and amplitude.

463
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm keeping my eye on it. X-5.

464
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:29,265
- I'm stopping.
- Griffith,

465
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,700
you will press that button
if I tell you to.

466
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:35,038
-Y-5.
-She's going to seize.

467
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,507
-If we have to put her
in a coma, she--
-Dr. Griffith,

468
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,343
I need you to trust me
or get out of my OR.

469
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,478
I see something.

470
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:50,653
Can you tell me what you see?

471
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,258
I'm outside.
I'm walking near a lake.

472
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:58,428
I see... I see mountains.

473
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,762
It's, it's beautiful here.

474
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:04,467
Wait, wait, it's all gone.

475
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,035
Because I stopped stimulating.

476
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,540
That was absolutely amazing.
Is it time to close?

477
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:14,410
That's not why I stopped.
Hand me the control panel.

478
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,949
We need to verify
that the stimulation
is provoking the memory.

479
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,151
Her seizure activity
is becoming more unstable.

480
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:24,721
Restarting. See anything now?

481
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,390
I'm still at
the same place and...

482
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,261
there's someone else here.

483
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,130
-A man.
-Do you know who it is?

484
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,234
No, he's too far ahead,
but he's wearing a red jacket.

485
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,903
I think we're here together.

486
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:43,172
Wait, did you stop again?

487
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:44,607
I did.

488
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,876
All right.

489
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:48,845
How about now?

490
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:53,149
I'm still here. I'm-I'm taking
something out of my pocket.

491
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,052
It's, uh... it's a map.

492
00:24:56,586 --> 00:25:02,292
It says, "The Beehive
Basin Trail." It's Big Sky.

493
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:07,497
All right,
we are going to reduce
the frequency back to 140 hertz

494
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:13,002
and one millivolt,
terminating the stimulation
and removing the grid.

495
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,338
Wait, no, no. Wait,
why are you stopping please?

496
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,508
We can't risk
more seizure activity,
but, Molly, you did great.

497
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:21,978
-Would you like me to close?
-I've got it.

498
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,950
The EGD went well.
 We were able to clear your esophagus

499
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:29,786
and administer the Botox
to relax your sphincter.

500
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,021
And once we confirm
everything's going down okay,

501
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,623
you'll be good to eat
whatever you want.

502
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:35,658
Just need to take it easy
for a couple of days.

503
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:38,394
-I'll take it easy
after the reunion.
-No, wait, you need to rest.

504
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:40,997
Otherwise, you'll wind up
back here in a week.

505
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,702
Two years of hard work,
and Bobby's about to
undo it all in two hours?

506
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,172
Well, why doesn't Nora go?
Make sure he doesn't
mess things up.

507
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:51,341
-Okay, you need to fire him.
-We don't pay him.

508
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:54,777
Look, we can't just let Bobby
have what he wants
because he means well.

509
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:58,114
You need to go down there
and tell him that he is out.

510
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:03,920
Well, um, the good news is
we were able to debulk
a lot of the mass.

511
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:07,156
So there is bad news... again.

512
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,363
Yes, so we couldn't revive
your working kidney,
so we had to remove it.

513
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:17,734
Back to dialysis.
More hours of my life wasted.

514
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,436
Once you're in remission,
we can put you back on
the transplant list again.

515
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,741
I've already had three.
I'm a hard match.
I won't find another.

516
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,377
You never know.

517
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,712
Before my first transplant,

518
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:33,750
I made a bucket list
of all the things
I wanted to do before I died,

519
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,018
you know,
like climb the Great Wall

520
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:37,420
or drive on the Autobahn.

521
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,955
Oh, see the Rockettes.

522
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:42,458
I mean, I thought
I'd be lucky to do half.

523
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:47,230
I did all of 'em.
Organ donors gave me
a second chance on life,

524
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:50,466
and then a third and a fourth.

525
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,403
And I'm happy with
what I did with them.

526
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:58,441
So, if this is it...
this is it.

527
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:04,981
Or you could call Gary.

528
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:06,549
We're not calling Gary.

529
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,785
-Wait. Gary is...
-Our brother.

530
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,286
Well, I'll be damned.

531
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,822
I'd rather live
the rest of my life in a box.

532
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:13,423
By box do you mean coffin?

533
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:15,425
It'd be better than
calling Gary!

534
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:22,465
She loved Big Sky.
We went a couple of times.

535
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:24,667
I can't believe she actually
remembered something.

536
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:26,804
All the way down to
your red jacket.

537
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:30,706
I'll check on her in a bit.

538
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:41,384
-Hey. How are you feeling?
-Hmm.

539
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,056
Tired.

540
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,828
Hey. They said I had a memory.

541
00:27:56,432 --> 00:28:00,636
I just wish my brain
could hold on to them
when it's not being stimulated.

542
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:06,676
Does, uh, Dave have
a red jacket?

543
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,412
He has a lot of jackets.

544
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:12,181
Did you ever go
to Big Sky with him?

545
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,151
A couple of times. Why?

546
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:19,422
Is that what I remembered?

547
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,930
But that was a memory
from after the accident.

548
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:32,836
You don't need to remember
anything for us to have
a future together.

549
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:35,705
You know, it's all in my brain.

550
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,009
It's all in there.
We just have to find
a way to unlock it.

551
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:41,879
Hey, maybe there's
a clinical trial.

552
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,646
No, you... No, no, no, no,

553
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:45,949
you don't let people dig into
your brain when you're healthy.

554
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,717
I'm worried about you.

555
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,052
The worst
has already happened.

556
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:56,659
- I lost my life.
- No, you didn't.
You're here.

557
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,369
You should rest.
We can talk about this later.

558
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,846
- Okay. All right. Thank you.
- Hey.

559
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,114
So Liz is being discharged.

560
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:20,550
She is. But she needs to rest,

561
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:24,186
so she's sending me
to go make sure this reunion
doesn't fall apart.

562
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,488
Mmm.

563
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:28,424
I wish Megan wasn't chaperoning
your nephew's camping trip.

564
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,597
Yeah. I can go with you
if you want. I'd love to see
the new paint in the gym.

565
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,901
Seriously? Teddy won't mind?

566
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,737
We've agreed to...

567
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,875
We've agreed
that we could see other people.

568
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:47,577
-Oh.
-Yeah.

569
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,614
Okay.

570
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,117
So I'll go home,
and I'll change
and come pick you up.

571
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,586
I'll text you my address.

572
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,754
-Okay.
-Yeah.

573
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,434
So, the program
is a 16-week rotation,

574
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:14,770
but we operate
on a rolling basis.

575
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:18,341
The trainees request
start dates,

576
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:21,644
based on where it fits
within their home curriculum.

577
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:24,246
So at any given time,

578
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,685
we have 20 to 30 trainees
from 13 different states,

579
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,989
but still that's
not nearly enough

580
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,291
to address patient demands
across the country.

581
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,761
You know,
somebody recently said

582
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:43,800
that programs like this
are a beacon of hope
in a dark time.

583
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:49,840
Well, I hope that
you will join me
in lighting the way. Thank you.

584
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,337
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:58,541
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.

586
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:00,043
I'm good. Come here.

587
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,017
Wait. Wait. Um...

588
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,885
I'm sorry, it's just dumb.

589
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,220
It's not you.
It's just I, um...

590
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,524
I feel like
I'm cheating on my husband.

591
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,595
Is this what it felt like
when you first opened
your marriage?

592
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:24,567
Our marriage
was suffocating us.

593
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:28,972
Being with someone else...

594
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,574
...felt like
finally breathing fresh air.

595
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:43,854
You really are amazing.

596
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:45,688
So I'm told.

597
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:51,895
But this... this...
is not gonna fix my marriage.

598
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:56,365
-I'm so sorry.
-Me too.

599
00:32:58,034 --> 00:32:59,268
It's okay.

600
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:12,983
I checked on Liz,
and a smoothie went down and is
in her stomach safe and sound.

601
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,485
You handled that disimpaction
like an experienced surgeon.

602
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,988
You didn't need a surgeon
for that.

603
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,589
Any teenager in an arcade
could've figured it out.

604
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,959
Maybe just take the compliment.

605
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,961
Where are you going?

606
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:27,496
To update Liz's chart.

607
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,366
Oh, you thought today
was just about learning
to disimpact an esophagus?

608
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,002
What else would it be about?

609
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,938
Your first
transesophageal echocardiogram.

610
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:37,306
-Really?
-Yeah, come on up.

611
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:47,483
-So you... You want me to...
-Find the heart.

612
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:49,685
It's just like the EGD, okay?

613
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,989
Insert the scope, flat side
facing the floor of the mouth.

614
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,358
Good, slowly feed it
down the esophagus.

615
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,930
Good, good.
Now adjust the angle.

616
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:07,369
There. I-I might be biased,
but every time I see that,
it feels like the first time.

617
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,872
It's incredible.

618
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,587
Her EEG looks stable.

619
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,122
Mm-hmm.

620
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,293
I'm sorry for challenging you.

621
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,628
Kwan was in your head.

622
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,064
Yes.

623
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,199
Your star may be on the rise,

624
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:42,839
but that is not the same as
having years of experience
with hundreds of patients.

625
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:46,575
Whatever you know about
the patient's family,
their loved ones,

626
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,412
you keep it out of my OR or you
do not step foot inside it.

627
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,915
It won't happen again.

628
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,719
Okay. Now get started on
a write-up for grand rounds.

629
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:59,022
You're gonna present this
at grand rounds.

630
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:03,425
We are. Congratulations.

631
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,334
Wilson, hey, about that surge.

632
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:15,071
No. Marcus,
I am grateful to you
for saving my pregnancy,

633
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,807
but that does not mean that
you get to walk all over me.

634
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,475
-I'm sorry?
-I'm not your patient.

635
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:20,776
I'm your colleague.

636
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,444
Sharking my surgeries
doesn't help me.

637
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,613
It undermines my authority
and limits my training.

638
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,983
-I was just trying to help.
-Don't flatter yourself.

639
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:30,153
-I can advocate for myself.
-I'm sorry.

640
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:34,024
And it's "surgery,"
not "surge."

641
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,597
This some sort of OB showdown?

642
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,468
The three of us decided
it was time for a little talk.

643
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,604
Well, he earned it.

644
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:50,941
Do you want to go for a burger?

645
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,910
As long as I don't have to
talk about vaginal tears.

646
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:57,047
- Okay.
- Good deal.

647
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:06,089
-I love those crackers.
-Yeah. You never
let me throw them away

648
00:36:06,222 --> 00:36:08,457
when we got soup
from our neighborhood deli.

649
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,459
What kind of soup?

650
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:13,263
You liked
their Manhattan clam chowder.

651
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,635
-I called your parents.
-What?

652
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,272
-Why?
-I was worried.

653
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:25,976
And then I found out that they
had no idea about your surgery

654
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,846
-or that we're back together.
-Well, I didn't want them
to freak out.

655
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,816
Okay, but you lied to me
about it.

656
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,652
I think you know
you're on a slippery slope.

657
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,554
This isn't like last time.

658
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:41,992
Yeah, which you also
didn't tell me about.
I found out from Dave.

659
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,294
Okay, look,
I am so close to remembering.

660
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:47,596
No one with retrograde amnesia
has ever gotten
their memories back.

661
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,066
What makes you think
you're different?

662
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,137
I don't know. But that day
that I saw you in the ER,

663
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,972
I mean, that was the first time

664
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:59,541
I felt like
a piece of my old life
was trying to resurface.

665
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,046
I do. I wanna remember
my grandparents

666
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:08,184
and-and family vacations
and my college graduation.

667
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,920
I don't feel whole.

668
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,156
I want to.

669
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,458
I need to.

670
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,661
Because I don't know
what will happen if I don't.

671
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,033
Are you only with me

672
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,237
because you think it might help
get your memory back?

673
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,877
I, um...

674
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't know.

675
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,921
-Hey, um...
-Yeah.

676
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,856
...so I reviewed
Allan's post-op labs.

677
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,025
-Everything looks good.
-Great, thank you.

678
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,795
And great catch with
the thrombosis. He could have
gone septic and died.

679
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:55,098
Yeah, I don't understand why
he won't just call his brother.

680
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,765
He'd have a kidney tomorrow.

681
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,668
Yeah, sometimes people are
their own biggest obstacles.

682
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:03,772
Hey, uh, do you think
I need to repeat intern year?

683
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,609
You said that all internships
should be longer,
but they're not.

684
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,946
The rest of my class
is already moving on.

685
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,581
If I have to remediate,
that'll go on my record.

686
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:16,119
Competitive specialties
and fellowships
will be off the table.

687
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,587
My surgical skills
are as good as my classmates,

688
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,457
but my career
is going to suffer

689
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,126
because I tried
to save a patient
who was going to die anyway.

690
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,929
You're right,
but that's up to Catherine Fox.

691
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:28,298
Do you think
I can change her mind?

692
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,402
I'm not sure,
but I know someone who might.

693
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:37,807
So, if you have
any suggestions
on how I could approach her

694
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,977
or what to say,
I'd really appreciate it.

695
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,080
You want advice
on how to persuade my wife?

696
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:46,249
Yes, sir.

697
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,623
Couple of years ago,
I surprised her
with a trip to the Maldives.

698
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,361
Booked one of those bungalows
that's over the water,

699
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:02,298
a five-star restaurant,
sunset yacht cruises.

700
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:04,167
It sounds really nice.

701
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,771
Oh, it was paradise.
You know what she said
the best part was?

702
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,773
Yeah, I don't--

703
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,843
It was a little coffee pot
in our room

704
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:17,646
that was stocked with
Seattle roaster coffee.

705
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:20,917
Said she never found
anything better.

706
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:23,153
You understand what I'm saying?

707
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:26,688
You could've saved
a lot of money and gone to
the café next door?

708
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:31,895
No.
 I'm saying that once she makes up her mind about something,

709
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:35,465
she needs a really good reason
for her to change it.

710
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,467
And you don't have it.

711
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,035
Sorry.

712
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,870
<i>When you want</i>
<i>something badly,</i>

713
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,207
<i>it's hard to know if or when</i>
<i>to throw in the towel.</i>

714
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:47,210
A glass of the house white,
and his next drink is on me.

715
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,579
I'm presenting at grand rounds!

716
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,148
It's over. Me and Molly.

717
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:55,151
I'm so sorry. Was it Dave?

718
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:59,989
Hey. It took me longer
to get out of there
than I thought it would.

719
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,392
-Did someone die?
-Blue and Molly broke up.

720
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,028
Oh, sorry.
Did she go back to Dave?

721
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:09,731
I just did my first
transesophageal echocardiogram.

722
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,334
Read the room, Millin.

723
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,203
Blue and Molly broke up.
Don't ask about Dave.

724
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,905
-Who's Dave?
-Can you not talk about me
in front of me?

725
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,574
Nobody wants to talk about you.

726
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,043
Could I just get a rum and coke
and whatever he wants?

727
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:21,611
Hey, hey, what about me?

728
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,745
I'll buy you a drink
when you and Griffith break up.

729
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,249
So, never.

730
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,585
-Hey, can I get...
-Shh, shh, shh.

731
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:35,391
<i>So we push the limits.</i>

732
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:40,430
<i>Hoping if we put in a little</i>
<i>more time, more effort,</i>
<i>maybe it'll all work out.</i>

733
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,366
You're not
a margherita flatbread
with a side salad.

734
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:49,606
Um, Ben, Teddy's here.
Yeah, I'll call you later.

735
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:55,445
Uh, did you want, uh,
mini red, mini white?
The mini bourbon's mine.

736
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,281
Uh, mini gin and tonic.

737
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:03,519
Ah, only if you, uh, want it
served in a giant glass.

738
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,023
Okay.

739
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,493
Uh, congratulations on
your presentation.

740
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,295
Thanks.

741
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,934
Uh, I didn't see you
and Beckman after.

742
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,937
Oh. Yeah, we, uh...
we left and ended up--

743
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,441
You know, I don't need to know.
I work with both your husbands.

744
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,746
We ended up going to
the environmental health panel.

745
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,814
That's not what I expected.

746
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,283
Honestly...

747
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:36,886
me neither.

748
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:39,788
-Cheers.
-Ah.

749
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:47,263
Take it right out of the...
Okay. Get you some pretzels.

750
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,798
Uh...

751
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,809
<i>Or you could</i>
<i>crash and burn.</i>

752
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,279
<i>Taking everything you love</i>
<i>down with you.</i>

753
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,193
<i>But you won't know</i>
<i>until you try.</i>
