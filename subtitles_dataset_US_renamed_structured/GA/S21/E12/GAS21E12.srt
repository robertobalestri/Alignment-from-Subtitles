1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:06,640
<i>If I learned anything</i>
<i>from growing up in a hospital,</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,177
<i>it's that the standard of care</i>
<i>changes over the years.</i>

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,511
Our meta-analysis
confirms the correlation

4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,848
between the gut microbiome
and Alzheimer's.

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,983
Let's look at the data.

6
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,285
Wait. What is this?

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,752
I made some changes.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,122
Because all these institutions
kept rejecting us.

9
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,890
So if we want
to win this grant,

10
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:24,758
I thought we need
more patient data.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,227
Ellis broke the drawer!

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,428
- We just moved in.
- I didn't mean to!

13
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,997
It's okay.
I-I can fix it.

14
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,933
Uh, make sure
you triple proofread.

15
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,135
If Pitney is judging,
he points out every typo

16
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,103
passive-aggressively.

17
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,806
Did Nick tell you
he won the Blaisdell
Grant four years ago?

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,274
You did?
Yeah.

19
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,009
The judges are tough.
The competition's tougher.

20
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,945
You fire questions at each
other in the final round.

21
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:47,014
Alright. I am regretting
not studying on the plane.

22
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,350
A 373% increase
in Alzheimer's diagnosis

23
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,153
among
30 to 44-year-olds?

24
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,223
Yeah, we had
a 41-year-old patient.
University professor.

25
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,790
You should put it
in your presentation.

26
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,658
Your patients are fire
compared to these slides.

27
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,760
Not as fire as getting there
on time. We should go.

28
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,896
Oh. Yeah.

29
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,396
-Love you.
-Good luck.

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,132
Thank you.

31
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,701
<i>If you had a cold</i>
<i>in the late 1800s,</i>

32
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,239
<i>your doctor would prescribe</i>
<i>heroin as a cough suppressant.</i>

33
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,041
<i>If you had schizophrenia</i>
<i>in the 1930s,</i>

34
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>your doctor would perform</i>
<i>a lobotomy.</i>

35
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,814
<i>But despite the increase</i>
<i>in knowledge and research,</i>

36
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,250
<i>doctors still aren't perfect.</i>

37
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,852
So now that
we're engaged...

38
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,220
Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,388
...the real question is...

40
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,991
DJ or cover band?

41
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,126
Cover bands
are <i>so</i> cheesy.

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,062
I was kind of hoping
that we would have
a really small wedding.

43
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,232
Small like...
50 guests?

44
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,035
No. Like, um...

45
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,071
you, me, the kids,

46
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,207
and...a witness.

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,575
We have to
invite my parents.

48
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,077
Oh.

49
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,213
What about Schmitt?
Don't you want <i>him</i> there?

50
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,881
No, it's not that.
I just --

51
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:57,651
I, you know, have already
done the huge wedding.

52
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,088
I just -- I don't want to
make it a big deal.

53
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,026
So you just want to go
down to the courthouse

54
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,360
and sign the paperwork?

55
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,229
I've done that, too.

56
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,131
<i>Even today,</i>
<i>your doctor's not likely</i>

57
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,699
<i>to offer pain relief</i>
<i>for an I.U.D. placement,</i>

58
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,735
<i>even though it can be more</i>
<i>agonizing than a vasectomy.</i>

59
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,306
<i>We expect doctors</i>
<i>to not make mistakes.</i>

60
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,107
<i>But the history of medicine</i>

61
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,209
<i>is a history</i>
<i>of flawed judgment.</i>

62
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,312
Don't open your eyes.
Nope.

63
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,779
And...

64
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,315
I present to you...

65
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,984
"Molly and Blue:
the greatest bites."

66
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,551
What is this?

67
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:35,022
Okay. Here we have the
third-date garlic sirloin

68
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:38,125
that led us to
our very first time...

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,793
You know what.

70
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,097
And the six-month anniversary
trip to San Francisco.

71
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,432
Crab cakes.

72
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,869
And the "I love you"
bacon fried rice.

73
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:51,538
And how did you have
the time to do all of this?

74
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,107
Well --
Here we go.

75
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,541
I thought
it'd be a fun way

76
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,911
for you to relive
a little of your past.

77
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,612
You know?
The tastes, smells.

78
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,286
You know, they're not
gonna make me remember.

79
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, experimental surgery
might not, either,

80
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,025
but this is a lot less risky,
so why not try?

81
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,329
Let me guess.
Dave again?

82
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,431
Look. I turned down
his marriage proposal.

83
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,700
I mean, it's hard to
just cut someone out
of your life like that.

84
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,704
I'm late for pre-rounds.

85
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,639
You should go.

86
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,883
I never liked her.

87
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,818
Shouldn't we like
our therapist?

88
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,820
Who says <i>I</i> don't?

89
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,655
She clearly doesn't know
who we are.

90
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,158
Do <i>we?</i>

91
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,530
I mean, isn't -- isn't
that why we see her?

92
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,268
She told us to try an
unconventional marriage.

93
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,603
Because we told her
that sometimes

94
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,039
we are attracted
to other people,

95
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,639
so she's trying to
help us solve the issue.

96
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,342
Oh, so you want
an open marriage

97
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,609
and sleep with
other people?
I didn't say that!

98
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,844
You're not denying it.

99
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,181
Owen! Owen!
I am in love with <i>you.</i>

100
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,885
But if we continue
like this...

101
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,253
I don't want to lose you.

102
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,822
But we both feel
stifled and stuck.

103
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,357
"Stuck."

104
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,193
I want to change this,
but it doesn't feel like you do.

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,535
Oh, my grandma asked
where you were last night.

106
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,036
Well, she asked
about Linus,

107
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,872
but I'm pretty sure
that meant you.

108
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:34,208
Are they...

109
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,677
Us. A year ago. They're
here for interviews.

110
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,213
They look so rested.

111
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,881
We'll be in charge
of them soon.

112
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,084
Unless you're Adams.

113
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,885
No offense.

114
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,854
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

115
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,755
Wait.
You know someone?

116
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,158
Uh, the woman
in the purple sweater.

117
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,861
We <i>might</i> have
gone out last night

118
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,364
and I maybe might have
slept at her hotel.

119
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,100
What's she doing here?

120
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,767
We didn't talk details.

121
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,236
Who's the kid?

122
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,604
I don't know.
But he wasn't there

123
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,973
when she was doing
things to my neck --

124
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,341
Yes.

125
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,977
We've got prospective
interns visiting today.

126
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,080
And, yes,
that means that you --

127
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,816
You are about to be
second years, so act like it!

128
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,650
Stop standing around.

129
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,587
I want you to
take some initiative.

130
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,654
Make me look good.
Understand?

131
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,557
Where the hell is Kwan?

132
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,459
I'm here!
Here. I'm here.

133
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:29,430
Late. And sloppy.
You're on scut.

134
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,931
Yeah.

135
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,566
You'll be working
shoulder to shoulder

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,269
with the world's most
renowned surgeons attending.

137
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,037
Adams!

138
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,175
Melissa Walker, 52,
presented to the E.D.

139
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,077
three days ago
with abdominal pain,

140
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,278
nausea, fatigue.

141
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,113
Ultrasound
revealed gallstones.

142
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,748
She is now post-op
day two from a lap chole.

143
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,917
LFTs are all normal.

144
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,552
That's the video
I wanted to watch!

145
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,719
No, that one's dumb.

146
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,288
-Mom!
-Mom!

147
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,724
Okay. Jenina, can you take
them to get something to eat?

148
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,728
Oh. Wait.
Can we get something

149
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,164
from the gift shop, too?

150
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,698
Sure. Under $20.

151
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,973
Oh, oh, oh.
Are you in pain?

152
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,742
Mnh. I'm trying to
keep it in for my girls.

153
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,478
I mean, I know they may
look like they only care

154
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,046
about the phone.

155
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,747
Ever since I've been
in the hospital,

156
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,383
t-they're terrified that
they're gonna wake up

157
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,517
one day without me.

158
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,985
Ohh.
I-I understand.

159
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,055
Ohh. Okay.

160
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,456
I thought the surgery

161
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,158
was supposed to
take away the pain.

162
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,793
Yeah.
Uh, unfortunately,

163
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,497
it's probably inflammation
from the procedure,

164
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,699
but Dr. Adams will order
a CT just to make sure.

165
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,368
Okay?
Okay.

166
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,471
Hannah,
how are you doing?

167
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,973
Starving!

168
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,075
How long till we get
this show on the road?

169
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,577
Her INR is a bit high.

170
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,378
I'm sorry.
We should push

171
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,415
your hernia repair to
tomorrow just to be safe.

172
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,017
I'd like to see your labs
at a normal range.

173
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,386
Does that mean
I can eat?

174
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,021
I'll get you a menu.

175
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,856
Okay.

176
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,860
...was closely
linked to the discovery

177
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,462
of amyloid-beta oligomers
and plaques.

178
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,797
So with the correlation
to Alzheimer's confirmed,

179
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,701
our next steps
are how and why.

180
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,303
Our proposal
will significantly expand

181
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,639
our current data
on the microbiota

182
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,442
of the descendants of
people with Alzheimer's.

183
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,981
Is there a problem?

184
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,315
More of a question

185
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,417
about the veracity
of your research.

186
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,553
W-We have data
to support everything.

187
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,688
That's not our concern.
Another team presented

188
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,423
something similar
this morning,

189
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,260
except they're
several steps ahead.

190
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,662
That's impossible.
Who was that?

191
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,600
Where is he?

192
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,738
Grey! Shepherd!

193
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,073
Ohh!
This is a surprise.

194
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,209
Welcome to my lab...

195
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:59,246
where, uh, ahem, visits
are by appointment only.

196
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,614
Tuesday mornings
are good.

197
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,216
Oh. Meet my vassal,
Tommy.

198
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,450
I prefer protégé.

199
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,653
You're Tom and Tommy?

200
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,154
Well, my given name
is Vincenzo.

201
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,290
I needed something
I could remember.

202
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,158
I'm glad you're here.

203
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,427
I owe you a thank-you note,
and this saves me a stamp.

204
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,664
That abstract you published
was a gripping read.

205
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,932
Gripping enough to present
for a Blaisdell Grant?

206
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,701
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It was just a starting point.

207
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,003
You made it public,
so anyone could use it, right?

208
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,272
We weren't specifically
thinking about you, Tom.

209
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,374
And yet I'm the only one
who seems to have made

210
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,943
a groundbreaking
discovery.

211
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,447
Unless you've also
used antibiotics in mice

212
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,282
to trigger
a significant decrease

213
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:36,850
in Alzheimer's markers.

214
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,919
Hm? No? No.

215
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,521
Chins up.

216
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,123
Only one of us needs
to find a cure. Right?

217
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,559
Hm.

218
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,306
The girls are
at your brother's?!

219
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,474
He was in town.

220
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,475
Because Vegas
won't let him back.

221
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,776
The last time
he babysat,

222
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,278
he used a credit card
you gave him to --

223
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,446
Hi, Dr. Wilson.

224
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,847
Mr. and Mrs. Kotwani.

225
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,716
I expected to see you
two weeks ago.

226
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,950
So did we.

227
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,652
But this little guy
is as forgetful

228
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,220
about dates
as his father.

229
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,889
I apologized three times
for leaving them at home.

230
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,827
I've been eating dried dates
to induce labor naturally.

231
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,994
We've tried
acupuncture,

232
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,730
sex, long walks.

233
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,098
Passive aggression.

234
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,700
O-Okay, well, um, you
are 14 days overdue,

235
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,869
so we will need
to induce medically.

236
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,038
Can't those drugs
cause complications?

237
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,040
You've reached the point where
you can have complications

238
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,274
if you <i>don't</i> deliver.

239
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,542
I wish
we could keep trying.

240
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,511
Well, we need to
run some tests,

241
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,848
but maybe you'll go
into labor before that.

242
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,616
<i>AJ Angstrum,</i>
<i>return to the admit desk.</i>

243
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,918
<i>AJ Angstrum,</i>
<i>return to the admit desk.</i>

244
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,720
Her name's Vivi.
We've been talking,

245
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,389
but when I get home,

246
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,691
I'm gonna ask her
to be my girlfriend.

247
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,393
Jules?

248
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,396
You two know
each other?

249
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,164
We met last night.

250
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,734
Oh.

251
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,236
Convenient.

252
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm getting a vibe.

253
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,442
Like -- Like when
my homie Edgar

254
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,043
hooked up with
Elena Alvarez

255
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,678
and then he got
all weird around her.

256
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,547
How about we let
the doctors talk?

257
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,349
Great idea. Millin?
Yeah. Right.

258
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,050
Um. Carlos Navarro, 16.

259
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,986
History of
pectus excavatum.

260
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,823
Presents for the modified Nuss
procedure to raise the sternum.

261
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,991
No past
surgical history.

262
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,493
I'm gonna do a quick
exam, Carlos, alright?

263
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,695
Any, uh,
shortness of breath?

264
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,730
Mnh-mnh.

265
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,200
So...is Carlos
your...son?

266
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,169
I'm his patient
advocate.
Ah.

267
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,838
I work with foster
youth in Texas.

268
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,740
When my caseworker
finally approved my surgery,

269
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,042
Adriana called Dr. Beltran.

270
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,878
They used to
be married.

271
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:47,181
Yeah. Just not relevant
to your case.

272
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,349
-Ndugu, how are we looking?
-Asymptomatic.

273
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,717
His echo was normal.
Heart sounds great.

274
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,219
Great. That means
we can move forward.

275
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,987
Do you remember
how this works?
Uh, yeah.

276
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,356
You place a curved metal bar
under my rib cage

277
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,927
and then flip it over
to expand my chest.

278
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,162
And Vivi's not gonna be able
to resist me with my new pecs.

279
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,664
Well, right
on the first part.

280
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,332
Can't help you
on the second part.

281
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,602
Millin is gonna get you
prepped for surgery, okay?

282
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,070
Millin?
Yeah. Right. Right.

283
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,104
What she said.

284
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,739
See you soon.

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,249
These mice
have a family history

286
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,750
of beta-amyloid plaque.

287
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,752
Now, thanks to
your abstract, we know

288
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,489
that changes in the gut
microbiome can lead to --

289
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,257
Which of my students
knows the answer?

290
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,326
An inflammatory response
in the microglia?

291
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,963
Bingo! You're slow on the
buzzer today, Shepherd.

292
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,730
Not your student
anymore.

293
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,133
Of course, microglia are
crucial to the formation

294
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,003
of beta-amyloid plaques,
so I thought,

295
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,673
what if we use antibiotics
to change their microbiome?

296
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,843
To see if it led to
a reduction in plaque.

297
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,411
It did. By twofold.

298
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:55,482
Why do you even need
grant money?

299
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,750
You have
the Fox Foundation.

300
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,752
Oh, research funding
is like sex with me.

301
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,387
You can never
have enough.

302
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,322
And if I'd had breakfast, it'd
be coming back up right now.

303
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,658
Okay. Who wouldn't want
a Blaisdell Grant?

304
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,059
It's not just about
the money.

305
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,061
It's about prestige
and notice.

306
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,130
Then you parlay that
into speaking engagements,

307
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,866
a book deal, and...

308
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,034
And maybe you could
cure Alzheimer's.

309
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,736
Well, sure,
but when my work

310
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,472
changes the face
of medicine,

311
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,074
everybody wins.

312
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,243
Even you, Dr. Grey.

313
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:35,023
Oh. I see
you're keeping busy.

314
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,490
Does this mean
you're feeling better?

315
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,026
It means
I'm a procrastinator,

316
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,961
and Bianca's school play
is in a week.

317
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,029
Oh.

318
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,629
I hope I'm out of here
to see it.

319
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,231
Who's she playing?

320
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,301
A hot hors d'oeuvre. In
"Beauty and the Beast."

321
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,903
You know, I think
she's secretly hoping

322
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,071
the feather duster gets sick
so she can step in.

323
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,372
Mm-hmm.

324
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,542
Oh. Okay.
Your CT results were normal,

325
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,145
but we will give you
something for the pain.

326
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,715
But hopefully it will subside
as your body heals, okay?

327
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,284
Um, order repeat LFTs.

328
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,587
<i>Now</i> we're talkin'!

329
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,789
Two pieces
of banana cake!

330
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,557
Ooh! Y-You want one?

331
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,093
Uh, I wish.
I'm allergic to bananas.

332
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,795
Ever since menopause hit.

333
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,932
Yeah, well, allergies
can start at any time.

334
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:20,969
Did you develop any others
when you started menopause?

335
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,905
A few.
Some cheeses. Nuts.

336
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:27,075
Plus the standard symptoms.

337
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,744
Hot flashes, night sweats,
stomach pain.

338
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,113
But I guess that was
the gallbladder.

339
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,415
Well, I ordered
more pain meds.

340
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,150
We'll see if that
does the trick.

341
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,252
<i>Dr. Isenberg, 4-6-7-3.</i>

342
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,289
<i>Dr. Isenberg, 4-6-7-3.</i>

343
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,258
I read something
about amines

344
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,693
producing
excess serotonin

345
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,863
in people with
carcinoid syndrome.

346
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,933
Bananas, cheeses, nuts.
They're all high in amines.

347
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,302
Uh, you think my patient has
a one-in-a-million cancer?

348
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,938
S-Should she get
a PET scan?

349
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,405
If Bailey asked me to.

350
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,975
Anna's surgery
got pushed.

351
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,643
Do you mind if I do it?

352
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,512
Uh, knock yourself out.

353
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,048
If you're working
on my patients,

354
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,482
Mr. Follett needs
a rectal exam.

355
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,417
Hm. That's gonna
be all you.

356
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,420
Hey. where are
Carlos' pre-op labs?

357
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,822
I haven't put in
the order yet.

358
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,658
Ndugu had me
discharge Miles Aina.

359
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,593
Okay, well,
do you want to tell him

360
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,928
that you're delaying
his surgery or should I?

361
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:23,497
I will put
the order in A.S.A.P.

362
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,802
Hey. Thank you
for taking Carlos' case.

363
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:29,236
The favor means a lot.

364
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,872
You know I'm not
doing it for <i>you.</i>

365
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,673
<i>Satellite Pharmacy, 2-1-2-7.</i>

366
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,775
<i>Satellite Pharmacy, 2-1-2-7.</i>

367
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,677
Can someone turn up
the heat in Carlos' room?

368
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,713
He says it's "cold as balls."
It's his words, not mine.

369
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,381
You didn't tell me
your ex worked here.

370
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,950
I didn't know
<i>you</i> worked here.

371
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,651
You didn't say that you were
in town for a patient.

372
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,187
You want
my whole life story?

373
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,322
Just be chill.
Monica's cool with it.

374
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,692
Cool or she doesn't know?

375
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,226
She knows.

376
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,997
<i>Dr. Sarno,</i>
<i>call Oncology, 2-6-2-2.</i>

377
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,800
Hey!
Hey.

378
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,601
I examined your patient with
pulmonary valve stenosis,

379
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,004
and she's cleared
for surgery.

380
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:04,038
Great.

381
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:06,007
Whoa!
Look at that rock!

382
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,108
Did you get engaged?

383
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,176
Yes.

384
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,576
Congratulations.

385
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,412
Link did great.
Is there a date?

386
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,681
Uh, no.
We're having a little,

387
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,550
um, debate
about the wedding.

388
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,087
Oh, well, if yours
doesn't kill your priest,

389
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,520
you're one up
on me and Owen.

390
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:23,457
Hm! Well, you guys don't
set the bar very high.

391
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,226
Okay. Ready for
your Pitoc-- Ohh!

392
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,695
You said
you locked the door!

393
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,031
I said
it didn't <i>have</i> a lock!

394
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,498
Sorry! We were
just trying to induce!

395
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,433
Aah!
Oh, God!

396
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,937
Oh! God!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, oh.

397
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,344
Is this the guy
who fell upstairs?

398
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,014
Unh! I think
I broke my ass! Ow!

399
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,749
He's got pain
near the tailbone

400
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,085
after falling off his wife
and the hospital bed.

401
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,486
They were trying
to induce labor.

402
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,888
Naturally.

403
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,323
She said she'd divorce me
if I didn't!

404
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,925
Anand, Dr. Hunt
is going to help you.

405
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,227
I'm going back
to Shruti.

406
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,727
She just went on
the Pitocin drip.

407
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,562
Okay, but this
really hurts. Aah!

408
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,598
On a scale of 1 to 10,
it's like a 47!

409
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,067
That is
oddly specific.

410
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,334
And not something you
should tell your wife

411
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,602
while she is in labor.

412
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,507
I'm needed upstairs.

413
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,574
Okay.

414
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,410
<i>Dr. Mousa to the NICU.</i>

415
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,013
<i>Dr. Jennah Mousa to the NICU.</i>

416
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:22,516
Ah! Hey. What do you know
about bananas and menopause?

417
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,152
Doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

418
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,319
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

419
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,890
My one night stand
is Beltran's ex-wife.

420
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,624
How did you manage that?

421
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,893
I saw a hot woman
in a bar.

422
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,727
She's here with
a patient from Texas.

423
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,263
So she'll be out of
here soon. Lay low.

424
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,199
I'm on Beltran's service.
And she knows.

425
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,466
Oh, it <i>is</i> that bad.

426
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,601
What do I do?

427
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,237
Get off the case.

428
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,442
He's got my resources,

429
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,645
and now he's going to
get my grant funding.

430
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,713
And so you're upset
he's using your work

431
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,183
to compete against <i>you.</i>

432
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,617
No. I'm upset
his research is good.

433
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,253
Yeah.
I mean, Tom Koracick

434
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,222
has been doing this
for five minutes,

435
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,857
and he's actually
moving the needle.

436
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,292
Yeah, that's what
money does.

437
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,960
And he wants
more of it.

438
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,029
But he doesn't care
about Alzheimer's.

439
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,563
He might as well
be researching

440
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,798
genetically modified
tomatoes.

441
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,366
Well, they are
actually studying those

442
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,969
to see if they fight cancer.

443
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,204
You know what I mean.

444
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,370
I <i>do</i> know what you mean.

445
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,074
I mean,
it's a game to him.

446
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,474
He's never had to search

447
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,845
for a grandmother
who's gone missing

448
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:27,747
or taken car keys
away from a dad

449
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,382
or look into the eyes
of a mother

450
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,152
who's alive
but not there.

451
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,321
Well, that's something
you have that he does not.

452
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,056
Passion.

453
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,557
I don't think the
Blaisdell Grant judges
care about passion.

454
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,693
You say Koracick's got
the advantage right now,

455
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,162
so all you can do is
make a case for yourself.

456
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,197
That's all you can do.

457
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:45,032
Might be your last shot.

458
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,703
-You paged?
-Yeah. Possible broken coccyx.

459
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,571
He has swelling and bruising
at the base of the spine.

460
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,074
I'm just ordering
the X-rays.

461
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,809
I didn't even
need a boy!

462
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,710
Anand's wife is being
induced upstairs.

463
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,212
Congratulations.

464
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,413
Whatever. Aah! I have
two teenage daughters.

465
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,150
Do you know how long
it's been since I've
changed a diaper? Aah!

466
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:04,618
They got a lot more
options now.

467
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,786
Ohh! My house has been
chaos for 17 years.

468
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,455
I've been counting the days
till an empty nest

469
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,024
since my youngest
started high school.

470
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,725
In my mind, Shruti and I
were spending next summer

471
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,028
in Cinque Terre, drinking
prosecco and eating pesto,

472
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,395
but Shruti suddenly
wanted a boy,

473
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,530
so now I've got
a broken ass. Aah!

474
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,200
I still don't see how
those things are related.

475
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,968
You don't want to.

476
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,374
I had my first interview
with an intern candidate.

477
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,574
Very impressive.

478
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,277
Oh no.
It's a strong group.

479
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,645
One of them interned at the
World Health Organization.

480
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,613
Dr. Bailey,
can I show you something?

481
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,615
Mm-hmm.
I overheard Melissa Walker

482
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,118
talking about
her symptoms.

483
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,853
They seem to be in line
with carcinoid syndrome,

484
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:42,223
so I took her for a PET scan
and sent some labs.

485
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,226
Uh, who asked you to
take her for a PET scan?

486
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,593
No one,
but I was taking in--

487
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,129
Dr. Griffith,
you're on my service.

488
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,298
You can't go running scans
on whatever patients

489
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,698
you want to
just because --

490
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,734
Melissa has a
neuroendocrine tumor.

491
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:59,472
1.5 centimeters on the
appendix. I'll be damned.

492
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,474
There's also a small
spot on the liver.

493
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,311
I thought her symptoms
were menopause.

494
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:04,544
Yeah, so did I.

495
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,180
Well, that makes sense.

496
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,715
The tumor is secreting hormones
into the bloodstream.

497
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,018
She needs an appy
and a liver biopsy.

498
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,188
Can Adams take over
your service?

499
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,356
Yeah, I suppose so.

500
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,457
Alright, then,
Griffith, book an O.R.

501
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,361
for you and whoever
you want to assist.

502
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,761
To assist...?

503
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:24,531
You. You found it.
You take it out.

504
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,368
Uh...solo surgery?

505
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,836
If you don't think
you're ready...

506
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,204
Oh, no, I'm r--
I can do it! Thank you!

507
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,173
Alright. See you
in the operating room.

508
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,774
Yeah. Hey.
Congratulations.

509
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,585
<i>OT Morell to the 3rd-Floor</i>
<i>nurses' station.</i>

510
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,822
<i>OT Morell to the 3rd-Floor</i>
<i>nurses' station.</i>

511
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,992
Well, Carlos' pre-op labs
came back normal,

512
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,195
which, honestly, as the
intern on this case, <i>you</i>
should be telling <i>me.</i>

513
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,965
Dr. Beltran, I-I swear.
I had no idea.

514
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,836
If -- If you want me off the
case, I completely understand.

515
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,604
Talk me through
the Nuss procedure.

516
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,942
Now would be good.

517
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:12,446
Uh, get
thoracoscopic access

518
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,116
and perform cryoablation
on the intercostal nerves.

519
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:16,484
And then?

520
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,585
L-Lateral incisions
either side of the chest.

521
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,755
And then you pass the tunneling
bar under the sternum.

522
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,523
You're prepped.
You're with me.

523
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,926
Unless <i>you</i> want
off this case.

524
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,295
No, no, no.
I'll see you in the O.R.

525
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,529
Okay.

526
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,373
Oh!

527
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,144
I don't have time
to wait in lines.

528
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,779
Uh, hey, have you
ever read about

529
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:48,615
grid stimulations
to recall memories?

530
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,985
It's only ever been done
successfully on animal models.

531
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,920
Sounds cool.
Or risky and dangerous

532
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,955
and not proven to work,
yet Molly wants it.

533
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,291
I really need to eat
something before surgery.

534
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,293
You never held a retractor
on an empty stomach?

535
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,693
She's not holding
a retractor.

536
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,064
Bailey is letting me
take a lead on an appy.

537
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:05,565
Wait. You're getting
a solo surgery? I hate you!

538
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,934
Hm. You hate me
or you love me?

539
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,070
Because Bailey said
I could pick an intern

540
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,603
to go in with me.

541
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,373
Beltran's not gonna
release me from her service.

542
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:14,241
So she doesn't know
you slept with her ex.

543
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,043
- What?
- What?

544
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,710
So! It's an appy?

545
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,547
What about you? Technically,
she's your patient.

546
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,383
Um, I still have a bunch
of H&Ps to do for Webber,

547
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,118
but I know
you'll do great.

548
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,753
Well, it looks like
it's just you and me.

549
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,255
Fine. Let's go.

550
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:37,398
So...she's operating
on <i>your</i> patient?

551
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,731
Who'd you sleep with again?

552
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:45,573
Okay. You are
8 centimeters dilated.

553
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,707
And it's almost ready
to push.

554
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,110
Where is that
clumsy jerk?!

555
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:52,413
If you mean your husband,
he is waiting on a CT.

556
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,182
They want to scan
his pelvis and his spine

557
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:57,818
to make sure he doesn't
have an occult fracture.

558
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,187
This is your first, right?

559
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:01,856
Um, well,
my daughter's adopted,

560
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,358
but this is my first time
carrying.

561
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,462
When I told my husband
I was pregnant with our first,

562
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:10,898
he was so happy,
he cried.

563
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,067
This time, he barely
looked up from his phone

564
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,236
and said he'd get the crib
out of the garage.

565
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,271
Here. Let me make you
more comfortable, okay?

566
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,440
I know we've been through
this twice before,

567
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,941
but our son hasn't.

568
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,511
I want him to know
that he's special to us.

569
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,746
But now his dad is probably
gonna miss his birth!

570
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,984
I had to remind him about
that crib at least 10 times!

571
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,820
And -- Crap! I forgot to remind
him about the car seat!

572
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,088
Where's my phone?!

573
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,757
Oh. Uh...okay. Oh.
Here, here, here.

574
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,593
Shruti.

575
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:41,462
<i>Did you install</i>
<i>the car seat?!</i>

576
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,729
Oh, my God!
Are you in labor?!

577
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,098
What does it look like?!

578
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,299
So I did it!
I induced you!

579
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:46,433
My sex induced her.

580
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,602
<i>The Pitocin</i>
<i>induced me.</i>

581
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:50,670
Tell me that you remembered
to take the car seat

582
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,140
out of your trunk
and actually install it!

583
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:54,175
Okay.
<i>Of course I did.</i>

584
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,477
Take a breath.
You've got this.

585
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,945
<i>I love you.</i>

586
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,947
You're right. Thanks.

587
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,116
<i>I love you.</i>

588
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,884
I forgot the car seat.
Take me to the parking lot.

589
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:05,486
You shouldn't ignore
a possible fracture.

590
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,054
Are you married?
Because my wife means

591
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:08,455
the world to me, and
I just want her to be happy,

592
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,790
so can you please
take me back to my car?!

593
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,293
Uh...

594
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,363
Identify the right colon.

595
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:18,332
Follow the taenia coli
along the cecum

596
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,533
to locate the appendix.

597
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,068
Use the grasper
to clutch the tip

598
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,370
and hold it up towards
the lower right abdomen.

599
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,973
Could you talk to Molly?
As a doctor?

600
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,707
I don't think she understands
that no one knows

601
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,810
how to precisely target
where lost memories are,

602
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,012
and her surgery is scheduled
with Shepherd in two days.

603
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,315
Okay.
You cannot do this.

604
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,950
Thank you.
How do we tell Molly?

605
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:39,719
No. I mean
you cannot do <i>this.</i>

606
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,023
I am about to perform
my first solo surgery.

607
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,491
It's just an appy.

608
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,227
It's <i>my</i> appy

609
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,662
from start to finish
for the first time.

610
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,364
Melissa has two
scared daughters.

611
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:52,666
If anything happens
to her, it is on me.

612
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,202
So be my assist
or get out.

613
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,206
Also, instead of talking to me
about Molly's surgery,

614
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,541
try talking to Molly.

615
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:02,742
Okay. Are we ready?

616
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,213
Scalpel.

617
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,591
Okay. We're ready
to start getting

618
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,927
thoracoscopic access.
Let's drop the lung.

619
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,895
I met Carlos
when he was 12,

620
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,297
and he had a crush
on Vivi back then.

621
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,632
Still hasn't realized
that she's been waiting

622
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:25,798
for <i>h</i> to make
the first move.

623
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,434
Okay. Are we ready?

624
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,136
SATs look good
with one lung ventilation.

625
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,106
Okay. Millin, get
the Veress needle.

626
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,807
Alright, so, because
the lung is down,

627
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:35,643
the heart may have moved
from where it normally --

628
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:38,078
Okay. Needle's in.

629
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,247
Oh. Damn it! He's bleeding.
Why is he bleeding?!

630
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,915
Because you may have
punctured his heart.

631
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,285
I did what?! We need
to page Dr. Ndugu!

632
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,519
Okay, Millin,
I need you to breathe.

633
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,655
Someone page
Dr. Ndugu right now!

634
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,197
Alright. You know what?
It's still loose. Here.

635
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,465
I'll hold it down.
You pull.

636
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:01,035
Why is this
always so hard?!

637
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:03,037
I think it's a test.
Survival of the fittest.

638
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,772
Yeah. Hey...

639
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,840
Have you ever done
anything you didn't want to

640
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,208
in order to
help your marriage?

641
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,711
Like what?
Also -- not married.

642
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:14,148
Really? I mean, something
kind of unconventional.

643
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,449
Did Jo talk to you?

644
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:16,717
Why would Jo talk to me?

645
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,152
Because we just
got engaged,

646
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,321
and I want a conventional
wedding, she doesn't.

647
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,823
Oh, this is --
this is about <i>you.</i>
Hm.

648
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,759
Oh. Uh, well, you know,
I'm always open to things.

649
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,796
You know? Relationships
are about give-and-take.

650
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,997
That's what I learned
from my parents.

651
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,365
Uh-huh.

652
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,335
So, uh, how long
they been married?

653
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,603
Not as long as they've
been divorced.

654
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:39,106
First marriage, everything was
"my way or the highway."

655
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,109
Uh, but now they let
a lot of things slide.

656
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,044
Their second marriage seems
to be going a lot better.

657
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,946
Well, take it from someone
who's on his third.

658
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,514
It's a lot of hard work.

659
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,484
Congratulations,
by the way.

660
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,186
I'm sure
you'll be very happy.

661
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:57,925
Alright.
What happened?

662
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,760
I screwed up and
I punctured his heart.

663
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,795
For all we know, I could have
torn a hole right through it.

664
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,031
Vitals are stable for now.

665
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,369
Where are you going? Get back
in here and help fix this.

666
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,839
Let me see
the size of the needle.

667
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,608
Okay. How does that
compare to a 16-gauge?

668
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,210
It's about the same.

669
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,246
And we use those to do
intracardiac injections.

670
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,881
So what's your
recommendation?

671
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,684
Uh, do a pericardial window
and then place a drain

672
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:24,918
so that it can heal itself?

673
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,687
Correct. We will
take care of this.

674
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,222
And then you can help
Dr. Beltran finish

675
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,490
the Nuss procedure.

676
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:31,058
If Dr. Beltran
still wants me --

677
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,260
If you ask me one more time
if I want you on this case,

678
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:34,728
I'm going to lose my mind.

679
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,264
Focus and stay in lockstep.
Are you ready?

680
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,835
Okay. Good.
Let's see what's going on.

681
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:56,683
So how's it going?

682
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,654
So far, so good.
I was just about to
check on Mrs. Balaban.

683
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,623
Oh, you can, uh --
You can wait a minute.

684
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:09,563
My first solo surgery
was monumental.

685
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,466
I called my friends,
my family.

686
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:15,269
If memory serves, I even
bought a new pair of shoes

687
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,637
for the occasion.

688
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,005
Now I can't tell you
if it was

689
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:21,442
a cholecystectomy
or a hernia repair.

690
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,777
First one's
always a big deal.

691
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:25,479
Then so is the second.

692
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:28,015
10th. 100th.

693
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,651
You got your whole career
ahead of you.

694
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,620
Don't beat yourself up
over one lost surgery.

695
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:42,396
Ah. First Endoloop is on.

696
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:44,331
Ready for the next one.

697
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,266
Not so scary, right?

698
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,136
Muscle memory
is a powerful thing.

699
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,238
I wouldn't know.

700
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,540
With that attitude,
you never will.

701
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,010
Here.
Thank you.

702
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,382
Now, now, go slow.

703
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,650
Ah.

704
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,120
Uh...
it's caught in the port.

705
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:08,890
I need a new one.

706
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,797
It's still slipping.
My hands are big enough.

707
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:20,200
D-Do you think you have
smaller hands than me?

708
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,836
No. Try again.

709
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,504
Going again.

710
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:29,844
You know this. You've seen
it done a million times.

711
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,384
Almost there.

712
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,054
Got it!

713
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,690
Scissors.

714
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,934
Separating the appendix
from the cecum.

715
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,970
Endopouch, please.

716
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:12,085
Yeah.
Let's get it to path.

717
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,520
Well done.

718
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:14,956
Yeah.

719
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,391
Melissa should be
recovered in time

720
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,359
to see her daughter's
school play.

721
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,864
Before we close,
we would like to acknowledge

722
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:27,401
the 55 million people living
with Alzheimer's disease.

723
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,070
We feel passionately about
this work because of them.

724
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,372
And a Blaisdell Grant
would not only

725
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,474
help us continue the next
phase of our research,

726
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:36,577
but you'd be contributing
significantly

727
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,881
to our relentless
pursuit of a cure.

728
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,648
We're happy to take
any questions.

729
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,952
I got --
Hi. Hi. Yeah.

730
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:46,687
Are you proposing
to test a hypothesis

731
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,856
you've already
confirmed?
No.

732
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,960
No? I have a --
C-Can I -- Yeah.

733
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,895
Uh, theatrics aside,

734
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:56,730
this sounds like the study
your abstract was based on.

735
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,565
That involved
175 patients.

736
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,734
We would recruit
thousands in order to

737
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,037
identify specific
bacterial strains.

738
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,106
Yeah. Like I said,
more of the same, so...

739
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,474
Can you talk
about the people

740
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:08,910
you'll enroll
in the study?

741
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,378
Ages, ethnicities,
geographic locations?

742
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,814
Softball game's
at the park, Marsh.

743
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:14,481
Look, if you want to
make this personal,

744
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:17,451
let me tell you
about Paul, hm?

745
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,487
John, George, and Ringo.

746
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:23,624
The Beatles?
Not Beatles. Mice.

747
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,193
I've also got
Jermaine, Tito, Jackie,

748
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,594
Marlon, and Michael.

749
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:30,898
We're taking Alzheimer's
research to a new level.

750
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,935
That's right. Um...

751
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,937
Theatrics aside,

752
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,604
what about
the female mice?

753
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:39,373
The -- Excuse me?

754
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:42,409
Alzheimer's affects twice as
many women as it does men.

755
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,113
So are you only
studying male mice?

756
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,915
Of course. You put a few
female mice in a cage,

757
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,884
and pretty soon you have
a whole social hierarchy.

758
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,284
The young ones are
taking care of the oldest,

759
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:52,920
and they experience
anxiety and stress,

760
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:54,956
sometimes resulting
in hair loss.

761
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,126
And their hormone cycles
create fluctuations in behavior

762
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:01,129
that can render the
whole experiment useless.

763
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:04,264
Your inexperience
in neurology research
is showing great.

764
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:07,334
Anyone in this
field of study knows, hm,

765
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,303
female mice are problematic...

766
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,806
Right?

767
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:18,846
So you're not studying
female mice

768
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,882
because their
reproductive systems

769
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:22,349
mess with your results?

770
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,550
You catch on quick.

771
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,285
That's pathetic.

772
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:28,089
And the most asinine excuse
for sexism I've ever heard.

773
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,590
No wonder no one's
ever cured Alzheimer's.

774
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,693
The men who have spent
decades trying to do it

775
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,262
have ignored the patients
who need it the most.

776
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:36,998
And what's worst of all
is no one in this room

777
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:40,300
seems interested
in changing any of it.

778
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,303
How can we let this happen
knowing it directly affects us?

779
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,950
Well, thank you all
for your time.

780
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,633
<i>Dr. Binder to 3-West.</i>

781
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:14,768
<i>Dr. Binder to 3-West.</i>
How's he doing?

782
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:17,537
Stable.
Post-op labs look good.

783
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,676
Oh. Hey.

784
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:26,279
Did it work?

785
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:28,850
It did.
Thanks to Dr. Beltran.

786
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,752
Thank you.

787
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,721
I'm gonna be able to go
to pool parties, the beach.

788
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:38,325
You can go with Vivi.

789
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,361
T-That's her name, right?
The girl you like?

790
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,165
Yeah, yeah, she's --
she's okay.

791
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,566
Uh, but now that
I've got this new body,

792
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,602
I should
play the field, right?

793
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,670
No. No.

794
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:53,507
When you find someone
you can't stop thinking about

795
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,043
and they make you feel things
you've never felt before

796
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:58,946
and you have a chance
to be with her,
you should call her.

797
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,848
Do you hear me?

798
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,389
Should I go after her?

799
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,492
Millin!

800
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,494
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
if that was out of line.

801
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:16,164
And I'm sorry that I punctured
that kid's heart.

802
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,798
And I'm sorry that
I didn't strap a patient

803
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,299
onto the O.R. table
properly.

804
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,401
Okay. I -- I'm not sure
about that last one,

805
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,137
but complications happen.

806
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:25,739
You're an intern.
You're gonna make mistakes.

807
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,340
Hell, I still do.

808
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,643
I slept with Adriana because
I'm going through a breakup.

809
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,611
I don't care.

810
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:33,981
I mean, I'm not thrilled,
but you know what?

811
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:36,017
Honestly, the less we talk
about it, the better.

812
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,617
But I am your attending

813
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:40,054
and I do care about
your surgical training.

814
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,923
And today,
when it mattered most,

815
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:44,424
you froze and you
got in your own way.

816
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:47,161
And I know this
because I've been there.

817
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,930
So no matter
how hard it is,

818
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:51,098
you cannot bring your
personal life into the O.R.

819
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,901
In particular, mine.
Okay?

820
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,435
Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,851
Are you ready
for a visitor?

822
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:13,520
We both are.

823
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,621
You want to hold him?

824
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:15,890
Yeah.

825
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,524
Congratulations.

826
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:24,731
Hey, buddy.

827
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:29,237
I'm your dad!

828
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,305
I broke my butt for you!

829
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:36,844
In about five years,
you'll find that hilarious.

830
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,915
I'm so glad we did this.

831
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:46,720
Hey. There's Mom.

832
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:52,059
So once we get the results
of your liver biopsy back,

833
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:56,230
we will work to ensure you have
the best treatment plan.

834
00:34:56,264 --> 00:35:00,234
But your surgery
went beautifully.

835
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:01,903
I'm bored.

836
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,437
What did I tell you
about using that word?

837
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:08,109
You don't want to hear it.
Are we going home?

838
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,810
Your mom needs
a little more rest.

839
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,379
She can go home soon.

840
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,445
Can we sleep over?

841
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,948
Is that okay?

842
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,548
Um, if you want.

843
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:17,784
But you have to let your mom
get some rest.

844
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,287
Can you do that?
We promise.

845
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,754
-Alright.
-We'll send up some games

846
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,622
from the peds floor.

847
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,025
Thanks.

848
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,396
Well done.

849
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,298
You made me look good.

850
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,268
Dr. Bailey,
thank you.

851
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:37,138
Hm.

852
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,710
So?
How did surgery go?

853
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:46,113
Oh. It was okay.
It was...

854
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:51,352
I can't lie. It was the coolest
30 minutes of my...life.

855
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:54,454
You deserve it.

856
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:55,755
Jules and I are
gonna get a drink.

857
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,391
Do you want to come?

858
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,758
Uh, uh, n--

859
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,560
I still have to do hand-off
for next shift,

860
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:02,129
but, um, you should go.

861
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:04,265
Okay. See you later.

862
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:06,267
Yeah.

863
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:21,481
How's Shruti?

864
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:22,883
Doing better.

865
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,287
The dads are harder
than the moms.

866
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,827
I don't need a big wedding.

867
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,694
I don't need the band

868
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:37,832
or the slideshow
with photos

869
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,134
or a giant cake.

870
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,801
You're thinking
about cake.

871
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,371
I am.
Yeah.

872
00:36:43,404 --> 00:36:46,040
But the point is...

873
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,009
I just want to
be married to you.

874
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,344
I don't care
about the rest.

875
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:51,912
I do.

876
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,782
I want the wedding.

877
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,953
I thought that
I didn't because, well,

878
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,687
I've already done it before,

879
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,058
but I've never done it
with you.

880
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,692
I want to.

881
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,234
Can't wait to marry you!

882
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:18,671
Truly unimaginable.

883
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:21,275
I think
I insulted Lucas.

884
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,377
He will be fine.

885
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:26,280
You flew solo
in the O.R. today.

886
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,115
You know, I think that
we should stop worrying

887
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:31,318
about relationships and
just focus on our careers,

888
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,489
which is why I have decided
swearing off sex for a while.

889
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:37,091
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

890
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,229
O...kay.

891
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,600
Okay.
That makes sense.

892
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,602
Someone told me that
I need to put my head down

893
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,938
and focus on work.

894
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,406
I'm off the clock.

895
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,175
I'm looking for a mentor.

896
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,177
I'll do your progress notes.
I'll do your rounds.

897
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,711
I will do anything
you want me to.

898
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,451
I'm asking you,
by the way.

899
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:06,921
Alright. Um...

900
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:10,091
Meet me for rounds
at 7:00 a.m.

901
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:11,724
Great.

902
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,963
Do you know who told her
to focus on work? Me.

903
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:17,797
And then she asks <i>you</i>
to be her mentor?

904
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:20,234
Well, I think she's
terrified of you, actually.

905
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:22,169
Well, I can live
with that.

906
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,782
Hey.
I -- I'm sorry.

907
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:38,586
I-I realized today
I'm not coming off

908
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,554
as supportive --
And I am.

909
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,891
I'm behind you 100% with
whatever treatment you choose.

910
00:38:43,924 --> 00:38:47,461
And I think I'm just...

911
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,629
Well, I --

912
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,165
I'm scared.

913
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:56,337
I'm sorry, too.

914
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,610
Hey.

915
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,678
What's he doing here?

916
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:10,317
<i>Beneath the</i>
<i>white coats and fancy titles,</i>

917
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,785
<i>medicine is just</i>
<i>humans treating humans.</i>

918
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:18,959
I don't want us
to feel stuck.

919
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,961
And I think I didn't
want to admit it

920
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:23,297
because I had this idea
of what our lives should be,

921
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,367
and everything that therapist
said seems opposite to that,

922
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,469
which is...
Kind of terrifying.

923
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:29,803
Yeah.

924
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,076
Maybe it doesn't
have to be.

925
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:43,217
I'm willing to try
something new if you are.

926
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:47,821
Sometimes it just takes me
a minute to get there.

927
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:49,356
And...

928
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,960
It's a little weird
picturing you

929
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:54,461
flirting with
somebody else.

930
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:56,630
I am a <i>terrible</i> flirt.

931
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:57,865
You are.

932
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,308
Okay.

933
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,510
If we actually open this...

934
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,645
I don't want to
know any details.

935
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,713
Agreed.

936
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,483
And we check in
regularly.

937
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,455
And...

938
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:22,823
we stay safe.

939
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:25,792
And our marriage
comes first.

940
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:29,363
No serious relationships
or feelings.

941
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:31,131
Of course.

942
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:38,038
Are we really doing this?

943
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,150
<i>The most brilliant surgeons</i>

944
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,719
<i>have made</i>
<i>questionable choices.</i>

945
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,990
<i>No one gets it right</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

946
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:59,493
<i>So, as a doctor,</i>
<i>what do you do?</i>

947
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:02,196
<i>There's only one choice --</i>

948
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,796
<i>find your team...</i>

949
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:06,433
<i>work shoulder to shoulder...</i>

950
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,235
<i>let them help you</i>
<i>when you falter.</i>

951
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,304
Tom Koracick
won the grant.

952
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,145
Can't stop seeing
his smug face.

953
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:23,984
Who knew science was such
a male-dominated world,

954
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:25,085
even with rodents?

955
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,254
Ellis Grey knew.

956
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,423
She told me about it
her whole life.

957
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:32,126
Now I can't stop seeing
<i>her</i> gloating face.

958
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:36,063
What if Amelia and I did
Koracick's experiment

959
00:41:36,096 --> 00:41:37,431
with female mice?

960
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:40,567
Mm. Okay.

961
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,569
Who will fund it?
I will.

962
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,805
I mean, I know we just
bought this house,

963
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,940
but I have some savings.

964
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:49,376
And I said this is
personal, and it is.

965
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,911
Mm-hmm.

966
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,082
What do you think?

967
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:57,685
Honestly, I think --
I think it's a great idea.

968
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,121
How do I become
an investor?

969
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,756
Well, I can't let you
do that

970
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,525
because we don't know
if it'll work.

971
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:08,095
Look, if I'm gonna
bet on anybody...

972
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:09,697
it's you.

973
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,600
<i>Let them push you</i>
<i>to make you better.</i>
