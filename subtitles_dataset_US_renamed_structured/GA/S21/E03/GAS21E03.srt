1
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:06,863
<i>In 2023, a team of</i>
scientists studying hepatitis C

2
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,531
made a fascinating discovery...
Complications include

3
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:10,867
blood clots, bleeding,
leaking from or blockage of

4
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:12,768
the ureter tract and...

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,304
Still studying for
the kidney transplant.

6
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:18,041
I want to be ready.
You've been studying
all night.

7
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,675
You're probably
over prepped.

8
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,978
No such thing.
Going in early again?

9
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:24,480
This doesn't have anything to do
with that mystery woman

10
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:25,949
who stayed in your bed
and followed you

11
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,483
around the hospital,
does it?

12
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:29,552
Nope. Just trying
to stay ahead.

13
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:35,391
Whoever's ready
can ride it with me.

14
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:36,725
I'll come.
We'll catch up.

15
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:44,167
<i>They found that the virus</i>
<i>creates a "cellular mask"</i>

16
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:47,469
<i>to hide from our immune system</i>
<i>in plain sight.</i>

17
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:48,972
When you said
you wanted to...

18
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,673
do something
with just the two of us...

19
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,143
I, um, I was expecting
something else.

20
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:54,743
Like what?

21
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:57,646
We've gone four blocks.
I know, I just -- I...

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,648
I need oxygen.
I need...

23
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,026
Yeah, that.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,761
Yeah, I needed that.
Shall we keep going?

25
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:16,398
<i>Camouflaged in molecules</i>
<i>already known to our bodies,</i>

26
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:19,202
<i>the virus copies itself</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

27
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:21,403
Uh, you're not hitting
the gym this morning?

28
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:22,771
I thought I'd help you
out of the clinic

29
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:23,907
before my interview
with Heron.

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,608
Oh, I, um...

31
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,178
I've got some business
at the hospital this morning.

32
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,846
Hey, wanna meet for lunch?

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,747
It's taco day
at the cafeteria.

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,416
I don't feel like tacos.

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,585
You love tacos.
Too damn busy for tacos.

36
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,923
<i>It sneaks in like a Trojan</i>
<i>horse past our immune system.</i>

37
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:42,025
<i>And by the time the body</i>
<i>realizes what's happened,</i>

38
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,094
<i>the infection</i>
<i>has already taken hold.</i>

39
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,428
Why don't you just ask him?
Because
Webber doesn't want to

40
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:47,964
assist on
a kidney transplant.

41
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,199
He doesn't want to assist
on anything.

42
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,566
But you said
it'll be interesting.

43
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,035
For the interns.
Not for Webber.

44
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,371
What's this actually about?
Hmm?

45
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,805
I just thought
it would be nice

46
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,773
if the two of you
worked together.

47
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:59,541
Mer, come on. What's up?

48
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:02,279
I'm doing a liver biopsy
on Catherine today.

49
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:04,480
Her cancer may have spread.

50
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,283
And, uh...

51
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:07,583
he doesn't know,
does he?

52
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:08,651
I tried to
get her to tell him.

53
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,020
She doesn't want to.

54
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,992
I can't believe
you're doing this.

55
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:20,130
Breaking HIPAA?
No, making me
an accomplice.

56
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,531
Oh, what could go wrong?
What could go wrong?

57
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:26,870
I love you.

58
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,576
You know, some people
think you'll go to hell

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,778
if you swipe left
on a chaplain.

60
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, I, um...Hey.

61
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,683
I -- I'm sorry.
I was kidding.

62
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,519
I was just trying to get
to the -- the news on there,

63
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,922
and then my finger accidentally
opened up that app, so...

64
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,357
- Morning.
- Oops.

65
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,326
Thanks, Jacob.

66
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,795
Someone's a little hungry.
Oh, I like to
have extra treats

67
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,696
to hand out to the nurses.
That's really kind.

68
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,365
Yeah, well,
don't want to go to hell.

69
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:57,167
Again, kidding.

70
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:00,804
- Okay.
- ...in the morning,

71
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:04,207
so then I switched that
to Saturday at 2:00 p.m.,

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,209
and there was something else.

73
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:09,346
Oh, I, uh, I scheduled
our OB appointment

74
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,314
at Seattle Presbyterian.
Sure.

75
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,682
Why take
an elevator upstairs

76
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,352
when you can cross town
in traffic?

77
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,187
The minute people here
find out that I'm pregnant,

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,823
they'll treat me differently.
Like letting you sit down?

79
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:24,560
Giving you time to sleep?
No, like...not giving me
the good cases

80
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,896
or thinking I'm
not committed to the job.

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,898
It's your call...
Okay.

82
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:31,500
...but if I had a vagina, I'd
want Carina DeLuca all over it.

83
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,671
Came out way worse
than it sounded in my --
Yeah.

84
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:36,840
Yeah.

85
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,811
Hi. Oh. I'm sorry.

86
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,712
This is the best
that I could do.

87
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:46,316
But, hey, look,
you got a new microscope.

88
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,818
I've been using it
to look for the bright side,

89
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:50,820
but so far no luck.

90
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:54,024
Well, I have put your name
on a wait list for another lab.

91
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,192
I don't know what
I'll be doing there anyway.

92
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:57,861
Meredith hasn't exactly
filled me in

93
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,496
on the next steps
for our research.

94
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:02,198
I have an idea
to keep you busy today.

95
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:05,168
A hemangioblastoma
on the thoracic spine.

96
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,535
I can see that.

97
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:07,871
The patient's upstairs.

98
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,671
If you want her case,
it's yours.

99
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:11,341
Were you hoping
that I wouldn't notice

100
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,942
she's 20 weeks pregnant?

101
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,844
I mean, she needs to
terminate that pregnancy

102
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,213
before I can operate
on that tumor.
She wants to keep it,

103
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,216
and four other neurosurgeons
have turned her down.

104
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,418
Will you
just meet with her?

105
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:25,221
Uh...
Unless you're too busy?

106
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,724
Yeah, right.

107
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,795
Dr. Heron? I'm Ben Warren.
Oh, Dr. Warren --

108
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:34,730
the firefighting
anesthesiologist, yes?
I guess.

109
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,599
Uh, I know I'm a couple minutes
early for my interview...

110
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,236
Yeah, you're four <i>hours</i> early,
and I have two lap choles,

111
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,439
so I know that
your Dr. Bailey's husband,

112
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:45,442
but I -- No, I cannot shuffle
my schedule around for you.

113
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,643
I say no-no to nepo, right?
I --

114
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:50,914
So 1:00, coffee cart. Yeah?
Okay. See you there.

115
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:54,616
Good morning! Who is ready
to see what today holds?

116
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,453
That's why we're waiting here.

117
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,454
Oh, great! Okay.

118
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,055
Oh. Kwan.

119
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,257
I'm afraid I have
some traumatic news.

120
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,060
You are with Hunt
in the ER.

121
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,964
Get it? Trauma?

122
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:10,066
I-I'm just happy
for the work.

123
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,470
Oh, and, Millin, any guesses
where "I'll see you"?

124
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,938
Please don't.
That's right, the ICU.

125
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,772
Okay, okay.

126
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,341
Griffith,
you're with Webber,

127
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,577
and Adams is on Marsh's
kidney transplant.

128
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:23,379
Oh, I think I'm with Marsh.
Actually, Dr. Marsh
requested Adams.

129
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,150
And, Yasuda,
you're with Shepherd.

130
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,486
Unless you want to
keep playing telephone.

131
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,752
Shepherd? Got it.

132
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,688
Then let's get out there
and...?

133
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,190
Heal with love.

134
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:35,358
Yes!

135
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:37,927
You okay?

136
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,996
Yeah. I'm fine.

137
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,336
Can you pass me my tablet?

138
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,605
I need to watch
the weather report.

139
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,607
Donna Mae, you know
you can't go outside.

140
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,043
I know, but I just
want to see Victor Suarez.

141
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:57,013
He's so handsome,
and he's always accurate.

142
00:05:57,046 --> 00:06:00,483
If he says it's gonna rain,
it rains.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

143
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:03,386
I had to stop at the peds floor
for your pudding.

144
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,654
You are forgiven.
Donna Mae Clarkson, 82.

145
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,892
Status post-CABG
two months ago. History of TIA.

146
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,794
Congestive heart failure
with EF of 25%.

147
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,396
On levophed, an insulin drip,

148
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,832
dialysis three
times a week, and you...

149
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,034
don't have
an advanced directive.

150
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,403
No, dear, but thank you.

151
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:22,238
If you can't make your
own medical decisions

152
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:24,240
with no advanced directive,
we'd have to assume

153
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,242
that if you got sicker
than you already are,

154
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:28,744
you'd want us to use all
available life-saving measures.

155
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:32,048
It could be very uncomfortable.
I understand,

156
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,485
but if it means staying alive,
I choose quantity over quality.

157
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:38,221
Now, pass me that tablet
and the puddings.

158
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,156
Here.

159
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,196
Meredith,
what brings you here?

160
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,832
A patient consultation.

161
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,569
Oh, well, I was hoping
you were here to see Catherine.

162
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,871
She hasn't been acting
like herself lately.

163
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,440
She won't say it, but I think
your rift is eating away at her.

164
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,843
I don't know what to say.
Oh, I know there are
bad feelings,

165
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,879
but if you could reach
out to her, I'd be grateful.

166
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,583
I think about it.

167
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:16,259
Nice of you to show up.

168
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,694
Nice of <i>you</i>
to tell your husband.

169
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,295
You know --
Uh, both of you play nice.

170
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,730
The only enemy in here today
is cancer.

171
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:40,550
BP is 110 over 60.
Okay.

172
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,919
Do you have any tingling
or numbness in your legs?

173
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,488
No numbness.
They just get we.

174
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,724
Ms. Fletcher,
this is Dr. Shepherd.

175
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:49,758
She is chief
of our neurosurgery,

176
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,661
and she's looked over
your scans.
Rhiannon.

177
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,596
This is my brother Julian
and his husband, Carl.

178
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,932
They...
have a vested interest.

179
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:59,569
This is their baby.
I'm their surrogate.

180
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:01,337
We have a vested interest
because you're my sister.

181
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,172
He's lovable,
but annoyingly smothering.

182
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,241
So you can just ignore him.

183
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,643
Please say you're here to tell
me you can do the surgery

184
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,444
without affecting the baby.

185
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,182
Rhiannon, your pregnancy
hormones have caused

186
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,783
the tumor
to grow more rapidly.

187
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,919
Removing it would
already be a challenge,

188
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,290
but pregnant at 20 weeks, the
risk is exponentially higher.

189
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:21,991
Access to the tumor
is limited,

190
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,994
and there's a higher risk
of bleeding and clots.

191
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,596
What about waiting a few weeks

192
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:27,797
until my OB can deliver
the baby safely?

193
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,367
It's possible,
but it's not guaranteed.

194
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,802
If you don't
remove the tumor now,

195
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,838
the pressure on your spinal cord
could paralyze you

196
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,541
or the tumor could rupture,
causing catastrophic bleeding.

197
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,710
Your best option
is to terminate.

198
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,945
No.
Rhi, we said
we could adopt.

199
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,380
You and I are adopted.

200
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,482
I want to do this.
I'll do anything.

201
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,252
I'll sign a waiver.
No, you won't.

202
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,955
End of discussion.

203
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:56,559
Three different egg donors,
six retrievals,

204
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,828
eight transfers
between different surrogates

205
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,064
and the last embryo,
the one that worked for you,

206
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,900
is this one.

207
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:07,170
So before immediately deciding
what my "best" option would be,

208
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:08,338
take another look.

209
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,481
Let's get some more scans.

210
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:21,150
No promises,
but I will take another look.

211
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:22,820
Thank you.
Alright.

212
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,858
Dr. Hunt.
Hmm?

213
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,593
I am on your service
and ready for anything.

214
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,830
GSWs, 20-car pileups.
Whatever you need.

215
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:36,032
Just keep me busy and elbows
deep and whatever you got.

216
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,367
Music to my ears.

217
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,935
Ronald Meinero,
this is Dr. Kwan.

218
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:41,003
Ronald broke two ribs
this morning.
Were you attacked?

219
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,939
Yeah, by my own ass
and gravity.

220
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:44,674
I'm recovering
from hemorrhoid surgery.

221
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,542
Slipped gettin'
out of the sitz bath.

222
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,678
Ronald needs incentive
spirometer exercises,

223
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:50,848
10 times every hour,
okay?

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,316
Watch him,
and let me know the results.

225
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:57,620
Hey, boss.

226
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,456
Hello, Marsh.
You're here with Meredith?

227
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,092
No, I'm here to do
a kidney transplant.

228
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,094
I thought you might
want to assist.

229
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,063
Well, I think I'll pass.

230
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:09,565
But maybe one of our interns
might get a kick out of it.

231
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,467
Well, listen,
there's actually

232
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,202
a groundbreaking angle
to this one.

233
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:15,605
Yeah, it's only been done
one time before in the US.

234
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:17,273
Come on. I'll walk you
through the case.

235
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,876
See if you
change your mind.

236
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,443
I'm all ears.
Let's go.

237
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:23,079
What is taking so long?

238
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:27,650
Uh, we don't exactly do a lot
of liver biopsies in the clinic.

239
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:31,621
Oh, well...thank you
for protecting my privacy.

240
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:33,791
Richard is distracted
for at least an hour.

241
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:36,492
I had Nick invite him
onto his kidney transplant.

242
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,094
He knows to text me
when they're done.

243
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,662
God...
You told Marsh?

244
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:41,597
Do you want to risk
Richard walking in here?

245
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,102
A lied about tacos.

246
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,671
I don't know what that means,
but gallbladder looks good.

247
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:50,673
No fluid around the liver.

248
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,776
There's a lesion here
on the periphery.
Mm-hmm.

249
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,213
Looks like a good target
for the biopsy.

250
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,853
Okay, now, Catherine,
before we drape and prep you,

251
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:04,954
you sure you don't want
to reconsider telling Richard?

252
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:07,623
I think I want to reconsider
my surgical team.

253
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,692
It's a biopsy, ladies.

254
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:11,862
I tell Richard when
there's something to tell.

255
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,931
Will y'all just get
the damn thing started?

256
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:15,398
Come on.

257
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,870
He requested me.
I know.

258
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:25,141
What'd you want me to do? Say,
"No, my girlfriend wants that"?

259
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:28,311
You know I stayed up half the
night studying for that surgery.

260
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,982
Maybe you shouldn't have.

261
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:34,784
Says the Shepherd.

262
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:37,888
What?
I need to finish up
Webber's notes.

263
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,456
If it were you, you would
have taken it in a heartbeat.

264
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,358
Griffith, change of plans.

265
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,494
You and I are scrubbing in on
a transplant with Dr. Marsh.

266
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,195
Meet me in OR 1.

267
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:47,296
Chop, chop.

268
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:58,741
Is there
another surgical option?

269
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:01,912
I don't see one.
Is that her diaphragm?

270
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:04,848
Yeah. The pregnancy shifted
her internal organs up.

271
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:07,750
Makes the tumor harder
to access.

272
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,386
What if you embolize
the feeders to the tumor

273
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,221
to stop it from growing?

274
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,389
It's too late.

275
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,057
Even though it's benign,

276
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,260
the tumor is big enough
to be a risk.

277
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,228
There's no good alternative.

278
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:21,030
Well, anyone who's gone to
four different surgeons

279
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:22,900
isn't looking for
a second opinion.

280
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,935
If we say no, she's just gonna
try to go to someone else.

281
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,575
Tom. Big day.
How are you feeling?

282
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,244
Mm
anxious.

283
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,447
I'm much happier serving
the OR table than being on it.

284
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,616
I'm a scrub nurse
at Hope General.

285
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,852
Are you not gonna intubate
him first?

286
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,787
No. Not today.
Uh, let me present --

287
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,423
Tom Costello, 33,
here for a kidney transplant

288
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,724
without
general anesthesia.

289
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,260
An awake surgery?
It was in the pre-op file.

290
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,762
Under "Awake Surgery."

291
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,398
He's been given a mild sedative
and a spinal anesthesia.

292
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,667
Okay, so what are the benefits
of an awake surgery?

293
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,706
Uh...
Forgoing
traditional anesthesia

294
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,741
can expedite recovery
as well as reduce

295
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,310
one's hospital stay,
which ultimately could

296
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,445
save the healthcare system
billions.
Nice, Griffith.

297
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:12,281
<i>And</i> I can keep an eye
on my surgical team.

298
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,116
Is he prepared?

299
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,719
Um, Dr. Adams
is -- is new to the case,

300
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,087
but I assure you,
he's a quick study.

301
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,890
Mm.
Okay. You ready?

302
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,925
Uh, how many Raytecs
have you opened up?

303
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,726
10.
Uh, go ahead.

304
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,996
Okay. 10-blade.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

305
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,731
Are you sure everything
has been sterilized well enough?

306
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,467
We got you. You can relax.

307
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,904
Alright, here we go.
10-blade.

308
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,941
Thank you.

309
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:49,285
Still no advance directive?
Nope.

310
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:51,187
And the more I go in there,

311
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,757
I feel like a restaurant host
just trying to free up a table.

312
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,660
I don't want her thinking we're
trying to push a DNR on her.

313
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,295
Well, we're not.

314
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,797
You just need to
make sure

315
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,632
she clearly understands
what she's facing.

316
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,368
Did you explain that life-saving
measures can be invasive?

317
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:09,271
I use the word "violent."
That's an understatement.

318
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,808
Well, no matter
how old you are,

319
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,877
no one likes to think about
their own death.

320
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,145
So...give her a minute.

321
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:17,513
Some patients just take
a little longer

322
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,181
to listen to their doctors.

323
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:22,385
I wonder if she
would listen to someone <i>else.</i>

324
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:29,960
Knock, knock.

325
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,727
I don't know
why I said "knock, knock"

326
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,864
as opposed to
just knocking.

327
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,731
That's okay.

328
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,367
It's a great office.

329
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:39,568
Uh, it's the chapel.

330
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,038
Right.

331
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,574
It's got good light.
Windows will do that, so...

332
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:49,378
Uh, we're here, um,
about a patient.

333
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,881
It's an elderly woman.

334
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,748
She has multiple comorbidities,

335
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,351
and she's refusing
to sign a DNR.

336
00:14:57,753 --> 00:15:00,023
Okay, she has had
multiple surgical

337
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,159
and medical interventions,

338
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:06,063
and another intervention would
probably do more harm than good.

339
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:10,167
So you're asking me to talk
her into signing the DNR?

340
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,104
I...no. No.
Absolutely not. Um...

341
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,943
But chest compressions
on an octogenarian

342
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:23,312
with bones like toothpicks...
it could kill her.

343
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,951
At the very least,
uh, her ribs would snap

344
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,552
and one could puncture lung,
and then we would

345
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:31,021
have to intubate her.
Yeah, really,

346
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,289
this is not what I do.

347
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:36,793
Um, my comfort zone is
a little more,

348
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:38,895
you know, "Am I gonna
see my dog when I die?"

349
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,066
I -- I think
that she's struggling

350
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,369
with her own mortality,
and I thought that

351
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,840
you might be able to help
her understand her options.

352
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,411
- Dr. Hunt?
- Yeah?

353
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,880
I just finished
another session

354
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:58,447
of spirometer exercises
with Ronald

355
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,282
and discharged bed 2.
Great.

356
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:03,652
If you need me anywhere else,
I can handle multiple cases.

357
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:05,621
Well, we have
a scalp lac in bed 1.

358
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,757
Yeah, I'll take a look.
Um...

359
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,962
I am interested in exploring
trauma as a specialty,

360
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:15,331
and I would love to work
on...bigger traumas.

361
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:16,833
Ah.

362
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,567
Kwan, traumas are traumas.

363
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,170
It doesn't matter
if they're caused by gunshots

364
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,738
or wildfires
or falls in the bathtub.

365
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:25,175
Ronald babysits
his granddaughter every Tuesday,

366
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,777
and he is a ping pong legend
in Washington state

367
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,980
and he wants to get back
to both of those things
as soon as possible.

368
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:33,250
Carla, in bed 1, she
split her head open
sliding in to home plate,

369
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:36,485
but she's excited to play in
the state semifinals next week.

370
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,687
They're all counting on you
to help them.

371
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,489
But if they're
not exciting enough for you,

372
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,025
then...
I'll go check on them.

373
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,928
I think that's a good idea.

374
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,463
No one can accuse you
of having a dull career.

375
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,800
Well, I've tried to
follow my heart.
Aww. Isn't that sweet?

376
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,170
You know, I'm more of
a "dance with the one
that brung ya" kind of gal.

377
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,670
You know,
jack of all trades is great

378
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:57,140
if you want a job
at TaskRabbit,

379
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,975
but -- but for a surgeon?

380
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,544
I think you'll find
that I'm a very good surgeon.

381
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,345
Oh. Okay.

382
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,348
"Enthusiastically
recommends...himself."

383
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,684
In addition to my four years
as a general surgery resident,

384
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:12,122
I was a firefighter for five and
an anesthesiologist for seven.
Mm-hmm.

385
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,623
When I set my mind
to something, I master it.
Right.

386
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:17,127
But what happens when the next
shiny object comes along?
I --

387
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,328
You gonna leave me
high and dry?
No. I wo--

388
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,865
Surgery, it's a calling.

389
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:26,002
It requires patience,
commitment, stick-to-itiveness.

390
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,038
If I may be frank, I...

391
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,638
I'm not sure you have
what it takes.

392
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,477
You want commitment?

393
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,379
I've carried people
down 10 flights of stairs

394
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,648
wearing
75 pounds of gear.

395
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:40,851
You want patience?

396
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,351
I convinced a hopeless teen

397
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:43,987
to step away from the ledge.

398
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,487
Stick-to-itiveness?

399
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,891
I've been happily married
for 12 years,

400
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,827
and I have three children that
I love more than any career.

401
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,762
So if you don't want to bring
me back, I'll be fine.

402
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:55,332
Thank you for your time.

403
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,008
You're saying
you can do it?

404
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,508
I'm saying I'll try.

405
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,544
Because I think you are someone

406
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:10,579
who doesn't like
to hear no for an answer.

407
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,082
And so am I.

408
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:13,950
I told you.
You wanted to give up.

409
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:16,119
I told you it was possible.
Now, I didn't say <i>that.</i>

410
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:18,121
I don't know if it is.

411
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:20,223
This surgery will increase
the risk to yourself.

412
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,724
And we don't know
that we can save the pregnancy.

413
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:24,127
If there are
any complications,

414
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,129
I <i>will</i> put
your life and health first.

415
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,797
I still don't feel good
about this.

416
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,099
I don't either.

417
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:31,234
I <i>want</i> to do this.

418
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:34,371
Okay. Dr. Yasuda will admit
and prep you,

419
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,273
and we will see you
in the OR.

420
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:41,912
Okay, Catherine, I'm going in,
so you may feel some pressure.

421
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:44,281
I'm good under pressure.

422
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,714
And you better be, too.

423
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:54,257
Good hemostasis.

424
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,326
Put a rush on that,
and, uh, be discreet.

425
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,228
Oh! Damn it!

426
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,930
She's hemorrhaging.
Okay.

427
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,563
She's bleeding
from her esophagus.

428
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,565
Let's get her on her side.
Suction!

429
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,001
Hold on, Catherine.

430
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:06,435
Nurse Linda,
let's hang a unit of blood.

431
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,770
I'm gonna get
the intubation tray.

432
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:09,306
You're gonna set up
an EGD

433
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:11,007
and let the IR suite know
we are on our way.

434
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,310
On it.
Alright.
We need to put in a shunt.

435
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:15,011
Okay.

436
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:16,612
This is more than a biopsy.

437
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,148
And what are you saying?

438
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,515
I'm saying that even
if we stop the bleeding,

439
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:21,284
she could go into
liver failure.

440
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:22,852
She might never wake up
from this.

441
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,586
Richard needs to know.

442
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,789
Okay.

443
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:30,927
Okay.

444
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,802
Okay, it's in.

445
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,137
Adams.
Let's see what you got.

446
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:44,007
Uh, can we pause for
a needle and sponge count?

447
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,708
Okay, we already did one.

448
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,143
We'll do another one
before we're close.

449
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:48,610
Okay.
Can't be too careful.

450
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,447
Last month,
a patient went septic

451
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:53,149
after the surgeons left
a lap pad in her abdomen.

452
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,952
Okay. Bokhee,
can you count, please?

453
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,655
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine --

454
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:00,789
10. We're good.

455
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,725
Great.

456
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,961
Oh, shoot.
Griffith, can you --

457
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,031
Check the phone
while Adams sutures? Sure.
Yeah.

458
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:14,170
It's Dr. Grey
paging Dr. Webber.

459
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,206
Well, she doesn't know
I got pulled into a surgery.

460
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,174
I'll check in with her later.

461
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,977
It says 911.

462
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,812
You should go.

463
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,148
No, no, no, no,
no one should leave.

464
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:26,416
Now, look,
I'm sure it can wait.

465
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,917
How many cc's of blood
have I lost?

466
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:30,186
Richard, you need to go.
It's your wife.

467
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,553
Meredith is doing
a procedure on her.

468
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:32,721
You need to go.

469
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:37,760
- Where is she?
- IR suite.

470
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:49,772
Make sure to stay upright.
Very good. Good job.

471
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,374
What have we got?

472
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:52,775
I'd be better at this
if I played the tuba

473
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,512
instead of ping pong.
Let's get him inside. Let's go.

474
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,414
Okay. Car flipped over
the median, GCS 7.

475
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:59,748
He was intubated in the field.
Vitals are unstable.

476
00:20:59,782 --> 00:21:01,951
We might have to take
him directly up to the OR.

477
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:06,688
Kwan. Trauma one.
Okay. Keep going, Ronald.
I'll be right back.

478
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,359
Dr. Yasuda.
Orderlies are on their way

479
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,194
to bring your sister
to the OR.

480
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,430
Thanks, but that's
not what I...

481
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,764
Do you have siblings?
Yeah, I have eight.

482
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,101
I just have Rhi.

483
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:20,537
When Carl and I first started
looking for a surrogate,

484
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,704
she insisted that
no one would take better care

485
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,407
of the baby
than Auntie Rhi.

486
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,876
I said no, but after
all the failed attempts,

487
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,710
she offered again

488
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,814
and she was so determined
that I didn't fight it.

489
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,648
Then they found the tumor.

490
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:36,052
Am I gonna regret
not fighting it now?

491
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,088
I don't really know,
but, um...

492
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,323
Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Altman
are both excellent.

493
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:42,092
Aren't <i>you</i> a doctor?

494
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,660
You must have an opinion.

495
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:47,997
I...I wish I could tell you
it'll be fine,

496
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,665
but I just, I don't know.

497
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,267
I'm sorry.

498
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:05,148
We have 500 cc's of
blood in the NG canister.

499
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:07,083
Advancing the guidewire

500
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,519
I'm in
the right hepatic vein.

501
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,121
Aim anteriorly.

502
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:13,123
What happened?

503
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,824
We were doing
a liver biopsy.

504
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:18,294
She started bleeding.
So you do a TIPS procedure?

505
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,363
I'm about to
put in the shunt.

506
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,865
- Is she in liver failure?
- Not yet.

507
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,500
We're trying
to prevent that.

508
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,834
She wanted to get
the results of the biopsy

509
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:26,336
before she told you.

510
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,989
Take care of her.

511
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:49,893
I'll be waiting outside.

512
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:00,036
Okay, Tom,
we're almost done here.

513
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:04,040
Uh, can we do
a final count?

514
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:06,276
Yep. You got it.
Go ahead, Bokhee.

515
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,513
I don't hear counting.
It's 'cause
it's in our heads.

516
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,748
Are you <i>sure</i>
that the kidney is pink?

517
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,884
Tom, how many kidney transplants
have you done?

518
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:17,854
None! But I have seen so m--
Well, I've done more than 600,

519
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,023
and I've had one done myself,
so I get it's unnerving

520
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:23,226
being on the table,
but everything is under control.

521
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,761
Okay? We got you.
Okay.

522
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,031
Okay. Looks good.

523
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,401
What?

524
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:34,270
We're missing a Raytec.

525
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:35,771
Let's count one more time.

526
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:37,507
Okay.

527
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,109
Well, my faith
is based on a belief

528
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,378
that God doesn't
abandon me in death,

529
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,613
w-which I personally find
comforting.

530
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,714
Good for <i>you.</i>
O-Of course, you know,

531
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,351
everyone has their own
relationship with death.

532
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:51,020
It's okay and
perfectly natural to fear it.

533
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,689
Not me.

534
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:55,225
I'm not afraid of death
or -- or hell

535
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,427
or coming back as a bird.

536
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,696
Well, we're not encouraging you
to sign the DNR.

537
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,898
We just want to make sure
that you understand

538
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:04,733
what <i>not</i> signing it
would mean for you when --

539
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,437
For the last time,
I know what it means.

540
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,706
And I know
why I'm not signing it.

541
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:13,276
I refuse to die before
my bastard ex-husband.

542
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,445
I'm gonna outlive that SOB

543
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:17,947
if it's literally
the last thing I do.

544
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:23,620
Uh, it seems like
you could use some closure.

545
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:24,921
Hell, yes!

546
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,755
Closure on his casket

547
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,891
before it clicks shut
so I can dance on it.

548
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:37,066
I did not
see this coming.
Not a chance.

549
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,569
Things they don't teach you
in divinity school.
Well, they don't really

550
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:40,670
teach it in medical school,
either.

551
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:43,940
Oh! Victor Suarez.

552
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,142
Margins look good.

553
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,910
I've got
proximal control.

554
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,245
Yasuda, suction.

555
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,346
I've got distal control.

556
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,083
We've lost neuro signal
to the legs.

557
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,486
We need to get more
blood flow to her spinal cord.

558
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,455
- Bolus her with 500 cc's of LR.
- On it.

559
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,324
Anything?
No, and
we don't have time

560
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:02,592
to wait for it to kick in.

561
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,827
Start her on pressors.

562
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:07,597
Late decels. The pressors
are decreasing blood
flow to the baby.

563
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,799
Still no signal.
Go up on the pressors.

564
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:12,168
Give the fluids
a chance to work.
Mom's life and health first.

565
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,936
I know it may take
a few seconds.

566
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,805
Rhiannon's spinal cord
may not have a few seconds.

567
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:17,440
Doctors...
Hold off. If you don't stop,
the baby will die.

568
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,309
Go up on the pressors. I am
the primary surgeon on th--

569
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:21,444
Just stop!

570
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:22,879
This is a human being
on the table.

571
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,614
She is someone's daughter,
someone's sister.

572
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,516
She's counting on us
to save her

573
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,785
and ideally the baby,
to stop arguing

574
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,453
like she's some kind of
science experiment!

575
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,288
Just figure out what you do
and do it!

576
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,829
We've got blood flow
to the spinal cord.

577
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:42,699
Decels stopped.
Sinus rhythm's back to normal.

578
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,634
Thank God.

579
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:48,806
But, Yasuda...
Yep. I'll see myself out.

580
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:04,921
Do you see it?
No, I don't see it.

581
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,322
It doesn't mean
it's not still in him.
Are you whispering?

582
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,590
No. Sorry, Tom.

583
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,827
It's just a bit of a frog
in my throat.

584
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,394
Search
everywhere. Search the
field, search the floor.

585
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:12,261
We cannot close
until we find it.

586
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:14,197
Back table.

587
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:23,172
Sir? You okay?
I'm really not.

588
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,508
I am trying to trust you,
but I know the sounds

589
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,776
of the instruments
when they hit the tray.

590
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,244
I listen for them
so I can count.

591
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:29,879
Yeah.

592
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:31,881
Easy. That was a hemostat.
But the sponges --

593
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,883
the sponges
don't make any sounds.

594
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,085
You're doing great. We're
almost there. Hang in there.

595
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,887
That's septic patient that
I was telling you about.
Mm-hmm?

596
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,456
I was the one
who miscounted the lap pads.

597
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,892
And I am always <i>so</i> careful.

598
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:45,061
So if it could happen to me...
It -- It happens.

599
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:48,898
Nobody's perfect.
Deep breaths. Okay?

600
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,267
Why are you staring at me?
I'm not. Dr. Marsh.

601
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,735
What?
Find the damn thing.

602
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,772
Dr. Marsh. It's --
It's stuck to your shoe.

603
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,580
Thank you. Okay.

604
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:06,916
The, uh, the anastomosis
is complete.

605
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,118
We have 10 Raytecs accounted
for. We're ready to close.

606
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:11,988
Dr. Griffith, why don't you
take the lead?
Absolutely.

607
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,089
Are you sure you
don't want to do it yourself?

608
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,424
Tom.
Sorry.

609
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:15,758
Reese and I met

610
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:17,960
working in his father's
furniture store.

611
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:21,264
On slow days, we'd sit
on the showroom couches,

612
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,765
laughing and talking.

613
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,934
Oh, that sounds nice.
Oh, it was.

614
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:28,104
Then we got married,
and everything went to hell.

615
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:32,175
Our first fight was during the
wedding, and it never stopped.

616
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,144
The only good thing that
came out of that relationship

617
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:36,779
was my sleeper sofa.

618
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:39,482
Mrs. Clarkson,
we have some news.

619
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,117
We found your ex-husband.

620
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,753
Is he living
with that rat Sheila?

621
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,923
He was living at

622
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,024
the Oceanfront
Assisted Living Facility.

623
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:51,494
Oh.
But a couple of months ago,
he passed away.

624
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:55,731
Donna Mae,
how are you feeling?

625
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:04,974
Oh!

626
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,986
I know it sounds crazy,

627
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:21,023
but I'm gonna miss
that...horse's ass.

628
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,901
I'll sign that DNR now.

629
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,843
How are you holding up?

630
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:41,077
Bailey send you?

631
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:46,048
Uh, yeah.

632
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,590
You know,
at the fire academy,

633
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,059
there was a, uh,
a "burn building"

634
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,862
where they would simulate
structure fires.

635
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:01,397
It's, uh, it's our first time
dealing with the heat,

636
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,399
Smoke, the gear.

637
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:06,702
It's intense.
Pretty scary.

638
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,704
And it wasn't even
the real thing.

639
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:12,341
But the scariest part
wasn't the fire.

640
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,745
It was...It was not
being able to see my team

641
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:18,949
through the smoke and chaos,
and somehow...

642
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:24,220
...there was nothing
more terrifying than...

643
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,122
just that...

644
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:28,457
that feeling
of being alone.

645
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:34,063
Is there a point
to this story?

646
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,197
Not really.

647
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,776
Did the biopsy
go smoothly?

648
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:52,415
Um, if by smoothly
you mean

649
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:56,652
having to convert to an EGD
and TIPS procedure,

650
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:59,890
then, yes,
it went very smoothly.

651
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,928
Did you hear
from pathology yet?

652
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:06,930
Not yet.

653
00:30:06,964 --> 00:30:10,266
But for now, you're alive.

654
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,670
And also your...husband is
outside waiting to see you.

655
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:16,238
You told him?

656
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:20,476
It...became more than
<i>just</i> a biopsy.

657
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,111
I understand.

658
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,617
Thank you.

659
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,453
I'm sorry, what?

660
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,321
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

661
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:36,893
I know I've been stubborn
and very difficult, and...

662
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,932
But you are a big part of
what makes this hospital great,

663
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,467
and you -- you
should always be here.

664
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:48,638
Is that you give me my job back?

665
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,473
Don't make me
say it twice.

666
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:55,979
Oh!

667
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,179
Ohh.

668
00:30:57,213 --> 00:30:59,116
Oh, I'm sorry.

669
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,952
Oh, yes. Okay.

670
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:08,892
So she's gonna be okay?

671
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:10,192
She had some blood loss,

672
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,461
but I was able to
remove the tumor,

673
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,799
and she and the baby
are both okay.

674
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,301
Oh, my God, she was right.
She said you could do it.

675
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,637
And she was right.
Thank you.

676
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,007
I can't tell you how
much this means to all of us.

677
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,509
Well, we'll check on her
in the morning.

678
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:32,581
I'm sorry if I seemed
mistrustful earlier, I just...

679
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,417
I'm her older brother.

680
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,888
I've always watched out for her,
and I felt helpless.

681
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,090
I get it.

682
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:41,357
My brother...

683
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:44,795
...he watched out for me,
too.

684
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,553
Meredith, you looked me
in the eye

685
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,422
and you lied.

686
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,096
I'm sorry.

687
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:22,465
It was hard enough to get
her to agree to do the biopsy.

688
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm sure you can relate.

689
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,267
How long have you known?

690
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,903
What does that have
to do with anything?

691
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:31,707
Do you know how many times
I've stood up for you?

692
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,077
How many times
I've defended you, Meredith?

693
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:35,812
I tried to
get <i>her</i> to tell you.

694
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:37,747
And you don't think I would've
been able to handle it?

695
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:42,318
I think she was scared.
That's exactly

696
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,652
why you should have
told me.

697
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,657
Shame on you.

698
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:05,574
Dictate the operative
report,and then check his
H and H before you go.

699
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,276
You got it.
Good work today.

700
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,578
So, are you still thinking
about going into trauma?

701
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,149
Yeah. I like
the variety of patients.

702
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:14,851
Listen, some days are
slower than others,

703
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:17,254
but most days there is
something interesting.

704
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,754
I don't know if I want to be
the guy waiting

705
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,158
around hoping for
a car wreck.

706
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:25,361
A man was in a medically
induced coma from a brain bleed.

707
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,531
His life will never
be the same.

708
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:29,966
His loved ones will
never be the same.

709
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,605
Oh, and, uh, Robertson is gonna
take over the post-op care.

710
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,341
But if there are signs of early
graft rejection, I want to know.

711
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,944
Okay.
Okay?

712
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,548
Excellent work today.

713
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:47,683
Thanks.

714
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:50,954
I heard you're
repeating intern year.

715
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,555
Yep. Yeah.

716
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:54,991
12 more months
of following orders

717
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:57,294
and barely
getting to operate.

718
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,162
Well, I don't -- I don't think
that's such a bad thing.

719
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:02,299
Internships <i>should</i> be two years,
18 months minimum.

720
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,400
We expect you to learn
too much, too fast.

721
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,169
You're gonna be more prepared.
You don't think
I'll lose ground?

722
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,804
If you wanna
keep leveling up,

723
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,505
you work with people
that make you better.

724
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:11,473
Like Griffith.

725
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,010
She's good. You stick
with her, you'll be fine.

726
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,149
Congrats on Rhiannon.
Such a victory.

727
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,184
Well, it's a team effort.
You took the lead.

728
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,186
Just say thanks.
Thanks.

729
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,588
So I was catching up
on some admin work,

730
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:29,658
and these are charts of
15 patients similar to Rhiannon,

731
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,929
and they all asked
to see you.

732
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:36,233
15 pregnant women
with spinal tumors?

733
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:39,236
Patients with seemingly
impossible cases

734
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,905
who have been turned down
at hospitals across the country.

735
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:45,041
People who have
only been told no.

736
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:46,709
And they wanna see me?

737
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,345
Well, they all
say the same thing.

738
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,947
They want the neurosurgeon
who is working on the cure

739
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,748
for Alzheimer's
to take them on.

740
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:57,954
Impossible cases.

741
00:34:57,988 --> 00:34:59,421
Well, until you
get your hands on them.

742
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:01,925
So think about it.

743
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,261
Hi.

744
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:06,562
I was, um, completely
out of line in the OR,

745
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,266
but I'm glad Rhiannon
and the baby are okay,

746
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,034
and I'm really sorry.

747
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,070
Your outburst
<i>was</i> inappropriate,

748
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:15,939
but you weren't wrong.

749
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:19,742
Uh, Dr. Altman,
do you have a minute?

750
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,111
Sure.

751
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,650
Miranda!

752
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:28,919
Here to walk me
to the curb,

753
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,452
to which
I have just been kicked?

754
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:34,224
I came to say sorr--
Goodbye. Thanks.

755
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,093
Oh, no. I don't hold
anything against you.

756
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,427
No.

757
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,562
No, you, uh,
took care of the boss.

758
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,232
Can't compete
with that, right?

759
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,934
Plus, I take it as a sign
that I am --

760
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,734
I am needed elsewhere.

761
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,804
That's a nice way
of looking at it.
Well...

762
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:49,638
Okay.

763
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:51,174
I hired Ben Warren.

764
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,643
I'm s-- You what?
Well, I just --

765
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:57,113
I forgot how hard
this job is.

766
00:35:57,147 --> 00:36:00,317
I never seem to be able
to do it as well as you.

767
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,152
The interns don't
want to listen.

768
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,987
Sure don't want to laugh.

769
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,355
Sometimes they don't
even wanna do the work.

770
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:09,192
But Ben Warren does,
and he has.

771
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,194
Plus, I thought that
with all your recent troubles

772
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,330
that you didn't need
the whispers of nepotism

773
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,965
following you around.

774
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,700
No, no, no.
Ben Warren is a keeper.

775
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:21,338
Thank you. I really...

776
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:22,372
Thank you.

777
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,843
Yep!

778
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,013
I'm sor-- No. Oh.
Oh! Oh, oop!

779
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:31,948
Beep-beep-boop.

780
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,883
Oh, and by the way...

781
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:36,186
I promised the interns
a retreat.

782
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,620
Sounds fun, yeah?

783
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,996
I saw the OB appointment
on our shared calendar.

784
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:49,498
Oh, yeah. Forget that.
What?

785
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:52,168
I rescheduled a knee replacement
so I could drive you.

786
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:55,171
Well, A, I can still drive,

787
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:58,408
and, B, I decided to
see someone here.

788
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:02,745
I had a patient today

789
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,581
who was willing
to risk her ability to walk,

790
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,751
maybe even risk her life,
to save her pregnancy,

791
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:12,989
so I figured that I can
sacrifice a little privacy

792
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,358
if it means giving
our kid the best care.

793
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:18,862
Okay.
Okay.

794
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:20,997
This isn't because of
the thing I said about DeLuca?

795
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,133
Well...

796
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:34,277
Decaf and biscotti.

797
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,513
To thank you
for your help today.

798
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,248
You know they pay me, right?

799
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,116
Well...
How's Donna Mae?

800
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,286
Alive and kicking.

801
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,255
One of the orderlies,
to be exact.

802
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,892
I bet you don't see a lot
of patients like her, huh?

803
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:51,227
You'd be surprised.

804
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:54,264
Humanity is lovely, but, uh,

805
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:55,932
a lot of people
are nightmares.

806
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:00,736
What?
Too -- Too judgy?
No!

807
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,439
I like it.

808
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,706
Makes you feel
a little less saintly.

809
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,476
Mm.

810
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:09,279
I mean, you give pastries
to nurses.

811
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:11,147
The barista comps me.

812
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:14,084
We -- We hooked up
last year, so...

813
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,553
Kidding.
It was two years ago.

814
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,155
Also kidding. No.

815
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:21,491
I actually, uh...

816
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't get many matches
on the apps.

817
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:26,930
Maybe it's 'cause I'm too
forthcoming about my job,

818
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:30,632
but, uh, I don't want to
spring it on people either.

819
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,001
Mm.

820
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,112
Oh, wow.
Oh!

821
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,646
Yeah.
That's good.

822
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,920
I'm -- I'm sitting right
here. You could just ask me.

823
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,923
<i>Like viruses,</i>
<i>we</i> also <i>wear masks.</i>

824
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,959
<i>We disguise ourselves</i>
<i>to hide the parts</i>

825
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:57,327
<i>we don't want to be seen.</i>

826
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,335
<i>We project confidence</i>
<i>when we're insecure,</i>

827
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:06,970
<i>toughness when</i>
<i>we're vulnerable,</i>

828
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,539
<i>and calm when our lives</i>
<i>are spinning out of control.</i>

829
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:12,842
Bringing up your family name
was out of line.

830
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:16,678
It was not your fault.
He requested you.

831
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:20,450
I could have said something...
but I didn't.

832
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,718
And that competition
is gonna make us better.

833
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,687
And we're pretty
great together, right?

834
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,223
Mm.

835
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,799
You said "girlfriend"
earlier.

836
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,334
I did?

837
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,839
Oh, yeah, I did.
Okay.

838
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,479
I'm cold.

839
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,352
<i>The difference is</i>
<i>those defense mechanisms</i>

840
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,354
<i>don't always serve us.</i>

841
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:01,424
I'm not going to ask if you're
okay because I know you're not.

842
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,928
Did I do something?

843
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:09,666
My sister Chloe
called this morning.

844
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,535
She was diagnosed
with colorectal cancer.

845
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:16,738
She's only 22.
I'm so sorry.

846
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,575
Altman's gonna see someone
here will take her case.

847
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:23,012
Is -- Is there
anything I can do?

848
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,615
Be my friend.

849
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,851
As great as whatever
this thing between us

850
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,752
was beginning to be,
I...

851
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:34,457
I don't think I can start
anything new right now.

852
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,135
Yeah. Of course.

853
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,471
Really?
Yeah.

854
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:53,910
<i>The things we do</i>
<i>to protect ourselves</i>

855
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:56,980
<i>make it harder</i>
<i>to let other people get close.</i>

856
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:59,616
<i>As terrifying as it might be</i>
<i>to let your guard down,</i>

857
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:02,218
<i>the rewards speak</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

858
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,454
She looks so peaceful
when she's sleeping.

859
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:08,625
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Yeah.

860
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:11,094
How'd she take it when
she found out Richard knows?

861
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:12,929
Better than he did.
Yeah, I don't think
he's gonna speak to me

862
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:16,966
for a very long time.
I'm sorry.
Are you mad at me, too?

863
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,102
I mean, for letting me in
after I asked to be let in?

864
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:20,903
No, I'm not mad.
I did that, didn't I?

865
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,171
Yeah.

866
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:23,673
I mean, I am a little mad.

867
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:25,341
You haven't asked about
my groundbreaking

868
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:28,344
kidney transplant, though.
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,146
How was it?
It was great. It was.

870
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:33,750
I mean, it was a little
irritating, but mostly great.

871
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,985
I think it might be the future
of kidney transplants.

872
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:37,920
Really?
Yeah.

873
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,822
I want to hear all about it
on the plane.

874
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:42,292
Okay.

875
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,826
Let's go.
Okay.

876
00:41:56,673 --> 00:41:59,509
<i>Because at the end of the day,</i>

877
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:02,679
<i>the only person worth being...</i>

878
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:09,352
<i>is yourself.</i>
