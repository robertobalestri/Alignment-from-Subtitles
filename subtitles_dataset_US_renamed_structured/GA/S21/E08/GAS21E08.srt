1
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:08,574
<i>The Greek myths loved to talk
about the perils of hubris,</i>

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,755
<i>the dangers of believing
you can outrun</i>

3
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,785
<i>the will of the gods.</i>

4
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,615
How is she
still out there?

5
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,375
It's already 100 degrees.

6
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,725
She just barely left
that chair in six weeks.

7
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,765
Grief doesn't care that it's
the hottest spring on record.

8
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,276
One of us
needs to go out there.

9
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:23,385
She can't be late
on her first day back.

10
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,796
Or pass out from heatstroke.

11
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,006
Not it.

12
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:29,215
How long has she been
- out there?
- Too long.

13
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,015
I wish there were something
we could do for her.

14
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,775
Yeah, bring her sister back
from the dead.

15
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:34,395
- I'm being serious.
- I am, too.

16
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,605
I knew it. Just not ready.

17
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:37,775
Ready for what?

18
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,125
<i>As surgeons, we need hubris
just to get through the day.</i>

19
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:41,196
Come on, losers.

20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,195
Let's ride.

21
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:46,135
<i>We have to believe
we can fix people,</i>

22
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:48,135
<i>even with the odds stacked
against us.</i>

23
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,935
Okay.â™ª Life goes on and on

24
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:00,665
Oh, sorry.

25
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,595
Uh, Nora,
- what are you doing here?
- Hi.

26
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,285
I was going to text you.
I have a follow-up with Teddy.

27
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:06,325
Well, <i>had.</i>

28
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:08,225
I just heard it was canceled,
and now my car won't start.

29
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:10,225
And I've been on hold with
the tow company for 20 minutes.

30
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,226
Oh, well,
if they're as busy as we are,

31
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,055
you going to wait a while.

32
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,675
You should get out
- of this heat.
- No kidding.

33
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,955
My 10-year-old baked cookies
on the hood of my car yesterday.

34
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:19,065
- Didn't we do that once?
- Yeah, on your porch.

35
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,615
And then the dough sat
there for an hour,

36
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:21,685
doing nothing,
and then your dog ate them.

37
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,685
That's right.

38
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:26,685
I should get back in here.

39
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,446
It's like your Bat-Signal.

40
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,695
Are you calling me
a superhero?

41
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:31,035
You did save my life.

42
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,835
Technically,
that was Teddy.

43
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:37,115
Anyway, there... there's
a cooling center in the clinic,

44
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,526
so you're more than welcome
to wait there... Okay.

45
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:42,085
...and, uh, yeah,
good luck with your car.

46
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,186
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

47
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:47,985
<i>Humility makes you good,
but ego makes you great.</i>

48
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:49,955
I got the two
last iced coffees on Earth,

49
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:51,506
and one is for you.

50
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,825
I have this amazing case.

51
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:56,235
Some might call it
impossible,

52
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,035
which is where I'm focusing
my energy right now,

53
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,825
but there is
a cardiothoracic component,

54
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,755
and I thought, who better
to do it with than, uh...

55
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:02,895
Thanks again
for last night.

56
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:03,896
Call me.

57
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,736
Thank you.

58
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,076
Sorry about that.

59
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:15,495
Hm. I'm sorry
about your coffee.

60
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,675
<i>If that means flying
a little too close to the sun,</i>

61
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,055
<i>well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.</i>

62
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,845
Yasuda.

63
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:23,505
How are you feeling?
Any pain?

64
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:24,815
A little, not much.

65
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,235
Okay.
You still taking meds?

66
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:28,095
Just NSAIDs.

67
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,305
And PT? Benching 180.

68
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,855
Kidding.

69
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,345
I have the upper-body strength
of a jellyfish.

70
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,965
Listen, it can be hard
coming back to a place

71
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,035
where something traumatic
happened,

72
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,935
so just be patient
with yourself.

73
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:43,866
Thanks,
but what I need is routine.

74
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:46,835
I'm... I'm ready
to get back to work.

75
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,875
Okay, then,
welcome back.

76
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,535
We have expected high of 108.

77
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:55,055
That means a full E.R.,
lots of heat-related illness,

78
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,265
especially amongst
the most vulnerable populations.

79
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,405
Fortunately, we have
some extra local doctors

80
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,715
who have agreed
to help us out.

81
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,126
Please show them
a warm welcome.

82
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:04,235
We have cool IV fluids,
misters,

83
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,755
and inflatable ice baths.
Use them.

84
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,375
Cold immersion is
the fastest way

85
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,725
to lower internal body
temperatures.

86
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:14,035
All elective surgeries
have been canceled
until further notice.

87
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:16,420
Looks like your surgery
- just went up in flames.
- Be on the lookout for any
of the following symptoms...

88
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,765
cramping, nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, headaches.

89
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,316
Take care of yourselves,
hydrate,

90
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,495
and we will get through this.

91
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,185
Let's get back to work.

92
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,600
I know that you've been on
since yesterday,

93
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,775
but you need
to take a break.

94
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:27,225
- I'm good for now.
- Okay.

95
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:29,295
Guess I should find
my patient.

96
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,265
Come on. I'll introduce you
- before she has to leave.
- Okay.

97
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:34,025
Hey, Chief, uh,
I'm on your service,

98
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,405
and I'm ready to be
the best surgical wingman

99
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:37,305
- you've ever seen.
- I'm glad you're here,

100
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,715
but no scrubbing in today.

101
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,615
Today, I need
first-responder Ben Warren.

102
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,476
You'll be managing overflow.

103
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,105
You want me on admin?

104
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:47,005
What I need today is someone
who is good in a crisis.

105
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,276
I want you to communicate
with the command center

106
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:52,215
and update me as needed.

107
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,285
Can't imagine having
- to give birth in this heat.
- Yeah.

108
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:57,975
Or, you know, ever.

109
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,115
Turns out extreme heat
can cause preterm labor,

110
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,845
so that's fun.

111
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,635
- You know what's more fun?
- What?

112
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,645
The guy can't fix
our AC today.

113
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,095
Then call a different guy.

114
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:09,505
I've tried like 10 guys.
They're all slammed.

115
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,955
The kids can't sleep
in 90-degree heat.

116
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,715
<i>I</i> can't sleep
in 90-degree heat.

117
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,065
Fortunately,
we don't have to.

118
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,965
We could get a hotel
for the night,

119
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,965
or I could find us a house
to rent.

120
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:23,175
Damn it.
Can you just figure it out?

121
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:26,005
Jackie, Sky.
This is Dr. Winston Ndugu,

122
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:28,185
our chief
of cardiothoracic surgery.

123
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,015
He has agreed to work
on Jackie's case with me.

124
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,705
- Oh, my God, you're the guy.
- Jackie.

125
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,496
- You ghosted my mom.
- Oh, no.

126
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:38,225
I recognize you
from the profile on the app.

127
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,506
My mom showed it to me
in case she went missing.

128
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:43,675
Hello again.

129
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,305
If you want another doctor,
I can...

130
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,095
No, no, I have bigger things
to worry about

131
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,956
than a guy
I went out with once.

132
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,036
As long as you're excellent
at your job, I'm good.

133
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,655
Okay,
Jackie Williams, 18,

134
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:57,765
recently diagnosed
with Marfan syndrome,

135
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,525
a connective tissue disorder
that weakens blood vessels.

136
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:04,665
She has three brain aneurysms
as well as an aortic aneurysm.

137
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,045
I got a full ride
to Georgia Tech for basketball.

138
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,425
A week later,
I get this diagnosis.

139
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:11,845
And they're telling us
that they have to push
Jackie's surgery?

140
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,675
The hospital needs to
dedicate all resources
to the heat dome.

141
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:18,195
Her father died of a ruptured
brain aneurysm at 27.

142
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:20,126
Now we know it was
probably Marfan, too.

143
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:23,205
We'd really like
to get this taken care of.

144
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,515
We should sneak her
into CT just to take a look.

145
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,825
Thank you, Dr. Ndugu.

146
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:28,935
Least I can do.

147
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:29,936
No crap.

148
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:35,555
I thought you
were seeing Beltran.

149
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,735
I'm seeing a few people.

150
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,735
Clearly.

151
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,150
I'm really glad
that you're back.

152
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,425
If you need anything... Don't. I'm good. Really.

153
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,565
- Let's go.
- You're with me.

154
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:47,395
Carl Halcomb, 52,
was operating a crane

155
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:48,535
when it collapsed
on the apartment building.

156
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,195
Temp in the field
was 109.

157
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,785
Fluid and cooling measures
initiated en route.

158
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,265
Temp currently at 106,
and he's still altered.

159
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:58,275
Alright, we need to get
his temperature down fast.

160
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,825
My nephew... shaggy hair...
is he...?

161
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,105
He was on the phone.
- I tried to yell.
- We've got him.

162
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:04,515
David Holcomb.
20-year-old male.

163
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,555
Crush injuries to
the abdomen and right upper.

164
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

165
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,486
He's burning up.
Let's get a gurney out here.

166
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,115
Get everybody inside,
and page for more hands.

167
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,636
Oh, Lord help us.

168
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,071
I'm guessing shooting guard.

169
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,992
That's a position
in basketball.

170
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,271
She thinks she's funny.

171
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,141
No. She's right.
Um, huge Storm fan.

172
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,241
Sue Bird's my idol.

173
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,862
Excuse me. Blue.
Dr. Kwan.

174
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,242
We'll meet you in CT. Yeah.

175
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:45,801
Hi.
What are you doing here?

176
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:46,971
I heard about
the heat dome,

177
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,941
and I hopped on a plane
to come help.

178
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,601
That was a lie. I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

179
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:52,942
Is everything okay?

180
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,121
Dave proposed.

181
00:06:56,122 --> 00:07:00,231
He, um, proposed,
and I immediately came here.

182
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:03,781
Like, ever since that day
that you kissed me,

183
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:05,781
I just haven't been able
to get you out of my head,

184
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:10,312
and I don't know what to do,
so I just thought...

185
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:14,211
I don't know what I thought,

186
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,281
but I had to see you.

187
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,731
I...

188
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,531
This is not a good time.
Can we...

189
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,701
No, you're busy.
I don't want to keep you.

190
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:41,061
Sky. Jackie's on her way
to CT now.

191
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:42,342
Thanks.

192
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,721
Uh, my divorce was
more amicable than most,

193
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:53,491
but, still,
it's been rough,

194
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,801
so I-I've been trying
to get back out there,

195
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:59,221
and I'm just not ready
for anything serious right now.

196
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,251
That's what I should've
told you after our date.

197
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,841
For the record,

198
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:05,291
I never used the term "ghosting"
with my daughter.

199
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:08,671
Either way, I messed up.
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,061
Dating as a single mom,

201
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,301
it isn't exactly
a pleasure cruise,

202
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,022
but none of that matters now.

203
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:17,031
Since Jackie's symptoms
started,

204
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,861
all my energy
is going to making sure

205
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,031
that she gets the best care.

206
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,582
Well, you've come
to the right place.

207
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,281
Jackie's my whole world.

208
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,691
You can ghost me.
That's fine.

209
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,591
But you do not mess around
with my girl.

210
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,041
I wouldn't dream of it.

211
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:42,881
Okay,
nephew's in trauma one.

212
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,362
- How's <i>he</i> doing?
- Temp's 105,

213
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:47,371
Heart rate's rising, and
Adams got the last ice bath.

214
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:50,721
- Sorry.
- My nephew...
please say he's okay.

215
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,721
- Did I kill him?
- We'll try to find out.

216
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,721
He's delirious.

217
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,101
We have to cool him
down quickly

218
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,001
or he'd risk
permanent organ damage.

219
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:00,311
I need a body bag and ice
right now.

220
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,731
The E.R.'s out
of body bags.

221
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,831
Do you want me to...
go to the morgue?

222
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,142
No. I want you to <i>run</i>
- to the morgue.
- Okay.

223
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,322
- I can go by myself.
- I want to help.

224
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,951
Sir? Sir?

225
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,261
Uh, Adams,
give me an intubation tray.

226
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:18,501
He's got
an unstable humerus.

227
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:20,061
There's free fluid
in the abdomen.

228
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:21,131
I heard you might need
some help in here.

229
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,201
I brought some visitors.

230
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,411
Dr. Walters, Nurse Constantine,
and Dr. Beckman.

231
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,651
I thought
Dr. Beckman was... A man?
That'd be my husband.

232
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,062
I'm just helping out
for the day.

233
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,101
Dr. Hunt,
wondered if I'd see you.

234
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,761
What happened here?

235
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,592
Uh, poor kid
wasn't paying attention.

236
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:34,931
Crane fell on him.

237
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,351
That's a hell
of a wake-up call.

238
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,591
We should get him to C.T.
before...

239
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:38,941
BP's tanking.

240
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,771
Guess we'll go straight
into surgery.

241
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,561
Who's going to help me
find an O.R.?

242
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,391
What? No bossy women
in your lives?

243
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,252
- Come on.
- Deal with the arm later.

244
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,951
Let's go.

245
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,501
My patient's
got a temperature of 105.

246
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,602
Oh, yeah? Well, mine's
104 and pregnant.

247
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,401
You know, pregnancy
doesn't automatically
trump everything else.

248
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,781
Well, <i>I</i> trump <i>you,</i>

249
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,091
so I should get
the rest of the ice.

250
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:58,441
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's my ice.

251
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,791
Oh. There's a machine
in the attendings' lounge.

252
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,061
- Try there.
- Empty.

253
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:05,271
The cafeteria, then?
ICU? Dermatology?

254
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,831
Okay, I will be
the adult and order some.

255
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,351
Thank you.
Oh, you know what?

256
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,901
There's a convenience store
over on Pine.

257
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,211
You should probably just...
faster to go.

258
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,111
Why are <i>you</i> bossing <i>me</i>
around?

259
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,461
Because I'm dealing
with overflow for Chief,

260
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:16,871
we barely have enough orderlies,

261
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:17,941
and, well, you know,
we need ice.

262
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:18,981
Load as much as you can
in your car

263
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:20,052
and just hurry back.

264
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:24,671
I didn't drive today.

265
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,192
Okay, we'll take my car.

266
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,961
It's nice in here.

267
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,932
Quiet. Peaceful.

268
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:44,382
Which one do you think
was Chloe's?

269
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,422
I don't know.

270
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,632
I bet she was happy here.

271
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,782
She always liked
cold weather.

272
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:01,882
Mika?

273
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,751
Come on. We keep this guy
waiting any longer,

274
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,062
we'll kill him, too.

275
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:23,871
How's Molly?
Adams swore me to secrecy.

276
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:28,461
Molly is... deciding if she
wants to marry her boyfriend.

277
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,879
Do you still have feelings
for her?

278
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:34,051
Too much has happened.

279
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:37,401
It would be impossible
to make it work now.

280
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:41,681
Maybe it wouldn't be
as hard as you think.

281
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:43,231
How much longer
do I have to be in here?

282
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,681
I'm supposed to be in Georgia
right now,

283
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,751
starting team workouts,

284
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,451
but instead I'm sitting
in this giant tube

285
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,211
with blood bombs in my brain.

286
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,971
Well, maybe when
this is all done,

287
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:54,556
you could look into
a low-contact sport.

288
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,631
Basketball's the only thing
I've ever loved,

289
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,801
so I'm not letting
it go that easy.

290
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,421
After all this is over,
I'm going to find a way to play.

291
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:02,981
Good luck convincing
a pro team

292
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,771
to take that kind of risk
on you.

293
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,121
Scans are up.

294
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:09,261
Let's see
what we've got.

295
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:14,711
Okay. The aortic root aneurysm
definitely needs surgery ASAP.

296
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,851
Okay,
this is the brain CTA.

297
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:22,101
Right, there's two on the MCA.
There's one aneurysm on the ACA.

298
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:25,071
Damn it. See this one
in the posterior circulation?

299
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,831
That is on the basilar artery.

300
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,281
- That's new.
- And big.

301
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,451
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
that's Godzilla on steroids.

302
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:32,701
We need to embolize
that immediately.

303
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,251
Do you do it
endovascularly?

304
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,491
If we can get
the right angle.

305
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,291
If not,
we'll have to convert to open.

306
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,252
And I'm going to need
you to put her on bypass.

307
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,361
Uh, no, it'd be too much
stress on the heart.

308
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,981
It could cause
the aortic aneurysm to rupture.

309
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,711
I mean, this could rupture
at any second.

310
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:47,232
If that explodes,
she's brain-dead.

311
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:51,061
So what do we tell the mom?

312
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:55,411
We tell her I will go in
endovascularly,

313
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,342
and we pray that
I don't have to open her up.

314
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,065
I don't understand.

315
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,503
I thought that
all surgeries were postponed.

316
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:06,783
Well, her case is now
considered emergent.

317
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,712
You said that
the brain aneurysm could wait.

318
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:10,782
This new one is larger
than the others.

319
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,132
And in a more
concerning location.

320
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,482
Does that mean
that it's harder to fix?

321
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,002
Mom, don't freak out.

322
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,908
I was going to need
this anyway,

323
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,458
and she's the only doctor
who actually said yes.

324
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,389
Are you sure you
can still do this?

325
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,708
This aneurysm is difficult,

326
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,328
but it's the same game, and I've
been playing for a long time.

327
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,439
I know how to do this.

328
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,533
Do we have to decide
right now?

329
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,316
I'd like to proceed
sooner than later.

330
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,642
You should take a minute
- to think about it.
- Kwan.

331
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:40,512
I know my word might not hold
a lot of weight right now,

332
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:43,062
but Jackie does need
this surgery,

333
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,412
and you want Dr. Shepherd
to do it.

334
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:46,723
I promise.

335
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,833
It's my only shot.

336
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:54,833
Then I guess
you better take it.

337
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,052
We should clear the air.

338
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,432
I'm sorry?

339
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,052
I am sorry for what happened
with Teddy.

340
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:08,913
We should get in there.

341
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,402
Look, what happened was
not my finest moment.

342
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:14,402
I don't typically go around
kissing other people's wives.

343
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,412
We were just having
a good time,

344
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,372
and it was
a misunderstanding.

345
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,003
And it was
<i>my</i> misunderstanding.

346
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:26,382
You know,
no apology necessary.

347
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:27,832
I trust my wife.
She told me it was nothing,

348
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,762
and I believe her.
We're good.

349
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:31,833
Okay. Hm.

350
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,942
Wait. What would you
have done just now

351
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:36,222
if Teddy hadn't told me
about the kiss?

352
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,742
Crawled under a rock
and died.

353
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:42,173
- Chief. Chief.
- Seattle Pres's generator failed

354
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,453
and a semi-truck blew a tire

355
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:47,633
and caused a 15-car pileup
on the 5.

356
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,083
That means
more incoming traumas

357
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,913
and staff caught
in traffic.

358
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,734
So, uh,
it's not a great time

359
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,293
to tell you
that the ICU is full, huh?

360
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,363
I have 700 problems.

361
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,953
I need you to bring me
the solutions.

362
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,573
Okay, we can send overflow
to the PACU,

363
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,023
and I can put out
another request to nurses

364
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,373
to come in
on their day off.

365
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,093
Great.
- Make that happen.
- Alright.

366
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,993
Oh, uh, also,
the ice delivery is delayed.

367
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,613
Already sent someone
to get more.

368
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:11,064
Thank you.
Yeah, this is Altman.

369
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,384
Hey, you got any ice?

370
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,214
Yeah, it's in the back
if there's any left.

371
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:25,983
Ooh. Yum.

372
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,534
What? I haven't had
any breakfast yet.

373
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:36,953
What? We drove across
the Sahara for this?

374
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,888
We got to go somewhere else.
This is not going to...

375
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,683
Open the register...
now.

376
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:42,203
Get down. Get down.

377
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:44,614
- Oh, my God.
- I said open it.

378
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,343
Okay, um... Hurry up.

379
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,484
Okay, okay.
Just please don't hurt me.

380
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,693
You know what's worse than
burning or freezing to death?

381
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,523
Burning <i>and</i> freezing
to death.

382
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,183
Please stop.

383
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,463
Uh, core temp is coming down.
Slowly.

384
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,153
Millin, we have, uh,
incoming traumas.

385
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,053
Go give Altman a hand.

386
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,083
Okay.

387
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,704
Um, BP is falling.

388
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,983
Are those ST elevations?

389
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:11,993
He just went into v-fib.

390
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,443
Ah, he's having
a heart attack.

391
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:15,714
Okay, Yasuda,
get a crash cart.

392
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,133
Yas... Uh, anyone?
Crash cart? Now.

393
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,553
He's... He's dying.

394
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,143
That is what the crash cart
is for.

395
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:26,414
Okay, Carl, stay with us.

396
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,463
Give me the pads.
Okay.

397
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:38,223
Okay. Right,
we're going to charge to 150.

398
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,883
Clear.

399
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,843
It's not working.
You're losing him.

400
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,053
You're letting him die.

401
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:45,233
Okay, charge again
to 200.

402
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,853
Okay, clear.

403
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,583
Dr. Bailey, he's dying.

404
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,233
Hey, don't you think
I know that?

405
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,893
Go again. Clear.

406
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:57,894
- He's dying.
- Damn.

407
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:59,554
Aren't you supposed
to be a doctor?

408
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:03,112
He is dying.
You are letting him die.

409
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,073
You just can't let him die
like that.

410
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,151
You can't just let him die.
You have to save her.

411
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,011
Save her.
Just please save her.

412
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,426
Just... Just...
Just save her. Please.

413
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,221
You have to save her.
Please. Just take me.

414
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,951
Dr. Bailey,
just take me.

415
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,222
Just take me.

416
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,951
Going again.

417
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,471
Clear.

418
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:23,991
Got him back.

419
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,385
Chief, ICU is full.
PACU is full.

420
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,525
I think it's time
we considered moving

421
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,795
intubated patients
into the E.R.

422
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,665
We don't have the staff
to manage that.

423
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,905
With the outage, a few towers
have been knocked out,

424
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,565
and I can't get through
to anyone.

425
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,456
I need to talk to you
- about Yasuda.
- Okay.

426
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,425
We're kind of in
the middle of something.

427
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:49,325
She wants to work, but
she's not even close to ready.

428
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,745
- I have to bench her.
- Okay.
Offer her extra time off.

429
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:53,335
She has been through
so much.

430
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:54,675
She shouldn't come back
until she feels ready.

431
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:57,235
- Agreed. Thank you.
- Yep.

432
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,235
Chief, I've got
critical patients and
no place to put them.

433
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:01,685
Alright, we are going to
have to divert traumas.

434
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:02,855
You want to send
patients away?

435
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,415
No, but we don't have
the resources.

436
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,655
I know you only
want to talk about solutions,

437
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:07,585
but this is
a big problem.

438
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,415
Those hospitals
you want to divert to?

439
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,695
Seattle Press has been
experiencing power
outages all day.

440
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:14,735
Tukwila Hospital's
entire IT system is down.

441
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:17,185
I have been a first responder
with nowhere to take patients.

442
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:18,325
We can't close down.

443
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,805
Altman.
Wait, you're breaking up.

444
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:24,035
Wait. Don't do anything
until I get there.

445
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,995
I don't see any other options
right now. Do you?

446
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,426
So are we diverting
or not?

447
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:35,325
We're staying open.
I'll figure it out.

448
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,015
Okay, well, do it fast

449
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,225
before I have to start putting
patients in stairwells.

450
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,245
Open the drawer.
What's your name?

451
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,115
- Gladys.
- Gladys, listen to me.

452
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:50,526
I need everything that's in
that drawer right now,

453
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:52,076
- Gladys, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

454
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:54,565
Nothing's going through.

455
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,565
Okay. Uh...

456
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,565
There's got to be
another door.

457
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,635
Stay here.

458
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:02,125
No. No. No.

459
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,405
Oh, God.

460
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,750
That... That's everything.

461
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,616
I-I-I promise.
I-I-I swear.

462
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:15,756
Hey, look,
what about these, huh?

463
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,765
I need you to do exactly what
I say exactly when I say it.

464
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,935
Got it?

465
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,465
Hey. Get over here
where I can see you.

466
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,816
Both of you. Now.

467
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,915
Behind there with her.
Put your phones on the counter.

468
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,986
Put them on the table.

469
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,785
Alright, nobody moves
unless you want to die.

470
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:44,896
Got it?

471
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:53,311
Last anterior aneurysm
has been coiled.

472
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,731
Moving on
to the beast.

473
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:57,111
What are the chances
of Jackie developing

474
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,111
more aneurysms later on?

475
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:00,701
Well, the Marfan syndrome
does predispose her,

476
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:01,981
but that does
not necessarily mean...

477
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,112
Doesn't it, though?

478
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:04,811
I mean, we can fix these,

479
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,741
but the underlying problem
will always be there.

480
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,501
Can we hold
on the negativity

481
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,921
while I am inside
Jackie's brain?

482
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:13,681
Of course. Sorry.

483
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:16,681
Wow. This is not good.

484
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,301
You see how
there's no neck to it?

485
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,722
Looks worse than
on the scan.

486
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,961
If we go any further,
I'm going to rupture it,

487
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,101
and she's going to lose
a lot more than basketball.

488
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,477
We are going to have to put
her on bypass and open her up.

489
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:33,771
Specimen coming your way.

490
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,701
Liver and stomach look good.
How's the small bowel?

491
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,631
Think we're ready to close.
Oh-looped PDS.

492
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,531
Is there any ETA
on when I can set this arm?

493
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,641
Uh, we're closing now.

494
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,191
Dr. Beckman, what do you think
of Grey-Sloan so far?

495
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,331
State-of-the-art O.R.s

496
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,441
and dark roast
in the attendings' lounge.

497
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,611
If you tried to poach me,
I wouldn't be mad about it.

498
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:53,472
Are you looking
for a new job?

499
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,961
Aren't we always looking to
upgrade some part of our lives?

500
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,831
You didn't consider applying
for a position in the past?

501
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,071
Oh, I did.

502
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,591
Head of the department
never called.

503
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,211
We haven't had
many openings lately,

504
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,071
but, by all means,
e-mail me your rÃ©sumÃ©.

505
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:07,181
That'd be fantastic.

506
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,251
Blood's coming
from somewhere.

507
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:10,252
Damn it. We need
to open again. Scissors.

508
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,422
Page me when you need me.

509
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:27,682
Hey.

510
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:34,382
That's where she died.

511
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,281
Chloe?

512
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:39,732
My parents let me name her.

513
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:45,491
Did they run out of ideas
for the eighth girl?

514
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:47,391
I already had
two younger sisters,

515
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,771
and I was not excited
about a third.

516
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:53,982
They figured I'd be more into
her if I had a bigger stake.

517
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,542
- Did it work?
- Too well.

518
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,101
I love all my sisters.

519
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:04,961
But Chloe...

520
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,512
she was my heart.

521
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,861
And now I've lost it.

522
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,701
I've grieved my mom
every day of my life,

523
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,771
and I never met her.

524
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:20,532
I can't imagine
how you're feeling.

525
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,642
Will I ever feel
normal again?

526
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:31,711
I think this is
your normal now.

527
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:33,201
And every day you'll get

528
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,341
a little more comfortable
with it.

529
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:38,751
â™ª Of holding tighter

530
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:42,512
â™ª Of losing control

531
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:45,522
â™ª Could I let it go?

532
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,591
Cream, no sugar. Right?

533
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:52,771
You remembered.

534
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,352
Yeah.

535
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,081
â™ª Slow fading

536
00:22:57,082 --> 00:22:59,702
â™ª Short breath

537
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,502
Jackie's first basketball.

538
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,371
Once she outgrew it,

539
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:06,831
I started using it
as a stress ball.

540
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:15,481
She was just a baby
when her father died.

541
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:18,411
In the blink of an eye,

542
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:21,111
the love of my life
was just gone,

543
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:26,871
and I had this little girl
to take care of.

544
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,011
And I didn't think
that I could do it,

545
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:30,702
but she gave me
the strength.

546
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,442
Every smile, every giggle,
every... every milestone.

547
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:45,372
She kept me going.

548
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:49,342
I don't know
what I would do if...

549
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:55,862
She's going to be okay, right?

550
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:58,731
We can't make guarantees,
but...

551
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,522
Hey.

552
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,601
So the good news is I got
all but one of the aneurysms.

553
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:09,021
Okay, um, uh,
what's the bad news?

554
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,531
There's been a change
of plans.

555
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,261
We are going to have to
open Jackie up

556
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:13,881
to get the last aneurysm.

557
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:15,781
What does that mean?

558
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:17,781
Well, I will open
Jackie's skull

559
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,721
after Dr. Ndugu puts her
on bypass.

560
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:22,581
We will cool her down
to stop her heart

561
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:24,551
and cut off blood flow
to her brain,

562
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:26,791
which will make it safe
to clip the aneurysm.

563
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,521
You're stopping her heart?

564
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,311
I know it sounds scary,
but Dr. Ndugu will be there

565
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:33,731
to make sure
that her heart is okay.

566
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,111
I couldn't go any further
without risking a rupture.

567
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:36,662
This is our best shot.

568
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,771
Okay, just...
just save my baby.

569
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,391
Okay.

570
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:43,572
Save my baby,

571
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:50,261
What the hell happened?

572
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:51,962
We knew this was
a possibility.

573
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,911
Hey,
I got your text.

574
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:03,401
What's going on?

575
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:12,301
Are you okay?

576
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,931
I just want to feel normal.

577
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:17,001
Please.
Help me feel normal.

578
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:19,281

587
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:36,423
Gladys,
do I look stupid to you?

588
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:38,323
$47 on a busy day?

589
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,493
I-I just work here.

590
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:41,943
Where's the rest
of the money?

591
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:43,883
Hey, look, you want money?
Yeah? Yeah?

592
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,676
How about we give you
what's in our wallets?

593
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:50,123
I got, uh...

594
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:52,163
- 12 bucks.
- Um...

595
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:54,683
12 bucks?

596
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:55,963
Where's the safe,
Gladys?

597
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,063
Where is it?

598
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:02,654
Gladys, look at me.

599
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,243
Where's the safe,
Gladys?

600
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:08,253
I-It's, um, in the back.

601
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,253
Okay. Let's go.

602
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,254
Okay.

603
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,733
And you two,
you follow her.

604
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,743
And don't try
anything stupid.

605
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,683
Well, that was...

606
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,234
Yeah.

607
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,373
My whole body's vibrating.

608
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,583
You're welcome.

609
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,763
Mm, Dr. Bailey's
probably looking for us.

610
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:39,213
I need a minute.

611
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:51,153
Oh, it's not you.

612
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:53,293
I know.

613
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,573
Aw.

614
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:59,194
Just, every room in this
hospital, I-I see her face.

615
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,373
- Every room.
- Okay, come here.

616
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:03,893
- I see her face.
- Come here. Come here.

617
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,133
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

618
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:09,483
We'll figure it out
together.

619
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:11,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I promise.

620
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:16,763
No wonder no one wanted
this case.

621
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,283
One wrong move, and
we literally blow up her life.

622
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,773
Or we could save it.

623
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,044
As Jackie cools
to 16 degrees Celsius,

624
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:24,293
the heart will stop,

625
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:25,943
and Dr. Ndugu will shut off
the pump.

626
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:28,843
And then I will have 45 minutes
to clip that aneurysm

627
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:30,333
before she's at risk
for permanent brain damage.

628
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,403
- Is that enough time?
- It's going to have to be.

629
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:34,333
But what if we don't access
the right angle?

630
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,023
No more questions.
I...

631
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:40,863
As I work, I need comp...
complete...

632
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:43,004
No distractions.
I need complete concentration.

633
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,483
Dr. Shepherd.

634
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,183
You said it yourself.
This is an impossible case.

635
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:57,293
That was before you saw
the fourth aneurysm.

636
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,774
No one will fault you
if you can't do this.

637
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,573
I have been Sky and Jackie,

638
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:07,813
desperately searching
for a shred of hope.

639
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:11,303
My dad, my brother.

640
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:13,443
I have seen loss.

641
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:16,033
I thought
there was a chance

642
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:20,103
that I could keep Skye
from losing Jackie, but...

643
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:22,396
but what if there's no...
what if I can't give her that?

644
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:24,313
It's too late for that.

645
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:25,803
You've come too far now, okay?

646
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:27,323
You have to
see it through.

647
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:28,393
Can you do this?

648
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:30,803
Because I think you can.

649
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,703
Okay, let's do it.

650
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,503
Okay. Okay.

651
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:39,914
Okay.

652
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:42,683
Scissors. Mesenteric bleeding
has stopped.

653
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,333
Good catch, everyone.

654
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,853
It was all Dr. Beckman.

655
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:48,133
It was a team effort.
And this was a lot of fun.

656
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,173
We should all have dinner
again sometime.

657
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:51,304
Too soon?

658
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:54,033
I think
we're ready to close.

659
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,593
Dr. Beckman,
you do the honors.

660
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,143
Go ahead.
I'm right behind you.

661
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,594
Somebody paid ortho.

662
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:07,083
I've dissected down as far as
I can without risking rupture.

663
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:09,913
Are we ready
for circulatory arrest?

664
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:12,533
Internal body temperature
is at 16 degrees.

665
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,713
Perfusionist is ready
to stop the pump.

666
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:15,503
Just say the word.

667
00:30:19,374 --> 00:30:21,203
Start the clock.

668
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:23,723
â™ª Oh, and we know

669
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,203
Bipolar.

670
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,773
Dr. Bailey,
do you have a minute?

671
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:38,943
Yasuda.

672
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:41,253
I was just going
to look for you.

673
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,744
Come find me after, okay?

674
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,293
You should know
that I got Carl back.

675
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:51,473
He just got a stent placed,
and he's recovering.

676
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,543
I am so sorry
that I freaked out, okay?

677
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:56,583
- It will not happen again.
- Oh, yes, it will.

678
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,683
My mom died
three years ago,

679
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:02,144
and I still lose my cool
sometimes.

680
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:06,213
I thought that work
would distract me.

681
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,903
I leapt into work
after I lost my mom.

682
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:13,663
I... I needed a purpose

683
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,494
to help me make sense
of her death.

684
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:20,773
Turns out,
death doesn't make any sense.

685
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,983
If I could do it again,
I would stay home.

686
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:27,853
I would rest
until I was ready to come back

687
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,613
because I <i>wanted</i> to work,

688
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:34,484
not because I-I <i>needed</i> work
to save me.

689
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,273
â™ª Wherever I go

690
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:40,143
I don't want to be here.

691
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:42,903
Take more time, okay?

692
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,493
Go be with your family.

693
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:46,663
Grieve. Okay?

694
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:49,463
We'll... We'll be here
when you're ready to come back.

695
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:56,153
I don't think
I <i>can</i> come back.

696
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:58,604
â™ª Rolling in my mind

697
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:01,783
Rest can do wonders.
Okay?

698
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:04,513
Y-You'll... You'll feel
differently in a few weeks.

699
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,993
I want to believe that,
but I-I know myself.

700
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,654
I am either all in
or I am all...

701
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:14,553
I need to find
a way forward.

702
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:20,633
I-I can't do that if everything
around... me reminds me of her.

703
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:30,714
I'm sorry to hear that,
but you know yourself best.

704
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:35,783
You know, great surgeons
have great respect

705
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,543
for how fragile life is.

706
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:41,234
And when
you <i>are</i> ready...

707
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,553
...this will
make you better,

708
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:47,173
stronger.

709
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,903
I know it.

710
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:50,973
I really, really hope
you're right.

711
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:14,923
Stay right there.

712
00:33:14,924 --> 00:33:17,103
Gladys, what the hell
is taking so long?

713
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:18,753
- I've never opened this before.
- I don't know how.

714
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:21,933
Figure it out unless
you want me to use this.

715
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:25,173
My grandfather owned
a convenience store.

716
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:26,623
Did he ever tell you
what to do

717
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:28,283
if you're robbed
at gunpoint?

718
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:30,353
He died
before I was born.

719
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,393
I'm sorry.

720
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:33,703
How'd he die?

721
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:36,843
Robbed at gunpoint.

722
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:39,394
Yeah, my Uncle Derek
and Aunt Amelia...

723
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:42,263
uh, Dr. Shepherd...
were there.

724
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,784
Maybe we don't talk.

725
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:49,963
Are you okay?

726
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,313
I think I'm bleeding.

727
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:55,723
What? Where?

728
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,694
I'm pregnant.

729
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,576
Almost done.
Just have to deploy the clip.

730
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,813
- One minute.
- I can see that
but I have to finish this

731
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:16,953
if we don't want her
stroking out on the table.

732
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,954
Kwan, retract here.

733
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:26,649
50 seconds.

734
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:29,344
Almost there.

735
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:35,803
40 seconds.

736
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:46,464
Got it.

737
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:47,853
Alright.
Let's restart the pump.

738
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:57,133
That was... Impossible.

739
00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:01,386
Ticktock, Gladys.

740
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,287
I'm starting to lose
- my patience.
I'm trying.

741
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:05,747
Wait.
- Where are you going?
- We have to get you
out of here.

742
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,297
Hey. Sit down.
Sit down.

743
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,848
Hey, hey,
she's pregnant.

744
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:16,957
Congratulations.

745
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,437
Okay, look... look,
if you let us go,

746
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:20,307
we'll walk out of here
like nothing happened.

747
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:23,897
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my money.

748
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:25,172
What, are you digging a tunnel
back there, Gladys?

749
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,067
- Hurry up.
- Safe won't open.

750
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:30,557
- God. Well, try again.
- I'm trying.

751
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:33,348
Sit down!
I'm not going to tell you again.

752
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,078
- Alright.
- Sit down.

753
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,767
Come on, Gladys.

754
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:40,666
- Oh, God.
- God!

755
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,028
Miss Williams?

756
00:35:58,038 --> 00:36:00,967
- How is she?
- We got the last aneurysm.

757
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,897
We're warming her up
to restart her heart.

758
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,837
Thank you so much.

759
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,628
Everyone was so scared
to take Jackie's case.

760
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:12,804
Everyone except
Dr. Shepherd.

761
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:16,707
Thank God she did.

762
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,987
We'll have more updates
for you soon.

763
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:21,507
Thank you.

764
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:56,677
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head, either.

765
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,437
I've wanted this
for so long.

766
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:10,645
We'll get you an ice bath
to lower your temperature
as soon as possible.

767
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,967
Hey, have you seen Wilson
anywhere?

768
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:16,007
No. I got to go
pick up the kids.

769
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,597
But if you see her,
- have her call me.
- Yeah.

770
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:22,527
Warren, I told you to divert
all incoming an hour ago.

771
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,907
I-I know it looks chaotic,
but I have a plan.

772
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,987
No one has a plan
with a heat dome.

773
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:29,087
That is why I asked you
to close to trauma

774
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:30,887
so that we could focus on the
patients that we already have.

775
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:33,097
People will die
waiting on rigs.

776
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:35,167
Says the firefighter.
Think like a surgeon.

777
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,748
You told me to be
a first responder today.

778
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:41,687
We are closed to trauma,
effective immediately.

779
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,927
<i>Nurse Milstien to the O.R.</i>

780
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:46,001
<i>Nurse Callie Milstien
to the O.R.</i>

781
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,087
So you take the heels off
and eat residents for lunch?

782
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:00,497
Do you ever feel like
no one listens to you?

783
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,777
I work in
a male-dominated specialty.

784
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,568
Sometimes I think
they hear me

785
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:07,987
- the... third time I say it.
- I mean,
did you see the E.R.?

786
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:12,437
I don't know what
- I'm going to do.
- Yeah,
you are pretty screwed.

787
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,268
How can I help?

788
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:16,787
- Can you stay?
- Yeah, I can stay.

789
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,347
Hey. I'm just, uh...
I'm heading up to the ICU.

790
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:26,487
Can you... Actually, uh,
I'm going to take that break.

791
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,247
Call me if you need anything.

792
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:31,327
<i>Every surgery
is an act of hubris.</i>

793
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,777
<i>You open a body knowing
you can make it better.</i>

794
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,737
37 degrees Celsius,

795
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,847
and her heart hasn't
restarted yet.

796
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,987
Why hasn't it restarted?

797
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:41,467
V-fib.
We need to shock it.

798
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:46,307
Charge to 100.

799
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:52,038
Clear.

800
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:55,448
Alright,
let's charge to 200.

801
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,077
Clear.

802
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,487
It should be working.

803
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:02,666
Why isn't it working?

804
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,356
Again.

805
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:05,807
I said again.

806
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,666
Clear.

807
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,677
â™ª Trust we lose

808
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:20,547
â™ª Reach for hands

809
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:22,687
â™ª To pull me through

810
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:29,937
<i>On our best days, surgeons
decide our patients' fate.</i>

811
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,937
Hey, how did your talk
with Bailey go?

812
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,146
What are you doing?

813
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:37,217
Mika.

814
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,457
Mika,
please don't do this.

815
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,737
Please.
Let's just talk about this.

816
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:43,396
â™ª On the inside of my skin

817
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,396
I'm so sorry.

818
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:55,507
â™ª Ohhhh

819
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:58,376
â™ª Oh, ohhhhh

820
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:28,787
â™ª Waters rise but can't erase

821
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:30,547
<i>It can make you feel
invincible,</i>

822
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:31,857
<i>like you can do no wrong.</i>

823
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,757
Hey.
Still no tow truck?

824
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:36,136
Eight people ahead of me.

825
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,797
I'm going to be here
till winter.

826
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:40,007
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

827
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:41,767
You know who's not, though?

828
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:42,968
My kids.

829
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:44,797
I told my ex
I can't get them today,

830
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:46,767
and he booked a fancy lake house
for the weekend.

831
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:48,567
So I either go
and get them tomorrow

832
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:49,768
and ruin their vacation,

833
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:52,156
or I don't see them
for a few days.

834
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:54,778
He's always the hero,
and I'm just...

835
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,718
...crying in public,
which, apparently, I do now.

836
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,718
Come on. I'll give you
a ride back to your hotel.

837
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,067
- Don't you have to work?
- If they need me,

838
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,417
they can, you know,
send out the Bat-Signal.

839
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,106
â™ª Ohhhh

840
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:17,317
â™ª Oh, ohhhh

841
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,077
What did you say
to Mika?

842
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:21,217
â™ª Forgiveness

843
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:24,427
I told her
to make the best decision

844
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:26,497
for herself
and her family.

845
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,156
And now she's leaving
for good.

846
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:31,227
She needs our support.

847
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:33,156
Support?

848
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:37,098
You let her go like
she meant nothing to you.

849
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,858
<i>But inevitably,
our hubris catches up with us.</i>

850
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:49,068
<i>In those awful moments,
we're left with nothing</i>

851
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:51,217
<i>but the wreckage
of our shattered egos.</i>

852
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:57,288
When are you do?

853
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:01,537
It's okay.
You can tell me.

854
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:02,847
When are you do?

855
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,337
- Leave them alone.
- Leave them alone.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

856
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:12,197
What do you think
you're going to do with that?

857
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,856
Put that down, Gladys.
- Put it down.
- Mnh-mnh.

858
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,827
Put it... Hey, sit down.
Don't move, Gladys.

859
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,138
Don't move.

860
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,177
