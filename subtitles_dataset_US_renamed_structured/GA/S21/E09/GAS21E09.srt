1
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:05,553
In a rare instance

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,058
when a patient died while
hooked up to brain monitors,

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,479
doctors saw an increase
in brain activity

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,609
right before
and after his heart stopped.

5
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:30,102
Call 911.

6
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:35,905
Come on.

7
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,090
911. What's your emergency?

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,887
The brain waves that surged
were associated with dreaming,

9
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,977
information processing,
and memory recall.

10
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,106
Push another epi.
Please, Jackie.

11
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:57,489
Still nothing.

12
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,078
Someone get me a T.E.E.
right now.

13
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,378
It confirms what we often hear

14
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,384
when we revive a patient
in cardiac arrest --

15
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,305
that right before
their heart stopped,

16
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,434
they saw their life flash
before their eyes.

17
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,396
After everything
we've been through,

18
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,359
I thought this was
impossible.

19
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,570
Me too.

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,408
Not that I remember it all,
but...

21
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:31,474
Mm...

22
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,478
E.R.
I have to go.

23
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:36,693
Can you stay?

24
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:38,196
I'll look for you
as soon as I can.

25
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,991
I have nowhere else
to be.

26
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:54,311
Bailey,
have you seen Yasuda?

27
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,525
I paged her 10 minutes ago.
Nothing.

28
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,656
That's because she doesn't
work here anymore.

29
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,202
She quit the program.
What happened?

30
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,749
Just being back here
where her sister died,

31
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,169
it was too hard.

32
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,465
It's unthinkable.

33
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:10,553
I wish there was more
I could've done to help her.

34
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,559
Oh. She's tough.
She'll -- She'll find a way.

35
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,353
I'm not so sure
about the others.

36
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:17,984
Millin isn't handling it
very well.

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,407
First year of residency, your
fellow interns are all you got.

38
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,579
I'll keep an eye on her.
Thank you.

39
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,593
Thought we were closed
to trauma.

40
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,639
Bring it in.
Bring it in this way.

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,726
All right. Hold up right there.
Watch yourself. Watch yourself.

42
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:36,395
Watch your backs, folks.
Watch your backs.

43
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:37,816
Make room
for the emergency vehicles.

44
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,736
What the hell happened?

45
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,197
Warren left us open
to trauma,

46
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:42,867
so you're looking at
the consequences.

47
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,788
I was going to set up
an additional triage tent,

48
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,625
and then I was gonna
come up with some workarounds.

49
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,963
I was chief of staff
at the Army Medical Command.

50
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:51,802
This is not a workaround.
This is a fireable offense.

51
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,348
So if you get the urge
to make another decision

52
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,935
without consulting me,
don't.

53
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,312
This is Altman.
Go ahead.

54
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,398
What did you do?

55
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,277
Not the time.
Ben!

56
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:03,742
All right. That's the last one.
We are closing to trauma!

57
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:06,455
Adams!

58
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:08,084
I'm okay.
It's not all time.

59
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,504
Jo Wilson, 38-year-old female.

60
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:10,715
Wilson?
Jo?

61
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,885
I'm gonna have to call you back.

62
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,889
What happened?
Got a gunshot wound
over here.

63
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,102
Yeah. His name is Damian.
28-year-old male.

64
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,772
GSW to the right chest.
No exit wound.

65
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,358
Intubated on the scene.
He was with you?

66
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,945
He held up the store.

67
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:25,201
All right. I'll go.
Stay with Wilson.

68
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,289
Let's get her inside.
She's bleeding.

69
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,126
You were shot?

70
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,673
No.
I...I'm pregnant.

71
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,723
I got you.

72
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:46,452
I really appreciate you
taking me to my hotel.

73
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,289
I know they need you
at the hospital.

74
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,212
Teddy hired a bunch
of outside doctors to pitch in.

75
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,926
She has plenty of help.

76
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,138
I can't believe
you still drive a truck.

77
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:59,395
What was it you used to drive?
An old Silverado?

78
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,650
I just remember it took up
two parking spaces.

79
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,071
Yeah, and it didn't go
over 45 miles an hour.

80
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:05,866
And only one
of the handles worked.

81
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,787
It was not what you would call
a chick magnet.

82
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,624
You could have driven
an RV,

83
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,962
and I would have thought it was
the sexiest truck on earth.

84
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,507
You hated me.

85
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:16,095
I was madly in love with you.
I thought you knew.

86
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,391
Hold on.

87
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,232
Okay.
You were mean to me.

88
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,069
You were my best friend's
older brother,

89
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,823
and I was a teenage girl

90
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,618
who didn't know
how to tell a boy I liked him.

91
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,455
W-Wow.

92
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,710
Are you okay?

93
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,048
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's just, um...

94
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,854
It's pain where I had
the surgery.

95
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,773
It happens sometimes.
You had the surgery
weeks ago.

96
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,337
I'm running you back
to the hospital.

97
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:40,686
No, no. That's not necessary.

98
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:43,483
Any amount of pain
could indicate a complication.

99
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,401
We're not taking
any chances.

100
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,328
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

101
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,040
It's 108 degrees.

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,835
The sun is out.

103
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,756
Everyone's working together
towards a common goal.

104
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,885
Mika quit.

105
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,014
What?
Why?

106
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:04,149
Well, her sister died here,
and she almost died,

107
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:05,986
and I think she wasn't
into the weather,

108
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:08,157
but that's just
an observation.

109
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,120
You okay?
You two were close.

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,915
I didn't come here
to make lifelong friends.

111
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,627
Did you?

112
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,380
No.

113
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,971
People come and go,
and I still have a job to do.

114
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,570
Do you see anything?
What's going on?

115
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,615
Why won't her heart start?
Ndugu?

116
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,368
Right there.

117
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:32,414
The aortic root aneurysm
dissected and extended down,

118
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:34,042
occluding the left
coronary artery.

119
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,172
The blockage is keeping
her heart from starting?

120
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:38,635
It's the tear.
Caused a massive infarction.

121
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,681
We need to revascularize
her coronary artery

122
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,727
to restore blood flow,
then put in an aortic graft.

123
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,396
Let's prep
for a sternotomy.

124
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,025
I know you wanted to take care
of this first,

125
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,653
but I maintain
that this was the right call.

126
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:48,947
She could have dissected
no matter what.

127
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,116
At least she did it
in the safest place,

128
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,620
where we can treat it.

129
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,372
An aortic dissection
is never safe.

130
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:54,584
Jackie's already been under
for hours.

131
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,170
We need to move faster.
Let's go.

132
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,424
Dr. Shepherd?
Whatever it is,
it's got to wait.

133
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,347
It's Dr. Adams.
He wants you to know he's okay.

134
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,396
Get us up to speed.

135
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:07,359
Single GSW
to the right chest.

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,321
No exit wound.
He's hypoxic.

137
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,866
He has a right hemothorax.

138
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,496
His FAST exam on his heart
was negative.

139
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,166
We need to prep
for a chest tube.

140
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,379
Okay. Bullet fragments are
localized on the right chest.

141
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,385
Let's order a type and cross
and trauma panel.

142
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:22,222
Can I do the chest tube?
Get her sterile gloves.

143
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:24,309
His sats are dropping,
so we need to move quickly.

144
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,940
I bet when he walked out
of the house with a gun today,

145
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,276
he didn't expect to be the one
getting shot.

146
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,904
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

147
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,365
All right.
You're gonna make an incision

148
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:34,288
between the fourth
and fifth rib space.

149
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,131
Now you're gonna pop through
the pleura.

150
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,093
Mm-hmm.
Good.

151
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:44,016
And now dilate
by opening the clamp.

152
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,476
Time for the tube.

153
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:48,190
Yeah.
Keep going.

154
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,365
All right.
He's putting out a lot of blood.

155
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,244
We need to call up to the O.R.

156
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,708
Nice work, Millin.

157
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:01,091
BP's 105 over 65.

158
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,972
That's...good.
Uh, how many weeks are you?

159
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,893
Sixteen weeks.

160
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,355
I, uh, had an appointment a week
ago, and everything looked fine.

161
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:09,901
Have you paged O.B.?

162
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,905
I can do it.
No, you will not.

163
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:14,409
You will get yourself checked.
Dr. Warren?

164
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,662
Come on. You heard her.
Let's go.

165
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:17,499
No. I-I was just grazed.
It can wait.

166
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:18,668
Do you think
your colleague

167
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,421
wants you to see me do
her ultrasound?

168
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,883
No.
Go. Now.

169
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,096
Don't let him out of your sight.
W-Wait. Adams.

170
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,225
Thank you.

171
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,939
Come on.
Let's go.

172
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,360
Bailey, I need to see
for myself.

173
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,824
You are not your doctor.

174
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,702
Okay?
We paged O.B.

175
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,080
In the meantime...
hmm.

176
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,259
All right.
The placenta looks great.

177
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,261
All right.
No abruption.

178
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:45,681
And where is the...

179
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,981
We have a strong heartbeat
right there.

180
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,943
Mm.

181
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:52,945
What about the other one?

182
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,116
There's an "other one"?

183
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,707
Okay.
Let me see.

184
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,215
Oh!
There it is!

185
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,721
Oh, beautiful.

186
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:08,894
Just these two,
right?

187
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:11,774
As far as I'm aware, yeah.

188
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,945
You okay?

189
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:16,241
Mm.

190
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:18,204
Nope. Okay.
Aah!

191
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,458
All right.
Someone help me get her to O.B.

192
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,378
And where's Lincoln?

193
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,508
All right.
Hold on.

194
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,735
We were finishing a surgery.
Are you okay?

195
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:35,822
It's just superficial abrasions.

196
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:37,283
Steri-Strips and I'm good.

197
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,037
And I've got psych coming down
for an eval.

198
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:41,208
Yeah. I don't need that.
Yeah. Well, hospital policy.

199
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,087
You have to be cleared
before you can go back to work.

200
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,297
No. I know it's important.
You got to process.

201
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:45,466
Have you called your mom?
Do you want me to call her?

202
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:46,719
I really do not.

203
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,515
Oh, they just extubated
Jackie.

204
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,393
Go check on your patient,
all right?

205
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:52,648
There's already too many people
standing around this bed.

206
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:54,192
All right.

207
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,531
You stay with him.
Kwan can cover post-op.

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,954
Okay.
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Davis to Cardiology.

209
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,290
Dr. Elizabeth Davis
to Cardiology.

210
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,466
And, uh, I also have to go
check on...something.

211
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,149
What happened?

212
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,529
Wilson and I went to the
convenience store to get ice.

213
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,906
A guy tried to rob it.

214
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:20,077
I got lucky.
He's on his way up to the O.R.

215
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,125
Thank God you're okay.

216
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:31,391
Griffith, I need you
to help Millin

217
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,312
transport this patient
up to the O.R.

218
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:34,815
That's him.

219
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,984
That's...

220
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,529
No.
I c-- No.

221
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,533
Y-Yeah. You can.
He's just another patient.

222
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,161
Except he tried to
shoot you.
But he didn't.

223
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,833
Just another patient.
Mm.

224
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,883
I have to do a consult.

225
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,427
Have him prepped by the time
I get up there.

226
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,972
Chief, I'm on
Ndugu's service --

227
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,976
It's all hands on deck.

228
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,272
And if he's got a problem with
that, frankly, I don't care.

229
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,877
So, Dr. Marcus is
on his way.

230
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:10,177
No. Absolutely not.
Literally anybody else.

231
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,225
Uh, well, DeLuca is in Italy.

232
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:16,106
Patel's on leave.
Kincade's in the O.R.

233
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:18,193
Isn't, um, Dr. Marcus
the chief O.B. resident?

234
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,572
It doesn't matter!

235
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,491
He's not taking a trip
down there.

236
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:25,709
Okay. I know it can be difficult
to be the patient

237
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,796
with someone
you usually work with.

238
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:29,884
But you need somebody
in h--

239
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,929
Wilson! God.
I-I just heard what happened.

240
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:32,931
Are you okay?

241
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,186
You're...
Marcus?

242
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,856
Yes.
I finished med school.

243
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:38,275
Undergrad only took me
two years.

244
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,486
It's Bailey, right?

245
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:44,496
Wow! Twins?
It's a party.

246
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:46,291
So, based on
the initial workup,

247
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,920
it's likely stress
that's causing the bleeding.

248
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,590
Okay. Okay.
That's good.

249
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,428
That's good.
She's also having
acute back pain.

250
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,681
Wilson, next steps?

251
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,685
Kidding.

252
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,482
Uh, pain and bleeding could also
indicate other complications,

253
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,985
so I'd like to --

254
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,488
I was just getting
the kids settled.

255
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,075
I came as fast
as I could.

256
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,412
It's okay.
I'm okay.

257
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:06,999
What about the bleeding?

258
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,922
It's slowed down, but I'm --
I'm feeling heaviness below.

259
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,343
I'd like to do
a pelvic ultrasound.

260
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:14,598
I'm assuming
you're dad.

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,938
So let's give them
a minute.

262
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,357
Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,319
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Rolfe to the O.R.

264
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,156
Dr. Emma Rolfe
to the O.R.

265
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:25,745
No. You're right there.
Hey.
Do you need a minute or...

266
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,749
My son is throwing
a tantrum,

267
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,004
and my ex wants me
to calm him down.

268
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,549
Tell me you have
good news.

269
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,427
Well, your EKG is normal,

270
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,180
but your white blood cell count
is elevated,

271
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,726
which means --
I know what that means.

272
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:38,145
Last time, I needed surgery.
Is that what's happening?

273
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,190
Do I have to go through this
all over again?

274
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,615
Could just be a mild infection
or even stress or dehydration.

275
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,746
Let's not worry until there's
something to worry about, okay?

276
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:47,748
Hey.
What's happening?

277
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,459
Uh, just some chest pains

278
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,589
and hopefully a disproportionate
amount of anxiety.

279
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,383
Her EKG's normal,

280
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:56,181
but she has leukocytosis,
and she is slightly febrile.

281
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:57,726
We're still waiting on
blood cultures.

282
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,103
All right.
Let's admit her.

283
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,649
Start her on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

284
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,613
Get a chest X-ray
and CT with contrast.

285
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:05,074
Is now a good time to worry?

286
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,702
It's just --
It's been such a day.

287
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,121
You know what?
Why don't you go with her?

288
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:09,541
I can get Cass to come down
and help out.

289
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,504
It'll help with the scans going
much quicker if you're there.

290
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,173
Okay. As long as you and Beckman
have it covered.

291
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,467
Yeah.
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Aranda to the E.R.

292
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,139
Dr. Angie Aranda to the E.R.

293
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,477
Yes.

294
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:22,734
No.
I know.

295
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:25,907
No.
I-I do still love you.

296
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:27,703
I just --
I just needed some space

297
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,915
and like a minute away
from school.

298
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,669
I'll --
I'll call you tomorrow.

299
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:33,923
Dave?

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,142
Uh, yeah.
He called like eight times.

301
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,438
I had to pick up.

302
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:43,526
I just --
I didn't know what to say.

303
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,195
I didn't want him to know
that I was here, so I just --

304
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,118
I just tried to pretend
like everything was normal.

305
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:49,328
It's -- It's fine.

306
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:50,540
It's anything but fine.

307
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,130
I didn't think this through.
And you're slammed.

308
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,508
I-I shouldn't have just
showed up out of nowhere.

309
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,011
No, no.
It's really okay.

310
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,973
At some point,
I need to give Dave an answer.

311
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,144
It's not his fault
that this is...

312
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:03,983
...this is what it is.

313
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,406
I really need to answer this,

314
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:10,663
but I want a chance
to talk about this.

315
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,166
Hang out at my place,

316
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,922
and we'll talk all about this
tonight.

317
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:17,969
If you need to go home,
you'll go home.

318
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:32,582
I'll never understand

319
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:35,045
how a person can point
a loaded gun at a stranger.

320
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,511
Well, people can hurt each other
in all kinds of ways.

321
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,974
I'm sure it's killing Yasuda
having to leave you --

322
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,393
Don't.
Sorry.

323
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,272
I didn't mean to bring it up.

324
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:45,817
When you want to talk about it,
we will talk about it.

325
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,444
I won't be talking about it
with you.

326
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,490
Did I do something?
I'm just sick of pretending

327
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,286
like we all mean something
to each other.

328
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,206
I get that interning here
is hard

329
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,795
and that we're all
trauma-bonded or whatever,

330
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,507
But we're just co-workers.

331
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:02,726
I don't need you to comfort me
or to understand how I feel.

332
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,521
I can take care of myself.

333
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,482
I've been doing it
my entire life.

334
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,571
How's it going in here?

335
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:10,324
Fine.
Great.

336
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,050
He's about to code.
All right.

337
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,179
Griffith, strap him in.
Millin, prep him.

338
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,561
Can you grab the other side
of the belt?

339
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,481
Yeah, I got it.

340
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,151
Did anybody contact the
blood bank to activate the MTP?

341
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,988
Uh, I'm not sure.
I can check it.

342
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,659
You are the intern
on this case.

343
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,411
You need to make sure you are
on top of the orders.

344
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:35,959
I'll do it right now.

345
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,839
All right.
He can't wait.

346
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:39,925
Okay.
We need to scrub in right now.

347
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,595
Yeah.

348
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,189
I was able to successfully
clip the posterior aneurysm,

349
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,818
but we ran into
a complication

350
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,655
when we tried to
wean her off bypass.

351
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:53,661
Uh, so what happened?

352
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,959
Jackie's stable, but
she had an aortic dissection,

353
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,713
which caused
a heart attack.

354
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,802
My 17-year-old
had a heart attack?

355
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,931
I opened her chest,
and I put in a graft.

356
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,518
And thankfully,
she's an athlete,

357
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:09,442
so her heart was able
to recover from the M.I.

358
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,695
I-I don't understand.

359
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,158
Why do these complications
keep happening?

360
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,953
Well, we knew her heart
was at risk

361
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,247
due to the root aneurysm.

362
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,542
Her brain was at
greater risk.

363
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,253
At the time.

364
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,550
Her post-op labs came in.
Thank you, Dr. Kwan.

365
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,639
How long does
the anesthesia last?

366
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,227
Hey, baby.

367
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,446
You still feeling groggy?

368
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:34,283
In my feet.

369
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,578
Your feet?

370
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,372
And my legs.

371
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:40,212
Dr. Kwan, would you get me
a needle, please?
Yeah.

372
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:48,311
All right. Jackie, let me know
when you start to feel this.

373
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,948
Did you start yet?

374
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,582
Why can't she feel
her legs?

375
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,650
There's no written rule
on it,

376
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,654
but people usually stand
on the other side

377
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,575
during a pelvic exam
to respect the area.

378
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,202
Right.
Sorry.

379
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:19,624
I need you to relax,
Wilson.

380
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,503
Okay.

381
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,799
You heard about Kincade's
uterine sarcoma case?

382
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,220
Poor woman's
second recurrence.

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,308
She's got four kids
and a death sentence.

384
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,312
You should see the scans.
They're awful.

385
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,439
Honestly,
it's like a horror movie.

386
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,151
Puppies.

387
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,698
Mm. They're adorable!
And calming.

388
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,451
I'm thinking about getting one
for Pru.

389
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:41,375
So, your cervix
is at 18 millimeters.

390
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,674
So an imminent risk
for preterm labor.

391
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,260
But you're just 16 weeks.

392
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,722
She's 16 weeks.

393
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,686
Which is why I'd recommend
a cervical cerclage.

394
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,690
It's placing a suture around
the cervix to keep it closed.

395
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,859
He's a doctor.

396
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,322
Oh!
Hospital babies.

397
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:59,078
Are you gonna name them
Grey and Sloan?

398
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:00,413
Just...

399
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,376
What are the risks
of the cerclage?

400
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,004
Um, well,
I could get an infection.

401
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,549
Or it could cause damage
to my cervix,

402
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,762
like, um, scarring
or stenosis.

403
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:09,933
Other options, please?

404
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,064
This is the option besides
terminating the pregnancy.

405
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:17,239
Cervical cerclage is very safe,
and it is the absolute best way

406
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,368
to preserve the health of Dr.
Wilson and the babies right now.

407
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:22,249
But if you'd like, I could give
you some time to think about it.

408
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,546
No. Give me the consent forms.
That'd be great. Thanks.

409
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,607
My 4-year-old listens
better than you do.

410
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:36,737
Yeah. Well, unless your toddler
is also a surgeon

411
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,239
during a record-breaking
heatwave,

412
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,826
I don't think that's
a fair comparison.

413
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,454
You shouldn't be
seeing patients.

414
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:44,043
I'm still on the schedule,
and the E.R. is over capacity.

415
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,796
Okay.
Let me rephrase.

416
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,341
I can't let you treat patients
right now.

417
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:49,345
I'm fine, all right?

418
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:50,848
I see life and death
every single day.

419
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,184
Business as usual.

420
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,687
All right. You know what?
Fine.

421
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,650
If you want a job to do,
why don't you head over

422
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,779
to the clinic and help out
with the cooling center?

423
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:02,120
Mrs. Long in bed 6
needs more stool softener.

424
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,876
Uh...

425
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,838
Do you see anything?

426
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:07,882
Not yet.

427
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:09,844
You championed me.

428
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,807
What?

429
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,729
You told Sky I could do this.
You told me I could do this.

430
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,273
Now I'm sitting here,
silently panicking

431
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:18,111
about what I've done
to this young woman,

432
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,407
and you're hardly saying a word.
You don't think I'm panicking?

433
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,411
You're not the only one
who operated on her.

434
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,791
I should have said no. From
the second you brought me in,

435
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,129
I had a bad feeling about this.
Why didn't you say anything?

436
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,882
Because you prematurely
accepted the case.

437
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:30,803
You knew it had a
cardiothoracic component to it,

438
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:32,932
but you accepted it
before getting my opinion on it.

439
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,519
She was admitted
before I even saw her.

440
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,648
No. No.
Do not put this on me.

441
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,612
You could have said no right
after you walked out the door.

442
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,742
Maybe you didn't because
of how you treated her mother.

443
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,415
Nurse Connie said
a cold front coming in.

444
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,960
The heat should break
soon.

445
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,381
At least there's that.

446
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,845
Scans are up.
Kwan, what do you see?

447
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,813
Uh, head CT is negative
for stroke.

448
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,988
But the CTA shows
the dissection flap propagating

449
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,533
into the descending aorta,
which means...

450
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,831
Blood flow to the spinal cord
is compromised.

451
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,217
I think it's...

452
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,889
Okay.
Is this...this the way?

453
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,225
Hey.

454
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,103
Radiology's a little
backed up.

455
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:18,481
We'll get you in there
as soon as we can.

456
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,609
You don't have to
babysit me.

457
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,362
Remember how annoyed
you would get

458
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,491
when your mom would make you
watch me and Megan

459
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,621
when she went to the store?
But that was a chore.
This is...

460
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,957
An excuse?

461
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,877
You made that face earlier
with Teddy.

462
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,213
What face?

463
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:32,175
I thought I sensed
some tension.

464
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:36,350
Um, sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

465
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,439
I-I think my surgical
complications removed my filter.

466
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,778
Or maybe it was my divorce
or -- I don't know. Sorry.

467
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:45,578
It's fine. Marriage is...
Marriage is complicated.

468
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,455
But I can't let this happen
any longer.

469
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,001
Are you trying to go up
or down?
Up.

470
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,546
Up?
Okay.

471
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:53,050
Damsel in distress.
I hate myself.

472
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,428
Don't -- Yeah. Yeah.
There.

473
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:59,731
Oh.
There.

474
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,150
Hi.

475
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,737
Hi.

476
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,957
Um, radiology's ready
for you.

477
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,959
So, um...
Oh.

478
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,299
...I'll go find an orderly,
okay?

479
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,386
Okay. Good idea.
Yeah.

480
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,687
Why don't we just first
start you on progesterone

481
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,566
and increase
your monitoring?

482
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,737
Why can't you trust that
I'm making the right decision?

483
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,574
I'm a pregnant OB-GYN.

484
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,912
I want a cerclage.
I'm getting a cerclage.

485
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:30,208
Well, you can't just wave your
specialty in front of my face

486
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,836
every time we have
a disagreement.

487
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,590
I've done hundreds of these!
I do them all the time.

488
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,385
But you don't get them
all the time.

489
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,638
What about Marcus?
How many has he done?

490
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:37,807
Should we be waiting
for somebody

491
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,267
born before TikTok?

492
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,562
He's in my year.

493
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,817
I have T-shirts
older than him.

494
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:44,529
Link --
Okay.
Our heart rate's elevated.

495
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,616
Um, maybe some deep breaths.

496
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,411
God.
I wish Dr. DeLuca was here.

497
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:50,958
First of all, I would never have
had Marcus' hands inside of me.

498
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,755
And second of all, she would
tell you how safe a cerclage is.

499
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:56,301
Maybe she could tell you that
this isn't just your decision.

500
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:58,515
She would never
tell me that.

501
00:20:58,515 --> 00:20:59,892
Are you thinking clearly?

502
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,228
What?

503
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:02,439
You witnessed a shooting
today.

504
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,650
You could have been
seriously hurt.

505
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,738
Okay.
Time out.

506
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,159
Okay. You are now the one
who is seriously hurting her.

507
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,455
Her B.P. is 140 over 90,

508
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:13,461
and that's too damn high
for her and for me.

509
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,551
Add to that
an 18-millimeter cervix,

510
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,389
and you are tripling
her chances for contractions!

511
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,391
Take a walk.

512
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:21,519
Okay. I'm sorry.
It's just --

513
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,772
I am not asking.

514
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,445
Look at me.

515
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:27,823
In.

516
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,744
And out.

517
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,829
Good.

518
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:32,332
In.

519
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,627
Out.

520
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,551
I've exposed
the damaged tissue.

521
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,597
He's gonna lose an entire lobe
of his lung

522
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:40,682
due to one bullet.

523
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,102
GIA stapler.

524
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,356
His bullet that he loaded
into his gun.

525
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,653
We should invite the lawmakers
voting against background checks

526
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,364
to assist
on these surgeries.

527
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,869
Violent crime rises
along with the temperature.

528
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,748
Read a story about a guy
who drove his truck

529
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,836
into a hardware store
during a heat wave

530
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:56,296
and killed four people.

531
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:57,967
There's some bleeding
at the staple line.

532
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,471
All right.
2-0 PDS.

533
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:03,477
Thank you.

534
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,314
Damn it.
I can't get visualization.

535
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,734
Suction.

536
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,362
No.

537
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,824
All right.
Griffith, Millin, what do we do?

538
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:11,368
Tilt the table.
Tilt it more.

539
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:13,372
Exactly. All right, team.
You heard them.

540
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,042
Anesthesia, when you're ready.

541
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,338
Oh, my God.

542
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:18,633
Why is he moving?

543
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,179
All right! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

544
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,602
Watch his line!
Secure airways and lines!

545
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,438
Page some orderlies!

546
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:28,110
Let's assess him and get him
back on the table right now!

547
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,376
Gently. Gently.

548
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:38,548
Let's keep him on the ambu until
we get him back on the table.

549
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:39,717
Where are those orderlies?

550
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,219
Damn it.
His central line has come out.

551
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:42,640
All right.
Shut off all the lines.

552
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,602
Got it.
Lap sponge.

553
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:46,021
All right.
Keep pressure on his I.J.

554
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,275
Should we pack the thoracotomy?
No. Here you go.

555
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:51,490
All right.
Millin, get me a wet towel.

556
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,285
Millin!

557
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,041
All right.
Take this.

558
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,170
How the hell
did this happen?

559
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,634
He must not have been
completely strapped in.
Millin, hold here.

560
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,763
If your wife finds out, she's
gonna fire me all over again.

561
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:03,848
Keep applying pressure.

562
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,101
Bring in the orderlies.

563
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:06,938
Come on, fellas.

564
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:09,568
We're gonna carefully lift him
back on the table.

565
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,365
Everyone set?
On my count.

566
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:14,829
One. Two. Three.

567
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:18,503
You want to puncture
her spine?

568
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:21,049
We place a small tube
in Jackie's lower back

569
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,722
to drain the excess fluid
around her spinal cord.

570
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:27,145
There is a chance that it could
reverse Jackie's paralysis.

571
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,898
This morning, you assured us

572
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:30,819
that you could take care
of her aneurysms.

573
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:33,323
You seemed...
so certain about it.

574
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,119
That was before I saw
the larger aneurysm.

575
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,998
She is my only child.

576
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,335
When did you know
that this was going south?

577
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,091
Was it when you had to open
her skull?

578
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,095
Or when you had to stop
her heart?

579
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,768
Or when you noticed there was
something wrong with her spine?

580
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:47,978
Sky...
I mean, I-I need to know.

581
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,565
I need to know.

582
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,778
Did you ever think
that you could save my child?

583
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,865
Or was I just a fool
for believing it?

584
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,911
I did think that I could save
your child.

585
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,499
And she is alive
and aneurysm-free.

586
00:23:58,499 --> 00:23:59,794
I do not make
false promises

587
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:01,672
because I have seen
too many bad outcomes.

588
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:03,718
This is not
a bad outcome.

589
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:05,304
Not yet.
You trusted me once.

590
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,601
Trust me again.
We have to act fast.

591
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,447
Okay.

592
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:16,034
I will trust you --

593
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:19,124
mostly because I
don't have any other option.

594
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,100
All right.

595
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,687
Her BP has settled down.

596
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:31,273
What do you think
you're doing?

597
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,318
Jo clearly doesn't want me
in the room.

598
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,868
Neither do you, so I thought I'd
help with an ex-fix in O.R. 3.

599
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,663
Well, you thought wrong.

600
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:40,584
W-What the hell am I
supposed to think, then?

601
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:44,884
Ever since we found out
it was twins, Jo has...

602
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,554
She's shut me out.

603
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,307
And I-I'm usually pretty good
at carrying on,

604
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:49,518
but today I can't.

605
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:52,273
Come here.

606
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:02,418
When I was in labor
with my son,

607
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,759
his father was getting
emergent brain surgery.

608
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,263
Now, I initially
didn't know about it

609
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:12,063
because my O.B.
never let it show on her face.

610
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:16,739
She knew that I was
at my most vulnerable,

611
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:19,494
and she supported me
with a strength

612
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:22,166
that I will never forget.

613
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:26,592
Jo has to do that
on a daily basis.

614
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:31,268
She treats those at their
most vulnerable and stays calm.

615
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:35,025
Right? They could be bleeding
or have a prolapsed cord.

616
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:40,912
She stays strong and encouraging
because that's her job.

617
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:44,085
But today...
it should be yours.

618
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:48,093
She's terrified.

619
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:51,642
So pull yourself together...
so she can fall apart.

620
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,704
Okay.
Central line's back in.

621
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:04,083
There's no signs of bleeding
or expanding hematoma.

622
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,920
Well, there's some bleeding
from the intercostals.

623
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,214
Probably from the fall.

624
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:08,968
2-0 silk.

625
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,807
I gave you
specific instructions

626
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:14,228
to strap the patient in
on the table.

627
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,232
Now's not the time.
Let me finish.

628
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:19,030
Your mistake was
extremely dangerous

629
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,034
and completely
unacceptable.

630
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:23,121
We give our patients
the very best care

631
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,583
that we are capable
of giving,

632
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,380
no matter who the patient is
or what he has done.

633
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,760
And if we can't,
then we leave

634
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,766
before our personal
distractions kill someone.

635
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,227
I should kick you out
of this O.R.

636
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:35,897
But instead, I'm gonna make
you stand there

637
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:37,984
and watch
these repairs,

638
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,905
which shouldn't even be
happening in the first place.

639
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:40,782
Am I clear?

640
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:53,265
Hey.
Yeah.

641
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,770
Once the temperature started
to drop, people started leaving.

642
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,858
Do you know
where the fans go?

643
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:59,903
You've worked here
longer than me.

644
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,450
So you don't know where they
keep the extra ice packs?

645
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,621
Just pack it up. You know,
someone will figure it out.

646
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,665
Who?

647
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,544
Don't ask
or it'll be you.

648
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,846
Don't move!

649
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:16,478
I hope we don't have
another heat dome anytime soon.

650
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:18,064
That's probably just
wishful thinking at this point.

651
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,486
But...
Adams?

652
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:22,072
Adams?

653
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,035
Okay. Okay.

654
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,622
All right.
Come here.

655
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,374
Come here.
Come here.

656
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:30,130
Just take a seat.
Take a seat.

657
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,806
Hey.
Feel the ground under your feet?

658
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:36,977
Do you feel the ground
under your feet?

659
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:39,273
Good. Good.
Then just keep looking at me.

660
00:27:39,273 --> 00:27:40,568
Keep looking at me
right here.

661
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:44,785
You're in the clinic.
You're not alone.

662
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:47,541
And you're safe.

663
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,377
You are safe.

664
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:54,972
Yeah.
Just breathe.

665
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:15,684
I just came down to say
a prayer, and...

666
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:18,230
I can't get
the words out.

667
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,609
May I?

668
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,736
Yeah.

669
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:33,511
Yeah. Jackie's always been
so full of life.

670
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,058
Seeing her in that bed
just...

671
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:38,395
It just breaks my heart.

672
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:43,155
She's strong
and resilient.

673
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:48,040
Whatever happens, she'll keep
kicking ass and taking names.

674
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,712
There's no doubt in my mind.

675
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:52,340
Yeah.

676
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,056
I'm not
a very observant Jew,

677
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:58,770
but I've always been
so moved

678
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,110
watching people stand
during services

679
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,449
and give a mi shebeirach
for their loved ones.

680
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,583
It's the prayer
for healing.

681
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:13,382
It's a mouthful.
I know.

682
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,010
It sounds beautiful.

683
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:26,951
Mi shebeirach avoteinu --

684
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:31,919
Avraham, Yitzchak,
v'Yaakov,

685
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,468
v'imoteiu -- Sarah...

686
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:42,775
You okay?

687
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,862
Can't feel a thing, so no.

688
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:46,448
We're hoping
to change that.

689
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,327
All right.
I'm going to insert the drain.

690
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:50,247
My mom's scared that this
is gonna make things worse.

691
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,376
She tries to act all cool
around me,

692
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,382
but deep down,
I know she worries.

693
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:57,428
Are you scared?
Not really.

694
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,184
I was scared at first
when I got diagnosed.

695
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,687
But now?
I don't know.

696
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,398
I feel like if I think too much
about it,

697
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,319
I'll be too scared
to do anything.

698
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,244
Kind of like what Coach says
about overthinking free throws.

699
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,666
You just got to shoot
your shot.

700
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,212
All right. The drain is in.

701
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,299
I'll let you rest,
and I will check back in a bit.

702
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,596
Cool. If I'm not here
when you get back,

703
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:21,268
it's 'cause it worked
and I walked away.

704
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:27,488
Here you go.

705
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,539
Sorry.
Uh, that was embarrassing.

706
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,417
No apologies necessary.

707
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,214
Yeah. I'm not really a...
feelings guy.

708
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:39,137
Yeah. No kidding.

709
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:44,314
I can't tell if I'm enraged
or...sad or freaked out.

710
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,694
Probably all the above.

711
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:48,656
There's no one way to feel
about this sort of thing.

712
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,994
So what do I do?
As far as I know,
there's no rulebook.

713
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:53,248
But I know
where you can start.

714
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:55,879
Yeah. You want to page psych
or should I?

715
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,342
I'll do it.
When I feel ready.

716
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:01,891
All right.

717
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,521
But in the meantime,
back to work.

718
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,525
Really?

719
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,738
Yeah. You had a panic attack,
not a heart attack.

720
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:10,575
I'll tell you what.
I'll, uh...

721
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:12,621
I'll figure out where all this
stuff goes so you don't have to.

722
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,667
Thank you.

723
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,553
Hey.

724
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:28,861
Is that for good behavior
or for you to soften the blow

725
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,615
for whatever
you're about to tell me?

726
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:33,370
Your scans are reassuring.
The stent is not infected.

727
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,542
Oh, my God.
That's --

728
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:36,877
Thank you.

729
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,798
Your white count
is still elevated,

730
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:41,177
so we want to keep you in
for a few more doses

731
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:43,181
of the antibiotics,
if that's okay with you.

732
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:45,019
Yeah.
Of course.

733
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:48,358
Why do I think there's more
you want to tell me?

734
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,868
I don't think I should be
on your care team anymore.

735
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:56,249
I'm sorry.
The freshman me resurfaced.

736
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,376
Or at least the part
that had a crush

737
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,796
on her friend's
older brother.

738
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:00,257
I-I shouldn't have tried
to kiss you.

739
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:01,176
It's not only you.

740
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,432
Oh.

741
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:06,520
Yeah.

742
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:11,279
So, uh, I'll have Teddy
check in on you.

743
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,345
I'm just going to check
his vitals.

744
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:24,347
I'll be quick.

745
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,813
He's a good guy.

746
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,985
He just...is going through
some stuff.

747
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,914
We both lost our jobs.

748
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,291
And then his friend Eddie
got sick,

749
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,507
and then he just...
shut down.

750
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:43,803
He stopped hanging out
with his friends

751
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,349
and stopped talking to me.

752
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:49,982
I just -- I don't know why he
thinks he needs to do it alone.

753
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,490
Well, let's hope this is
a wake-up call.

754
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,958
I'll be back in the morning.
You should get some rest.

755
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,619
I'm getting the cerclage.

756
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,292
Good.

757
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,175
I'm sorry.

758
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,597
It's just a couple
of hours ago,

759
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,643
I found out you were involved
in a shooting.

760
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:32,399
Ten minutes later,
I'm hearing "imminent labor."

761
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,613
You know, our whole world
was in danger,

762
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,825
and I-I freaked out.

763
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:39,748
I just want to do
whatever will keep you safe

764
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,292
and whatever
keeps them safe.

765
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:46,845
If that means Marcus
and a cerclage...

766
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:48,975
If I have to get a cerclage...

767
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:51,020
Stop saying "cerclage."

768
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:56,155
I know you and I
have been...

769
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:57,324
It's been rough.

770
00:33:57,324 --> 00:34:00,623
But I just want to be here
for you.

771
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:03,086
For them.

772
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:05,508
Just tell me
what you need.

773
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:08,931
Keep Marcus from talking
during the procedure.

774
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:15,193
Okay, then.
All four of you ready for this?

775
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,031
Do you play tennis?

776
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:19,578
You'll have your own built-in
game of doubles now.

777
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:21,540
Marcus, I'm gonna need you
to keep all chatter

778
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,755
to medically relevant
information.

779
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:27,092
I love you.

780
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:28,554
I love you.

781
00:34:35,486 --> 00:34:38,912
How does the drain look?
It's draining.

782
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,458
How are you feeling?
Same as when you
last checked.

783
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,630
I'd say there go
my WNBA dreams,

784
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,717
but those were already
in the trash.

785
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:47,640
Mm, I'm guessing you'll have
new dreams to chase.

786
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,813
Maybe. But basketball
will always be my true love.

787
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:52,900
There's got to be a way
to keep it in my life.

788
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,862
Jackie, your toes
are moving.

789
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,281
They are?
Yeah.

790
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,035
Oh, my God! They are.

791
00:34:58,035 --> 00:35:00,206
Mom, look!

792
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,460
It's working!
The drain's working.

793
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,299
Cue one-hour neuro checks.
This is good.

794
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:08,097
Thank God.
Thank God you're okay.

795
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,727
Update me
on her progress.

796
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,982
You're gonna keep going,
aren't you?

797
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:14,735
Impossible cases.

798
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:17,031
Well, I'm never gonna be able
to look somebody in the eye

799
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,743
and tell them I'm not
gonna try to help them.

800
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,329
I mean,
if that's a problem for you...

801
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,250
No. I'm not scared of
a challenge, Amelia, all right?

802
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,841
I...I take in the miracle
I always have.

803
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:27,511
But what you did today
was reckless.

804
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,682
I don't do reckless.

805
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:32,228
So if you need a miracle,
okay.

806
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,316
Give me all the information
up front

807
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:35,819
or find another surgeon.

808
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:42,499
Hey.
How are you feeling?

809
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:45,296
Cerclage went well.
No complications.

810
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:48,219
Babies are still inside,
so I'll take it.

811
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,641
But, um, I-I'll need to take
a few days off.

812
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,893
Yes, you do.

813
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,774
Hey, um...
Hm?

814
00:35:54,774 --> 00:35:55,901
Thank you.

815
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:57,947
For staying with me.

816
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,992
It really meant a lot
with, um...

817
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,330
with Link and Marcus --

818
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,710
Oh, God.
Marcus.

819
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,006
I can't stop picturing him
between my legs.

820
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,635
I'm gonna have to quit!

821
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:12,183
He saved your babies.
Just think about that.

822
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:14,396
Get some rest.

823
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:16,108
Ah.

824
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,530
Hey, I'm...

825
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,493
Uh, sitter's all set.
How are you doing?

826
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,455
Are you hungry?
Can I get you some food?

827
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:27,965
I, uh...I've been
making decisions on my own

828
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,969
my whole life.

829
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:32,641
And being in
a functional relationship

830
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:34,854
and allowing someone else
to weigh in on everything,

831
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:36,691
I-I-I'm still...

832
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,152
I know.

833
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,368
And I love you
so much.

834
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,329
I love you.

835
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,462
And Harry and Fanny.

836
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:50,552
It's my favorite great-aunt
and -uncle.

837
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:52,472
What do you think?

838
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:53,892
Is that your BP?
Yeah.

839
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:55,520
Mm.
Should I get you a juice?

840
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,357
Yeah.
I'll take orange juice.

841
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:58,317
Thank you.

842
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:09,047
Uh, Dr. Webber?

843
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:10,676
Millin, you okay?

844
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,472
It was me.

845
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:16,729
I didn't strap Damian
to the table.

846
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:22,991
I thought I did, but I-I
must have gotten distracted

847
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,285
and then, when Dr. Altman
called Griffith out, I froze.

848
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,789
I should have taken
responsibility for it then,

849
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:28,210
and I didn't, so I am taking
responsibility for it now.

850
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,254
I'm sorry.

851
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:32,761
I appreciate that.

852
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,305
But I'm not the one
who needs an apology.

853
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:43,115
Hey.
Go easy on that arm.

854
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,494
I've had worse injuries
playing soccer.

855
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,498
Are you okay?

856
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,043
I wasn't sure if this
might have brought up

857
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,674
some memories for you.
Yeah, a few.

858
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:53,469
I mean, that day shaped
my whole life.

859
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:55,139
Probably Derek's too.

860
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,728
You were his favorite,
you know.

861
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,690
He always saw something
in you.

862
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,734
Oh, and you didn't?

863
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,613
I found you infuriating.

864
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,702
But Scout and I love
having you around.

865
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:08,415
You coming home tonight?
Uh...

866
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:10,962
That's okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

867
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,348
Hey, Chief.
Uh, you got a minute?

868
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:18,937
No,
but you're already here.

869
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:22,736
Um, so, uh, about today.

870
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:25,534
I'm sorry. I was --
I was only trying to help.

871
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:28,581
You said that the hospital
doesn't have emergency plans

872
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,251
for, you know, heat domes.

873
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,965
Well, it turns out that we
don't have ones for wildfires,

874
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:35,010
tsunamis, and a few other
natural disasters.

875
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,806
And they're only increasing
with climate change.

876
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:38,893
So I want to put together
a committee

877
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:41,231
to fill in the gaps --
with your permission, of course.

878
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:42,734
Permission not granted.

879
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,574
Uh, can I ask why not?

880
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,036
As much as you can't seem
to grasp this,

881
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,834
you are a resident
on a trial basis.

882
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:54,048
You have no business devising
protocols that you can't follow.

883
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:56,721
If I were you,
I would spend less time assuming

884
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:58,600
that you have
a permanent position here

885
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,396
and more time proving
that you should have one.

886
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:02,900
We're done here,
Dr. Warren.

887
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,957
Hey.
You busy?

888
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:15,884
Well, a patient fell off
the O.R. table, so...yeah.

889
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,763
Um, do you mind getting
the kids?

890
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,642
Uh, sure. Sure.
Yeah.

891
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:23,148
Um, could you check in
on Nora Young before you leave?

892
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:25,570
Yeah.
Of course.

893
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,118
After all these years,

894
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:31,122
she still gets under your skin,
doesn't she?

895
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:34,254
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess she does.

896
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,509
What happens in our brains
in the moments before we die

897
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:38,638
has puzzled scientists
for centuries.

898
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:40,474
While we have some evidence

899
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:42,854
of our lives flashing
before our eyes,

900
00:39:42,854 --> 00:39:45,401
there are still many questions.

901
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:49,117
Temperature dropped
21 degrees in two hours.

902
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,294
How's Adams?

903
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:57,592
Oh, he's okay.
He's okay.

904
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:00,765
I'm used to seeing patients
come off rigs every day.

905
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,311
Hundreds of them.
Some worse than others.

906
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,692
But I can handle it.

907
00:40:05,692 --> 00:40:07,194
Always have.

908
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:11,202
But if one more resident
comes off a rig,

909
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:14,292
I don't think I can.

910
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,968
You talk to Altman?

911
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:20,722
Not yet.

912
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,523
No one knows exactly
why it happens.

913
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,195
Some people think it's biology.

914
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:30,240
Others believe it's spiritual.

915
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:37,506
Hi.
Hey.

916
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:44,645
There are people around.

917
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:48,151
I don't care.
It's been a long day.

918
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,048
What we know for sure is
that you can try to look away,

919
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:02,096
pushing down all
the uncertainty and pain...

920
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,112
You and me.

921
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,454
It feels like
such a long shot.

922
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:17,293
I mean, you're here.

923
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:18,838
And I'm in California,

924
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:20,842
and it's --
it's already so messy.

925
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:22,052
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

926
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,305
Don't -- Don't --
Don't overthink it.

927
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:25,017
Well, I have to
sort of think it.

928
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:28,273
Well, then think
about this.

929
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:29,902
I've never stopped
loving you.

930
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:33,116
What if that's enough?

931
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,118
Blue.

932
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,372
Say no to Dave.

933
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,335
Turn down his proposal.

934
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:40,715
Look. I-I don't want to
get this wrong.

935
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,009
If you and I
start something

936
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:45,390
without breaking it off
with him, it-- it'll feel wrong.

937
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,232
So go home...
and tell him.

938
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:54,701
And when you come back...
I am never losing you again.

939
00:41:55,787 --> 00:41:57,916
So say no.

940
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:04,095
But your life will catch up
with you in the end.

941
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,039
