1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:04,014
<i>Everybody wants
privacy for themselves.</i>

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,715
Do you have any
idea how many places

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,334
I've been looking for
you? What the hell, Alex?

4
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:10,404
You can't call? You can't
text? What happened?

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,022
<i>For other people, not so much.</i>

6
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,473
They said that the
trial was canceled.

7
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:15,897
- You said you were
taking a plea.
- I did.

8
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,128
Are you in hiding?

9
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,830
Are you evading the
law? Are you on the lam?

10
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,398
Alex. I can help you, but,
I mean, I have kids here.

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,073
Stop it. I went down
there. I talked to the D.A.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,937
I have to advise you, Dr. Karev,

13
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,573
that talking to you without
your lawyer present just isn't...

14
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,582
- She's on her way. Should we wait?
- We should.

15
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:47,757
But... if you just want to
tell me what it's about...

16
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,026
Wait! You can't just go in!

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,162
- Mr. Kirby, I'm sorry.
- Can I talk to you?

18
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,297
- Have you... Did you guys talk?
- What are you doing?

19
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,753
I'm dropping the charges.

20
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,418
What? You can't do that.

21
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,086
- Well, I am.
- No, he's right.

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,056
They're not your charges
to drop. They're the state's.

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,480
- Really?
- Really.

24
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,781
Okay, then...

25
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,384
if you put me on the stand,
I'm gonna have to tell the truth.

26
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,738
We had a fight, both of us.

27
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:18,126
And I was just as much
to blame. I started it.

28
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,836
The only reason I
let it get this far is...

29
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,532
pride, I guess. I didn't want...

30
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,879
Anyway, you put me
up there, I'll say that.

31
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:28,503
You're tanking this case.

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,135
Has something happened?
Has he threatened you?

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,421
Absolutely not.
No, he's... great.

34
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,145
- DeLuca.
- This case is a slam dunk.

35
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,148
- It's a slam freaking dunk.
- I'm sorry to waste your time.

36
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,715
Okay.

37
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,484
- So, Andrew
called off the trial?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,151
- For you?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,953
- Why?
- No clue.

40
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,344
DeLuca. DeLuca, wait!

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,187
So, you called a meeting,
and they ignored it?

42
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,524
How many attendings
didn't show up? A few?

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,239
Five? The entire staff?

44
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,542
Well, it was mostly
the department heads.

45
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,711
It was just their way
of sending a message...

46
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,513
Oh, you're going to have to
send a message right back.

47
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,115
I know that. I know.
I am handling this.

48
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,384
I know you are, Dr. Bailey.

49
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,059
But I am a dragon.
I'm your dragon.

50
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:27,513
And you should feel free to
unleash me, should you wish to.

51
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,482
Call me if you need backup.

52
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:36,237
I'm a dragon, too.

53
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,121
<i>Dr. Reynolds, extension 2216.
Dr. Reynolds, extension 2216.</i>

54
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,423
Ohh!

55
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,625
Boy, am I glad to see you.

56
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,693
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

57
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:47,928
I didn't expect
you till tonight.

58
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:50,430
Well, I took an early
flight to avoid a storm,

59
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,799
moved up a couple
of bladder repairs.

60
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,422
Making hay while the sun shines.

61
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,420
- How are things here?
- Oh, fine.

62
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,893
I have a bowel resection later.

63
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,346
How are things with Dr. Minnick?

64
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,060
Good. Good.

65
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,262
You know, just the
usual bumps in the road.

66
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,286
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,488
Well, I better get going, okay?

68
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,657
I'll see you tonight.

69
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,096
Metabolic panel showed slightly
elevated AST and ALT levels.

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,932
CT showed no stones, but
there was wall thickening.

71
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,668
Well, CT can miss gallstones,

72
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,337
especially if the
gallbladder's opacified.

73
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,162
In that case, the study
of choice is ultrasound.

74
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,278
Oh, I get a star? What did I
do? Play nicely with others?

75
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,998
The stars are the surgeries
I've chosen to teach in today.

76
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,783
Yours is first up, Dr. Grey.

77
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,323
No.

78
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,817
- No?
- No.

79
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,124
Okay. What is it?
What's the excuse?

80
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,109
The surgery too
delicate, too dangerous?

81
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,999
There is no excuse. Just no.

82
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,115
Let's go, Edwards.

83
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,442
Hey. So, what's the
fallout from last night?

84
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,644
So far, nothing. Why?
What have you heard?

85
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,196
Well, Minnick's car is here, so that
means she obviously wasn't fired.

86
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,300
- You know what
Minnick's car looks like?
- So? That... That's not weird.

87
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,484
- Hey, did you hear about Alex?
- No.

88
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,520
- Yeah, Andrew told me.
- Did he tell you why?

89
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,889
- No. He wouldn't say.
- "Why" what? What's up with Karev?

90
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,540
He's not in jail.
There's no trial.

91
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,776
- Yeah, Andrew
dropped all the charges.
- Really? Why?

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,411
- Well, I don't know. We just said...
- No idea.

93
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,613
What happened last night? Do
we have all the attendings with us?

94
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,848
Uh, well, Hunt... I'm not
sure where he stands yet.

95
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,234
Well, what about Riggs?

96
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,539
Uh, Riggs, we can ask after
he's done talking to your mom.

97
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,754
- What, after he's done
doing what?
- Talking to your mother.

98
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:41,257
- My what?
- Your mom,

99
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,726
your mother, the one
that raised and fed you?

100
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,630
How could Riggs be talking
to... My mother is in Hawaii.

101
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,431
What is he talk... What are
you... What is he talking about?

102
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,015
No. I met her at the coffee cart
this morning. She's really nice.

103
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,536
Why is no one making any sense?

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,594
Maggie, your mom is here.

105
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,082
- My mother is here!
- That's what I've...

106
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:04,080
- Okay.
- Mom!

107
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,344
Maggie!

108
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,552
What are you doing here?
What's going on? Are you okay?

109
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,078
What kind of welcome is
that? Let me look at you.

110
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,026
Where are your manners?
Introduce me to your friends.

111
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,628
Yeah, Pierce... manners.

112
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,030
Arizona and I are
already old friends.

113
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,750
Oh, yes, yes. Mrs. Pierce and I
go way back to the coffee cart.

114
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:26,252
Not "Mrs." Diane.

115
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:29,089
- Diane.
- But who is that?

116
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,746
Is he the one you like?

117
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,392
- Mom!
- What? Look at him.

118
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,879
Okay. Everyone, thank
you. You can go now.

119
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,179
Go now.

120
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,098
- Yeah, well... I have things to...
- Yeah.

121
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,889
- Lovely to meet you. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.

122
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,702
I just want to introduce myself,
Diane. Dr. Jackson Avery.

123
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,538
Oh, so, you're the
famous Jackson Avery.

124
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,741
Yes, and he's very busy, so...

125
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,860
- Are we all set for 2:30?
- We are. Yes.

126
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,012
What is happening at
2:30? What is happening?

127
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,698
Just a little consult.

128
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,033
Wait, what? You're not
getting plastic surgery?

129
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,601
It's not a dirty word, Pierce.

130
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,204
Mom, why? Why would you do that?

131
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:06,231
I don't know, I might want to
have a few things spruced up.

132
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,912
And you said
Dr. Avery is the best.

133
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,853
She's right. I'll see
you this afternoon.

134
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,018
Mom, what is going on?

135
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,471
I just spoke to you two days
ago. You said nothing about this.

136
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:22,625
I knew you'd try to talk
me out of it. So... surprise!

137
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,812
Come on, give me the tour.

138
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:28,231
I've only seen this
place on video chats.

139
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,567
Mom, I have
surgery in 20 minutes.

140
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,101
I wish you had told me
that you were coming.

141
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,639
It's okay. I have my book.
Just put me somewhere

142
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,842
and I can take care of myself.

143
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,666
Okay.

144
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,786
Wilson, what do we have?

145
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,471
Trauma Two. One! Trauma One.

146
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,606
I said, "What do we have?"

147
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,426
Oh, a patient. A trauma
patient in Trauma One.

148
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,744
Sorry. That's all I know.

149
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,362
Wilson, how many
hours you been working?

150
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,380
I'm fine.

151
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,882
You did a full shift
before going to Tri-County.

152
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,767
That was an all-nighter.
Did you work yesterday?

153
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,241
- I just need some coffee.
- How many hours?

154
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,490
- Thirty... something.
- Okay. Go home.

155
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,358
No, no. I'm okay, I'm okay.

156
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,860
No, you're not. And
I'm not gonna risk

157
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,329
you making a mistake
'cause of exhaustion.

158
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,618
Okay. I'm going.

159
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,258
Is that razor wire?

160
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,404
I'm staying.

161
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,632
Home, Wilson.

162
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:36,571
Okay. Gently. On three,
guys. One, two, three.

163
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,439
What have we got?

164
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,375
Fifty-year-old female found
down, wrapped in barbed wire.

165
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,924
Vitals: BP ninety over
sixty, tachy at one-twenty.

166
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,414
Non-responsive at the scene.

167
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,028
Trauma panel, chest
film, and cross-match her.

168
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,098
Keep her on high flow O-two.
Someone get a core temp.

169
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,392
Hey. I have a few minutes
before my lap chole.

170
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,950
- Oh, I gave that to Lawson.
- What? Why?

171
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,517
When Dr. Minnick approaches you
to observe in your O.R. and teach,

172
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,486
she's not asking
you for permission.

173
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,925
Wait, she told on me?

174
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,323
Bailey, who is this woman?

175
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,693
Dr. Minnick is the residency
director now. Period.

176
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,996
And you're the chief of general
surgery, so I need you to get in line.

177
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,304
Bailey, I'm not
going to get in line.

178
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:31,521
I do not support this, at all.
It's unfair and it's unnecessary.

179
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,190
You're pushing Richard
aside for no reason.

180
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,210
And a lot of us feel this
way. I think you need to listen,

181
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,228
and hear what
people are saying...

182
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,816
You're saying you won't
let Minnick into your O.R.?

183
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,406
I think a lot of us are. Yes.

184
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,711
Then you no longer have
an O.R. You're suspended.

185
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,947
Effective immediately.

186
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,216
Go home, Dr. Grey.

187
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:34,021
Bailey took out Grey.
Winter is coming.

188
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,831
Okay, set up a central
line and page RT.

189
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,616
Core temp's thirty-two.
She's hypothermic.

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,885
Let's start infusing warm saline

191
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,287
at a rate of one-fifty and
grab a warming blanket.

192
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:56,906
This poor woman. Has
she been conscious?

193
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,307
Not since they got her, no.

194
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,725
She's lucky her...

195
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,911
Careful. Okay, somebody
call maintenance.

196
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,303
We're gonna need wire cutters
and heavier gloves to free up this leg.

197
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,151
That razor wire
was just everywhere.

198
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,821
I would have helped her myself,
but I was afraid I'd lose a hand.

199
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,189
Can you tell me anything
about her medical history?

200
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,359
God, no. She was very private.

201
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,700
I mean, like really,
really private.

202
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,870
Annie and her husband
never said hi, never waved.

203
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,051
Right after they
moved onto our road,

204
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,320
they started to build the
wall around their place.

205
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:30,840
Not a fence, a
wall. Like a fortress.

206
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,638
- They seemed a little...
- Private.

207
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:34,999
Nutballs.

208
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,013
I tried to bake cupcakes, bring
them over, say hi, welcome.

209
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,667
- She didn't like that either?
- Her husband just yelled,
"We have guns."

210
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,085
He died a while back.

211
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,887
I only see her when
she gets her newspaper.

212
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,678
Six-thirty sharp, every morning.

213
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,159
But yesterday, the paper
just sat there for hours.

214
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,028
Finally, I peeked over
the fence, thinking,

215
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,012
"Grace, you're gonna get
your dumb head shot off."

216
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,923
There she was, tangled
in all of that razor wire.

217
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,704
Well, one thing's for sure.

218
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,048
She'd be dead right now if
it weren't for you finding her.

219
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,577
There's evidence of early ulceration.
She's been down a long time.

220
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,479
The blood flow's been
compromised. Page cardio.

221
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,782
We need a vascular consult, 'cause
she's in danger of losing this leg.

222
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,049
Right away, doctor.

223
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,074
Okay. Push five of Haldol.

224
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,134
Ow!

225
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,803
The rumor mill is...

226
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,943
The rumor mill is churning.

227
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,972
Why? What's it say?

228
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:57,865
- That you suspended Grey.
- Dr. Grey got herself suspended.

229
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,320
- What about Karev?
- What about him? He's in jail.

230
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,283
You really don't have a
line to the rumor mill, do you?

231
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,760
Charges got dropped.

232
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,995
- No jail.
- No jail?

233
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,664
Who...

234
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,985
Wait. Why are you smiling?

235
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,138
- What did you do?
- I might have told DeLuca.

236
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,301
Well, Karev was
gonna take the plea.

237
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,203
Yeah, but I wasn't supposed
to say anything to anyone!

238
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,005
And you didn't. I did.

239
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:29,363
I told DeLuca. DeLuca
took it from there.

240
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,896
But why would he
do that for Karev?

241
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,987
Come on, now. It's for Wilson.

242
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,256
Why would he do it for Wilson?

243
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,491
Woman, are you blind?

244
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:43,878
Blind... Why would...

245
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:48,827
<i>Pain Management, O.R. Recovery.
Pain Management, O.R. Recovery.</i>

246
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,155
Neighbor says she was putting razor
wire on the fence around her place.

247
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,036
- Fell off a ladder
and got tangled.
- My God.

248
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,571
Who needs razor wire?
What's wrong with people?

249
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,230
Every time she moved,
she injured herself more.

250
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,377
She's lucky she
didn't sever her aorta.

251
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:08,180
Hey. Word is Bailey
just took out Grey.

252
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,415
- What?
- They fired her?

253
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,200
No, suspended. And
apparently, Shepherd, too,

254
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,702
'cause she's just, like, gone.

255
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,226
Yeah, well, we sent a
message. Bailey sent one back.

256
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,790
- She took out our power hitter.
- Who, Shepherd?

257
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:20,025
- Grey.
- What makes Grey
our power hitter?

258
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,727
She was the one we didn't
think Bailey would ever take out.

259
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:24,664
Yeah, I'm just saying we're
all pretty powerful hitters here.

260
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,166
Look at the hospital sign.
Grey seems untouchable.

261
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,070
Well, I mean, if we're talking about
big names and power hitters, then...

262
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,911
I'm just saying.

263
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,198
This is getting scary.

264
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,569
Oh, my God. Is that razor wire?

265
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:43,749
Ma'am, you have to hold still.

266
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,451
- Max her out
on the midazolam drip.
- No!

267
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,535
Copy that.

268
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,557
She's gonna tear herself to
shreds. We have to stop her.

269
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,741
How?

270
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,126
Ma'am, I know it hurts,

271
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,395
but if you don't lay still, you're
gonna hurt yourself a lot more.

272
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,813
Please. What's her name?

273
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,947
- What?
- Her name, what's her name?

274
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,249
Annie Banks.

275
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:05,637
Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie.

276
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:06,738
Shh!

277
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,743
It's okay, I got
you. Annie. Annie.

278
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,807
Annie. Annie. Shh!

279
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:14,746
It's okay. I got you.

280
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,856
Annie, it's okay, it's okay. Look
at me. It's okay. I've got you.

281
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,792
I've got you.

282
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,854
- Okay, can I get a hand?
- Uh, right. Yes.

283
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:37,853
What is it?

284
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,155
I can't tell where to start...

285
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,699
- Just start.
- Okay.

286
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,271
Hi. Where you going?

287
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,273
To try to get my job
back. Why are you home?

288
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,441
- Oh, I just lost mine.
- What?

289
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,560
I threw down with Bailey
over Richard's replacement,

290
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:02,694
and she suspended me.

291
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,213
- What the hell?
- I know.

292
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,781
I've a meeting with Bailey right
now. I'm gonna tell her it's not cool.

293
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,265
Don't say a thing.

294
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,318
You just worry about
getting your job back.

295
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,204
Go cut open some little
kids. It's been too long.

296
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,206
Are we both ever gonna
work at the same time again?

297
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,396
Go.

298
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,787
That is a nasty
intraperitoneal bladder rupture.

299
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,140
- I'm so glad you're in town.
- Hmm.

300
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,140
Well, anyone could
repair a ruptured bladder.

301
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,865
Well, yeah, absolutely.
But it's just the hospital...

302
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,481
Are you here to put
a halt to this stuff?

303
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,731
A halt to what stuff?

304
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:44,070
You know, the Dr. Webber,
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Minnick... stuff.

305
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,138
Now, how is any
of that my business?

306
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:49,046
- 'Cause Dr. Webber's
your husband.
- Yes, he's my husband.

307
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,218
And he has his job, and I have
mine, and Dr. Bailey has hers.

308
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,187
And you have yours.

309
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,974
You should keep your mind on
these scans, and not on my marriage.

310
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,844
Yeah. Right. Yes.

311
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,345
<i>Dr. Adele to the NICU.
Dr. Adele to the NICU.</i>

312
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,781
- Riggs. Hey.
- Ohh!

313
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,866
You're not gonna take the
razor wire lady from me, are you?

314
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,518
- Who?
- You didn't hear about it?

315
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,505
She fell into a big batch of
it. It's like a cocoon of death.

316
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,407
Apparently, her vascular
damage is through the roof.

317
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:24,543
No, no. I wanted to
apologize for my mother.

318
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,094
She can be so...

319
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,930
No worries. Come
on, she's a hoot.

320
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,254
- Right. A hoot.
- Yeah.

321
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,291
Have you seen Dr. Webber?

322
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,887
No, why? Do you
need him for a consult?

323
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,091
No, I need to introduce
him to my mother.

324
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,616
I need to prepare him
or warn him or something.

325
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:45,452
Do you think she considered
that? That this might be a thing?

326
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,366
That my mother meeting my
birth father might be a thing?

327
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,553
I mean, what if he wasn't ready?

328
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,188
What if he hadn't planned, or-or

329
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,557
run through enough
scenarios or-or...

330
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,163
read enough books on the topic?

331
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,853
What if it doesn't work?
What if they hate each other?

332
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,501
Do you think she
thought about that?

333
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,169
Can I say a thing?

334
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,257
No.

335
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,083
All right. I better
get to the ER.

336
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,563
Wait. Say your thing.

337
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:18,135
It'll be okay. Whatever
happens. You're their kid.

338
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,303
And she was like
that as a little girl?

339
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,871
- It's you! And you. I
can just hear her now.

340
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,410
- Hey! Well, there she is.
- Yes!

341
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:35,335
I was just sitting here and
in walked your... Richard.

342
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,950
- So, you met my mother.
- I did.

343
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,242
- We've been having
the nicest chat.
- That's so great.

344
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,959
Well, I just came to take
you to your appointment,

345
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,627
so, if you don't want
to be late, we should...

346
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,530
Oh, well, all right, then.
I'll see you tonight, I guess.

347
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:52,870
See you at eight.

348
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,372
Okay. Bye.

349
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,540
- What is happening tonight?
- We're going to dinner.

350
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:05,127
Acosta's. Reviews
are through the roof,

351
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,597
an amazing wine list,
and it's on the water.

352
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,498
Mom, I know
Acosta's. I live here.

353
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,319
He seems every bit
as nice as you said.

354
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,409
He is.

355
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,074
What's wrong, Maggie?

356
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,542
We have to go, if you
don't want to be late

357
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,378
for your butt lift,
or whatever it is.

358
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,618
Oh, just stop it, Maggie, now.

359
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:39,600
I will need your court papers,
dismissal of charges, whatever.

360
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:42,286
I need all that
paperwork for your file.

361
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,617
You can start back
as soon as I have it.

362
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,364
Thank you.

363
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:58,647
Promise me that you are the Alex
Karev who heals small children.

364
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,871
That you have left behind the
Alex Karev who beats people up.

365
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,407
I've got my head on straight.

366
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,404
I want my job back.
I just want to work.

367
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:07,628
Promise me.

368
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,731
I promise.

369
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:15,302
Don't scare me like that again.

370
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:22,242
You need something else?

371
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:26,191
You suspended Meredith...
for backing Webber?

372
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,442
I just don't understand
where it's coming from.

373
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,163
Webber was the program
since I've been here.

374
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,883
Really, Karev? The second
I give you your job back?

375
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,000
Look, since you've been here.

376
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:37,944
Get out of my office
before I change my mind.

377
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,262
Go!

378
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,075
Just promise me you won't
turn her into a fish-lipped monster

379
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,698
with an immobile forehead.

380
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,997
- That's not something I do.
- I'm just reminding you

381
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:07,265
that you swore a sacred
oath as a physician

382
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,336
to give sound, medical counsel to
women who are already beautiful.

383
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,977
To you. I'm not
worried about you.

384
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,608
I want to feel beautiful naked.

385
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,976
Ew, Mom!

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,451
Go. I'll text you when I'm done.

387
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,206
All right. Well, firstly, I do
agree with your daughter.

388
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,291
You look terrific. But that doesn't
mean there aren't some things

389
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,493
that you might like to change.

390
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,996
So I'd like to start with
just a brief conversation

391
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,364
so that I can get
a better sense...

392
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:41,100
I always taught my daughter, if
she wanted to know something,

393
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:43,140
don't ask the internet.

394
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,410
Find the smartest
person in the room.

395
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,663
And if they're not
smarter than you,

396
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,782
find another room.

397
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,970
My doctor at home
is not the best.

398
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,422
Maggie tells me you are.

399
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,591
Well, that's very nice
of her. Thank you.

400
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,079
Can you get rid of this?

401
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,023
Well, let me take a look here.

402
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:32,684
It's mostly just vascular
repair. I'll look for organ damage.

403
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,920
I'll take care of the limb. I'm
worried about that right leg.

404
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,055
- She tore it up pretty badly.
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,325
Did Shepherd get canned, too? I
mean, this place is coming apart.

406
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,617
Shepherd didn't get
suspended. She's taken a leave.

407
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,853
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,503
No. She left. She left work,

409
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,961
she... left me.

410
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,097
Where'd she go?

411
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,277
- Grey's house?
- Edwards, I think.

412
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,585
What are you gonna do?

413
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,205
She's good to go.

414
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,843
What can I do? You know,
go over there and drag her out?

415
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,578
I've said what I can,

416
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,532
I tried. She doesn't want
to... doesn't want to talk...

417
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,780
- Damn it.
- Look, she'll come around, mate.

418
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,199
No, no, it's the razor wire.

419
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,474
DeLuca.

420
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,024
<i>Dr. Burks to Oncology.
Dr. Burks to Oncology.</i>

421
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,113
Oh, so now my
fetoscopy's in O.R. Three?

422
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:36,770
I'm glad, glad I
checked the board.

423
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,217
You would have figured it out
if you had walked into O.R. Two

424
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,970
- and found a bowel obstruction.
- You do this everywhere you go?

425
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,554
- Do what?
- Turn the place against you.

426
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,823
People don't like change.

427
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,647
Mmm. I know. People like people.

428
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,194
So first you try and
oust Richard Webber,

429
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:51,163
and then you get
Meredith Grey suspended.

430
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,363
- Suspended?
- Yeah!

431
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,266
I mean, you really don't want
to make friends here, do you?

432
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,974
I... I didn't come
here for that.

433
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,909
Well, then you're
doing a great job.

434
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,978
Meredith Grey? How about
a little heads up next time?

435
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,131
No. Better yet, no
more suspensions.

436
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,650
I am doing my best here,
but you are not helping.

437
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,618
Well, I can't just
allow insubordination.

438
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,002
No, you can't make my job even
more difficult than it already is.

439
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,309
I'm still moving forward, but I'm
up against very strong opposition.

440
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,528
Yeah, I've seen that for myself.
Look, the residents are happy.

441
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:24,902
The attendings are not.

442
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,650
If I am seen as the person who
came in and tanked Meredith Grey,

443
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,452
that's not gonna be
good for the program.

444
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,955
- It'll slow down my progress.
- It's a new system.

445
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,140
- You can have all the time
you need. I don't need time.

446
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:39,232
I need to stop being blocked.
My job is hard enough. Look...

447
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,738
I have to win people over. Just,
please, don't suspend anyone else.

448

<i>Vascular Surgeon to O.R. Two.
Vascular Surgeon to O.R. Two.</i>

449
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,049
Two-oh Vicryl. Have you done a
Connell technique yet, Edwards?

450
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,313
- Like to try it?
- I would love to.

451
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,882
Uh, that's a very
complex repair.

452
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,419
The idea is to see what
the resident is capable of.

453
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,171
It's not like
Dr. Minnick is in here.

454
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,929
Dr. Minnick is the
residency director.

455
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:12,761
Suction, Kepner.
More distal, Edwards.

456
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,435
I'm sorry. Are you really
okay with all of this?

457
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,921
Let it go, April.

458
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,187
Good, good. Now, go under
again, and that should cinch it up.

459
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,890
- Where do you want me?
- Left arm.

460
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,347
Just missed the brachial artery.

461
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,159
She's losing her leg, huh?

462
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,228
Yeah, her foot's already
developed gangrene.

463
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:31,997
The wire disrupted
the popliteal artery.

464
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:34,099
Did a number on her
abdominal wall too.

465
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,383
Can I get a three-oh
nylon, please?

466
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,118
Yeah, you should
close up the subcue first.

467
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,286
We going with the
Minnick method here?

468
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,061
By necessity. I cut up
my arms pretty good.

469
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,999
So, why the change of heart?

470
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,516
- What?
- Karev.

471
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,371
Why'd you let him off the hook?

472
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,550
Is it okay if we
don't talk about that?

473
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,703
It's just... it's my personal
business. I don't...

474
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,294
Of course. Sorry. Of course.

475
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,694
So, what's the deal with
this lady anyway, huh?

476
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,680
What do we think she's
got behind that wall?

477
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,470
Meth lab? Hmm? Puppy mill?

478
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,450
Think she's a nudist?

479
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,552
Maybe she's the
tinfoil hat lady.

480
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,054
You know, maybe
she's just stubborn

481
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,457
and locked herself away,
and it's gonna cost her a limb.

482
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,524
Right.

483
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,263
That's not a great look.

484
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,366
Well, Diane, our
initial biopsy results...

485
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,537
They show inflammatory
breast cancer.

486
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,791
- We need to confirm, but...
- Breast cancer?

487
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,138
But... but there
are no lumps. I...

488
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,974
I understand. It's...

489
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:51,943
a particularly
aggressive form of cancer

490
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,368
that presents as external skin
reactions more often than lumps.

491
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,972
- Dear God.
- I am so sorry.

492
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,470
Now, you'll have to
have a full work-up,

493
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,312
at which point we can
discuss our options.

494
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,609
I'll be able to refer
you to local specialists.

495
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,244
You're in Hawaii, I believe?

496
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,330
I know a terrific group of
oncologists out there on the Big Island,

497
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,338
and I'll be more than happy
to travel to you for surgery.

498
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,408
That's if... if you'd like.

499
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,823
You would?

500
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,294
You're Maggie
Pierce's mom, so, yes.

501
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,229
Would you like me to
grab Maggie for you?

502
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,898
Oh, no. No, don't. No.

503
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,656
Not while she's working.

504
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,661
I'll tell her tonight.

505
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,859
What are you calling this again?

506
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,700
This is called inflammatory
breast cancer or IBC.

507
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,053
It's a local form
of the disease.

508
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,842
Maggie's gonna have
a million questions.

509
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,761
Will you help me tell her?

510
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,594
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

511
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:01,834
Absolutely.

512
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,784
Um, I'm sorry if I pushed.

513
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,020
What's between you and
Dr. Webber is none of my business.

514
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,895
You don't owe me an apology.
You owe Dr. Bailey one.

515
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:29,607
We were taking a stand

516
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,193
for Dr. Webber. I don't
understand why you...

517
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,544
Dr. Webber doesn't need
you to fight his battles.

518
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,603
What you did stands to
hurt this entire hospital.

519
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,006
Your first priority needs to
be this place and its patients.

520
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,203
You should not be proud about what
you did, you should be embarrassed.

521
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,664
Hi! How are we doing in here?

522
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:00,539
Annie, the injuries caused
by the razor wire were deep.

523
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:04,364
Some of the cuts compromised
the blood flow to your right leg.

524
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:09,670
Unfortunately, we... we had
to amputate below the knee.

525
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,483
How'd they find me?

526
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,286
Well, a neighbor called 911,

527
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,871
and then the firefighters
broke the gate down.

528
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:20,225
Listen, they saved your life.

529
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:24,151
Damn razor wire. I
got most of it down.

530
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,500
Then I fell off the ladder
into the whole mess of it.

531
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:30,557
- You were taking it down?
- Yeah.

532
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:34,405
My husband and I,
we didn't trust people.

533
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,125
There's just so much
bad stuff out there.

534
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:41,101
Started with locks,
alarms, and cameras...

535
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,955
And then the wall. It
felt safe, you know?

536
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,674
It was him and me
against the world.

537
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,351
But then he died, and...

538
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,988
It just felt more like a prison.

539
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:04,169
Every day I'd...

540
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:06,826
get the paper, and I'd
think about going farther.

541
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:09,762
But I never could.

542
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:15,569
So then I thought,
start with the wall.

543
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,989
Just take the stupid thing down.

544
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about your leg.

545
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:26,779
I feel like one of them animals

546
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,333
that chewed its leg
off to get out of a trap.

547
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,021
But I got out.

548
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,792
I finally got out!

549
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:42,195
Thanks.

550
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,839
- Hey. You got a minute?
- No.

551
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,007
Look, you never gave
me a chance to say...

552
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,775
Don't. Okay? Don't thank me.

553
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,149
I'm not. I'm sorry.

554
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:08,105
I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry...
It was a misunderstanding.

555
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
You got the wrong
end of me overreacting.

556
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,824
I'm glad you're okay,
and I'm really sorry.

557
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:18,198
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

558
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,962
I gave you every
chance to say that.

559
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,430
For months, you could
have just said that.

560
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,798
I said it that night.

561
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,166
Oh, yeah, because you
didn't want me to tell the cops

562
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,284
that you beat me up.

563
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:27,785
You came to me
in my hospital room

564
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,287
when I was jacked
up on painkillers

565
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,722
afraid I was never
gonna see again.

566
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,441
You tried, and then you
never talked to me again.

567
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:37,195
I saw you almost every day. I
worked for your friends every day.

568
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:40,899
I knew what happened that night.
I knew what you were thinking.

569
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:44,019
I knew why you hit me. If
you would have just treated me

570
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,637
like a human being, if you
would have just talked to me,

571
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,072
maybe we could
have avoided all this.

572
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,797
- I didn't think you'd listen.
- Yeah? Well,
I'm a pretty good guy!

573
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,136
Why'd you do it?

574
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,716
- I don't
have to explain myself...
- Just tell me.

575
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:07,314
Jo's been through enough.

576
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:10,343
She doesn't need to
live her life being scared.

577
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,481
Yeah, well, Jo would say she's
pretty good at taking care of herself.

578
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,005
Yeah, well, should she have to?

579
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,968
- Hi.
- Your mom's in the kitchen.

580
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,770
She what? What? You met my mom?

581
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,461
- Yeah.
- She met you.

582
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,242
- She met you without me.
- We did more than meet.

583
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:43,477
I mean, she folded laundry, put
the kids to bed, and fed me lasagna.

584
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,680
God. I am so sorry. I'm so
sorry she's been in the way.

585
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,868
Are you kidding? I'm in love
with her. The woman's incredible.

586
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,693
Maggie! Oh, good!

587
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,129
I'm going to binge watch
TV. Tell her she can move in.

588
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,199
Mom, I really wish that you'd...

589
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:07,651
Hey, Maggie. Hey.
I invited Dr. Avery.

590
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,886
Of course, you did.

591
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,821
Because who doesn't invite
their plastic surgeon to dinner?

592
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,307
Come, have
something to eat, honey.

593
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,877
Mom, we have plans with
Richard Webber. You made them.

594
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,697
I know. I thought we
might postpone that.

595
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:22,049
I thought it would be nice to
have a quiet dinner at home.

596
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,309
- Is that okay?
- Why not?

597
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,783
- Are you upset with me, Maggie?
- Am I...

598
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,202
Yes, Mom. Yes.

599
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,251
You show up here without warning
for plastic surgery that you don't need.

600
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:43,521
- You embarrass me
in front of my friends.
- When did I embarrass you?

601
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,039
Then you make dinner
plans with Richard,

602
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,924
and you blow them off like
they don't mean anything.

603
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,932
- Oh, he'll understand.
- You talk to Meredith
without me.

604
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,781
You talk to Richard,
you talk to Jackson.

605
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,766
I mean, you two go way back.

606
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,601
Uh, Dr. Avery, I am sorry.

607
00:32:56,625 --> 00:33:00,071
You don't get to apologize
for me to my friends.

608
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,906
This is my life that
you've walked into.

609
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,348
You can't just come in and
rearrange things without asking me.

610
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,663
When did you become so selfish?

611
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,520
I am not the one who
destroyed our family.

612
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,020
Who moved to
Hawaii to make soap,

613
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:18,979
without thinking about who you
were leaving behind or hurting.

614
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,481
And now you come here and you...

615
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,468
You are the one who is selfish.

616
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:28,116
You only think about yourself.

617
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,973
Maggie, if I could...

618
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,746
I think you should go, Jackson.

619
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:40,578
I'm so sorry that Maggie's
being so very rude.

620
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,713
I'm being rude? You
just kicked my friend out

621
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:45,149
of a house that wasn't
even yours to invite him to.

622
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:46,907
God! Mom...

623
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,043
I have no idea who
you are anymore.

624
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,579
Guys, I'm here if
you need anything.

625
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:58,702
Thank you.

626
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:05,925
You are right.

627
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:09,173
You don't have any
idea who I am anymore,

628
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,498
because you haven't
taken the time to try.

629
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:17,232
The moment I left your father,
it was like I could finally breathe.

630
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,357
Now, I know that's not something
you want to hear, but it's true.

631
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
I...

632
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,945
I have finally become the
person that I always wanted to be.

633
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:29,448
I want my mother back.

634
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,205
I'm sorry you don't like
who I've become, but I do.

635
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:40,276
And I'm not apologizing
for that. Not anymore.

636
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:48,752
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the hotel. I...

637
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,988
- Mom. I've an early
flight in the morning.

638
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,093
You have a great life here.

639
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,632
You call when you're
ready to share it with me.

640
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,651
- You wanted to see me, Chief?
- Sit.

641
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,337
It is obvious that you
don't support my decision.

642
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:49,506
I just... I just think that
Dr. Webber is the backbone of this...

643
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,716
Save it. You're not gonna win
a loyalty contest against me.

644
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,869
You support Dr. Webber. I
get it. That's your business.

645
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:01,191
But my business is making
sure this hospital runs,

646
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,443
and right now, some people
are making that very hard.

647
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:08,047
So it is tough
decision time, Kepner.

648
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,830
Congratulations.

649
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:26,260
- On?
- Getting your way.

650
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,313
I'm pretty sure the chief is starting
to think I'm not worth the trouble.

651
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:31,449
- She is a smart lady.
- She could fire me.

652
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:34,791
- I wouldn't cry.
- No, you'd be terrified.

653
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,254
Because then you
would have to face it.

654
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,006
- Face what?
- If Bailey fired me,

655
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,214
you and I would be an option.

656
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,335
We could date. We could kiss.

657
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:51,040
We could... actually
be something.

658
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,315
So screw you.

659
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:17,784
- You think this tie is too much?
- No.

660
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:21,632
That's a nice place you all
are going to. No, this is good.

661
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,824
You know, I worked
with April all day today.

662
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:28,405
She could not shut up about
Grey getting suspended.

663
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:30,813
Well, I don't blame
her. It's outrageous.

664
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,530
You think it was the right call?

665
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,766
I think Bailey had to
send a clear message.

666
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,023
To me. About me.

667
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,711
Well, I think she's...

668
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:50,199
Actually, I don't
want to get into it.

669
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,001
We're in it.

670
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,417
You're on Bailey's side on this.

671
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,537
Richard. You're going to
have a lovely dinner tonight.

672
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,689
Don't ruin it. We can
talk about this later.

673
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,931
This is from Maggie. She
has to cancel dinner tonight.

674
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,099
So...

675
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,687
I guess we can
talk about this now.

676
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,807
- Why?
- We have pizza and beer.

677
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,710
I have shows with swords
and dragons and decapitations.

678
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:23,983
We also have gossip.

679
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,438
Come in. Where's Warren?

680
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,074
He's married to the chief.

681
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,288
- So...?
- So, he is not to be trusted.

682
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,506
- I didn't invite him.
- Yeah.

683
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,308
Edwards wants to have some
weird sort of strategy session.

684
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,962
Listen, Bailey called a meeting
with the attendings last night,

685
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,897
and no one showed up.

686
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,901
Not a single one. So Grey isn't
the only one trying to get Minnick out.

687
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,620
Yeah, but we're residents.
It doesn't really concern us.

688
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:51,673
It only concerns us.

689
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,208
This is our education, we
worked hard to get here,

690
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,609
and they're obstructing us.

691
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:59,935
Look, Kepner, Avery, and
Robbins are all with Grey.

692
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,822
- Karev probably will be, too.
- Karev?

693
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:04,857
Karev is in prison.

694
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,262
What?

695
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,550
What?

696
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,985
Why did she leave, though?

697
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:19,817
Because I'm terrible, and I
exhausted her with my terribleness.

698
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:22,119
Now she's gone, and I
can't make it up to her

699
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:25,911
and I feel awful. I
love my mother. I do.

700
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:30,211
But for her to just barge in
here like that with no warning...

701
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,617
And she was weird.

702
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:35,349
She was. She was, she was
flighty and nervous and weird.

703
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,018
God, I couldn't
wait for her to go.

704
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,386
She makes some
good lasagna, though.

705
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,779
Are you seeing this?

706
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,197
Bailey hired an
interim chief of general?

707
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,854
Bailey replaced you? With who?

708
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,789
Kepner?

709
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,242
Kepner.

710
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,450
Amelia.

711
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,759
Every day you
don't open the door,

712
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,883
it gets a little
easier to stay inside.

713
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,535
I can't pull you out anymore.

714
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,473
No one can open
this door but you.

715
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:31,277
And I want to be
here. I will be. But...

716
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,398
Amelia.

717
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,195
Tell her I'm not
gonna wait forever.

718
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,255
<i>We have to keep
something to ourselves.</i>

719
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,220
<i>Or else anyone can get to us.</i>

720
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:08,480
<i>They'll see the stuff
we don't show anyone.</i>

721
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,726
<i>So we build the
walls high and wide.</i>

722
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:16,916
<i>And we lock the gates.</i>
