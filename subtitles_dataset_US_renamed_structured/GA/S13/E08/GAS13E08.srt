1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>There's this family in
Italy who never slept.</i>

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,953
<i>They suffered from a genetic disease
that kept them awake for months,</i>

3
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,456
<i>until their bodies
just shut down.</i>

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,046
<i>Even after all these years,</i>

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,594
<i>scientists still don't
really know why we sleep.</i>

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,718
<i>We just know we have to sleep.</i>

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,687
<i>Because without it, we
make poor decisions,</i>

8
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,534
<i>we say things we shouldn't.</i>

9
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,893
<i>And sometimes we see
things that aren't there.</i>

10
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,548
What do we got?

11
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,066
MVC with abdominal trauma,

12
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,118
severely hypotensive
since he arrived.

13
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,554
FAST exam show fluid in
the right upper quadrant,

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,588
lots of it.

15
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,889
It's gonna be a long night.

16
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,075
Don't say that. I
haven't slept in 48 hours.

17
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,509
Thought I saw you
go home earlier.

18
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,345
You did. I got off
an 18-hour shift

19
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,281
to go home to find Zola,
who is boycotting sleep,

20
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,499
and Ellis, who had an earache.

21
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,268
By the time I got
the last one down,

22
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,019
I got the call. Where were you?

23
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,054
Four-hour lysis of adhesions.

24
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:37,089
Then a triple-A
ruptured in the ICU.

25
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:39,675
Pierce and I had to do a
balloon catheter bedside

26
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,678
- before rushing him to the OR.
- Oh, that sounds...

27
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,031
Then a GSW to the abdomen that
Edwards caught. A duodenal repair.

28
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,367
- How long have you been here?
- What day is it?

29
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,424
Scalpel.

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,405
How do you know when
you're too tired to operate?

31
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,758
Right about when you
make your first mistake.

32
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,108
I hate that answer.

33
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:57,544
You don't. You just keep going.

34
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,168
Don't love that one, either.

35
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,459
Okay, Edwards,
grab a hemostat to lift.

36
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,082
Dividing the fascia.

37
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:23,419
Okay, Edwards, get lap
pads in here. Get in there.

38
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,938
We got massive bleeding here.

39
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:27,082
Okay, we're gonna
need a Bookwalter now.

40
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,984
- Edwards, I can't see a thing.
- I'm trying.

41
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,028
Wipe.

42
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,242
- Got it, got it.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,027
Okay, let's get more
lap pads in there.

44
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,219
Let's bring in another suction, and
we are gonna need the cell saver.

45
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,970
Good evening, surgeons. I
heard we've got a good one.

46
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,855
I'm here to give you
another set of hands.

47
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,357
Yeah, we could use
it if you're available.

48
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,075
Available? I'm primed.

49
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,512
I napped all afternoon,
ate a balanced supper,

50
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,780
and just had a cup of coffee.

51
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,214
- Well, that's nice.
- Did you?

52
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,817
Someone tell me what
we've got on our table.

53
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,990
A mess, sir.

54
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,971
Grade four liver lac,
portal triad looks intact.

55
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,812
We've just packed
all four quadrants.

56
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:20,059
- Wow! That liver's...
- Destroyed. Like I said, a mess.

57
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,611
Okay, hematoma's
tracking into zone two.

58
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,998
Edwards, let's do a right
medial visceral rotation.

59
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,265
Got it. Medium clip, please.

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,900
How many units has he had?

61
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,819
We've gone through
at least a dozen.

62
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,521
He's bleeding out
everything we pour into him.

63
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,456
- Clamp.
- Okay, keep suctioning.

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,924
- Other lap.
- Retractor.

65
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,297
Suction right there.

66
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,695
- I need two more clamps.
- You know, back in the day,

67
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,198
I would always come
into the hospital overnight,

68
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,000
even if I wasn't on call.

69
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,524
That's when the most
interesting surgeries came in.

70
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,940
Best learning
opportunities, am I right?

71
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,841
Yeah. Yes, sir. Bovie up.

72
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,185
I'll never forget this case, back
when I was a second-year resident.

73
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,747
It was about 3:00
in the morning,

74
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,983
and I'd been on my
feet for about 42 hours.

75
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,127
Right angle.

76
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,443
This fella came into the ER
with terrible abdominal pains,

77
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:09,414
claimed that an alien baby
was inside, eating its way out.

78
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,517
That's funny. Dr. Grey,
do you see this?

79
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,003
This kidney's cracked in half.

80
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,405
Exactly. It was his kidney.

81
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,380
Well, a kidney stone. It
was the size of a coconut.

82
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,932
It was six hours in the OR.

83
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,515
This seems like a
grade four injury to me.

84
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,216
- Mm-hmm.
- Any way we can salvage it?

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,334
- No.
- Yes.

86
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,653
If someone could clarify...

87
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,973
Okay, it was the size of a
dinosaur egg. It almost glowed.

88
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,475
Actually, sir, I was
talking about this.

89
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,926
This liver is shredded.

90
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,662
We don't have the
time or the blood volume

91
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,196
to spend an hour
fixing a kidney.

92
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,031
We could better control
the extra blood loss

93
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,355
if we fix the kidney.

94
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,035
Well, there will be no blood
loss if we just take the kidney out.

95
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,487
I'm very happy to
keep discussing it,

96
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,889
but I really think a final
decision would be good.

97
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,892
- Take the kidney out.
- You know what, Grey?

98
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,160
- Let's hold on for a minute.
- Patient doesn't have a minute.

99
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,712
Should I clamp the hilum?

100
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,648
No, we're gonna do
a partial nephrectomy.

101
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:05,849
That would be useless.

102
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,550
- And why is that?
- What?

103
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,784
I wasn't asking for myself.

104
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,353
I was asking for
Edwards. Why is that?

105
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,821
What does Edwards
have to do with this?

106
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,222
Well, she's our resident here.

107
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,125
This is an excellent
teaching case,

108
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,910
and she'd benefit
if you'd elaborate.

109
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,244
It's fine, really.

110
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:19,329
Richard, please...

111
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,897
Now, look, you and Dr. Hunt

112
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,065
are chiefs of general
and trauma surgery.

113
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,602
If we don't make a decision,
we're gonna be here all night.

114
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,637
I'm going to repair
the kidney. Suture.

115
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,839
- Hunt!
- Now, look, you two

116
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,058
should want this resident
to learn from this patient.

117
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,193
Owen, if you do this,

118
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,627
Edwards is gonna
learn from this patient

119
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,267
when he's a cadaver in my lab.

120
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,768
Dr. Webber, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,488
- You're tired.
- No, it's not... It's just...

122
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,863
- Fine. Let's do the partial.
- Good.

123
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,287
Retractor.

124
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,409
- Edwards.
- Yes, sir?

125
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:00,853
Tell me about the patient.

126
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:04,056
Uh... Okay. He came
into the ER unconscious.

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,498
No, no. Tell me his name.

128
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,279
Well, he didn't have any ID,
so as of now he's John Doe.

129
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,331
The car sped up a freeway
ramp the wrong way,

130
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,633
smashed into another car.

131
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,935
One guy's in OR five, and
the other one's right here.

132
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,737
Do we have the reckless driver,

133
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,139
or do we have the
innocent victim?

134
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:20,395
We don't know.

135
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,392
So, we don't know if
this man had a family,

136
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,561
we don't know if he was
running from something,

137
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,331
and we don't know if he was
the good guy or the bad guy.

138
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,635
We know nothing.

139
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,652
What do we need to
know in order to do our jobs

140
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,219
and not simply be mechanics?

141
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,606
How are we... We're
not being mechanics!

142
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,531
You're treating this patient
like a sack of organs on a table!

143
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,751
Now, here's what we're gonna
do. We're gonna play a game.

144
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,192
And how is this the
best use of our energy?

145
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,940
Now, here's how we start.

146
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:56,964
This patient is no
longer John Doe.

147
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,645
- Who is he, then?
- Basin.

148
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,229
We make him someone.

149
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,805
Anyone we want.

150
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,485
- What is he doing?
- He likes to teach.

151
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,721
When he's pissed,
he really likes to teach.

152
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,357
- Surgicel snow, please.
All right, first things first.

153
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,548
We need a name. Who's got one?

154
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,431
Brandon.

155
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,834
All right, Brandon.
Now, who is he?

156
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,492
I think he's the guy in
IT who parks next to me.

157
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,568
Okay, is he a good
guy, someone we like?

158
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,936
I don't know.
We've never spoken.

159
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,938
Okay, well, then
pick someone else...

160
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,329
and make them someone good,
and they don't have to be a male.

161
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,167
All right. How about Joanie?

162
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,763
- Now, why Joanie?
- 'Cause you didn't like Brandon.

163
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,619
How about Gail?

164
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,023
Gail's nice.

165
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,312
Let's go with Gail.

166
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,601
She's 45... No.

167
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,087
She's 46.

168
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,093
What is it we like about
Gail? And be specific.

169
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,839
I mean, do not stop

170
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,892
until you picture this
woman on the table,

171
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,727
until you can truly see her.

172
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,686
Do not stop until we can hear
her voice, what she has to say.

173
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,375
Well, this is going to be fun.

174
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,967
So, who is Gail?

175
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,036
Why do we like her?

176
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:03,135
And why would we go to
such lengths to save her life?

177
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,372
Sorry, shouldn't we want to
save her even if we don't like her?

178
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,608
Yes, but let's make
it easier on ourselves.

179
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,228
I mean, we need to fill Gail in.

180
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,503
I mean, Really give her something
that we can sink our teeth into.

181
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:21,270
Does she have hobbies, or...
Or is she known for something?

182
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,888
Right lobe is still bleeding.

183
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,392
- Over here, too.
- Okay. Large clip.

184
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,646
Well, what if Gail
plays the cello?

185
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,786
Edwards?

186
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,589
Uh... Sure.

187
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,957
<i>My mother forced me to learn.</i>

188
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,592
<i>Something about
learning an instrument</i>

189
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,482
<i>would help instill discipline.</i>

190
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,397
Remove the top blades.

191
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,233
- What are you doing?
- Remove them. Scissors.

192
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,834
Pringle didn't make
a dent in the bleeding,

193
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,335
I'm gonna try and
create more exposure

194
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,703
<i>with a subcostal... Ten blade.</i>

195
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,289
<i>That's what this guy needs is
more incisions to bleed from.</i>

196
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,142
<i>Okay, suction is
blocked. Fix it now.</i>

197
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,295
Okay, what else? We
need to make Gail more real.

198
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,763
Okay, she plays the cello.

199
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,498
Someone answer
him. I'm too exhausted.

200
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,099
- You started it.
- You're the one who was...

201
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,100
Oh, my God.

202
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,052
Dr. Webber, I have
a question about Gail.

203
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,021
Okay, go ahead,
Edwards, and don't be shy.

204
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,978
Does Gail...

205
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,848
have a dog?

206
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,668
Excellent question, but no.

207
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,270
Gail doesn't have
time for a dog.

208
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,785
She's got two...
No, three young kids,

209
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,003
so her house is already mayhem.

210
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,308
- Three boys?
- No, no.

211
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,596
Two boys and a girl.

212
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,743
That's nice, right?

213
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,979
Hey, stop
terrorizing your sister!

214
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,598
- Don't make me come over there!
- Stop. Stop.

215
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,360
Hey! You're the
oldest, act like it!

216
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:50,231
Boy, you roll your eyes again,
I'm gonna shut 'em for good.

217
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,179
I imagine Gail's
work keeps her sane.

218
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,853
Does anyone have any idea
what she does for a living?

219
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,540
Maybe... she's an engineer?

220
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,044
Or something with
research, politics.

221
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,891
Maybe she's whatever
Dr. Webber says she is.

222
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,500
Gail dreams of being Principal
Cello for the Chicago Symphony.

223
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,771
She practices relentlessly
every morning and night.

224
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,569
But in between, she teaches
music to kids in the neighborhood,

225
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,173
and she helps lead the
local high school orchestra.

226
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,562
If you could just hear
this one student of mine

227
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,803
<i>play Bach's "Sonata
Number One in G Minor,</i>

228
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,451
"Fuga Allegro." She
learned it just like that.

229
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,889
- Pressure's dropping.
- It's gonna continue to drop.

230
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,657
He's still bleeding despite
any move we make.

231
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,275
We should just cut
our losses and stop.

232
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,310
Damage control?

233
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,783
We should just pack him up,

234
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,997
and when he's stronger we
can come back in and finish.

235
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,233
No, we're gonna concentrate
on the retrohepatic area.

236
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,301
We'll try and repair
the vascular injuries

237
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,303
- that are in there first.
- I agree with Hunt.

238
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,089
How do you expect
to even see anything

239
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,824
behind this liver
to get a clamp in?

240
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,109
Trust me, we close
and let the body heal.

241
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,300
Somebody call up to ICU and
let them know we're coming.

242
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,216
We should keep going in
here, try and repair the damage.

243
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,101
At this point, this
patient wouldn't survive

244
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,669
the elevator ride to the ICU.

245
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,803
Look at this liver.

246
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,755
At this point this patient
is not surviving anything!

247
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,824
So you wanna give up now?

248
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,776
Leave Gail to die
in a bed upstairs?

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,678
Is it better if Gail
dies on the table?

250
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,551
It's better if Gail lives.

251
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,455
- What if we call UNOS?
- Wait, really?

252
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,774
Wait. Can we list him for
an emergent liver transplant?

253
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,076
- No!
- Why not?

254
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,644
You know why not!

255
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,945
He'll be dead before
a liver even gets here.

256
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,798
And if he's not,
he'd be too unstable,

257
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,033
and he'd reject it immediately.
It would be a waste.

258
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,385
We'd be taking an
organ from a stable,

259
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,139
far better candidate
who could really use it.

260
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,274
Edwards. Tell me the indications

261
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,593
for an emergent
traumatic liver transplant.

262
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:49,094
Acute hepatic failure,

263
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,163
portal vein thrombosis,
uncontrollable hemorrhage.

264
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,247
Exactly.

265
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,582
And I don't remember
many case studies

266
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,800
of this procedure
being successful.

267
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,369
Which is why we're not doing it.

268
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:58,103
I disagree with your decision.

269
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,271
Well, I'm sorry, but...

270
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,723
- But what?
- But he's not your patient!

271
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,126
My hands are in his body.
I'd think that'd make him

272
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,228
as much my patient
as yours or Dr. Hunt's.

273
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,968
But it's still my call.

274
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,589
We've got three attendings
here, and a senior resident.

275
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,869
We need to discuss the options.

276
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,354
- No, we don't.
- Why not?

277
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,323
Because you also have
the chief of general surgery

278
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,680
in here, Dr. Webber,
and I outrank you.

279
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,021
Of course.

280
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,642
And I'm saying no.

281
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,156
We are not listing
him for a transplant,

282
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,224
and we're done talking about it.

283
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,768
Do you think you can
stop this retrohepatic bleed?

284
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,450
I can try.

285
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,331
Okay, if it doesn't
work, it's up to the ICU.

286
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,755
If you're not on board,
feel free to leave.

287
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,223
Okay, medium clips. Another one.

288
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,472
Another!

289
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,462
I mean, this isn't working.
The clips aren't even holding.

290
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,276
- Sure hope it was worth it.
- What?

291
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,810
Whatever this guy was doing

292
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,012
that put him on the road
in the middle of the night.

293
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,381
Well, maybe she
didn't have a choice.

294
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,525
"She"?

295
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,718
Oh, Gail. We're still playing.

296
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:20,252
Maybe money becomes tight,

297
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,976
She picks up
extra work at night.

298
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,340
Their father left for the war,

299
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,009
and I couldn't say no
when the boys wanted to go

300
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,133
to a science camp at the museum.

301
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,446
Or she takes her
shift in the evening

302
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,250
at a reception desk
at a nearby hotel.

303
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,401
It isn't all night,
but it's late enough.

304
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,871
- How much longer?
- I need more visualization.

305
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,173
Mobilize the liver
more anteriorly, please.

306
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,479
Yeah, on it.

307
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,450
- You know, this isn't working.
- Just give me a minute.

308
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,530
Hunt,

309
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,382
- why don't you take your turn?
- Excuse me?

310
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,584
Try the game. I mean,
turn John Doe into someone.

311
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,454
I'm not good at
making people up.

312
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,989
Sure you can think of someone.

313
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,241
Richard, I don't need to.

314
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,775
I operated on
hundreds of John Does

315
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,010
when I was in the army,
and I did just fine. Malleable.

316
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,479
<i>Load of crap.</i>

317
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,382
I call load of crap...
giant load of crap.

318
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,651
- On what?
- Whenever we had a John Doe,

319
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,419
first thing you would
do is yell at someone

320
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,687
to go find the patient's tags.

321
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,723
Yeah, 'cause I didn't want to
have to do all the paperwork.

322
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,891
- Uh-huh.
- Where the hell is that Rummel?

323
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,593
Maybe ask for it nicely

324
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,027
and someone
will bring it to you.

325
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,397
I already did, and I
shouldn't have to ask twice.

326
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,383
Dad would say that. Oh,
God! You turned into Dad!

327
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,668
That is a thing
anyone would say.

328
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,239
You got his nose and his chin and
his unreasonably high expectations

329
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,824
- of everyone around you...
- You know what?

330
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,575
That no one could
possibly live up to,

331
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,045
but not his beard.
His beard was good.

332
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,597
- Yours is just sad.
- My beard is fine.

333
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,533
Actually, I shaved this morn...
Why am I even explaining this to you?

334
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,702
Feel free to stop.

335
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,838
I need that Rummel
tourniquet now!

336
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,528
Screw it. I can't reach it.
Okay, I'm gonna open the chest.

337
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,964
- Scissors.
- What? Why?

338
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,166
Total hepatic
vascular isolation.

339
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,668
We're gonna completely stop
the blood supply to the liver,

340
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,287
find the source of the
bleeding, and then we'll repair it.

341
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:02,488
All right, that's smart.

342
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,657
That'll give you
infrapericardial control.

343
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:07,526
Cutting him from stem to
stern right now is reckless.

344
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,412
Just get control of the IVC
from above and below the liver

345
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,747
from the incision we've made!

346
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,832
Yeah, that is what the
textbooks would tell you to do,

347
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,333
but any trauma
surgeon will tell you

348
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,569
it will not work
without a sternotomy.

349
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,037
Edwards, it's all you.

350
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,088
Saw.

351
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,112
Doesn't have to
be pretty, just fast.

352
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,280
We're racing against
the clock here.

353
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,015
I'd love to know
what is so hilarious

354
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,917
when my patient
is fighting for his life!

355
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:35,554
"Trauma surgery is fast
and a race against time."

356
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,623
If it's a race, you're losing,

357
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,692
because you suture
like a dumb tortoise.

358
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,326
I like my sutures to hold.

359
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,645
Oh, and your beefy, fat
hands slow you down?

360
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,981
Do they have to special-order
those gloves for you?

361
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,216
I am trying to teach.

362
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,985
You've never supervised
trainees, so you don't get it.

363
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,125
Oh, I get it.

364
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,989
Enough to know that you don't
know what to do with your patient.

365
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,240
Am I right?

366
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,613
Why are you stopping?

367
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,066
I don't know if this is gonna
work. He's still bleeding.

368
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,568
I wanted to close, and you
said you could isolate the liver.

369
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,792
- I know, but...
- Then do it.

370
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,972
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

371
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,245
- Stop.
- I'm not doing anything.

372
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,164
You're giving me
that look, I don't like it.

373
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:19,468
Mom does it, too.

374
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,151
- Well, you should call Mom more.
- Will you just go away?

375
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,053
You're the one that
brought me here,

376
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,358
and you usually only bring
me around when you feel guilty.

377
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,674
Why are you guilty, Eeyore?

378
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:31,398
- I am working.
- Is it Nathan?

379
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,647
You feel bad about
being nice to him lately.

380
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,231
- Nope.
- It's fine.

381
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,967
Well, I mean... it's not fine.

382
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,535
He cheated on
your little sister, but...

383
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,854
I don't feel guilty
about anything!

384
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:45,679
Oh, well, that's a first.
Well, something's wrong.

385
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:47,948
What is it, then?

386
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:52,736
- New wife isn't working out?
- I'm done talking to you.

387
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,768
You're not gonna choke
anybody again, are you?

388
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,519
Will you shut up? Shut
up for God's sakes.

389
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,593
Hunt!

390
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,327
Uh... Uh...

391
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,314
Suction's full.
Change it, please.

392
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,730
Obviously. She's
what's wrong with you!

393
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,754
No!

394
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,285
What happened?

395
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,687
- An affair?
- No, we're just friends.

396
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:15,711
Well...

397
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:20,081
- I like her.
- Yeah, well, good for you.

398
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,361
You should have married her.

399
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,482
- Then you'd have kids. I
didn't wanna marry her, okay?

400
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,651
I just... I wanted it... I'm trying
to save this guy's life here.

401
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,069
Who the hell is this guy anyway?

402
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,321
What does that matter?

403
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,079
Because I can see his
liver, or what's left of it.

404
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,465
You've really been throwing
out some bold moves.

405
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,546
You're monopolizing the OR,

406
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,048
you're wasting hospital
resources and personnel.

407
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,167
It's not a waste if
we save the patient.

408
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,820
Owen, why won't you call it?
You know where this is headed.

409
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,238
Because you don't stop, okay?

410
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,506
You don't stop until
you've got the final answer.

411
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,910
You don't stop until
you've saved them, or...

412
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,733
you find out that they're...

413
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,750
That they're dead.

414
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
Owen.

415
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,895
This guy isn't me.

416
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,366
- Pressure's dropping.
- I know.

417
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,535
Surgicel, EVARREST.

418
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,253
Give him ten units of cryo.

419
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,821
I see bruising on
his neck and face.

420
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,073
Okay, let's pack him, get
ready to bring him upstairs.

421
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,777
- I miss you.
- No.

422
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,600
Cut it out. You have to focus.

423
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,387
You know what you have to do.

424
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,457
- DeBakey clamp.
- What are you doing?

425
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,858
Edwards, call UNOS.

426
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,610
Send them everything
we have on this patient.

427
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:45,761
- I'm sorry?
- What?

428
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,065
Go now!

429
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,366
- Owen...
- Webber's right.

430
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,801
Transplant's the only
way to save this patient.

431
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,003
I'm removing his liver.
It's only making him worse.

432
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,977
- Scissors.
- Do not make that cut!

433
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,386
Basin.

434
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,417
Clips, please. Boki.

435
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,778
We decided not to list him.

436
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,414
No, you did.

437
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,450
And we were never supposed
to take out the whole liver.

438
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,936
How the hell is the patient
supposed to survive without a liver?

439
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,171
His liver already wasn't
working in his body, Grey.

440
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,107
Removing it while we wait for a
match won't make much of a difference.

441
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,943
How do we know a match
is even gonna come through?

442
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,032
We don't,

443
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,680
but we're gonna do a portacaval
shunt to bypass the blood supply.

444
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,615
That should give
us an hour or so.

445
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,740
I imagine Gail is
pretty tough, right?

446
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,456
Gail is tough as nails,
on her feet 16 hours a day.

447
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,959
She wouldn't let up even
when the pain in her back

448
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,543
started keeping her up at night.

449
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,012
<i>You know, I thought
it was my mattress.</i>

450
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,932
The thing must have
been at least 15 years old,

451
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:17,920
so I replaced it, but...
that didn't help much.

452
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:22,124
She's one of those people
whose bag rattles all the time

453
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,282
because she carries around a
bottle of aspirin everywhere she goes.

454
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:29,013
We got bleeders.

455
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,100
When you said an hour, did
you mean a minute and a half?

456
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,184
- Hang two more units.
- UNOS has everything.

457
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,153
Okay, did they
agree to list him?

458
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,255
He's listed as 1A, and
he's a fairly easy match,

459
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,092
so fingers crossed. There's
blood in his ET tube and nares.

460
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,426
Check his coags and a D-dimer!

461
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,461
Also, the lab tech mentioned
his platelets were clumping,

462
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,546
so I was thinking...

463
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,831
Edwards, you were right.

464
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:48,166
Looks like he's in
DIC. Let's jump back in.

465
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,501
No, actually,
that's not what I...

466
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:50,669
The azygos is bleeding.

467
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:51,987
It can't be. I clamped it.

468
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,322
Well, it's bleeding again.

469
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,890
Must be coming
from his renal vein.

470
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,909
Let me see if I can
feel it from where I am,

471
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,053
got a better angle.

472
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,719
Something else might be going
on. There is blood in his urine too.

473
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,988
- And the neck bruises.
- They can't hear you.

474
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:10,811
If you want them to listen, like,
really listen, you gotta be louder.

475
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:15,426
Found it. It's small, but it's
definitely a venous bleed.

476
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,163
- Really? Is it the azygos?
- It is.

477
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:20,248
- I got it. Give me a tie.
- I got it.

478
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,567
- You don't trust me?
- Not really.

479
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,984
I did what was
best for the patient.

480
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,353
You lost your damn mind.

481
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,377
This tissue's falling
apart in my hands.

482
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,559
We'll clamp this, and then
I'm gonna secure it with a tie.

483
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,860
- Move your hands.
- Dr. Hunt.

484
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,362
Just a second, Edwards!

485
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,797
Just tell him! You
know what it is.

486
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,541
I don't think the patient's
decompensating because of DIC.

487
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,412
We spent months
reading about it.

488
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,322
- You know it. It's...
- It's his platelets.

489
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,624
We'll give him more.

490
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,888
No, the patient has
a platelet disorder.

491
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,828
There's this cool lab test

492
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,830
that helps prove the
platelets don't clump.

493
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:53,782
The lab already saw
abnormal findings,

494
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,567
they can confirm it
with the blood sample.

495
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:56,668
Okay, fine, fine.

496
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,670
For now, just get in
there with some suction,

497
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,689
so I can see what
I'm doing. Damn it!

498
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,945
It's too friable.

499
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,160
We need to take him up to ICU until
we find a more permanent solution.

500
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,494
That won't work!

501
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,199
According to chapter 21 of
<i>Hemostasis and Thrombosis...</i>

502
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,683
<i>Hemostasis and Thrombosis.</i>

503
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:14,419
Dr. Grey, if we close
him, he's gonna get worse.

504
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:15,704
Okay, push bicarb.

505
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,006
You know what
Nurse Paula would say.

506
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,675
Owen, he can't handle any more.

507
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,310
She'd yell, "If you got
something to say..."

508
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,813
- I think he can. I think...
- "...speak up!"

509
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,831
I think I'm gonna watch
you kill this patient.

510
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:29,223
Okay, stop, all of
you! Listen to me!

511
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,529
Something you needed to say?

512
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,462
Repairing the azygos
won't stop his bleeding at all.

513
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,565
And you can take him to the
ICU, but he's still deteriorating.

514
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,617
This patient has an
autoimmune disease,

515
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:49,104
specifically idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura.

516
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:53,831
- ITP is extremely rare.
- According to a study in Ku...

517
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,110
- Kuwait.
- Kuwait,

518
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:02,205
there's an incidence of 125 cases
per one million people per year.

519
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,185
It's more common than we think.

520
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,021
Edwards, the body is shutting
down because of the trauma.

521
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,624
- Talk fast.
- That is because

522
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,391
the trauma is the
only thing you see,

523
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,444
because trauma is all
that you are used to seeing.

524
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:15,047
I see a body that's attacking
itself from the inside,

525
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,481
and every time
we give him blood,

526
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,783
his body chews up the
platelets one by one.

527
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:22,154
It's like we're filling a
giant tank with a hole in it,

528
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:23,922
and the only thing
we need to do to stop it

529
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:27,492
is to give him steroids, a lot
of them as soon as possible.

530
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:29,545
- He doesn't have a liver.
- Thanks to you.

531
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,313
If we administer steroids,

532
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,948
then without being
able to metabolize,

533
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,183
- it could become toxic...
- And before you argue

534
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,284
about how risky it is,

535
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,953
let me just say, we
have very little time,

536
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,221
and you should listen to me,
because I know all about this stuff.

537
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,357
If I were on the table,
I'd want the risky thing.

538
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,031
- I'd want to survive.
- Yes.

539
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,313
Where did you
get all this again?

540
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:51,182
When you're stuck in a
bed for your whole childhood,

541
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:54,446
you kind of get obsessed
with the thing that put you there.

542
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,878
I read... a lot.

543
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,580
Good catch, Edwards.

544
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,033
Thank you.

545
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,220
Send up a blood sample and
give him a gram of prednisone.

546
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,488
This is a reach.

547
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,140
Then you and Webber
should be all over it.

548
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,324
And we'll need
some more platelets.

549
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,195
Dr. Grey, we might have an ID.

550
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,997
A woman came in, said her
husband was working late,

551
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,932
then he never came
home. She saw the news.

552
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,396
Go ahead.

553
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,363
He's in V-tach.

554
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,186
<i>I mean, this really hurts.</i>

555
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,138
This isn't normal, is it?

556
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,192
And it's not just my back.

557
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,205
I can barely get a pulse.

558
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,907
Push 300 of amiodarone.

559
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,208
Did we push the steroids?

560
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,609
It won't matter. It's
because of his liver,

561
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,994
or the fact that he
doesn't have one.

562
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,996
Okay, internal
paddles on standby.

563
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,297
Look, we still have time.

564
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,088
Go find out if he
belongs to them.

565
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,024
Something's wrong...

566
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,475
really wrong.

567
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,348
- He's in V-fib!
- Starting heart massage.

568
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,301
- Okay, internal paddles?
- Saline! Charge to 20.

569
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,836
Okay, clear.

570
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:24,292
- No change.
- Push one of epi. Let's charge to 30.

571
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,861
Clear!

572
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,230
Damn it! Push another epi.

573
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,415
It's him!

574
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,568
The wife confirmed
the ID from the photo.

575
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:36,070
- What's his name?
- Carl. Carl Henley.

576
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,574
Are we done with
Gail? Is Gail Carl now?

577
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,627
- Are there children?
- A little boy and a girl.

578
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,579
They're with her
downstairs in the lobby.

579
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,640
<i>Okay, charge to 50!</i>

580
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,910
Clear!

581
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,062
Still no pulse.

582
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,513
The shunt put too
much strain on his heart.

583
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,881
Liver's only been
out for 20 minutes.

584
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,567
The shunt will bypass
everything for at least an hour.

585
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,120
And then what? We
still have no donor.

586
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,105
Not to mention, Carl
probably has ITP.

587
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,540
And how was I
supposed to know that?

588
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,257
Edwards didn't have a
problem figuring it out.

589
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:14,693
Can Edwards not be involved?

590
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,479
Every step of the way, you
and Webber just took over.

591
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,181
- Grey, what is your problem?
- My problem?

592
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,170
Ever since I
walked into this OR,

593
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,573
you've been negative at every
step, shooting down every approach.

594
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:30,075
What do you think
I'm doing right now,

595
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,660
massaging this
heart for exercise?

596
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,244
Dr. Grey, you've been
doing that for a while.

597
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,330
- You want me to take over?
- No! Go again at 50.

598
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,065
Okay. Clear!

599
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,619
I've done everything I
can to keep Carl alive.

600
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,388
It's a miracle
he's come this far

601
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,290
considering the shape
he was in when he got here

602
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:46,674
and all these Hail Marys.

603
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,743
Since when have I
taught you to play it safe?

604
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,378
You taught me to do no harm.

605
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,397
Look, as long as Gail
is on this table, you'll...

606
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,272
Carl! His name is Carl.

607
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,303
<i>Where is Mommy?</i>

608
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,377
She's with the doctors, sweetie.

609
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,296
Is my daddy with them?

610
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,649
Let's just wait for your
mom to come back, okay?

611
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,614
Someone should
go talk to the family.

612
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:11,232
We're in the middle
of resuscitating him.

613
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,367
Someone needs to tell
them what's happening

614
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,742
and prepare them for
what's about to happen.

615
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,709
- We've got a rhythm!
- Will it last?

616
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,377
It's faint, but
it'll do for now.

617
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,579
Okay, let's close him
and rush him to the ICU.

618
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,883
- With no liver.
- It's our only option.

619
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,973
It's time to
compromise, for all of us.

620
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,335
Hey, guys. Hey.

621
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,926
Where's Daddy? Is he here?

622
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,813
Remember, Daddy was driving...

623
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,933
- in his car?
- Yeah, is he coming home soon?

624
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,037
No, he was in an accident.

625
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,323
Oh.

626
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,644
Well, is he hurt?

627
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:25,946
He was.

628
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:31,150
Are the doctors fixing
him? Is he going to surgery?

629
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,367
- He's hyperkalemic. Push calcium.
- And one amp of bicarb!

630
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,557
- How are his MAPs?
- Barely in the 50s.

631
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,350
No, they can't fix him.

632
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,549
Then you should go
in there and fix him.

633
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,508
- Zola...
- You fix everyone.

634
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,727
Zola, I can't fix him.

635
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,751
Why?

636
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:09,723
I can't fix him...

637
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,226
because...

638
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,646
Because no one can fix him...

639
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,719
Because he's dead, Zola.

640
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,278
Daddy died.

641
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:08,198
You didn't make Gail up.

642
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,810
You come up with
what you need to.

643
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,475
Whatever helps. An old patient.

644
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:20,059
"Someone good."

645
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,801
<i>It's okay, son.</i>

646
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,438
You were only ten years old.
There was nothing you could do.

647
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:45,352
My mother, she hated doctors.

648
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:48,105
Or at least that's
what she said.

649
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,369
You know, I think she
just didn't want to worry us.

650
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,926
We thought everything was fine.

651
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,195
Okay. Wound-vac, please.

652
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,626
She still taught music
classes every day,

653
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,130
yelled at us about our
homework, fixed us dinner.

654
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,955
We grew up listening to that
damn cello all day, every day.

655
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,109
She played it for hours...

656
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:12,462
<i>Bach...</i>

657
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,280
Vivaldi...

658
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,282
Elgar.

659
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:19,720
She would shut
the bedroom door...

660
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:22,367
and tell us not to knock

661
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,786
unless someone was
bleeding or something's on fire.

662
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,845
I hated it...

663
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,782
that constant drone
of classical music...

664
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,868
until one day it stopped.

665
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,905
The house was silent.

666
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,059
I missed it.

667
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,080
That's when I knew it
meant something was wrong.

668
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,366
What was wrong with her?

669
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,369
You're the doctor, you tell me.

670
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,634
Forty-six year-old woman,
backache, sudden weight loss,

671
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:57,869
fatigue...

672
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,158
Multiple myeloma?

673
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,142
Breast cancer?

674
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,882
Or... were there any
signs of jaundice?

675
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:08,318
Good question. Yes, there was.

676
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,347
Was it gallstones?

677
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,200
Did one of them get
trapped in her bile duct?

678
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,424
No.

679
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,812
It wasn't hepatitis, was it?

680
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:24,284
It was pancreatic cancer.
Stage three or four.

681
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,192
She had six months.

682
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,956
Pretty sure we're almost
done here if you need to take...

683
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,146
I'm fine.

684
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,510
We just need to finish
the... The closure.

685
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,312
The three of us can handle it.

686
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:42,502
Wait.

687
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:46,934
We should stop closing.

688
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,536
You've been pushing
to close him for hours.

689
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,038
I know, and now I'm
pushing to stay open

690
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:52,223
because I think we can
save him right here, right now.

691
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,225
Meredith, we've
tried everything.

692
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,327
We haven't tried
a liver transplant.

693
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,812
But we don't have a donor liver.

694
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,316
We have a liver there. Boki.

695
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,867
The right lobe is
completely destroyed.

696
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:05,020
We do a partial
liver transplant.

697
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:08,123
Look, we ditch the right
lobe, we repair the left,

698
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,558
and graft the remaining
vessels. It'll work.

699
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,977
But we couldn't repair
it inside of his body.

700
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,529
How are we gonna
do it on the outside?

701
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,664
The main damage was behind
it, where we couldn't reach it.

702
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,183
Now we have total
access. This'll work.

703
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:23,409
We've done liver autotransplants
with tumors, but with trauma?

704
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,140
It's risky. I've
never seen it done.

705
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,115
Because people give up
by now. It's a Hail Mary.

706
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:36,167
Hail Mary. Your turn.

707
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:38,335
Okay, great. Webber, you and I
are gonna go at that back table.

708
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,154
I need a scrub
nurse and irrigation.

709
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,039
And, Edwards, you and
Hunt are gonna go prep

710
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:44,314
for the anastomoses.
We gotta work really fast.

711
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,802
Nice save, Grey.

712
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,252
Should have
thought of it sooner.

713
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:38,578
All right, I'll get him up to ICU,
and... then I can update the family.

714
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:41,075
I can update the family.
Thank you, Edwards.

715
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,226
Thank you.

716
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,367
All right, let's go. Thank you.

717
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,553
Sorry... for things that I said.

718
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,471
It's okay.

719
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,191
No, it's not. You were right.

720
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,379
I was tired, but... I have
to learn to push past it.

721
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,897
And you did.

722
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,249
Have you always done
that with your mother?

723
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,472
I didn't used to.

724
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:24,541
Back then...

725
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,595
I was trained to
depersonalize the patient.

726
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,112
Tissue was tissue,
faces were covered,

727
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:36,369
and blood was a
mess on the floor.

728
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,405
We were to stay focused,

729
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,925
and our hands were
inside just mannequins.

730
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,226
So, what changed?

731
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:51,084
One afternoon, I was in the OR,
and we lost a patient on the table,

732
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:54,098
and I went along
to inform the family,

733
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:56,055
you know, tell them
the horrible news...

734
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,624
and I was numb.

735
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,080
I watched them sob
and hold each other and...

736
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,316
And it didn't
affect me... at all.

737
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,188
That patient died from the
same thing my mother died from...

738
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,891
and I was a robot.

739
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,096
After that...

740
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,116
I started changing the rules...

741
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,886
and it made me a better surgeon.

742
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,956
<i>We've all hit that
point of exhaustion...</i>

743
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,743
<i>the point where nothing
makes sense anymore.</i>

744
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,680
You've saved her now...

745
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,697
about 1,000 times.

746
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,955
I suppose.

747
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,494
Goodnight, Meredith.

748
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,509
Goodnight.

749
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,478
<i>Your body hurts, your
brain becomes foggy,</i>

750
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,869
<i>and you feel like you're
trapped in a tunnel...</i>

751
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,440
<i>when all you want is your bed.</i>

752
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,578
<i>So... how do you keep going?</i>

753
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,184
<i>How do you not just
sit down and give up?</i>

754
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,423
<i>Sometimes it's easy.</i>

755
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,392
<i>Sometimes you play
games in your head.</i>

756
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,549
<i>You make up someone...</i>

757
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,252
<i>someone good.</i>

758
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:33,854
Hi.

759
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,146
I'm sorry. I didn't think
anyone was in here.

760
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,769
<i>Whatever you need...</i>

761
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,338
It's all yours.

762
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,024
<i>To keep you going.</i>
