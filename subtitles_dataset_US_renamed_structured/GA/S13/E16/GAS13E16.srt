1
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:07,239
<i>Freezing. Choking.
Getting tongue-tied.</i>

2
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:09,652
<i>It's what we call it
when your mind goes</i>

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,276
<i>from brilliant to blank.</i>

4
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,913
We should only be
gone a day. Two max.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,295
If you need me before
then, you can just...

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,451
Please...

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,082
Harriet's dying for some
quality time with her grand mom.

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,850
I could've just
taken her with me.

9
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,963
<i>You can prepare all you want.</i>

10
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,141
Aren't you gonna
say, like, "Go, child,

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,509
"you're being ridiculous"?

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,495
<i>But the feeling can still
hit you, out of nowhere.</i>

13
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,068
If you're having
second thoughts,

14
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:40,117
we could bring
your patient here.

15
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,581
No, I told you, we've got a...

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,788
a girl who needs a throat
transplant and a donor

17
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,212
in the same exact hospital.

18
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,581
We can't risk
moving either of them.

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,682
I know.

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,533
I just meant...

21
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,031
<i>So when it hits you, when
your mind shuts down,</i>

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,017
<i>when you open your mouth
and no words come out,</i>

23
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,218
<i>the good news is...</i>

24
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,082
If you have something
to say, say it.

25
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:05,163
Nothing.

26
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,817
I'm sure you'll be just fine.

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,986
<i>It happens to all of us.</i>

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,422
Wait. Where is Grey?
Since when is April coming?

29
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:39,776
Oh. Grey called to tell
me that Zola has the flu.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,178
And you didn't
think to tell me that?

31
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,780
I knew you'd need a
capable surgeon to assist

32
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,399
- and April's more than capable.
- It's unbelievable.

33
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,151
- Hello. Hi, Catherine.
- Hi.

34
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,836
You have everything you need?

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,176
Yes, of course.

36
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,162
Okay. All right.

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,849
You ready?

38
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,699
- I'll put her in the car.
- Jackson, go.

39
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,501
Miss Harriet and I have plans.

40
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,885
No medical journals, all right?

41
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,404
I don't need her looking at
flayed open surgical fields.

42
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,878
Give me my child.

43
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,499
Bye, baby.

44
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,044
Bye, baby.

45
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,625
Can I take your bag, Dr. Grey?

46
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,194
Oh, uh, it's Dr. Kepner.

47
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,562
I'm so sorry. The
manifest said...

48
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,652
It's okay. Dr. Grey got
hijacked by my mother.

49
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,890
This is amazing.

50
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,906
Why have we never
taken your plane before?

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,480
It's... it's not my plane.

52
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,607
It's your name right out there.

53
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,619
Right on the wing,
great big letters: Avery.

54
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,482
- Yeah, but...
- So it's your plane.

55
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,116
No, it's the family plane.

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,860
- It's not my plane.
- Well, yeah.

57
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,867
It's Catherine's, too. I mean...

58
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,660
I mean, she did make the
Avery Foundation what it is.

59
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,928
Seems right she
should get to fly

60
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,719
- anywhere she wants like this.
- Really?

61
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,555
Can we not talk about
my mother right now?

62
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,775
Yes, I will have some champagne.

63
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,344
You should not
have any champagne.

64
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,248
We are going
straight to the hospital.

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,549
- Uh, club soda?
- Same for me, please, Katie.

66
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,253
- Thank you.
- Coming right up.

67
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:47,554
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

68
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,994
Here are your
charts, Doctor Avery.

69
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,531
- Dr. Grey.
- Kepner.

70
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,844
- Right. Sorry.
- I... I know his name

71
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,162
because it's on
all our stationery.

72
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,186
Right.

73
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,150
A patient and a donor,
two of them here together,

74
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,885
same time, same
day, perfect match.

75
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,721
It's like winning the lottery.

76
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,456
I mean, if you call
a brain-dead kid

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,008
a lottery ticket, then, yeah.

78
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,074
Of course.

79
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,127
And it's a horrible
loss. Uh, that was...

80
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,391
I'm just thrilled that you're
both here to make this possible.

81
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,133
The donor patient's room
is at the end of this ICU...

82
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,551
And you have the
donor consent forms?

83
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:21,771
Yeah, before we get to that, uh,
Mr. Young is going to need you

84
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,174
to explain to him why there's
nothing more you can do for his son.

85
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,559
Why? No one's told him that yet?

86
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,794
I thought he knew
we were coming.

87
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,395
Well, he does,
It... It's just that,

88
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,363
he's had a bit of trouble
accepting what's happened,

89
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,182
as I'm sure you can understand.

90
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,684
You told me very clearly

91
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,135
that the patient's
father was on board.

92
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,588
Now, hold on. I never
said that he agreed.

93
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,673
- I merely said...
- So he thinks that we're coming

94
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,092
to save his kid,
not take his organs.

95
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,595
I thought that once you
had examined the boy,

96
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,019
it'd be better coming from you.

97
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:49,866
I'm just glad you're here.

98
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,218
I mean, Dr. Corridan said
that there's nothing he could do.

99
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:53,386
Then he said there
was another doctor

100
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,704
who was coming in from Seattle.

101
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,579
I was like, "It's great,"
right? That There's hope.

102
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,861
So, okay. What's the plan?

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,967
I mean, you... You...
You wanna do some tests?

104
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,182
Surgery? Obviously,
you want to examine him

105
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,068
but how long before
you think he'll wake up?

106
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,642
- Mr. Young, I'm af...
- Eric, Eric, please.

107
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,157
- Eric...
- It's his birthday.

108
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,380
Did I tell you that?

109
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,550
Double digits, he kept saying.

110
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,165
I mean, he was having the time
of his life up on that mountain.

111
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,455
"Just one more run, Dad...

112
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,190
Just one more run..."

113
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,288
Eric, I'm afraid we
have some difficult news.

114
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,463
We've looked at Brian's
scans, and unfortunately,

115
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,448
Dr. Corridan was right.

116
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:38,272
There's nothing that
we can do for your son.

117
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,787
Oh my...

118
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,369
Then why are you here?

119
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,154
We are here...

120
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,029
because we wanted
to talk to you about...

121
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,556
donating your son's organs.

122
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:58,991
No.

123
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,760
You're here...

124
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,156
to help my son.

125
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,208
I understand how
difficult this is...

126
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,093
Difficult? If you understood

127
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,361
what you were
asking, you wouldn't...

128
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,035
- Mr. Young...
- I know what we're asking.

129
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:15,918
When all you want is to
have him back, to hold him.

130
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,820
I know the thought
of letting any part

131
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,084
of him go feels...

132
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,312
impossible.

133
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,694
You're the only one that
can make this decision.

134
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,961
We understand that.

135
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,063
We wouldn't ask
you to do something

136
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,648
that you're not
comfortable doing.

137
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:31,735
And if ultimately you don't
want to do this, that's fine.

138
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
We are here to
support you, either way.

139
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:36,961
All I know is...

140
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,732
is when I lost my son...

141
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,036
I just needed to find
a little meaning in it.

142
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,975
Where do I sign?

143
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,895
This way to Caroline's room.

144
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,519
Her parents are very
eager to meet you, Dr. Avery.

145
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,104
This is Risa and Mary Hodges.

146
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,538
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you both.

147
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,423
Listen, we're grateful
that you're here,

148
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,059
that you came all this way,

149
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,627
but our daughter's
met dozens of doctors,

150
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,997
each one ordering more tests,
putting her through more hell,

151
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,566
making promises they
had no business making...

152
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,871
Mary, maybe let
the guy say hello.

153
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,412
She needs the tumor gone.

154
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:00,840
But she needs her vocal cords.

155
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:01,875
She needs her voice.

156
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,193
So if this throat
transplant isn't real...

157
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,695
I mean, if it's just another
rug you're gonna pull out

158
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,599
- from under her, then...
- You're scared.

159
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,381
I totally understand.

160
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,217
Let me, um... let me start over.

161
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,037
It's my fault. I'm Dr. Avery.

162
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,121
I am a double board
certified plastic surgeon

163
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,579
and ENT specialist.

164
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,331
I'm also a dad.

165
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,844
Now, I've come a long way

166
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,063
because I know that I
can help your daughter.

167
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,247
And I do not make
promises that I can't keep.

168
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,073
I just... I still don't know
if this is the right thing.

169
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,858
The laryngectomy
is still the safest...

170
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,243
No, Mary, we agreed. They
are not taking her vocal cords.

171
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,184
What if you go in
there, Dr. Avery...

172
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,700
and you cut open her throat,
and the transplant doesn't work?

173
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,919
In that case, we'd be
looking at a permanent trach.

174
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,210
Permanent. See? And
you want to risk that?

175
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,362
He wouldn't do it if he
didn't think that he could.

176
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,859
- Would you?
- This procedure gives her

177
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,361
the best chance at survival,

178
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,146
at getting her voice back,

179
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,450
her whole life back.

180
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,756
Mary, come on.

181
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay.

182
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,319
- Why are you doing that?
- Doing what?

183
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:22,171
Telling those moms you're a dad
to charm your way into the room,

184
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,090
- using Samuel to...
- It's my life.

185
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,842
- It happened.
- Yeah, it's my life, too,

186
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,748
- but I don't use it to...
- To what?

187
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,979
Help that dad make his decision?

188
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,997
Help those moms find
a little bit of comfort?

189
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,667
April, if you don't like
it, that is your problem.

190
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:37,453
I'm not the one that asked you
to come here in the first place.

191
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,223
Look, we have tonight
to prep for the surgery.

192
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,543
I have somewhere that I
need to be. I will find you later.

193
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,195
What... where do you need to be?

194
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,019
- It's Montana.
- I'll find you later.

195
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,111
- April.
- I laid out all
of Caroline's charts.

196
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,301
Chinese food is on the way.

197
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,901
<i>I know things are not the
greatest between us right now,</i>

198
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,435
<i>but if we're gonna
do the surgery...</i>

199
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,059
Yeah, no, I need to prep alone.

200
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,128
<i>- I'll talk to you tomorrow.</i>
- Um...

201
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,197
Okay.

202
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,674
Carl!

203
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,447
I thought your doctor said
to cut down on the red meat.

204
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,229
That's why I'm sharing.

205
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:50,432
You good?

206
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,217
On the house for new customers.

207
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,590
Well, enjoy that.

208
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,801
Hello?

209
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,118
No, this is Dr. Kepner.

210
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,396
No, I don't... I don't know.
Have you tried his room?

211
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I'm sorry. What?

212
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,108
There was a lesion
on the donor's throat,

213
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:25,278
which means the transplant
is no longer an option.

214
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,913
- I am so sorry...
- Don't tell us you're sorry.

215
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,699
You talked me into this.

216
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,117
You said this was the solution!

217
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,120
And now, I mean,
if there's no donor,

218
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,339
- how do you fix our daughter?
- Mary, please, stop yelling.

219
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,391
If there's a time to
yell, Risa, this is it.

220
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,828
The best way to help
your daughter is to do

221
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:45,431
- the laryngectomy,
which means...
- No, we know what that means.

222
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:49,068
That is removing her vocal
cords and her ability to speak.

223
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,804
And we told Dr. Avery
it's not an option.

224
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:55,747
At this point, I really
think it is her best chance.

225
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,035
And... and what about Dr. Avery?
Is that what he thinks, too?

226
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,950
I don't know where you
are or what you're doing,

227
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,974
but call me!

228
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,866
Damn it!

229
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,353
Oh my... where have you been?

230
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,980
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

231
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,765
Corridan's called a dozen times.

232
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,824
- I have been calling, texting...
- Calm down. You sent one text.

233
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,363
No organs, no surgery, right?

234
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,759
Didn't hear anything after
that, so I figured I'd have a drink.

235
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,183
Uh, battery died.

236
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,302
Well, that's not very
helpful now, is it?

237
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,715
- You're drunk.
- You're pissed.

238
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,851
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh, I am.

239
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,287
We lost the donor,
Caroline's repeat scans

240
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,522
show more extensive
esophageal invasion,

241
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,340
her parents are a wreck, and...

242
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,743
and you're... you're
here getting drunk?

243
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,967
Jackson.

244
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,687
I got off work,
and I had a beer,

245
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,188
April.

246
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,286
Four beers, actually, and
some whiskey on top of that.

247
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,804
What is wrong with you?

248
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,040
Nothing. Nothing wrong with me.

249
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,291
We have a patient!

250
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,331
- No. Not us, me.
- Who's counting on us!

251
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,745
And there's no organs,
there's nothing I can do,

252
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,347
so just leave me the hell alone.

253
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,236
I mean, this isn't you. You
don't get wasted in bars

254
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,621
- and bail on your pat...
- I didn't bail on anyone!

255
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,311
So, how we doing over here?

256
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,228
- Dessert?
- No, he's going home

257
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,185
to sober up. He has work, right?

258
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,215
In that case, let
me call you a cab.

259
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,479
I'm walking.

260
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,130
Can I get you something?

261
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,016
No, I'm good.

262
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,344
He left his book.

263
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,601
<i>Techniques in
Oropharyngeal Surgery.</i>

264
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,835
Hmm.

265
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,109
Airway reconstruction?

266
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,140
Uh, throat transplant.

267
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,624
Uh, supposed to be
a throat transplant.

268
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:53,709
It just got scrapped.

269
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,616
Total laryngectomy
not an option, huh?

270
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,654
I was a surgeon. That
was many lifetimes ago.

271
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,163
Really?

272
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,144
You gave that up for this?

273
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,077
Well, this isn't
all that different.

274
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,723
People come to you in need,
you provide them comfort.

275
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,482
They leave here feeling
better than when they came.

276
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:14,001
And the hours are
better, and nobody dies...

277
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,870
That I know of.

278
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,003
- Welcome to Bozeman, Doctor...
- Uh, Kepner. April Kepner.

279
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,267
Robert Avery.

280
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,597
Avery. I'm, I'm sorry.
Like the hospital?

281
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,700
Kinda. Once upon a time.

282
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,435
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

283
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,437
I... I will.

284
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,359
We still need to find
a way to help Caroline.

285
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,516
- What time is it?
- It's early.

286
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:06,966
- What?
- Are you okay?

287
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,190
Yeah, I'm fine.

288
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,281
Hurry up and get dressed.
We should get to work.

289
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,328
Sure.

290
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:15,908
I hate this. I don't see
how we could do anything,

291
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,649
but the laryngectomy,
but I hate the laryngectomy.

292
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,930
Seems like she'd
have had a better shot

293
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,264
if you'd taken
her to Grey Sloan.

294
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,399
She's not stable enough to move.

295
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,950
- You know that.
- No, not now.

296
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,318
I'm just saying, I don't know

297
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,302
why we had to come
all the way out here.

298
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,393
Do you?

299
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,626
The last time I worked on
a kid with a throat tumor,

300
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,033
we did a staged procedure.

301
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,646
I did a radical excision
and a trach first,

302
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,981
and then we did a skin flap.

303
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,616
She doesn't have
that kind of time.

304
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,867
Yeah, I, I know. I'm just...

305
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,569
And if we'd gotten
to this last night...

306
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,871
Then we still would not have
had enough time for the flap.

307
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,572
I mean, come on.
You made your point.

308
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,075
I was drunk, April. I
get it. I don't need you

309
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,377
- to monitor everything...
- I'm not!

310
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,679
I am just trying to come
up with a fix for our patient,

311
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,981
regardless of the fact that
you don't even want me here.

312
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,599
And yet you're still here.

313
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,134
Cause you and my mother
are such good friends

314
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,753
that she chose you instead
of asking me who I want.

315
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:03,338
Oh, my God! I was
friends with her long

316
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,679
before you and I were even...

317
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,242
I respect her!

318
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,993
- I respect what she's built...
- Great!

319
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,857
- And what the means...
- Good for you!

320
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,147
You know, your mom
says the difference

321
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,933
between the two of us is
that you were born with money,

322
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,985
and I had to earn it. It's
why she and I are more alike.

323
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,637
You think this is a contest
between you and me?

324
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,038
Who's the most alike?
Who's the most appreciative?

325
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,808
No, Jackson!
That is not the point

326
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,209
- of any of this...
- Shut up.

327
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,611
What? Don't tell me to shut up.

328
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,475
- Are you kidding me with...
- Shut up.

329
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,017
If her airway's collapsed, we'll
have to crike her right away.

330
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,285
Take her straight to the O.R.

331
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,737
Dr. Corridan, what
are we looking at?

332
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,056
The nurses paged us, 911.
What is happening here?

333
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,741
Caroline is being discharged.

334
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,809
What! No, she's not
stable enough to move.

335
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,628
The doctors at
Baylor think she is.

336
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,279
What doctors at Baylor?

337
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,336
The one we called.

338
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,616
I spoke with Dr. Rapkin there.

339
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,918
She has a new method she
believes will help Caroline.

340
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,086
Aggressive chemo radiation

341
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,488
with staged excision
after two weeks.

342
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,939
Yes, we have
already rejected that...

343
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:56,664
We've gone through
every possible alternative.

344
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,363
Risa, there comes a point
when you just have to hear...

345
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,985
You think I don't hear you?

346
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,788
All of you?

347
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,757
My daughter has no voice.

348
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,692
We are her voice.

349
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,824
We are not gonna let her down

350
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,948
just because we
stopped asking questions.

351
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,685
We asked, you said no.

352
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,537
We're leaving.

353
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,135
They have the right to move
her if they feel it's necessary.

354
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,220
No. It is too dangerous
to move her anywhere.

355
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,872
That girl could choke
on her tumor, okay?

356
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,107
If you move her,
she could die. Period.

357
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,994
Okay. So you... you'll
need to fill out an AMA form.

358
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,484
Uh, legal reasons.

359
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,203
Tell us what you have.

360
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,372
Tell us why we should stay.

361
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,511
We've been down
every road, every one.

362
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,375
There are no other options.

363
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,711
We do the laryngectomy,
Caroline lives.

364
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,775
It's that simple.

365
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,581
We're going to Baylor.

366
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,368
It's what she wants,
what we all want.

367
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,912
We'll fix it. We
will fix her voice.

368
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,826
Listen, what Dr. Avery
means is that...

369
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,294
I have an idea is what I mean.

370
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,731
I told you that I don't
break my promises, right?

371
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,021
I promise you this.

372
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,267
I have an idea that I
think is gonna work.

373
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,670
All right, I'll call
Dr. Rapkin. I will.

374
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,774
I'll call everybody that I can.

375
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,758
This is gonna work, okay?

376
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,061
Give Dr. Kepner
and I a little bit of time

377
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,535
and do not move her.

378
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,834
Please.

379
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,211
We get on a plane
tomorrow at three.

380
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,497
You've got till then.

381
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,320
Okay. So what's your idea?

382
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,837
I don't have one.

383
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,820
- What? You just...
- Yes, I lied,

384
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,124
but they can't move her,

385
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,489
and I just needed
a little more time.

386
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,741
What is the matter with you?

387
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,792
Why are you
torturing this poor girl?

388
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,846
You... You just made a promise
that you know you can't keep,

389
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,748
- that you know we can't deliver.
- We can find a way to deliver.

390
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,252
Where? Where? Where
are we gonna find it?

391
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,848
At the diner?

392
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,271
What?

393
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,863
When are you gonna tell
me that you found your father?

394
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,678
Your father, Jackson, your
long-lost, deadbeat dad.

395
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,281
The distinguished, hippie
former surgeon Dr. Avery,

396
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,049
who slings hash
at the local diner.

397
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,233
He's the whole
reason we're here!

398
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,290
- No, I came here
to help a patient.
- Don't lie to me.

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,440
And worse yet, don't lie to
Caroline and her parents.

400
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,762
We are only here 'cause
of your freakin' father,

401
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,906
and now that kid is gonna die.

402
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,913
- Night, night, baby.
- Sleep well.

403
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,281
Be good for Grandma, okay?

404
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,265
- Love you.
- Love you, nugget.

405
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,085
Why didn't you just tell me?

406
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,351
All right.

407
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Forget it.

408
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,868
"You good?"

409
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,337
What?

410
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,686
I sat there, staring at
him across the room.

411
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,327
Figured, you know,
eventually, he'll...

412
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,863
see me, recognize...

413
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,782
something.

414
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,500
My face, my eyes, just...

415
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,936
anything and that's...

416
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,654
all I got was...

417
00:20:58,891 --> 00:20:59,891
"You good?"

418
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,761
Like, literally, that's it.

419
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,213
No recognition, nothing.

420
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,633
Like I was...

421
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,321
anyone.

422
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:15,657
No one.

423
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,459
- So talk to him.
- Yeah, I tried.

424
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,178
I, I wanted to.

425
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,548
I went, and I sat there...

426
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,883
waited...

427
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,473
I got a million things
to say to that guy.

428
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,226
Thinking about it my whole...

429
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,794
Tell him what an ass he was

430
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,368
for walking out
on his family, his...

431
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,054
kid.

432
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,926
He couldn't hack it as
an Avery. Join the club.

433
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,730
Could still show up.

434
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,462
Pick something...
birthday, graduation.

435
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,601
Show the hell up.

436
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,093
That's what I was
gonna say, all that.

437
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,030
Then, uh...

438
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,769
Then he...

439
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,172
He looked me right in the eye.

440
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,149
He doesn't know his own son.

441
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:34,452
So make him know you.

442
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,302
- This is stupid.
- No, it's not.

443
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,410
- All right, well, you can go.
- I'm not going.

444
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,309
We're not married.
It's not like who I talk to

445
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,144
or don't talk to is any of
your business anyway.

446
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:09,147
Yeah, it is my business,
because we have a job to do,

447
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,451
and you're not here.

448
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,784
And you're not gonna be here
till you say what you need to say.

449
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,007
So go say it.

450
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
Then it will be over...

451
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,435
and we can get back to work.

452
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:42,703
Hey, back again.

453
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,769
Sorry, we're closed.

454
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:52,323
I've got some meatloaf
left over in the back.

455
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,942
I could fix up something
to go if you'd like...

456
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,015
I'm Jackson Avery.

457
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,153
I'm your son.

458
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:07,294
Oh, my God.

459
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,244
Oh, my God.

460
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,549
Jackson.

461
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,054
Oh, son.

462
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,404
Oh, Jackson!

463
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,830
Oh, good God!

464
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,095
Oh, my God. Come
inside. Oh, Jackson.

465
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,287
I'm sorry, it's just my brain
is going a little... You know?

466
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,685
You want to sit? Of course
not. You've been sitting.

467
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,627
Why didn't you just... I
mean, I don't blame you, but...

468
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,298
I'm sorry, I do not
know what to say here.

469
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,780
Are you here for work,
too, at the hospital?

470
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:52,490
You and your friend, uh,
April, was it? The surgeon?

471
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,575
Yeah.

472
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,226
You're a surgeon.

473
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,910
I am, yeah. Plastics and ENT.

474
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,835
Of course. Of course,
you are. Good God.

475
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:08,755
And your mom? Is she here, too?

476
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,308
This your place?

477
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,324
It gives me a roof over my head
and weekends off to play golf,

478
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,593
food on the table.
Speaking of which...

479
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,150
Oh, wait right there.

480
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:25,991
My own blend.

481
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,636
I've been working
with these local guys.

482
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,380
Great guys. You'd like them.

483
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:32,841
I don't know why
I just said that.

484
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,547
I've no idea who you'd like.

485
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,262
Anyway, we're thinking of
opening up a little business

486
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,481
on the side. Nothing
big, you know? Just...

487
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,825
putting it out there for
the tourists and such.

488
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,185
- You're right.
- Incredible, huh?

489
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,570
Chicory.

490
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,670
Listen to me...

491
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,939
yapping away like
some kind of idiot.

492
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,341
Tell me something.

493
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,771
Anything, everything.
I know nothing.

494
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,165
Here.

495
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,521
Here we go.

496
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,099
God, it's good to see you.

497
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,251
Look at you.

498
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:33,334
I'm head of plastics
and board chair

499
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,238
at Grey Sloan Memorial. I'm...

500
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,990
developing a new
protocol with skin grafts,

501
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,582
- particularly burn victims and...
- No, I'm not talking, um...

502
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,536
Of course you're amazing.

503
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,571
With your mom's
help, your name...

504
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,226
I'm sure you're successful.
No, what I mean is, uh...

505
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,545
What you do, your family.

506
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,581
Are you married?

507
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,233
Kids?

508
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,467
I guess what I'm asking is...

509
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,453
are you happy?

510
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:08,509
- Yeah, of course.
- No.

511
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,595
Not "of course."

512
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,315
I'm happy.

513
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,535
Are you?

514
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,484
Honestly, yeah. Yeah, I am.

515
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,207
But for me...

516
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,326
the whole Avery thing...

517
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:31,998
I just couldn't do it.

518
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,234
If it works for you, great.

519
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:37,687
For me...

520
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,824
the galas, the hand shaking...

521
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,609
it wasn't my thing.

522
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,447
Your thing.

523
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:49,582
But when I found out what was...

524
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,536
you couldn't drag me away, pal.

525
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,368
From your diner in Montana?

526
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,632
The night that I
met your mother...

527
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:01,861
it was an...

528
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,676
annual Avery Gala.

529
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,744
I was stuffed in a
thousand-dollar tux

530
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,048
and she...

531
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,516
was the most beautiful
woman in the room...

532
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,020
going toe to toe with some rich
dinosaur about God knows what.

533
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,994
And she had a laugh. Oh...

534
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,082
I introduced myself...

535
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:27,106
and she ignored me half
the night just to spite me.

536
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,774
I was born into that life,
but she was born for it.

537
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,864
So you took off.

538
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,963
You know your mother.

539
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:43,086
Her expectations are...

540
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,855
crushing.

541
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,337
How about you don't
talk about her anymore?

542
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,572
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,873
You're right. She
is your mother...

544
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,396
It's true, she is my mother.

545
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,697
And I don't know you.

546
00:28:58,721 --> 00:28:59,997
Jackson...

547
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,771
- Forget it.
- Listen.

548
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,443
- How'd it go?
- Don't.

549
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,501
- Jackson...
- Just don't ask.

550
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,570
We got to come up with
something to save this girl's voice.

551
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,174
There's got to be
something, right?

552
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,177
You want to talk about it...

553
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,413
what happened with your dad?

554
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,165
You know? Maybe we
could do a staged procedure.

555
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,016
I could excise the
tumor now, we could wait

556
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,307
- on a transplant donor.
- No, it wouldn't work.

557
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,955
She'd need another
course of radiation,

558
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:58,840
which would make her
a bad surgical candidate.

559
00:29:58,864 --> 00:29:59,864
Yeah.

560
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,699
Yeah, we talked.

561
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,852
He talked, really, a lot.

562
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:09,169
About how hard it was
being an Avery and...

563
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:10,824
surgery and...

564
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,476
Temporary stent.

565
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,161
- Erosion and bleeding, right?
- Crap.

566
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,048
He was just so
damn polite, and...

567
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,814
What about, um,
the animal studies?

568
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:23,838
Okay.

569
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,637
I just kind of clammed
up. I didn't say anything.

570
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:29,893
Really, he was...

571
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,896
just like...

572
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,464
warm? I don't
know, he was happy!

573
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,838
I definitely didn't picture
him, like, happy without me.

574
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,909
He talked a lot, didn't
say anything about me.

575
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Nothing.

576
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,278
Talked about mom's laugh,

577
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,819
his stupid tuxedo, coffee.

578
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,738
I felt really stupid.

579
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,490
You're not.

580
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,108
Never occurred to me, all
that time, that he didn't even...

581
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,714
He really didn't even miss me.

582
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,267
- You don't know that.
- Oh, I do now.

583
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,832
I really do. It
didn't even occur

584
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,055
to the guy to pretend otherwise.

585
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,672
How do you go up to
somebody and tell them

586
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,456
what an ass they've
been when they're just...

587
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,609
smiling at you, talking
about chicory coffee?

588
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,485
I just stood there with
my heart in my guts...

589
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,749
guts in my throat, whatever
the stupid expression is.

590
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,434
It's heart in your throat.

591
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,970
- No, that's not it.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

592
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,439
There's something about guts...

593
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,903
No, you feel it in your gut,
but your heart's in your throat.

594
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,837
What?

595
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,523
That's it. She needs a valve.
Right? She needs something...

596
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,506
- Okay. What is?
- That's it.

597
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:55,946
Her guts...

598
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,708
for her throat.

599
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,582
And we can use her
own guts for her own...

600
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,129
- throat.
- Throat.

601
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,714
- We lost the transplant, okay?
- Okay.

602
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,467
- We lost the vocal cords.
- Yeah.

603
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,867
All right, so what if...

604
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,374
what if we just
made her new ones?

605
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:11,806
I mean, what if we just used
Caroline's own intestines

606
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,297
to create her a new valve?

607
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:15,548
She's already got an
ileocecal valve here.

608
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,812
Right? I could use
her attached appendix,

609
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,597
and... and I could
build a vocal tube.

610
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:20,932
And she'd be her own donor.

611
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,917
Literally be putting her
own guts in her own throat.

612
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,986
That's still not the expression,
but do you think it'll work?

613
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,926
No. I mean, maybe. Yeah.

614
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:29,815
Okay, well, which one
you want to go with?

615
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:35,953
Yeah, I don't think so.

616
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,833
Well, we've
examined all the risks.

617
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,368
We feel like the
benefits outweigh them.

618
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,586
Yeah, the parents have
consented. They both want this.

619
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,322
It's never been done before,

620
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:46,841
and if something
were to go wrong, or...

621
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,749
Well, that is exactly
where the magic happens.

622
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,846
Okay, it's never
been done before.

623
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,464
- Mm-hmm.
- Until we do it.

624
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,066
Like today. Like right here.

625
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,518
Don't you want to be a
part of this magic, Steve?

626
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,120
Don't you want a
place at the table

627
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,872
when we turn that
young girl's stomach

628
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,546
into an actual throat?
When we make history?

629
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,296
Well, I...

630
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,285
- At the table?
- At the table.

631
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,655
At the table.

632
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,902
I... I still don't know
if I can get approval.

633
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,504
Yeah, well, luckily,
you don't have to.

634
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,756
- I'm sorry?
- It's my name on the hospital.

635
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,993
As an Avery, I officially grant
us permission to make history,

636
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:25,179
- together.
- At the table.

637
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,336
Exactly.

638
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,066
<i>She is gonna do great.</i>

639
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,274
Dr. Kepner and I will be sure to
update you as soon as we can.

640
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,207
I am giving you as much
love as humanly possible

641
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,192
because you're her doctor...

642
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,496
and I believe in you.

643
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,285
Thank you.

644
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:46,812
You just make sure
she comes back alive.

645
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,155
You hear me?

646
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,116
If we were back at home,
we'd have a full gallery,

647
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,380
a webcast.

648
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,325
I can't believe
nobody's gonna see this.

649
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,178
I'll see it.

650
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,293
Ah, Dr. Corridan. Join us.

651
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,496
Good luck, doctors.

652
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,232
Here we go.

653
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,239
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

654
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,715
This is gonna work, right?

655
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,301
We did it.

656
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,485
Damn right you did.

657
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:43,684
I am so tired I could drop.

658
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,658
And yet I am so awake.

659
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,123
That... was...

660
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,147
I know.

661
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,577
Oh, don't even bother.

662
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,081
They'll let us know
when she's awake.

663
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,414
It's gonna be a
couple hours, anyway.

664
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,791
In that case, I'm...

665
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,843
I'm gonna go sleep.

666
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,412
- Like the dead.
- Yeah.

667
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,746
Unless you think we should
go check back in on the patient.

668
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,815
No, no, I think you're
right. I think we should rest.

669
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,022
Maybe we should
go do that, then.

670
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:17,882
Sure. No, agree.

671
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,876
- That's a good call.
- Okay.

672
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,741
- What?
- I'm just...

673
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,077
thinking about our
track record in hotels.

674
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,199
What about it?

675
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:03,355
I know why my mother sent you.

676
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,290
Wanted me to have some backup.

677
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,779
She must've figured I was...

678
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,972
probably gonna see
him and knew better

679
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,156
than to try to
talk me out of it.

680
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,982
She wanted me here.

681
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,485
- Just in case.
- That is so...

682
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,170
Catherine.

683
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,190
I was gonna say
infuriating, but yeah.

684
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,487
Jackson, I know
what a good father is.

685
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,456
I've had one my whole life.

686
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,360
You are a good...

687
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:45,913
father.

688
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,014
You took us both in.

689
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,767
You took care of
her when I couldn't.

690
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,220
And you haven't stopped
taking care of either of us since.

691
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,957
Even with everything that's
happened between us...

692
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,709
you never bailed.

693
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:04,998
And he couldn't do that.

694
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,021
You came here to
tell him something.

695
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,324
Don't leave till you do.

696
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,322
Hey, hey. Sit, sit. I
got something for you.

697
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,657
I can't stay long.
We're headed out.

698
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,761
I can make you something
for the road, if you want.

699
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,278
I just came to say goodbye.

700
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:42,302
Okay.

701
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,520
Listen...

702
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,173
I'm really glad you came by.

703
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:50,292
- Maybe next time, if...
- Yeah, I don't think there's...

704
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,261
gonna be a next time.

705
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:56,966
Okay.

706
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,403
- Jackson, listen...
- I have a daughter.

707
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:03,854
Her name is Harriet.

708
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,575
Harriet.

709
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,030
Jackson.

710
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,927
Wow. That is wonderful.

711
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:15,951
I'm a grandfather.

712
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,771
No.

713
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,609
No, you're not.

714
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,093
My mom's a wonderful
grandmother, and you seem...

715
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,890
like a decent guy.

716
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:28,394
But you're not a grandfather.

717
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,879
You're not my father.

718
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:34,719
I figure, when you have a
kid, you're making a promise.

719
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,410
And I don't break my promises.

720
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:39,553
That's the real difference
between you and me.

721
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,497
- Look, Jackson...
- Take care, Robert.

722
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,495
I'm really glad that I met you.

723
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,322
Goodbye.

724
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,221
<i>Freezing.</i>

725
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,155
<i>Choking.</i>

726
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,790
<i>Getting tongue-tied.</i>

727
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,370
<i>There's a reason it happens.</i>

728
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,394
Take a deep breath now.

729
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,283
Take your time.

730
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,785
Okay. Take your time.

731
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,997
I... ma...

732
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,185
Hi...

733
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,087
Mama.

734
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,475
<i>We lose our words
because the stakes</i>

735
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:52,531
<i>are so high...</i>

736
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,730
Hey!

737
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,850
<i>And we have so much to lose.</i>

738
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,220
And there she is!
Thanks, Grandma.

739
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,224
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah.

740
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:21,739
Good.

741
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:23,224
Jackson said I could
get a ride home?

742
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,009
- Oh, of course, of course.
- Yes?

743
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,917
Come here, little
baby. Good girl.

744
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,547
Hi!

745
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,339
- Thank you.
- Oh, please.

746
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,229
- That's what grandmas are for.
- No.

747
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,582
I mean...

748
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,759
What?

749
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,104
- What, baby?
- Just...

750
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,272
Thank you, Mom.

751
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,819
For everything.

752
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,989
<i>We're petrified of
saying too much</i>

753
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,496
<i>or saying it wrong...</i>

754
00:41:57,899 --> 00:41:59,081
You ready?

755
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,183
Let's go home.

756
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:11,839
<i>When the truth is,</i>

757
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,813
<i>the only wrong
thing you can say...</i>

758
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,152
<i>is nothing at all.</i>
