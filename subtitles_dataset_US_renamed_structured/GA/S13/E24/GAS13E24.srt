1
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:09,341
<i>When life forces us to
do something impossible,</i>

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,824
<i>an explosion happens
inside the body.</i>

3
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,118
<i>The rush of hormones
blast through us,</i>

4
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,165
<i>- making us stronger.</i>
- What the hell?

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,405
<i>Making us faster.</i>

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:29,556
<i>Biology overrides fear, and that
makes the impossible, possible.</i>

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,576
Okay, so either this is
a drill, or it's a real fire!

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,178
If it's a real fire, then it
probably has something to do

9
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,063
with the guy, so I vote drill.

10
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:39,449
Despite that large boom
you just heard? Really?

11
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,936
All right, fine. It's the guy.
The bad, escaped rapist guy!

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,754
Why? Why?

13
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,294
Oh, door's unlocked!

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,126
Well yeah, a fire would
override a lockdown.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,582
I gotta go find Stephanie.

16
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,034
Just be careful!

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,223
The entryway is closed, ma'am.

18
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,608
I just watched an
explosion up there!

19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,060
And I already reported it.
The hospital is on lock down.

20
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:09,462
- Did you see that?
- Something exploded up there.

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,631
- This entrance way
will remain closed!
- East South,

22
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,550
possibly in the South
wing, four, five floors up!

23
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,900
- That's right near the NICU.
- And the CCU, Yeah!

24
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:16,419
- We have to get in there!
- We need to get in there!

25
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,570
- Hey!
- They won't let us in!

26
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,188
They're clear to come
in. I need their help.

27
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,691
- There's a lockdown!
- I ordered the damn lockdown!

28
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,327
Fire in the hospital
trumps rapist on the loose.

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,767
They are cleared!

30
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,265
- There's a rapist on the loose?
- Where have you been?

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,084
We have a multiple-alarm
fire on floors five and six

32
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,686
from the service elevators east.

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,805
We are concerned about the
structural damage on that floor.

34
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,669
We're diverting all
incoming traumas.

35
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,366
Patients in immediate or impending
danger need to be evacuated first.

36
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:47,200
Unaffected areas, the ER, radiology,
nursery, daycare. They stay put.

37
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,406
We have to prioritize.

38
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,754
Firefighter Carroll here will be
directing you to the most urgent areas.

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,459
And, uh, the woman with her arm
in the air, over there is Dr. Kepner.

40
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,878
She is setting up
the holding area,

41
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:02,431
- Outside by parking lot one.
- By parking lot one.

42
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,856
Take evacuated patients
to her. She is in charge.

43
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,793
And if your patients can walk,
they can transport themselves.

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,942
Okay, thank you, Dr. Grey. Do not be
a hero. If they can walk, let them walk.

45
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,512
Carry the rest. The
elevators are not working.

46
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,986
- Do not try and use them.
- Work fast, but work safe.

47
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,648
Our man's still at large, so we're
maintaining security at the exits,

48
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,622
and we're keeping
active sweeping.

49
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,447
Because just one hospital
emergency wasn't enough.

50
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,761
Lord, don't make me have to
tell Catherine Avery I burned

51
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,913
- her hospital to the ground.
- Edwards!

52
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,056
Stephanie!

53
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:39,741
Edwards!

54
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,245
Go, go, go, go. Stephanie?

55
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,609
Maggie! Hey, take
this to Kepner outside.

56
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,945
- Right away.
- I've been texting you. Are you okay?

57
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:06,846
They're trying to
contain it near the CCU,

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,430
but I heard it spread
to the O.R. floor.

59
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,685
- I just figured I'd help
with evac.
- Have you seen Nathan?

60
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,487
No, no, and don't go thinking
he's been burnt to a fiery crisp.

61
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,890
- I'm sure he's fine.
- No, I'm not, I'm just,
I need to speak with him.

62
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,741
- So if you see him,
please let him know.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,126
I'm legit! I swear!

64
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,178
High alert in progress,
sir. I need to see some I.D.

65
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,047
I don't have it. My
wife has my wallet.

66
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,581
Look, our baby's
upstairs for observation.

67
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,183
- Please.
- Is there a problem?

68
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,118
You gotta help me.
I've looked everywhere.

69
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,354
I went... I checked the
cafeteria, the gift shop.

70
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,540
- I tried looking outside,
looking there.
- What are you looking for?

71
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,564
My daughter, Erin.
She's missing again.

72
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,677
Help!

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,152
Help me!

74
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,227
Stephanie!

75
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,334
Help!

76
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,090
- Erin!
- Stephanie?

77
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,379
Erin! Erin, where are you?

78
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,728
Don't do that! I
thought you were dead!

79
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,218
I thought you were gone!

80
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:27,182
- Stephanie?
- Yeah? Erin, uh, hang on!

81
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:29,863
Hang on!

82
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:33,188
- I don't like this.
- Don't worry, uh, Sondra.

83
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,023
You'll be fine, all right?

84
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,136
You're just gonna get a
bit of fresh air, all right?

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,639
Okay, we got Mr. Pruitt downstairs
safe and sound. Who's next?

86
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,674
Okay, these two very capable
doctors are going to carry you down.

87
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,908
Carry?

88
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:44,643
Yeah, you're gonna have
your own personal escort.

89
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,280
- Down four flights of stairs.
- But a smooth ride, I promise.

90
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:49,615
- Like Cleopatra.
- Exactly!

91
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,534
Okay, hurry up!
Okay, this place is full.

92
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,238
- We got to move quick.
- Yes, sir!

93
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,820
Come on, let's go.

94
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:58,208
Oh. Just finished alerting
all dispatchers to divert

95
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,442
their traumas. Do
you need hands here?

96
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,598
Absolutely.

97
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,235
Hey, you guys seen
Edwards anywhere?

98
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,732
- I'm looking for a missing girl.
- We don't have eyes
on Edwards yet?

99
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,118
- No,
I've been looking everywhere.
- Is she missing?

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,354
Yes, yes. The rapist
guy in the hospital.

101
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,939
That's her patient. She's
with him somewhere.

102
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,607
- What?
- I gotta go.

103
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,125
Did you alert police
about Edwards?

104
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,427
No, no, good idea.
Can you do that?

105
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,678
- I...
- Thank you!

106
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,946
- We need all hands on
deck, Avery! Let him go.

107
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,099
Doctor Webber, there's a
protocol when it comes to this.

108
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,067
- You can't just...
- I am looking for
a missing girl.

109
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,203
And yes, the police
are also looking for her.

110
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,106
Then maybe we should let the cops
do their jobs. We focus on patients.

111
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,324
Okay, listen. She
likes to run and hide.

112
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,210
She has brownish
hair. Her name is Erin.

113
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,780
- All right,
we haven't seen her yet.
- Grey! Doctor Webber...

114
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,399
Look, I'll be fine, Dr. Minnick.

115
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,383
Would you let the police know we
have a resident missing? Will you?

116
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,346
<i>Okay, the kids are asleep,
so it should be easy.</i>

117
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,883
Ellis is just getting over a
bug, so when she wakes up,

118
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,172
just take her temp.

119
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:00,820
We are gonna be on
the road for the next

120
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,978
several hours, but
after that texting is best.

121
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:12,270
Hey, uh, you might
wanna eat something.

122
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,040
What's gonna take hours?

123
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,793
Owen, there's been an
explosion at Grey Sloan.

124
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,474
What? What do you
mean, an explosion?

125
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,726
So it looks like the
helipad there is off limits.

126
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,227
How many casualties?
Are there people hurt?

127
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,196
- Why didn't you wake me?
- It only affected a few floors,

128
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,498
and they have got it covered.

129
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,199
Look, I'm the head of
trauma. I need to be there.

130
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,968
Okay, no. We have to go. It's
gonna take a few hours to drive

131
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,337
to Madigan Army Medical Center.

132
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,294
And we have to be there
when your sister lands.

133
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,265
Yeah.

134
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,094
They suggested you might
want to bring photographs

135
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,471
- or keepsakes if you have any?
- Right.

136
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,708
Right. Right, because
she might not remember.

137
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,373
You know what? You stay
here. I'm gonna go to the house

138
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,381
- and see if I can find an album.
- No, no,
I know where everything is.

139
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,311
Erin, don't be
scared! Just hang on!

140
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:12,664
All right, Erin?

141
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,082
Okay.

142
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,563
Fire extinguisher. Fire extinguisher.
It's a lab. It's a lab. It's a lab.

143
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,705
There has to be a fire
extinguisher somewhere.

144
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,442
Is he gone? Is that man gone?

145
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:30,192
Uh, yeah, yeah. He's very, very
gone. You keep your face low, okay?

146
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,228
You keep your face low and stay
as far away from the fire as you can!

147
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,722
I can't. I can't.
My leg, it's stuck.

148
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,142
Okay, don't worry. Uh,
I'm coming, don't panic.

149
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,608
- Oh, God! Just... Okay.
- Ow, ow!

150
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,960
Move it off! Please!

151
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,761
No, no, honey, it's keeping
all the blood in your leg.

152
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:23,884
It hurts.

153
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:30,858
Yeah, I know. I know it hurts.
But I can't... I can't move it until...

154
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:36,976
I figure out how to fix your
leg. And I... and which I...

155
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,195
How the hell am I
gonna fix her leg?

156
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,420
- Stop it! You're scaring me!
- Sorry!

157
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,093
Okay.

158
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:57,319
Okay. You... You lucked
out, missy. 'Cause I am...

159
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,667
the best surgeon in here.

160
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:05,443
I do this kind of
stuff in my sleep.

161
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:09,581
Okay. All right. We're
gonna figure this out.

162
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,233
Okay? Right? Just
you and me. Right?

163
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,471
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay, okay.

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,363
- Right? Just you and me.
- I really want my mom.

165
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:33,665
Yeah, I know. I know. I do, too.

166
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,378
Okay!

167
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,262
God! Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's
okay. I got you. I got you, okay?

168
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,797
- All right? Lie back.
- Okay.

169
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,821
Just lie back.

170
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,472
Relax as much as you can.

171
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:56,844
You know, when I was a
kid, I was in the hospital a lot,

172
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,026
and, uh... they would have to...

173
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,283
- Ow, ow.
- Oh, it's okay! I'm sorry.

174
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:07,550
They would do a bunch of stuff
that hurt me too. And I hated it.

175
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,953
I hated it. So, do you
know what I would do?

176
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,277
Ah!

177
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,882
- What?
- I would clench my fists.

178
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,601
Real tight, tight as I could.

179
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:25,023
- Mm-hm.
- Sometimes, my, uh, nails would
dig into my hands.

180
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,325
And I would even break the
skin sometimes, but it helped.

181
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,312
The more I thought
about my hands,

182
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:35,161
the less I thought about
anything else. And sometimes,

183
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,631
I would just scream my head off.
And it would drive my doctors crazy,

184
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,166
but it made me feel better.

185
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,630
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

186
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:44,325
All right, Erin.

187
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,397
Look, what I'm about to do
is really going to hurt, Erin.

188
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:53,796
It's going to hurt a lot, and so,
I want you to clench your fists.

189
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,537
Clench them real tight,
as tight as you can for me.

190
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,357
- Okay.
- And if you need to scream,

191
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,378
- you just go ahead and scream,
okay?
- Okay.

192
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,833
Okay. Here we go.

193
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:22,241
I want patients organized
by condition and severity.

194
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,978
The temp CCU area needs
ventilators and crash carts on standby.

195
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:29,265
And please check everyone
for smoke inhalation.

196
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,392
- Erin! Erin! Where...
- What's going on?

197
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,827
Oh!

198
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,147
What... We don't
know! A fire, explosion.

199
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,266
But there're no kids out here. How
are my PEDS patients or the NICU?

200
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:49,268
Listen, the fire is on the
south side, about four floors up.

201
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,204
The kids should all be okay.
What happened with Jo's husband?

202
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,879
- You never called me back.
- Yeah, uh, the trip was a waste.

203
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,693
Okay, I'm looking for
this little girl. She's eight,

204
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,945
she's super smart, she
keeps ditching her parents.

205
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,689
- Look for her!
- All right!

206
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,172
Hey, what do we have?

207
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:08,020
CCU patient, one day status
post CABG. She's stable.

208
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,473
She just needs to stay
on her heparin infusion.

209
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,591
Are you okay?

210
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,460
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Not a
big fan of fire. You know?

211
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,531
If I'm being honest, it's kinda
my worst nightmare, actually.

212
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,534
Okay. Well, just, like, imagine
that it's a parking lot barbecue.

213
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:26,105
The smoke, the burning burgers,
Okay. All right, you know what?

214
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,740
Just take a minute. Okay?
Just take a minute. We...

215
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,142
No, no. I'm good. I'm good.

216
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,412
- You sure? Okay.
- Burnt burgers. Right? Burnt burgers.

217
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,419
Oh, Pierce! Can you
come take a look?

218
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,102
- Hi.
- Hi.

219
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,286
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,824
The chest sounds good.

221
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,215
Those handsome boys
treated me like a queen.

222
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,346
Good. I'm glad to hear it. We're
gonna get you set up in triage.

223
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,770
We're gonna get you attached
to an EKG machine. Okay?

224
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,153
Hey, you didn't happen to
see Jackson in there, did you?

225
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

226
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,889
Right when the alarms went off.
And then he took off, running after

227
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,326
Edwards, like he was
fireproof. He's not back yet?

228
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,313
- No! Of course not. Typical.
- Typical?

229
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,338
Yeah, he ran into a burning
bus once to save a child.

230
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,791
He's the kind of guy that
runs into a fire, apparently.

231
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,228
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Yeah. Me too.

232
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,956
It's okay. Good. Erin, I
just wanna... loosen this.

233
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,276
And see if there's
less bleeding. Okay?

234
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,840
Look, less blood.

235
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:38,261
- No blood?
- No blood. Good girl. Okay.

236
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,164
All right. This is heavy.
Scootch on out. Scootch out,

237
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,550
scootch out this way. Don't
bend, don't bend, don't bend.

238
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,325
Go this direction. Keep
going. There we go. Okay.

239
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:52,096
Let's get you out of here, okay?
Hang on. Let me help you up.

240
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,710
Okay, okay. Don't
put any weight on it.

241
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,970
Lean on me. Good girl. Good
girl. Good girl. Hang on. Okay!

242
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:10,497
- How do we get around it?
- We can't... We can't.

243
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,575
Hang on, hang on.
Hold on, hold on.

244
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,651
Okay. All right, so...

245
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,435
I'm gonna pick you up,
and I want you to take a big,

246
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,770
deep breath, okay?

247
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,572
The biggest breath
you can, and then hold it.

248
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:40,861
One, two, three, jump!

249
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:47,218
Good! Keep that leg straight.
Okay. Good girl, good girl. All the way.

250
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,683
Okay. All right. Here we go.

251
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,710
We can't go down there.

252
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,604
There's the roof.

253
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,147
Okay. All right, come here.
Put your arms around me,

254
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,016
- tight as you can. Okay?
- Okay, okay.

255
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,204
We have to go up. Come on, Erin.

256
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,940
One step at a time.

257
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,948
Okay. One step... at
a time. There we go.

258
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,242
Steph!

259
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,696
Edwards! Stephanie!

260
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,763
Ma'am, can I help you?
Let me help you walk.

261
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,372
-I don't need any help -Ma'am,
did you just have surgery?

262
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:35,504
For God's sake. I'm not a
ma'am. My name is Cheryl.

263
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,689
And surgery would
be better than this.

264
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,057
Being sliced up and gutted

265
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,493
would be better than
this. It's just kidney stones.

266
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,279
Okay, look, no. We gotta
get you out of this hallway.

267
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,414
There's way too much smoke.
All right? I'm gonna pick you up.

268
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,902
- Is that okay?
- No way! I'm perfectly capable...

269
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,805
of walking, and...

270
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:55,963
- I'm sure you are.
- It's just kidney stones!

271
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,624
Do you not hear the alarm?
The fire is on the floor above us.

272
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,876
Yeah, I was midway through a
lobectomy when the alarm went off.

273
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,700
I'm not leaving a
patient open on the table.

274
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,983
Okay, glove me. What
the hell are you doing?

275
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,985
Well, you're right. You can't
walk away from the patient.

276
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,192
And it'll be quicker if the
two of us work together.

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,592
This floor is supposed to be
clear. You need to evacuate.

278
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,656
Sir, I have a man's
lung in my hand.

279
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,211
- We're working
as fast as we can.
- How long you need?

280
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,532
- Fifteen minutes.
- Fifteen, no more.

281
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,234
Sir? We're looking
for a missing girl.

282
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,602
She's eight years
old. Her name is Erin.

283
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,346
- We've all got our eyes
out for her. Okay. Thank you.

284
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,163
Bovie.

285
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,596
All right. Let's get her
on a morphine drip.

286
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,930
All right, you're
gonna be all right.

287
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:54,655
- We've been looking for you!
- You scared the crap out of me!

288
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,157
- I need some O-two.
- Yeah, of course you do.

289
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:00,923
That's what happens when you
don't listen, and instead you inhale

290
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,387
- an entire hospital full
of smoke!
- Ah, what the...

291
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:07,201
- Stupid heroics!
- Look, I was trying to help her.

292
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,285
You are a surgeon,
not a firefighter!

293
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,953
I wasn't trying to
fight a fire! All right?

294
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,017
- I was trying to save Edwards!
- Don't yell at her!

295
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,890
She is the mother of your child!

296
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:20,976
- Okay.
- And what would
I have told Harriet?

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,267
- I'm fine, April!
- Breathe.

298
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,204
You know, Megan used to
call me Eeyore during the war.

299
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,896
She said the war made
me grumpy and too serious.

300
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,400
Go ahead. You can say it.

301
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,970
- What?
- She was right.

302
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,683
Wouldn't war make anyone grumpy?

303
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,577
Not her. No, she
was... She was happy.

304
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,347
She was always smiling
and joking and laughing.

305
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,858
I don't know what to say. I
mean, how do I even... How...

306
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,061
I don't know what to... I
don't know what to say.

307
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,382
You will... when you see her.

308
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:32,806
You'll know what to
say when you see her.

309
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,966
They found her ten miles
from where I was stationed.

310
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,630
She was right
there the whole time.

311
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:49,281
Owen, your sister is alive. And
that doesn't feel real, right now,

312
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:52,739
but it will... when you see her.

313
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,038
- Almost there. Oh. You okay?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,323
- Okay.
- Okay.

315
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:20,734
Almost there, almost... Almost
there. Okay, stay there. Good.

316
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:37,112
No. No. No. No! No! No!

317
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,232
- What?
- No! No!

318
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,700
- What?
- My key...

319
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,151
My keycard! I don't
have my keycard!

320
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,376
I can't... I can't get
out without the card.

321
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,565
- We can go down.
- My card...

322
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,039
We can get through
the fire. We can make it.

323
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,627
So we're stuck?

324
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,133
No. No, we're not stuck.

325
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:19,426
We are... we're
gonna sit right here

326
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:23,108
and put this over our heads,
and we're gonna be just fine,

327
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,598
I promise you. Come on.

328
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,736
No. That's pulling the
covers over your head.

329
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,283
My mom said, when things
get scary, you don't do that.

330
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,219
You turn on the lights
so the scary goes away!

331
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:36,159
Listen, your mom
is right, usually, but...

332
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,426
I'm a doctor. And I know that,

333
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,436
in this case, this blanket is
our best chance. Okay? Okay?

334
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,107
Okay.

335
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,512
All right. Come on. Let me help you.
Lean on me, lean on me, lean on me.

336
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,883
Good girl. There we
go. There we go. Okay.

337
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,190
Okay, hang on. Okay.

338
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,009
No. The scary will get
you. The scary will get you.

339
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,544
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

340
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,645
Don't worry about me, okay?

341
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,269
I've got a lot of ways
to keep scary out.

342
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,970
Is that my card?

343
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,192
That's... that's my
card! That is my card!

344
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,673
No, Stephanie! Don't leave me!

345
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,257
- No, it's okay! It's okay!
- Don't leave me alone!

346
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,577
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
Keep your face covered, okay?

347
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,413
All right? I... Erin, I'm
gonna be right back.

348
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:55,606
Fists, fists. Good, good!

349
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,009
No!

350
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,749
No! No, Stephanie! Stephanie!
No, don't go. Don't leave me.

351
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:10,788
Stephanie, no!

352
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,384
Stephanie, come
back. Come back...

353
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,408
No! No, Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!

354
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:45,005
Stephanie! Please...

355
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,431
Stephanie!

356
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,453
Let's get out of here.

357
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,313
Whoa!

358
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,778
I found him in O.R. Two.

359
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,779
O.R. Two? We evacuated
that floor ages ago!

360
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,723
Yeah, I was in the
middle of a thoracotomy!

361
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,085
Hey, Maggie, can you take over for
him there? You need some oxygen.

362
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:22,009
Not until my patient's stable.

363
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,217
You inhaled a lot of smoke.
Put this over your face.

364
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,444
Thank you.

365
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,828
- Wait, come here.
- Okay.

366
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,244
- Stay here. Stay here. Don't move or walk.
- Okay.

367
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:50,971
Help us! Help! Help
us! Somebody help!

368
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,793
Here! Help! Help!

369
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,212
Stephanie! Stephanie!

370
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,965
Oh, my God!
Wait, Erin. Wait, no.

371
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,414
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

372
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,768
Don't. No, don't! Don't.
Erin! No! Erin! Don't! Hey!

373
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:15,140
Erin, stay with me. Erin!
No! Stay with me, okay?

374
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:19,833
Stay... Somebody help me!
Somebody help me, please!

375
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,853
Somebody help me!

376
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:31,945
Put your mask back on.

377
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,284
And... And no, no
one has seen Edwards.

378
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,164
But that doesn't mean that...

379
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:41,382
Hey, Chief! Any word on Edwards?

380
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,934
No one's seen her
since the lockdown.

381
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,118
I told Minnick to tell the
police that she was missing.

382
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:49,296
Minnick! What did the
cops say about Edwards?

383
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:53,517
- Oh, my God. I forgot.
- You forgot?

384
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,470
There were patients. I forgot.

385
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:00,769
I saw Edwards earlier,
before the alarm.

386
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,753
She was... she was
with a liver lac patient.

387
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,205
- That's him. That's the guy.
- Where?

388
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,162
- What?
- Where did you see her?

389
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,515
It was a hallway,
just a regular hallway.

390
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,895
Where's radiology on
this thing? When I saw her,

391
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,164
we were close to there. I
had no idea who she was with.

392
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,699
If I'd realized, I could
have done something.

393
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,201
Which way were they walking?

394
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,303
It's just... You know what?
It's easier if I show you.

395
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,288
- I can just walk you right
in there.
- Benjamin Warren!

396
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,090
Absolutely not!
You're a civilian,

397
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,358
and the fire is not
completely contained.

398
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,660
We are wasting time out here!

399
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,144
Agreed. If it helps
find this guy sooner?

400
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,896
No, we're seeing
sporadic flare-ups inside.

401
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,966
Giving a criminal the perfect
opportunity to escape the premises,

402
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,500
no questions asked?

403
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,202
-This isn't about protocol. It's
about -MIRANDA: Oh, hell, no!

404
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,386
- Capturing a dangerous predator.
- You coming or what?

405
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,360
- I have
a radio on me.
- Damn it.

406
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:44,062
You heard 'em. Move.

407
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:47,032
Roll up, guys, we're
going in with 'em. Okay.

408
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:48,822
It was right in here.

409
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,670
Yeah, this is it. This
is where I saw her.

410
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,004
They were...

411
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,908
They were... they were
headed in this direction.

412
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,163
And... they must've
gone in here.

413
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,260
Hey...

414
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,373
if she was near the
explosion when it happened,

415
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,975
could she... Could
she have survived it?

416
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,710
Would depend on her
proximity to the blast.

417
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,245
- Captain, over here.
- Yeah?

418
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,469
We got a casualty.

419
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,274
We have an adult.

420
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,642
Can I borrow your light?

421
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,196
Help me!

422
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,899
Please...

423
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:34,601
somebody help me!

424
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,807
Stay with me. Stay with me.

425
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,051
No, no. This is too
tall to be Edwards.

426
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,327
It's blood. It is, It's blood!

427
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,363
It's blood over here.

428
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:16,126
Edwards!

429
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,074
- Edwards, you all right?
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

430
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,225
She needs an IV access,

431
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,033
and a... and an Ambu
bag and a freaking gurney!

432
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,213
All right. On it. Let's go.

433
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,321
Did you take the scenic route?

434
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,361
They were on the
roof. The patient coded.

435
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,214
She needs as much O-neg as
possible and get her typed and crossed!

436
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:45,216
Hey, get her to Trauma
One. Edwards, we got this.

437
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,818
- You can get down.
- No, ma'am.

438
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,319
She needs to go
straight to the O.R.

439
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:51,222
-Nope, O.R. floor is inaccessible
-She's not gonna make it.

440
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,724
She needs to be
treated here, now!

441
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:54,126
Edwards, you're
injured. You need...

442
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,099
She needs blood
and a defibrillator now!

443
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,814
I deep-fried a rapist, I... I
dove through a wall of fire.

444
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,916
I did not do all of that so
that this little girl could die.

445
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,753
Okay? Should be... I
saved her. I saved her.

446
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,187
I saved her. I saved
her, Doctor Bailey.

447
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,856
We need to finish
saving her, right now!

448
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,691
And I need you to
get out of my face!

449
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:10,995
Doctor Bailey!

450
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,218
You heard her. Get out of
her face. This ER is now an OR.

451
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,239
She's back in sinus.
Pressure's holding at 70.

452
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,646
Yeah, this leg
is still cyanotic.

453
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:29,778
Should we amputate?

454
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,113
No, we save the
leg. We save the leg.

455
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,487
This son of a bitch does
not get to cost this girl her leg.

456
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:38,052
- Doctor Bailey, please.
- We'll need to do a graft.

457
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,476
Okay, let's throw a shunt in
and we'll get that leg a chance.

458
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,895
All right, how is she?

459
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,820
We're prepping to do
a graft to save her leg.

460
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,185
You need to be lying
down, Stephanie.

461
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,187
- Let me take a look
at these burns.
- No, not yet, not yet.

462
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:31,373
Okay, look. You need to
at least be hydrated, okay?

463
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,477
Will you stay there? Let
me just take care of this.

464
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,960
You get the proximal
end? Oh, yeah. I got it.

465
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,596
We need to isolate the distal.

466
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,315
How's she doing? BP's
steady, SATS are 97.

467
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,823
Which means
she's finally stable.

468
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,569
Uh-huh.

469
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,222
She's gonna make it
through this and keep the leg.

470
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,440
Oh, my God.

471
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,058
You got her back, Edwards.

472
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,826
Now, you need to get
yourself back. Okay?

473
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,145
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- You did...

474
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,730
Gurney!

475
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,648
Let's get her on a
bed right away! Okay.

476
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,017
All right, her adrenaline
faded. Pain probably set in.

477
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,761
It's the body's way of
protecting itself from the pain.

478
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,856
- Got her head?
- Yep.

479
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,161
Okay, -RICHARD:
Let's get back to work.

480
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

481
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:23,675
You okay?

482
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:27,434
- Yeah, I think so.
- You sure?

483
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,304
Yeah, look, I'm
sorry if I scared you.

484
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,673
I was fine. I'm fine.

485
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,316
It's just, you're gonna
need to breathe when I...

486
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,739
when I tell you what I
have to tell you, so...

487
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:43,316
Take a deep breath for
me, so I know that you can.

488
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,387
What do you mean? What
do you want to tell me?

489
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,157
Take a deep breath for me.

490
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:13,630
Okay, so remember the dream...
where they come back to us?

491
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:16,344
Hm?

492
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,118
Derek forgets his keys
and Megan goes for...

493
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,048
For coffee. Yeah.
What... What about it?

494
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,577
Nathan, they found
Megan. She's alive.

495
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:34,651
That's not funny.

496
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,422
The Army called
Owen this morning.

497
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,950
That's... not funny.

498
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,572
Okay.

499
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,162
Shh. Shh.

500
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,448
Okay. Shh.

501
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,977
Major Hunt, Dr. Shepherd.

502
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,906
I'm Lieutenant Hill.
This is Colonel Turner.

503
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,329
Glad you guys could
make it on such short notice.

504
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:42,268
So, if there's anything you
need, don't hesitate to ask.

505
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,034
- Appreciate it.
- Absolutely, ma'am.

506
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:50,005
If you'll just walk this way. I
know it's hard to know exactly

507
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,978
what to expect, so
you should be prepared.

508
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,798
She may not know who you are...

509
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,768
She may not trust where she is.

510
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,853
She could be fine, or she
may communicate in extremes.

511
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,222
There could be yelling.

512
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,846
So, it's best to avoid
any potential triggers...

513
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,366
Sudden movements, sudden
noises... Anything like that.

514
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,299
And why did it take
us so long to find them?

515
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,616
I was sidetracked
by treating patients,

516
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,452
which is my job. I
was doing my job.

517
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,771
Right, that
protocol states that,

518
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:45,359
I'm sorry. If anyone could
follow protocol around here,

519
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,628
Edwards would be
perfectly fine right now.

520
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,752
I'm sorry, what?

521
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,433
She was supposed to be in counseling.
But, Doctor Webber over here decided

522
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,735
she should be
able to work today.

523
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,220
If you hadn't completely
undermined me...

524
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,884
- If I hadn't complete...
- Then a little girl would
be dead!

525
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:02,148
Doctor Minnick...

526
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:07,699
I don't believe that there's a place
for you in my hospital any longer.

527
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,233
Doctor Bailey, hold on.

528
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,802
It's Chief Bailey, and
I am not holding on.

529
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:15,723
She is holding on. She
is... is clinging to these

530
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,458
procedures and protocols,

531
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,128
and cannot see when
to let go in order to save

532
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,980
the life of a
patient. A child! I do!

533
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:27,835
I know! Because I was taught
right! Doctor Edwards certainly knew,

534
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,476
because she was taught right.

535
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:40,098
This is not some factory
that turns out surgical robots.

536
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:41,204
We make doctors.

537
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,558
Thinking, feeling,
human doctors.

538
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,912
And we will teach them right.

539
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:57,037
- Hey. You're not going home?
- Uh, nope,
incoming's two minutes out.

540
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:01,686
Hey, well, look, I just wanted to,
um, say, I'm sorry about earlier.

541
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,871
I yelled at Jackson
and I shouldn't have.

542
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,258
Well, he was an idiot
and he almost died, so...

543
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:10,511
Well, I just meant that, you
know, he's your baby's father,

544
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,246
and I went too far.

545
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,832
I was just mad because he
and I had been talking earlier

546
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:16,456
- when the alarms went off...
- Maggie.

547
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,042
What?

548
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,979
Jackson, he, uh... He likes you.

549
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,894
I know him, so I know
what that looks like.

550
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,214
And, he likes you. He
has feelings for you.

551
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,333
No, he doesn't. Why
would you even...

552
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,068
Because I have a feeling
that you like him, too.

553
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,470
So, you know what?
You should just tell him.

554
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,771
I gotta get out there.

555
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,718
- Hey. Long night?
- Yeah.

556
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,166
You want to go back to
my place? Sleep it off?

557
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,268
Or maybe do some other
stuff before we sleep it off?

558
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,702
And by other things, I mean sex.

559
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,072
You wanna go have
some overly tired sex?

560
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,606
I shouldn't. I have to pack up.

561
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,864
- Pack up what?
- I just got fired.

562
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:04,403
What...

563
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm so sorry, but you
know I'm gonna have to do

564
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,469
this again today, right?

565
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,592
Mm-hm.

566
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:14,375
It's looking good, it's looking good.
Edwards, I can turn up the morphine.

567
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,843
You don't need to
be in this much pain.

568
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,166
Not yet, not yet.

569
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:35,718
- How are you feeling?
- I've had better days.

570
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,740
- Your burns are severe.
- Mm-hm.

571
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:46,963
But we are all with you. We
are going to get you back.

572
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,396
But it'll... It'll be a while
before you step in an OR.

573
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,437
Okay. Actually, about that...

574
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,300
I've spent my whole
life in hospitals.

575
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:05,176
My whole life. And I... I
think I need to see everything

576
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,481
that's not the
inside of a hospital.

577
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:12,205
I need to travel and...

578
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:18,011
and explore and... and hike
and... and breathe. And breathe!

579
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,762
Okay.

580
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:27,615
Breathe... breathe...
Real air. So deep.

581
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,219
I want to breathe it all in. Away
from the monitors and the blood

582
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:34,043
and the... and
the sterile gowns.

583
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,548
Away from saving other
people's lives. I want my own.

584
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,150
It's time... It's time
I lived my own.

585
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,874
You changed my
life, Doctor Webber.

586
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:54,847
You have... You,
you taught me how...

587
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:02,855
You taught me how to take
my past and find my path.

588
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,279
Thank you. Thank
you. I think I found it.

589
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:17,337
- Which means?
- Which means I quit.

590
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,329
Mmm. Okay, DeLuca. Turn that
morphine up as high as it'll go, please.

591
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:51,387
- Nathan, are you okay?
- Where was she?

592
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,009
- I don't know.
- Well, who had her? Is she hurt?

593
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:58,144
I wish I knew more.

594
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:02,009
Do we know for sure it's her? I
mean, have they confirmed that?

595
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:06,146
Apparently so. I... I'm not
really sure how it works.

596
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,336
Well, where is she now?

597
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:16,145
They're taking her to
Madigan Army Medical Center.

598
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,661
Owen and Amelia
are on their way now.

599
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:24,315
- Tell, Pierce I... I had to go.
- Okay, wait.

600
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,184
- Are you okay? Can you drive?
- And someone needs to contact

601
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,287
my patients, tell them
that I finished surgery.

602
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,655
Don't worry, we'll take care
of it. Are you okay to drive?

603
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,864
- Do you want me to take you?
- Megan is alive?

604
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:37,523
Megan's alive.

605
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:52,760
- I'm sorry.
- No. Don't do that.

606
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,901
- No.
- Don't do that. Don't apologize.

607
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,586
If this were Derek, I
would already be gone.

608
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,410
- Okay, I can drive.
- Get out of here! Go!

609
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:06,378
Yeah, okay. I can drive.

610
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,967
<i>Nobody wakes up thinking,</i>

611
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,419
<i>"My world will explode today.</i>

612
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,592
<i>"My world will change."</i>

613
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:30,002
<i>Nobody thinks that, but
sometimes it happens.</i>

614
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,958
<i>Sometimes we wake
up. We face our fears.</i>

615
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,293
<i>We take them by the hand.</i>

616
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:15,080
<i>And we stand there,
waiting, hoping, ready...</i>

617
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:18,518
<i>for anything.</i>
