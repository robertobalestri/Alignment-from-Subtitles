1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,063
<i>Previously, on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:05,048
Look at that hand.
This is assault.

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,084
A pediatric surgeon
walking around this hospital...

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,570
<i>Do you realize what happens
if you're convicted of a felony?</i>

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,690
Mer, the trial's tomorrow. It could be
our last chance for like eight, ten years.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,693
Jo Wilson isn't my real name.
That's why I couldn't marry you.

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,528
<i>It might all come
out in court tomorrow.</i>

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,997
You picked the bad guy. The guy
who hurts you or hurts other people.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,599
<i>Karev, what are you about to do?</i>

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,234
<i>I'm going to the district
attorney's tonight,</i>

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,368
<i>and I'm gonna take the plea.</i>

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,719
It's just us, now.

13
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:29,239
<i>There were five of us,
and it can't be just me.</i>

14
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,223
Mr. Karev? He'll see you now.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,415
<i>Back in the day,
physicians made house calls.</i>

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,852
- We can still turn around.
- Bailey, no, we can't.

17
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:45,622
<i>So, if you chopped off your finger,
or woke up with a touch of cholera...</i>

18
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,107
We've all had a long day.

19
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,241
I have to see this patient

20
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:50,460
and this was the window
of time we were offered.

21
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,562
Wilson? Are you
sure you're good?

22
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,132
<i>You could order up a
doctor, like delivery pizza.</i>

23
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,388
Ew.

24
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,403
Um... You know, I don't
want to talk about it.

25
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,622
<i>A respected member of the
community, at your service.</i>

26
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,491
<i>The ultimate personal touch.</i>

27
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:07,382
I mean, with everything
that's happening with Karev.

28
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,863
There's nothing
that I can do about it.

29
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,764
Whatever happens at
the trial tomorrow happens,

30
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,222
so I just... I want
to do this tonight.

31
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,325
God, this is so gross!

32
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:18,960
Okay.

33
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,362
Okay.

34
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,093
Well...

35
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,250
Wilson's right.

36
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,964
Tonight's gonna be hard
enough already. Let's focus on this.

37
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,053
Look.

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,734
Oh, now, that's...

39
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,458
A crime against God.

40
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,540
Oh, my... This one has feet.

41
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,574
Wilson.

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,076
What? It's not a baby.

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,627
It's a mass of skin
and cells, like a tumor.

44
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,347
Wilson, stop talking about
symptoms and start talking patient.

45
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,083
Kristen Rochester,
16, 31 weeks pregnant,

46
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,819
preliminary ultrasound
shows likely TRAPS Syndrome.

47
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,940
Yeah, hard to say for sure, since
their ultrasound machine is junk.

48
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:56,175
- It's outdated, is all.
- It's junk.

49
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,444
Well, you know what's not junk?

50
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:00,246
Our portable ultrasound, which
we have. It's in the bag, right?

51
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,432
Mm-hmm, along with
the fetal ablation machine.

52
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,451
Easier to handle in
our not-junky hospital.

53
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:08,727
Well, it's not possible for us to
transport this patient, and you...

54
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,629
And you know it.

55
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,699
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

56
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,206
You have somewhere to be?

57
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,475
I don't wanna spend more
time here than we have to.

58
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,161
We do this fast,
then get the hell out.

59
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,295
She's just another patient.

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,413
No, she's not.

61
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:35,653
- No, she's not. God, can you imagine?
- No.

62
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,651
I mean, but really,
to be pregnant and...

63
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,487
- I cannot imagine.
- Bailey...

64
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,807
I would never put myself
in a position to be in here.

65
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,647
Nobody intends to be here.

66
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,046
I'm just saying. You get
hungry and desperate

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,788
or broke and desperate,
and stuff happens.

68
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,486
Stuff does not
just happen to you.

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,526
You happen to stuff.

70
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:09,737
It's gonna be fine.

71
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,414
<i>Hi. How you doing tonight?</i>

72
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,633
- Name.
- Dr. Robbins. This is...

73
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:28,718
Inmate name.

74
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,436
Oh. Kristen Rochester.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,740
Bag.

76
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,632
- Yeah, this is all
medical equipment.
- Stand back against the wall.

77
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,083
Now what?

78
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,119
In<i> Orange,</i> they strip-search.

79
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,800
I am not getting
strip-searched. Arizona...

80
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,224
Bailey, you are not
getting strip-searched.

81
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,637
- Sir, can I...
- Against the wall.

82
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,799
Sorry. Sorry. Thanks for coming.

83
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,417
Amanda Joseph,
Kristen's attorney.

84
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,952
Let's go get popped through.

85
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,070
"Popped through"?

86
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,338
I represent inmate
Kristen Rochester

87
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:06,673
and I'm accompanying
these doctors

88
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,817
to deliver court-ordered
medical care. Let us through.

89
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,083
Now.

90
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:22,026
Personal effects, cell
phones, keys, weapons.

91
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,097
- Who brings weapons to a prison?
- So many people.

92
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,135
Arms out.

93
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,767
Um... I have a prosthetic leg.

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,854
- I'm gonna raise your pants leg.
- Come on, is that
really necess...

95
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,440
ary.

96
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,442
Visitors pass. Keep
them on you at all times.

97
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,860
You will not be able
to exit without them.

98
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,269
- What?
- Hold the badge up to your face,
look at that camera.

99
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,650
Four visitors
clear for Eldredge.

100
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,504
We should get immediate access
to Kristen, but you never know.

101
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,456
- Badges up.
- "Never know"? Why?

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,875
Dr. Eldredge is already
pissed you're here.

103
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,176
You're doing fancy,
expensive surgery.

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,161
Special treatment
gets the others riled up.

105
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,063
Eldredge pushes
you, you push back.

106
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,532
Not literal pushing, correct?

107
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,417
I got this. I can
handle a pushing.

108
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,141
No-one is pushing.

109
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,454
What, you think someone's
gonna swipe that thing?

110
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:29,889
Hey, someone could.

111
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,492
Then, all of a sudden,
she's walking around outside.

112
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,826
They're locked in cells.

113
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,628
And I'd be trapped
on the inside.

114
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,164
No-one knows me,
no-one trusts me.

115
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,984
My record says that I'm in for theft
or worse, so who's gonna listen to me

116
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,153
when I'm yelling that there's
been some horrible mix-up?

117
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,988
Nobody. Nobody listens.

118
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,247
I never get my hair
done. My teeth go bad.

119
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,996
I die in here.

120
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,581
- That can't happen, right?
- Just don't lose your badge.

121
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,916
Badges.

122
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,206
This way.

123
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,323
- Ms. Joseph.
- Dr. Eldredge.

124
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,525
Doctors Robbins, Bailey and
Wilson are here for Kristen Rochester.

125
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:07,709
I hope they brought a book.

126
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,846
I don't have time to wait
around. I've got 12 cases today.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,898
I have 26 inmates, and Rochester
isn't number one on my list.

128
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,400
If you insist on creating
an unreasonable delay

129
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:16,002
and obstructing my
client's legal rights,

130
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,346
- you know I have no recourse
but to report you.
- Fine.

131
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,762
Rochester for the
win. Follow me.

132
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,764
I have ground rules.

133
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,249
Walking.

134
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,505
Totally normal. Don't engage.

135
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,120
Rochester's a wild one, and I
don't have time to stitch you up

136
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,254
if she goes off on you.

137
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,306
Hey! I've been sitting
here for an hour!

138
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,525
You should stop banging
your head against the wall.

139
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,710
You suck!

140
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,062
Rochester isn't allowed
to initiate contact.

141
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,931
So, we can touch her
but she can't touch us?

142
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:47,667
Yeah. And don't be a hero and
tell her anything about her condition.

143
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,785
Tell me. Bad news sets her off.

144
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,937
"Sets her off"?

145
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,305
If she goes into labor today...

146
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,756
Well, we're hoping
that's not gonna happen.

147
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,726
If she goes into labor today, she
gets 24 hours with the baby, max.

148
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,444
Then she goes back into gen pop.

149
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,946
Twenty-four hours? That's it?

150
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,398
But she's the baby's mother.

151
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,999
She's a violent felon
with a sentence to serve,

152
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,372
and I can't spare the bed.

153
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,303
- I don't make the rules.
- At least nod so I know
you all heard me.

154
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,504
- Okay.
- Yes.

155
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,648
<i>- Let me out!</i>
- Here we are.

156
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,962
Um, what's K-10?

157
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,629
K-10 is for especially
dangerous inmates,

158
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,649
murderers, validated
gang members.

159
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,750
Which is she?

160
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,318
That's confidential.
She's a minor.

161
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,388
It means she can't circulate freely
with other inmates. For their safety.

162
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,655
What about our safety?

163
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,463
She behaves for me. We're fine.

164
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,834
Rochester. Company.

165
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,749
See? Look at her.
She's just another patient.

166
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,824
You know how it goes. No
touching, no sudden moves.

167
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,329
Hi. Hi, Kristen. I'm Dr. Robbins.
How are you feeling today?

168
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,694
The baby's really hungry.
Could I have something to eat?

169
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,146
You had your pregnancy
snack an hour ago.

170
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,347
No seconds. You know that.

171
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,649
- I'll need written proof
of that.
- Of course you do.

172
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,751
Please? I'm so hungry.

173
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,153
We really can't give
her another snack?

174
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,387
There are no extras to give.

175
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,291
Really? You're starving
a pregnant mom?

176
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,115
- That's okay with you?
- You'll live.

177
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,678
You're gonna be like that?

178
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:06,734
I am.

179
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:11,523
Okay, then.

180
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,705
Kristen, we're gonna take a look
at your baby. How's that sound?

181
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,195
Inmate, away from the door.

182
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,451
Hi, Kristen. Good to see you.

183
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,052
We can get you
access to supplies.

184
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,045
Backup in cell
seven! Inmate, get...

185
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,493
Oh, my God!

186
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,528
Hey! No excessive force!

187
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,831
I told her I was hungry!

188
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,038
That's a write-up
and a white card.

189
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,235
It's totally worth it.

190
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,026
Now are you gonna
get me something to eat?

191
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,828
"Just another patient"?

192
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,668
Listen to me. Kristen
doesn't scare you.

193
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,802
She sure does.

194
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,120
No, she doesn't.

195
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,607
She can smell fear. If you
treat her like an animal in a cage,

196
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,025
she will act like one.

197
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,609
She and Eldredge
have a rocky history.

198
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,817
You have a clean slate,
with me on your side.

199
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,635
Use it.

200
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,266
- What are they doing? Is that even legal?
- Hey!

201
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,768
Get off!

202
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,220
You can't shackle a woman
in late-term pregnancy!

203
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,373
- It's policy.
- It's illegal.

204
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,376
She hurts me, she gets 24
hours in four-point restraints again.

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,661
Do something!

206
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,063
I can't allow this.

207
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,882
I can't allow putting civilians
at risk with a violent inmate

208
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,584
unless she's fully restrained.

209
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,587
She's trying to starve me!

210
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,689
Spare me the dramatics. You ate.

211
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,690
You guys are just
gonna stand there?

212
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,776
Let her treat a
pregnant girl like this?

213
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,011
She's fully restrained.

214
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,512
I need you to get the
sheriff on the phone

215
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,464
to discuss this
violation immediately.

216
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,368
Sure. He always returns my
calls in a hurry. I'll be outside.

217
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,343
Go! Get out of my face! Get out!

218
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,346
I'm gonna go check
her finger. It's injured.

219
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,166
Kristen, we've talked about
the yelling. How it doesn't help?

220
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,621
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,456
Are you going to let these
doctors help you and your baby?

222
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,916
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,342
You could use a
second set of hands.

224
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,224
You spook easy.

225
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,309
It's dislocated.
Could be broken.

226
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,727
We should get an
x-ray to make sure.

227
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,734
Okay!

228
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,354
Uh... Can I help?
You got a splint?

229
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,118
I don't wanna waste
one. Just buddy-tape it.

230
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,287
Buddy-tape it?

231
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,021
Tape the broken finger
to the uninjured finger.

232
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,379
I know what it is,
and it isn't sufficient.

233
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,661
Are you trying to act tough,
here? Is that what this is?

234
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,414
Because you and I are
on the same side, here.

235
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:55,648
I'm just trying to help.

236
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,284
Your help has already
buried me in paperwork

237
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,668
and broken my finger.

238
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,305
You know what? You should
probably get back to your VIP patient.

239
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,694
I'll tape it myself.

240
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:09,082
Do you need me
to hold your hand?

241
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,010
I don't bite.

242
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:23,948
I mean, I have.
But... can't right now.

243
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,050
Okay.

244
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,346
We're all set.

245
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,225
Okay, Mama, you ready
to take a look at this baby?

246
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,027
Does she always talk like that?

247
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,054
- Yep.
- Like what?

248
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,667
Like unicorns and rainbows
are about to shoot out of your ass.

249
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,805
Okay.

250
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,552
- All right, let's...
- Hey, hey, hey!

251
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,471
- No sudden moves!
- That wasn't a sudden move.

252
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,455
You can't just put hands on me
like that! How about a little heads-up?

253
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,280
Got it.

254
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:01,264
Okay. The next thing
you'll feel is some cool gel.

255
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,586
Heads up.

256
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,627
And then this
wand on your belly.

257
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,626
I don't think she likes your
thing. She keeps kicking.

258
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,494
She's definitely on the move.

259
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,485
There's her fingers and toes.

260
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,788
Oh. Good. I don't
want her to be a freak.

261
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,454
And there's our problem.

262
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,862
I don't even want to see that.

263
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,717
I can't believe that monster
thing is in there with my baby.

264
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,947
It's like a...

265
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,215
Acardiac twin.

266
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,338
Yeah, I know.

267
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,161
I made a guard Google
it and show it to me.

268
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,556
The way it's sucking my baby's
blood just reminds me of, like, a...

269
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,658
A vampire?

270
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,714
Yeah.

271
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,699
Yeah, it's so gross.

272
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,518
So, do you have any questions?

273
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,569
Yeah. How soon can we start?

274
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,269
As soon as we get the baby
into position, we're good to go.

275
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,559
Then let's get going.

276
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:01,841
As soon as I go into labor,
I get my mom here. Right?

277
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,542
Yes, when you go into labor.

278
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,511
Yeah. I know. Just call her now,

279
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,380
'cause as soon as you
guys give me the medicine

280
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,582
or whatever to start labor,
she should already be here.

281
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,168
Kristen, that's not
what's happening.

282
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,693
It's the law! I get my
mom when I'm in labor!

283
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,778
To hold my hand and crap!

284
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,496
Right?

285
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,147
Yes, that is the rule, but I... I thought
Dr. Eldredge explained this to you.

286
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,538
Dr. Evil? Is that a joke?

287
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,606
The baby's not coming today.

288
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,307
What?

289
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,055
Today, we're just gonna cut the
connection between the mass and the baby

290
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,808
so that your baby's heart doesn't
have to work double-time anymore.

291
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:39,161
But, Dr. Evil said
it wasn't surgery.

292
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,425
Yeah, it's a procedure. You'll
be awake the whole time.

293
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:43,988
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

294
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,836
We use a probe to go into
your belly through a tiny incision.

295
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,462
You want to poke my belly
with a gigantic probe thing?

296
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,963
No! No, no, no, no, no. I want
my baby. I want to deliver my baby.

297
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,287
Why didn't you tell me this?

298
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:03,502
Kristen, I'm not a doctor. I told you
everything I knew. Nothing has changed.

299
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,489
This is the safest, best
way for us to get to our goal.

300
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,096
- But I...
- Kristen. What is our goal?

301
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:14,034
To have a healthy baby so
that my mom can adopt her

302
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,487
and I can see her all
the time when they visit.

303
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,091
You're sure. No baby today.

304
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,345
There... There's
still a chance, right?

305
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,261
Very slim chance.

306
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,234
Hey.

307
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:33,087
You know, I saw this movie, once, where
this girl got to keep her baby in prison.

308
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,561
They gave her a crib and diapers
and everything, all in her cell.

309
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:44,332
And her mom just dropped the
baby off every morning, like daycare.

310
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,185
What?

311
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,232
Oh, nothing.

312
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,289
What?

313
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,024
It's just a movie.

314
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,859
Yeah, obviously, I know that.

315
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:02,444
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Nobody thinks you're stupid.

316
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,751
She does! Don't you?

317
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,522
Speak!

318
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,975
I think that's a movie.

319
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,023
And you're in a
maximum-security prison.

320
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,625
I know that! I live
here! Don't you get that?

321
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,129
- Inmate, settle down!
- She's okay. Right, Kristen?

322
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,685
Yeah. I'm fine.

323
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,655
You know, things don't always
happen the way they do in movies.

324
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,207
I know that.

325
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,543
Ms. Joseph? We
have a call for you.

326
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,444
I'll be right back.

327
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,002
I still get to be her mom.

328
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,365
Even if I don't see
her all the time.

329
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,872
And she'll know I'm her mom
because there's this, like, touch thing

330
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,797
and this smell thing
when she's born.

331
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,132
That's what they say.

332
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,453
She'll know I'm her mom forever.

333
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,189
No matter what.

334
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,725
Doctors?

335
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:10,980
- Okay, so, I have to go.
- What?

336
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,531
- Why?
- Just downstairs.

337
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,700
A little emergency with another
client needs my attention.

338
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,369
How about focusing your
attention on keeping your K-10 client

339
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,538
- from killing us?
- She's not gonna kill us.

340
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,056
She'll just break our fingers.

341
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,175
One of my clients pulled a
knife on a doctor in the ER, okay?

342
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,260
I have to go now. I'll
be right downstairs.

343
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,844
- But...
- You'll be fine.

344
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,525
Hey, that lawyer is the one
person that girl listens to.

345
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,181
She's the K-10 whisperer.

346
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:45,214
Baby's position's blocking our
access to the acardiac twin's vessels.

347
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,982
And now she's just abandoned us.

348
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,286
So, Wilson, what do we do?

349
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,719
We externally rotate the baby.

350
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,138
- Yep.
- Wait, you wanna lay hands
on the violent criminal?

351
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:56,942
Push her around and just cross our
fingers that she doesn't push back? No!

352
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,194
- We have to.
- She's calmer, now.

353
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,520
Because the lawyer calmed
her, and now the lawyer is gone!

354
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,366
She seems so hopeful.

355
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,203
Sure, about turning her
prison cell into a nursery.

356
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,238
But there are prison nursery programs
where they teach you parenting,

357
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,941
let you spend time with your
baby... Maybe she could get into one.

358
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,143
She is shackled to
her bed, right now,

359
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,613
because she attacks
people who bother her.

360
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,898
You think a crying baby
isn't gonna bother her?

361
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,566
- Who are you?
- What?

362
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,519
I mean, how did I not
know that you felt this way?

363
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,063
I mean, what did
prison ever do to you?

364
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:36,615
Okay, we're gonna push on
your belly to move the baby around

365
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,551
so we can get access
to the acardiac twin.

366
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:39,640
Will it hurt?

367
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,654
A little. I'm sorry. You'll...

368
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,606
Not me, Stupid.
Will it hurt the baby?

369
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,725
No. No, she won't feel a thing.

370
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,132
Okay, Wilson, take the wand.

371
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:51,903
You're gonna feel my hands on
your belly, and then a lot of pressure.

372
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,722
Okay? Here we go.

373
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,789
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

374
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,213
Can you show me
the umbilical cord?

375
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,846
It's still covered.

376
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,970
This baby does not want to move.

377
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,040
All right. More pressure, okay?

378
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,905
Ow. Ow. Stop. Stop it!

379
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,209
Okay. Okay.

380
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,134
Can... Can you at least
take these cuffs off?

381
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,023
I'm so sorry, that's...
It's not up to me.

382
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:37,231
I went to court to get you here.
And you are freaking useless!

383
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,816
Let's try it again.

384
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,286
God! What the hell?

385
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,795
So what's your adoption
plan? With your mom?

386
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,042
I'm not gonna talk to you
about that. I don't have to...

387
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,728
More pressure. More pressure.

388
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:58,869
All right. So, then, how about
I tell you something about me?

389
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,674
My daughter lives across the
country, so she's not always with me.

390
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,759
Is she making that up?

391
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,795
No. It's true.

392
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,709
You ready for more?

393
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,878
Robbins. They
want you downstairs.

394
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,297
I'm kind of in the middle
of something. Is it urgent?

395
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,515
- I don't know. Ask her yourself.
- Ask who? Amanda?

396
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,706
I don't take messages.

397
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,424
Such a bitch.

398
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,189
All right, Wilson, continue
with the cephalic version?

399
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,709
Yes. Absolutely.
Thank you, Dr. Robbins.

400
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,516
"Thank you, Dr. Robbins."

401
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,117
You have to kiss her ass, huh?

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,600
Hey! Are you a doctor?

403
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,102
I need help.

404
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,455
Yes, you! Help!

405
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,895
Well, hell.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,783
What seems to be the problem?

407
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,386
It's been oozing for days.

408
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:07,888
And then there was this smell.

409
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:09,885
Is that normal?

410
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,277
No. That's
definitely not normal.

411
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,517
I'm Lee.

412
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,220
But everybody calls me Needles.

413
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,071
Okay, then.

414
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,042
Oh...

415
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,369
You know, I once helped a guy
I liked rob a convenience store.

416
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,964
You're a doctor.

417
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,222
Yeah, now. But before...

418
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:48,762
I had a... bunch of
crappy foster parents.

419
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,860
"Stars, they're just like us."

420
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,166
What?

421
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,455
You're trying to act like we're the
same, you and me, but... we're not.

422
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,323
Hmm.

423
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,194
I also used to live in my car.

424
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,279
Which was stolen.

425
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,177
I get how life can screw
you over, sometimes.

426
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,252
No. You don't get it. At all.

427
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:19,610
I grew up on Bainbridge Island
with a mom who bakes casseroles.

428
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,761
I went to an all-girls
private school.

429
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,233
What was that like?

430
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,536
Too many blazers,
not enough boys.

431
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,107
Okay, more pressure.

432
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:38,090
Well, the casserole
part doesn't sound bad.

433
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:39,358
Mm.

434
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,299
First place at the block
party, three years running.

435
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:49,606
Fanciest swing set on the
block, huge room with a TV.

436
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,042
It was a good setup.

437
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,394
Yeah.

438
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,864
It was a really good swing set.

439
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,146
And in the summer,
my mom would take me

440
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,082
to this soft-serve
place on the beach.

441
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,307
We'd do cartwheels
until it was dark

442
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,876
and we were freezing and sandy.

443
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:14,949
'Cause in front of the other
prep-school moms, she wore pearls, but...

444
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,585
at the beach, she didn't
even wear makeup.

445
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,856
That was my favorite.

446
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:32,883
Anyway, my baby will
get the casseroles...

447
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:36,336
the swing set, the big room...

448
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,666
the cartwheels on
the beach, all of it.

449
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:43,777
Sounds really nice.

450
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,945
Do you wanna know
what I'm gonna name her?

451
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:49,917
Sure.

452
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,696
Ellie.

453
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,904
Ellie? I love that.

454
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,481
If you tell anyone I said
all that crap, I'll kill you.

455
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,154
Hey, I just IND'd an abscess
without packing it or using antibiotics.

456
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,622
Good. You're treating
my patients at random.

457
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,390
I know this place looks
like a shanty town to you,

458
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,677
but we do actually keep
records here, charts.

459
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,334
Hey, you know what you
don't keep? Basic gauze!

460
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,906
See, if you put a little aside
each day, you'd build a surplus.

461
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,921
Maybe stay in your
own lane, Dr. Bailey.

462
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,775
That's Chief Bailey. And I've
been asked to drive in yours, today.

463
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,511
And you're used to driving a
luxury vehicle with cruise control.

464
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:43,453
A little trickier when you're at the wheel
of an '86 Datsun with the engine on fire.

465
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,637
You know what?

466
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:51,178
If I were you, I'd take a look at
how I allocate my resources, is all.

467
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:54,364
Come here. You'll love this.

468
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,245
Two inmates just beat
the hell out of each other.

469
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,931
I've got one eyelid lac and
a human bite to the hand.

470
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,055
What do you need?

471
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,467
Lidocaine.

472
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:03,735
Lidocaine. Great.

473
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,204
I have 14 vials for
these two inmates.

474
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,758
Oh, and I also have to do a
digital block, a wound closure,

475
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,349
and drain an abscess,
so who gets the lidocaine?

476
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,746
- I...
- Here's another fun one.

477
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,915
Seven protein shakes
for eight pregnant inmates.

478
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:21,024
That's almost enough for every
woman to get one every other day.

479
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,087
How's that possible?

480
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,196
A dozen women
need sanitary napkins.

481
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,960
Good news. I got 35
for the whole week.

482
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,885
So, who gets and who
doesn't? Go ahead. Choose.

483
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:33,498
I see.

484
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:35,355
Seriously, make
a decision, Chief.

485
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,437
I understand. I get it.

486
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:41,039
I don't allocate my
resources. The state does.

487
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,457
And when the state
decides between

488
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,308
cutting the school
budgets or the prisons,

489
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,161
guess which one they pick.

490
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,570
So then I get to
pick. From this.

491
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,576
In here.

492
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,556
Hi. I'm Dr. Robbins.

493
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,842
You're the doctor.
I'm Emily Rochester.

494
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,911
Yeah, you're Kristen's
mom. Kristen's doing fine.

495
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,412
We're prepping her for the
procedure, which means...

496
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,465
- You haven't started yet.
- No. You're just in time.

497
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,049
Is... Is there anything
you want me to tell her?

498
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,353
No.

499
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,465
You can't tell
her that I'm here.

500
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,789
I'm sure that she'd be
happy to know her mom...

501
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,093
No.

502
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,797
I'm here for the baby.

503
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,933
I don't understand.

504
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,698
The mother is never gonna
bring the baby to visit?

505
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,155
Can she even do that?

506
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,136
If she's legally adopting her after the
baby's born and she signs the papers,

507
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,671
she can do whatever she wants.

508
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,922
I hate people.

509
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,675
Okay, so, do we tell
Kristen? 'Cause it'll kill her.

510
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,843
We have to.

511
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,377
No. We do not.

512
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,820
It's not our place, and
it's not our business.

513
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,568
So she's just gonna
give birth to that baby

514
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,242
and then never see her again?

515
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,844
We don't tell.

516
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,277
If my mother was abandoning me,

517
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,779
I would want to know
what was happening.

518
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,983
She's in agony as it is. Telling
her is only gonna make it worse.

519
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,841
We do not hurt her
more, not right now.

520
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,113
That's the probe?

521
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,621
Yeah. Maybe you
look the other way.

522
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,921
Once we start, you
have to stay very still.

523
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,594
No moving. You got it?

524
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,001
Okay, you're gonna
feel a little bit of pressure.

525
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,756
And we are in the
amniotic cavity.

526
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,310
Okay, now we're in the
abdomen of the acardiac twin.

527
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,912
And coagulating
intra-abdominal vessels.

528
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,643
What happens to
the tumor baby thing?

529
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,701
You just suck it
out or something?

530
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,697
Wilson?

531
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,565
Uh, the mass is harmless,

532
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:51,208
so it actually stays in
the belly until delivery.

533
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,626
Nasty!

534
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:56,146
The baby's tired from
pumping blood for two.

535
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:58,392
She'll feel much better soon.

536
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,735
I don't think I'm gonna tell
her about her vampire sister.

537
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,538
I mean, not until she's older.

538
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,391
You know, my mom never
told me anything juicy.

539
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,478
I hated being kept in the dark.

540
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,843
What's wrong?

541
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,162
What? Nothing.

542
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,331
No, it's not nothing.
You made a face.

543
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:21,699
Did you mess her up?

544
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,284
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Remember? We're not moving.

545
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,720
No, don't talk down to
me with that "we" crap!

546
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,090
There is nothing to
be upset about, Kristen.

547
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,542
Yes, there is. I can tell.

548
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,111
You're lying to me.
Is she lying to me?

549
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,879
No, Kristen. Your
baby's totally fine.

550
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,599
Rochester, calm down.
They're trying to help you.

551
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:38,717
Now you're lying to me?

552
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,818
No, I'm not. There,
there! I got it!

553
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,521
Get this stuff out of me!

554
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:44,356
Okay, we're done.
Probe is almost out.

555
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,391
Ow, ow, ow, ow! What did you do?

556
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,793
Nothing. Please,
just stay still.

557
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:50,645
I'm bleeding. I'm
bleeding. I can feel it.

558
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,853
I can feel it. I'm
bleeding all over.

559
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:56,267
It's not blood.

560
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,419
What?

561
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:58,787
Okay, all right. Hold pressure.

562
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,538
All right, I'm gonna
examine you now, okay?

563
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:01,839
Okay, we need a little privacy.

564
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,108
That's strictly
against protocol.

565
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,325
Can we at least shut the door?

566
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,465
No.

567
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,195
I am about to examine
her with her legs open.

568
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,299
The least you could
do is back the hell up.

569
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,899
Thanks.

570
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,039
All right, deep breath. Okay.

571
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,793
All right, you're
gonna feel my hands.

572
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,574
All right, I see pooling, so
it's definitely amniotic fluid.

573
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,343
And she's having
some contractions.

574
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,895
Okay, I need oxygen, suction,
and an infant warmer, Eldredge.

575
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,047
Did you hurt my baby?

576
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,948
- No, no, no.
- What's going on?

577
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,183
Everything is okay.
Nothing is wrong.

578
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,425
Your water broke, and
you're in pre-term labor.

579
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,358
She's in labor already?
Isn't it too early?

580
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,995
Well, she's 31 weeks,
which isn't completely to term,

581
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,485
but it's... it's far enough
along for survival.

582
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,450
I don't even have a crib yet.

583
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,336
Kristen's allowed to have you in
the room with her, for the labor.

584
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,737
Did you tell her that I'm here?

585
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,040
No. But she's
been asking for you.

586
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,975
And if you could just
come with me to see her...

587
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,833
I'm fine where I am.

588
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,708
She needs her mom.

589
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,804
She's having a baby.

590
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,558
I said that I'm fine where I am.

591
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,281
She's your daughter.

592
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,296
Do you have a daughter?

593
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,452
I do.

594
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,922
Well, keep an eye on her.

595
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,125
Pay attention.

596
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,745
I don't know what for,
because Kristen was...

597
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,183
perfect. She was beautiful.

598
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,502
I never could have imagined.

599
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,640
Just pay attention.

600
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:42,913
She's someone that I
don't even recognize now.

601
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,017
The baby is better off never
knowing her in the first place.

602
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,250
God!

603
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,818
They're five minutes apart.

604
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,920
I hate this! It hurts!

605
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:58,223
I know. I know. I know. But you
know what? You're doing great.

606
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,730
No, it's not that!
It's the cuffs!

607
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,036
Did Amanda call my mom?

608
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:08,016
Is she on her way?

609
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,350
I'm not aware of that.

610
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,118
You are keeping her from me!

611
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,236
No, I'm not.

612
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,793
I have the right.

613
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:16,312
She has the right to be here.

614
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,627
Call Amanda. I want Amanda!

615
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,284
Ms. Joseph is unavailable.

616
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,254
Why are you letting her do this?

617
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,769
No one ever tells me anything!

618
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,237
Her pulse is skyrocketing.

619
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,705
Okay, you need to
calm down, okay, honey?

620
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't call me stupid
freaking pet names!

621
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,071
I know you know.

622
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,907
Where is my mom?

623
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,670
Tell me!

624
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,189
Rochester. Settle down.

625
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,090
Okay, listen, we need to get
your pulse rate down, okay?

626
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,359
So just take a couple of deep
breaths with me, okay, Kristen?

627
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,494
Take a deep breath.

628
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,084
Why won't you just tell me?

629
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,666
She's downstairs.

630
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,434
- Wilson!
- Wilson.

631
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,975
Sorry. She doesn't
want to be lied to, right?

632
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,212
What?

633
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,648
I'm so sorry, Kristen.

634
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,762
Your mom's here,
but she won't see you.

635
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,741
I want to know why.

636
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,994
I don't know the
answer. I wish I did.

637
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,246
Well, tell, tell me again,
what did she say exactly?

638
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,115
I've told you
everything that I know.

639
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,272
Liar.

640
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,670
You're all liars.
Bring me my mom!

641
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,679
I wish we were lying, but
we're not. She won't come.

642
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:42,482
No. No. Liar.

643
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:47,404
Nobody's mom doesn't come
when they're having a baby.

644
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,242
I need her here.

645
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,195
I want my mom.

646
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,197
Mommy!

647
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:01,379
Okay. Kristen, Kristen, I'm
sorry, but it's time to push again.

648
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,764
No. I'm not gonna
do this, I won't.

649
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,650
Honey, it's gonna happen
whether you want it to or not.

650
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,007
No, I can't.

651
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,943
I can't do it alone.

652
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,166
You're not.

653
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,702
Get off!

654
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,888
Shush, shush, shush, I'm holding
your hand. You're not alone.

655
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,575
Now...

656
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,189
push.

657
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,260
Okay, great. Good, good, good,
good. Great job. Great job, Kristen.

658
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,762
Good, good, good, good, good.

659
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,531
I want my mommy!

660
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,017
Shush, I know, I know, I know.

661
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,154
Just tell her... just tell
her... Tell her I'm sorry.

662
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,938
Tell her I'm so sorry.

663
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,247
Tell her... tell her I
wish I could take it back.

664
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,352
Tell her that, and...
and maybe she'll come.

665
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,171
Please?

666
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,369
We're here with you.

667
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,410
Yeah, we got you.
We're here, Kristen.

668
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,876
I hate this. I hate you!

669
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,394
Get away from me!

670
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,812
Squeeze all you want.

671
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:10,564
You're pissed off.
You're hurt. You're tired.

672
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,223
You deserve to
be. Put it all on me.

673
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,539
Good, good,
good... Just like that.

674
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,391
Here we go. Another push. I need
a big push, Kristen. Push, push!

675
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,993
All right, keep your
head in the game.

676
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:24,011
We're here with you,
Kristen. We got you. Come on.

677
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,114
Keep on pushing, keep on
pushing, keep on pushing!

678
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,699
Yes! Yes, yes! Good job.

679
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:30,435
You got this, all right? Okay,
good. Okay, take a breath.

680
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,393
Great. That was perfect.

681
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,343
Can we undo two
of these restraints?

682
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,477
It's too risky.

683
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,895
They're cutting off
her blood supply.

684
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,830
She still has good blood
flow. They're not cyanotic.

685
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,867
She's having a baby! Do you think
that she needs this to hurt more?

686
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:49,470
If this was illegal before, it has to be 10
times more illegal now that she's in labor.

687
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,723
Rochester's K-10. She's
combative, unpredictable.

688
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,174
Well, can't we call someone?

689
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,292
I tried the sheriff.

690
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,115
There has to be someone else.

691
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,703
Me. I'm someone else.

692
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,305
So, it's up to you?

693
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,288
Come on, Dr. Eldredge!

694
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,129
You get to say yes here!

695
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,930
Say yes!

696
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,330
Hall, unhook them.

697
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,732
After what she did this morning?

698
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,439
You'll stay close by.
Unhook her restraints.

699
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:23,109
Hall, get them off
of her right now!

700
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,683
Okay, good job.

701
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,635
Here, here.

702
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:36,422
Good.

703
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,890
We are so close,
Kristen! We are so close!

704
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,242
You're doing so well.

705
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:47,045
Baby's head is out! Suction!
Okay, you're almost there.

706
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,362
One more push.

707
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,264
No, I can't. I can't.

708
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,256
Give us one more push,
and it'll all be over. Okay.

709
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,856
Okay!

710
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,246
Yes!

711
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,151
Just tell me she's okay.

712
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,388
Just... Just tell me I
didn't mess her up. Please.

713
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,346
No, she's perfect.

714
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,811
You should be so
proud of yourself.

715
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,486
Good job, Kristen.

716
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,283
I am.

717
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,671
Take her away. I
don't want to see her.

718
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:49,089
No, Kristen, that's
not what you want.

719
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,480
Yes, it is.

720
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,166
I'm not her mom.

721
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:57,304
I don't get to be
her mom at all.

722
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:00,106
I'm no one.

723
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,121
Just take her away.

724
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:08,248
No, Kristen, she's so beautiful.
Just look, just for a moment.

725
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,652
No.

726
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:29,468
I want to hold her.

727
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,694
Okay.

728
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
I want you to be good.

729
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,556
Okay?

730
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,892
Listen to your grandma.

731
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,761
Don't be like me.

732
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,868
I love you, Ellie.

733
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,790
Be good.

734
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,709
Please.

735
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,113
I'm your mama.

736
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,100
Remember me.

737
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,403
Okay?

738
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,224
Okay. I'm ready.

739
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,989
You sure?

740
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,573
Yes. Please take her.

741
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,696
Come here.

742
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,569
She'll be okay.

743
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,174
She'll play on
your nice swing set,

744
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,944
in your big room.

745
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,315
She'll grow up doing
cartwheels on the beach.

746
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,020
She's gonna miss you every day.

747
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,157
But she'll be okay.

748
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,355
What happens to Kristen now?

749
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:32,570
She'll recover here a few
days, then go back into gen pop.

750
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:33,721
For how long?

751
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,690
The rest of her
sentence. 20 years to life.

752
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,514
That's longer than
she's been alive.

753
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,366
You want to know what
she did to end up in here?

754
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,285
No. I really don't.

755
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,353
We're keeping Ellie for...

756
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:52,261
Hannah. Her name is
Hannah. Please call her Hannah.

757
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,011
The baby will be kept
in the hospital's NICU

758
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,029
for observation for
as long as she needs.

759
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,553
And then she can come home?

760
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:03,740
And then she can go with you.

761
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,443
Uh, any other questions?

762
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:09,827
No.

763
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,877
Was there something else?

764
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,613
If this one makes a mistake,
will you leave her, too?

765
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,020
Excuse me?

766
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:32,351
If you're ever looking for a new
job, please come see me first.

767
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,421
Yeah, well, same goes for you.

768
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,661
Maybe it won't be so bad.

769
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,114
Maybe she'll be okay.

770
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,494
Yeah, maybe.

771
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:05,751
No. She won't...

772
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,282
be okay.

773
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,067
<i>There's a reason doctors prefer</i>

774
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,808
<i>to see a patient in
person, face-to-face.</i>

775
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:15,723
You were right.

776
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,980
Stuff does happen to people.

777
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,863
I don't want to be right.

778
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,330
Karev. He came
to see me last night.

779
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,465
He told me...

780
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,800
I don't want to be right.

781
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,674
<i>It's the laying on of hands.</i>

782
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:31,355
<i>Human touch, that
spark of connection.</i>

783
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:33,307
Just listen to me. Karev...

784
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,425
I don't want to be right.

785
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:35,559
Wilson...

786
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,743
For God's sake, I
don't want to be right!

787
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,782
I want there to be
something good.

788
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,567
I want the world to be good.

789
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,736
For once, I want to
see sun and happy.

790
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,527
For once, I want to be
wrong. So just stop talking.

791
00:40:58,173 --> 00:40:59,583
<i>We lay hands on each other</i>

792
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,791
<i>so we feel like we're
all in this together.</i>

793
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,376
Say it.

794
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:11,867
Alex went to the D.A.
and took a plea bargain.

795
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,631
He's going to prison.

796
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:15,599
What? When?

797
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,485
Last night, before we left.

798
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,988
<i>We connect with each
other, because if we didn't...</i>

799
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,228
Stop the car.

800
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,664
Stop the car. I'm gonna be sick.

801
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,073
Let's go.

802
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,371
You okay?

803
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:55,761
Drive the car.

804
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,517
Drive the damn car!

805
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,089
<i>We would all feel so, so alone.</i>
