1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,008
<i>There are moments
when all the stars align.</i>

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,527
<i>When everything
seems as it should be.</i>

3
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,504
<i>Your life seems to
have sorted itself out.</i>

4
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,707
<i>It's not like all our
problems go away.</i>

5
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,371
- Oh, no.
- What?

6
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,073
- We fell asleep.
- Oh, we fell asleep?

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,781
Yeah. My kids will
be up. They'll see you.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,995
Is that such a bad thing?

9
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:37,497
- I've been over here
a lot lately.
- And they've never seen you.

10
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,801
Do you think that's an accident?

11
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,506
- What, so you don't want me
to meet them?
- Not in my bed.

12
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,970
- Okay, I understand.
- Okay.

13
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,060
Not yet.

14
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,490
- Just tell me where to go.
- Down the stairs

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,749
- and out through the back door.
- Okay, I'll be quiet as a mouse.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,153
<i>It's just that the problems
are suddenly manageable.</i>

17
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:00,793
<i>It feels so good,
you wonder if it's real.</i>

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,169
<i>And if I've learned
anything, I can tell you, it is.</i>

19
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,505
<i>It's very real.</i>

20
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,810
<i>- But it will not last.</i>
- Are you Major Owen Hunt?

21
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,340
I am.

22
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:23,543
Sir, I'm Major William Allen.
This is Chaplain Jane Roosevelt.

23
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,667
We're with the Army
Human Resource Command.

24
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,440
Is this about my sister, Megan?

25
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:34,554
Major, we have
reason to believe that...

26
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,217
Just tell them I'll need to push
my three o'clock lecture to four.

27
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,401
Thank you.

28
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,421
Aren't you supposed
to be at counseling?

29
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,390
I went. I went three times.

30
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:14,493
I barfed up all my childhood
sadness, I told them all my demons.

31
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,562
I participated. I feel
like I got enough out of it.

32
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,369
- Edwards...
- What I did was wrong.

33
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,372
I know. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:24,053
But I don't think I should miss
out on another day of education

35
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,088
because I didn't get a
stupid piece of paper signed.

36
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,208
- You feel calm? You feel controlled?
- Yes, yes.

37
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,512
How's your throwing arm?

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,151
Retired.

39
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:34,797
Give it to me.

40
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,657
Now get back to work.

41
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,001
- And if Doctor Minnick...
- I will talk to Doctor Minnick.

42
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,612
You are the one true king, sir.

43
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,316
Get out of here.

44
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,987
What do you mean
you're there? Where?

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,340
I hired a guy who gave me
his name and where he works.

46
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:03,143
It turned out he
was scheduled to do

47
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,345
a minimally invasive
conference here in L.A.

48
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,813
<i>So you're there, and
Jo's husband is there.</i>

49
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,733
- Yeah, I'm looking right at him.
<i>- Alex! What are you doing?</i>

50
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,923
<i>I don't know.</i>

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,338
<i>I don't know if I'm
gonna do anything.</i>

52
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,606
Sorry.

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,763
- Come home.
<i>- I can't yet.</i>

54
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,782
I gotta go.

55
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,121
What do we have?

56
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:30,236
Uh, BP's 95 palp. Somnolent,
but responsive to painful stimuli.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,238
SATS are 92 with a
100 percent oxygen.

58
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,295
On my count. One, two, three.

59
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,709
It's an MVC?

60
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,330
Sort of. Two people in one car.
Drove off a cliff on Admiral Way.

61
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,232
Do we have a name?
Haven't seen an I.D. yet.

62
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,784
- They didn't find a purse?
- No, they didn't even
find a blouse.

63
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,308
She came in dressed like this.

64
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,322
Why are people driving
around with no clothes on?

65
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,713
Passenger's next
door, maybe he knows.

66
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,580
- Talk to me.
- Male passenger, thirties,

67
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,699
unconscious and
intubated at the scene.

68
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,819
Vitals are stable. Large
bruises right chest and abdomen.

69
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,776
- Was he dressed?
- Except for his pants.

70
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,508
So these two were not
driving. They were parking.

71
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,694
The theory is they got overexcited
and popped the car into gear.

72
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,963
Premature acceleration. You
know happens to a lot of guys.

73
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,398
People need to get
busy where God intended,

74
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,618
in parking lots.
Where it's flat.

75
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,813
He's got a head lac and they
both have abdominal injuries,

76
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,815
Bailey's here and I
paged Doctor Grey.

77
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,306
You can jump in if you
want, but I think we got it...

78
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,314
Somebody please help my baby.

79
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,262
Please. Please,
someone help us, my baby.

80
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,047
- Here, right here. She's
choking on something!

81
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,272
Oh-two and cric kit, please!

82
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,496
Is she dying?

83
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,364
<i>Is she dying?</i>

84
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,328
<i>She's choking on
something.</i> It's okay.

85
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,319
Move. Move.

86
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,537
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, stop!

87
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,424
You're okay. You're okay.

88
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,711
- How long has she been choking?
- I don't know. A few minutes? Five?

89
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,280
Page neuro. Your baby's brain
may have been deprived of oxygen

90
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,404
for too long. Next
time, call an ambulance.

91
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,990
What?

92
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,515
Lower extremity deformity
with a large hematoma.

93
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,350
- I can't find a pedal pulse.
- Trauma panel,

94
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,569
- type and cross for eight.
- I hope the sex was good.

95
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,227
Is sex in a car ever that
good? All those windows.

96
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,426
Hey, miss. Hey, you're okay.
You're at Grey Sloan Memorial.

97
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,044
I do need you to keep
still, though, okay?

98
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,680
Abdomen's very distended.
Bring me the ultrasound now.

99
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:28,931
Is he alive?

100
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,039
- Can you tell us your name?
- Alison.

101
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,408
Please, is he alive?

102
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,857
Rapid intubation.

103
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,110
- Okay.
- I need a seven-oh E.T. tube.

104
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,560
She has a lot of
blood in her abdomen.

105
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,262
Alison, we're gonna take
you up to the O.R. now.

106
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:46,116
- Pressure's dropped! Seventy over 40!
- She's bleeding out.

107
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,719
Hang blood on the infuser and
prep her for a REBOA catheter.

108
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,321
No hemotympanum. Battle's
sign behind the right ear.

109
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,007
- He needs a head CT.
- I need you to explain

110
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,659
- why you're here, Edwards.
- Yeah, I got a six centimeter

111
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,761
oozing forehead lac here.
I'm gonna need a suture tray

112
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,196
- when you're done.
- You assigned counseling.

113
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,964
- I've been counseled.
- Lactate two point one,

114
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,183
- crit is 42. Labs are good.
- I'm seeing fluid

115
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,125
- in Morrison's pouch.
- You went to counseling
for a minute.

116
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,121
My paper's been signed
by Doctor Webber.

117
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,312
Oh, of course he did.

118
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,942
We need to clear him for a liver
lac. And until we rule that out,

119
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,901
- DeLuca, we need to keep him
on close observation.
- No, DeLuca.

120
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,481
- That's all you, Edwards.
- I can't, I'm on neuro.

121
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,850
You were. And now
you're on babysitting duty.

122
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,152
I'm sorry, two horn dogs
crash their sex mobile,

123
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,753
and I don't get a
surgery out of it?

124
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,211
Well, lucky for you, you
can sew up my head lac.

125
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,078
I should have just gone
to the stupid counseling.

126
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,069
- Damn right you should have.
- Page me when you get the scans.

127
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,408
Woah! Woah! Hey!

128
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,060
- What does that do?
- This is epinephrine.

129
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,652
It's for cardiac arrest.
Do you know what that is?

130
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,700
Okay. So we'll just
put that back there

131
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,391
and find out who you belong
to. Where are your parents?

132
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,326
Over here.

133
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,493
She's breathing fine. I think
you could start to feed her.

134
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:06,779
Yeah, what about her... her brain?
The other doctor said the oxygen...

135
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,580
I think I found
something of yours.

136
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:11,400
- Oh, my gosh. Where have you been?
- Please keep a close eye on her.

137
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,335
- It's very busy in here today.
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,805
- Gary, put the phone down!
- Well, I'm texting Karen.

139
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,523
Why are you texting the
nanny? She's off this week.

140
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:20,793
Yeah, but there's like a lot going
on, right? So maybe she could just...

141
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,717
Erin, you have to
stay with Daddy, okay?

142
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:27,833
Her neurological exam looks fine.
Her reflexes are good, she's alert.

143
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,252
I'd like to keep her here for
a few hours for observation

144
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,255
- as a precaution. Alright?
- Yeah, okay.

145
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,114
Um, the other doctor, the
one who, pounded on her.

146
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,927
What's his name?

147
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,095
- Was that Doctor Hunt?
- Yes.

148
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,231
We'd like to talk
to him if we could.

149
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,671
I'll tell him to come by.

150
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,525
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

151
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,499
Hey. What are you doing?

152
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,439
Okay. Ahh, did you treat a
choking baby this morning?

153
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,743
- Are we not speaking now?
- Yes! Why?

154
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,908
Ahh, baby's in the PICU for
observation. She looks good,

155
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,012
but the parents
want to speak to you.

156
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:12,878
- Why?
- I don't know.

157
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,430
I don't know if they're
upset or if they...

158
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,134
Upset because I
saved their baby?

159
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:20,008
Look, I am just the messenger.
They want to speak to you.

160
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,777
- I'll talk to them.
- Fine.

161
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,392
So, thank you, and I'll
see you on Saturday.

162
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,988
Sorry to bug you. Are...
are you Paul Stadler?

163
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,329
- Uh, do I know you?
- No. But I know you.

164
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,328
I couldn't put down your
paper on new approaches

165
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,497
to antibiotic resistance
to pathogens.

166
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:26,652
Ahh, yes, thanks. That was fun. It
was part of a whole W.H.O. thing.

167
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,905
Listen, I am this close to
a grant for I.B.S. research,

168
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,328
and your stuff...

169
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,683
I'm sorry. I'm Alex Stevens.
Can I buy you a drink?

170
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,469
Yeah. Absolutely.

171
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,322
God! Stop calling!

172
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,072
I told my girlfriend that I
will see you on Monday.

173
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,796
But every 20 minutes, she's
like, "What are you doing?"

174
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,966
Out of town means
out of town, bitch!

175
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,190
- Paul.
- Alex.

176
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,639
- This is from your wife.
- What?

177
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,361
You doing a single
interrupted suture layer then?

178
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,535
- No, running a subcuticular.
- Oh, even better.

179
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,331
- Not conscious yet?
- Nope.

180
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,800
- The girlfriend?
- Still in the O.R.

181
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,385
His head CT is clear. He
has a grade three liver lac.

182
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,254
Doctor Grey wants
serial abdominal exams

183
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,639
and six hour crits.

184
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,325
- Oh. Alright, sir.
- Hold on.

185
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,826
- Hold on. Alright,
I'm gonna get this out

186
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,128
of your throat, okay? One
second, I'm gonna count to three,

187
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,048
and you're gonna blow it
out. One, two, and three.

188
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,418
There you go. Great job. Okay.

189
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,506
- Get your head up. Clear that airway.
- What's happening?

190
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,440
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

191
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:31,510
Sir, you're in the hospital,
okay? You had an accident.

192
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,346
Let's get started with your
name. What's your name?

193
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,513
- Keith.
- Okay.

194
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,148
Keith, Keith, you're safe. Okay?

195
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,400
- We have Alison here too.
- Alison?

196
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,537
- Mm-hm.
- She's here? Is she all right?

197
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,589
- Did you talk to her?
- She was unconscious

198
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:44,991
- when she came in.
- Alison has pretty

199
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,192
severe internal injuries. We
got her in surgery right now.

200
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,549
Alison's in surgery?

201
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,264
- Okay, uh... when will she be out?
- Well, that's hard to tell.

202
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,632
- I have to go!
- No, no, settle down.

203
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:54,867
- I have to go see her!
- Settle down.

204
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,218
You need to stay
in bed. Hold on.

205
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,587
You need to lie in bed, okay?
You have an injury to your liver.

206
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,389
If you move, it could
make it much worse.

207
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,241
- I have to. Look, we
are gonna make sure

208
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,261
to let you know how she is
as soon as she's out, okay?

209
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,828
Right now, I need you to relax.

210
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,197
Okay.

211
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,231
- Okay?
- Okay.

212
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,499
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

213
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,423
Great. Alright.

214
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,422
- You're right. It perfed the esophagus.
- So do you need to open him up?

215
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,247
No, I think we should wait
a day and keep him on TPN.

216
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,179
I know this girl. She's trouble.

217
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,803
Hey, Erin. What you doing?

218
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,053
- What does this do?
- This...

219
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,308
does that.

220
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,923
- Woah! Is that his ribs?
- Mm-hm. That's his ribs!

221
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,243
- What's that?
- That little thing is a bullet.

222
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,147
- Nuh-uh.
- Nuh-huh.

223
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,898
- It broke his rib.
- She's better at this than you.

224
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,600
Did he die?

225
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,452
No, no, no. I mean,
it hurt a bunch.

226
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:47,803
But I think he'll be alright.

227
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,539
My dumb baby sister
almost died. She choked.

228
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,441
And where are your
parents? Are they in the E.R.?

229
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,745
In the ICU.

230
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,129
- I saw a man with only one ear.
- Wow,

231
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,782
really? Well, I'd like to see
that. Would you like to see that?

232
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,183
- Sure.
- Yeah, maybe you could show us

233
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,385
the one eared man on the way
back to your folks. What do you say?

234
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,129
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah, come on!

235
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,947
Okay. This is him? Sir?

236
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,697
Ahh, we think this might belong to
you. I think we found your radiologist

237
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,365
- in training.
- Yeah. Thanks.

238
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,833
- You're welcome.
- Sorry about that.

239
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,207
No, no. No worries.

240
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:22,310
That bloke is losing his mind.

241
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,105
Yeah, some people
just need a nanny.

242
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,413
So, do you want to... come
over for dinner tonight?

243
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,677
- What about the kids?
- With the kids.

244
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,432
You seem to like kids.
They seem to like you.

245
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:36,976
Yeah.

246
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,855
Yeah, sure. I mean, maybe
I could bring something,

247
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,999
- then you wouldn't have to cook.
- That's okay. I'll make something they like.

248
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,653
After they go to bed, you can...

249
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,379
stay.

250
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,937
Not all night. Just for a while.

251
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,472
Yeah, sounds good.

252
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,426
Sounds good.

253
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,108
Edwards, I assume your
patient's awake and stable

254
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,511
- if you felt comfortable
leaving him.
- Alert and oriented times three.

255
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,513
Lacs are repaired.
Vitals are stable.

256
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,281
He's looking for an
update on his girlfriend.

257
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,484
- Oh, hey, is she awake?
- Not yet. How is her boyfriend?

258
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,453
- Husband? Driving instructor?
- Definitely not husband.

259
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,688
Doctor Pierce repaired an
aortic injury, but she's not out

260
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,691
of anesthesia, yet.
Why not husband?

261
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,343
'Cause car sex is
only for when it's new.

262
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,111
- Or it could be cheating.
- Or why do it?

263
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,613
Someone is always uncomfortable
with the gearshifts and the consoles.

264
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,083
- There's limbs everywhere.
- You people need bigger cars.

265
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,369
Keith was asking about
her as soon as he woke up.

266
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,053
- Keith?
- Yeah, the co-pilot.

267
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,972
She did the same thing,
she asked about him first too.

268
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,691
They're in love. That figures.

269
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:34,510
That figures? What do you mean?

270
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,680
Well, two people who are in love
would wanna go to a beautiful place

271
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,744
to share their love.

272
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,119
It figures that they would wind up
bleeding in the bottom of a canyon.

273
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,420
- Wow!
- So cynical.

274
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,438
- That's what happened!
- Keith wants to be here

275
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,208
when she wakes up, okay,
but Grey wants him immobile

276
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,410
- for 24 hours.
- Guys, maybe it wasn't love.

277
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,878
- Doctor Avery?
- Alright? That's not romance

278
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,097
we're talking about here,
it was emergency sex.

279
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,900
And they were just too damn
horny to remember the parking brake.

280
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,169
- That's super cynical.
- What is wrong with you people?

281
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,621
- Seriously, wow.
- You should let him see her.

282
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,556
- She'll figure it out.
- Why,
because Prince Charming's kiss

283
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,326
is gonna wake her up? Prince
Charming has a grade three liver lac

284
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,844
that could kill him if he moves.

285
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,001
- Cynic!
- That's not... whatever.

286
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,004
Amelia.

287
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,818
Okay, so this is fun.
Owen is giving me

288
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,502
- the silent treatment now.
- No.

289
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:20,188
- Not you, me. I need your help.
- What?

290
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,530
I invited him over tonight.

291
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,366
- Nathan?
- To meet the kids.

292
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,582
- Wow.
- No, I feel...

293
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:32,356
- Nervous?
- Nauseous. I feel... really sick.

294
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,553
Because you think
the kids will like him,

295
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,688
and then it'll fall apart,
and he'll be gone,

296
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:37,873
and the kids'll be sad.

297
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,524
- No, it's not that.
- It's that.

298
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,626
I know this because I'm the
queen of thinking this way.

299
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,078
I always think
everybody's gonna die.

300
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,868
Yeah, but you're
crazy. I'm just...

301
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,404
sick.

302
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,768
Derek is dead.

303
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,642
Maggie is fine.

304
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,311
There's nothing in
your way, but you.

305
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,994
Let yourself have this.

306
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,633
Look at you, being the sane one.

307
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,037
Moments. I have moments.

308
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,288
<i>Doctor McCullough,
Doctor Kevin McCullough</i>

309
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,263
<i>to the I.C.U. Doctor
McCullough to the I.C.U.</i>

310
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,294
- Doctor Hunt?
- Yes, you asked to see me?

311
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,318
Yes.

312
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,135
Um...

313
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,720
This morning...

314
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,622
this morning...

315
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,093
You saved her.

316
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:29,057
You saved our baby girl. I never
could have done what you did.

317
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,542
Thank you, Doctor Hunt...

318
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Stop.

319
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,953
We thought we lost her, but
you brought her back to us.

320
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,097
Stop it!

321
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,262
Two soldiers came
to the house today.

322
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,212
They said they found her.

323
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,216
They said they found Megan.

324
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,023
Owen, I'm so sorry.

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,472
At least you know.

326
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,963
Maybe you can find some peace.

327
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,302
They said that she's alive.

328
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,769
They said...

329
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,725
they found her in a basement
in a rebel held neighborhood.

330
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,528
There was a raid and
they just left her there.

331
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,798
- She was there for...
- Where is she now?

332
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,078
Germany, Army hospital.

333
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,597
Did you talk to her? How is she?

334
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,699
- When is she getting here?
- I haven't. No, I haven't.

335
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,601
Oh, my God, Evelyn!
What did your mother say?

336
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,285
- Ha... Have you told her?
- How do we...

337
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,755
how do we even know that it's
her? What if it's not? What if they,

338
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,623
what if they got it wrong?

339
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,058
-I mean, -Owen.

340
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,215
They might have!
This might not be true.

341
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,752
- Okay.
- It might not be true.

342
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,254
Well...

343
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,844
let's find out.

344
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,095
Let's find out for sure.

345
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,228
Doctor Stadler's work combined
the worlds of fiber optics

346
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,517
and abdominal surgery...

347
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,755
forging the way for an
almost new specialty.

348
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,069
He started his research
when he was still a student

349
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,192
at Johns Hopkins,

350
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,162
showing an early
interest in new...

351
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,136
- Good luck out there.
- Thanks.

352
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,717
You nervous?

353
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,775
No, I'm good, I'm just
about to make a speech.

354
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,827
I'm a friend of Brooke's.

355
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,557
Your wife. Brooke Stadler.

356
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,077
The one who left you.

357
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,767
Yeah. How's she doing?

358
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,886
Where is she now?

359
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,388
You don't get to know that.

360
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,078
You don't get to think
about her ever again.

361
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,779
And if you come near her, I
will find you and I will kill you.

362
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,262
Do you understand?

363
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,719
- Who are you?
- Doesn't matter.

364
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,176
I know your name.

365
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,391
I know who you are.

366
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,260
And I'm watching you.

367
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:21,628
Doctor Paul Stadler.

368
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,263
Good luck.

369
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,084
Hey, Jo! It's me!

370
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:55,597
Hey, Alex.

371
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,786
Found her.

372
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,689
Thanks.

373
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:24,503
Whoa, whoa, no! No, no, no! What
did I tell you? What did I tell you?

374
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:26,605
- I have to go.
- Lie down. Lie down.

375
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,123
You're not supposed
to move for 24 hours.

376
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,509
Your liver could start bleeding
again. You could bleed out.

377
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,778
- No, let me go, okay?
- I can't.

378
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,046
I was the last
face she looked at.

379
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,150
Now, she's gonna wake
up in a hospital with a tube

380
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,402
in her throat and no
idea how she got here,

381
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,076
and surrounded by strangers,
and probably hurting like hell.

382
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,180
She's gonna be so scared. You...
you don't know how that feels.

383
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,483
- Yeah, I do, actually. I do.
- Then let me be there for her.

384
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,953
Let me be there
when she wakes up.

385
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,141
I... if she can just see me
first, she'll know she's okay.

386
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,427
She... she'll know. A...
and she won't be so scared.

387
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,997
Please? Let me do that for her.

388
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,134
Help me.

389
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:07,884
Please.

390
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,892
Yes. I'm calling on behalf
of Major Owen Hunt.

391
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,300
- I'm looking for a patient.
- Ask for Teddy Altman.

392
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,498
- What?
- Ask to talk to Doctor Altman.

393
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,105
Is there a Doctor Altman there?

394
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,947
Yes, I'll hold.

395
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,118
You speak German.

396
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,931
Hey, Doctor Altman,
this is Amelia Shepherd

397
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,922
from Grey Sloan Memorial. I...

398
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,192
I work with Owen Hunt.

399
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,038
Yes.

400
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:51,525
No.

401
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,198
- One sec.
- No.

402
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,620
I'm sorry, he won't.

403
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,650
I'm... I'm calling
about his sister.

404
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,343
Okay. We just need to confirm.

405
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,001
Right.

406
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,373
No, could we transfer her here,
as soon as she touches down?

407
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:23,193
Yes. Transfer to Grey
Sloan. Thank you so much.

408
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,534
She said she tried to call you.

409
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,069
Megan is being transferred
from Landstuhl now.

410
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,525
She will land at Madigan.

411
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:42,162
- And then we'll bring her here.
- We don't even know if it's her.

412
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,049
Owen, Teddy knows her.

413
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Teddy saw her.

414
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,249
I called Merritt Campbell.

415
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:06,481
She's the best PTSD
expert there is right now.

416
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,416
- She'll be here in the morning.
- Yeah, well, let's just wait

417
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,424
- and see how Megan is.
- Okay. But I meant for you.

418
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,644
For you too.

419
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,985
I got married right over there.

420
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,725
Then I got divorced.
Then I got married again.

421
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,198
And I went on with my life.

422
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,303
And I left Megan in
a hole in the ground,

423
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,671
for almost ten years.

424
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:47,021
Weeks would go by, and
I didn't give her a thought.

425
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,812
I couldn't spare her a thought,

426
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:54,118
when she was being
held and... tortured.

427
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,288
And I don't know what.

428
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,269
I stopped looking.

429
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,738
I gave up.

430
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,091
I gave up on her. I gave up.

431
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,165
I gave up on her.

432
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,570
- So Alison's waking up?
- Oh, you're not cynical.

433
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,520
No, you're the
one that's cynical.

434
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,537
Maybe they were in love or
maybe they were just horny.

435
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,277
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

436
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,281
We all love. We all get
horny and we all get hurt,

437
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,629
and then we come
through the other side.

438
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,487
And we get to help them do that.
We get to help them love again.

439
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,156
Or screw again,
either way, win-win.

440
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,004
But I... I think they're
in love. I choose love.

441
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,321
- Yeah.
- What do we have

442
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:13,380
- to be cynical about,
is my point.
- Oh, that... that's your point.

443
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:15,676
- Got it.
- Shut up.

444
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,342
Is she waking up?

445
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:34,345
Yeah, starting to. Avery,
you need something?

446
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,669
- No, just curious.
- Okay, Alison.

447
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,983
Alison, you with us?

448
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,077
- What happened?
- You were in an accident.

449
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,030
Is he dead?

450
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,143
- Did I kill him?
- Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

451
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,001
- You didn't do anything.
- Please, tell me I killed him.

452
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,902
- What did you say?
- There was a man in my car.

453
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,272
- Yes... Yes, he's here,
we have him.
- No, he got into my car

454
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:02,228
and he put a knife to my throat.

455
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,710
He made me drive to the woods.

456
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,400
He was trying to rape me.

457
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,784
And I thought, "No. No,
I'm not letting you do this.

458
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,753
"I'm not gonna let you do
this, not even if it kills me."

459
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,211
And I hit the gas.

460
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:21,264
Please, tell me he's dead.

461
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:23,597
- Call security.
- Stephanie's with him.

462
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:31,603
I am breaking the rules for
you. So be very still, okay?

463
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,606
Thank you so much.
You are a lifesaver.

464
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,262
Alright. Let's get
you out of here.

465
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,452
Oh, sorry. I thought
this was mine.

466
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,972
You going to the airport?
You want to split it?

467
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,644
Nah. I'll let you have this
one. I'll get the next one.

468
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,779
Thanks, man.

469
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,426
Airport, please.

470
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:39,459
ICU is reserved for family
only, so I'm gonna fudge it.

471
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:41,628
Just follow my lead, okay?

472
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,784
Brody, Brody, Brody.
What's going on?

473
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,480
Someone was assaulted.

474
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,584
- What?
- Yeah, I heard a patient
got raped.

475
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:53,573
They're looking for the guy.

476
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,926
Hey, no, no! Don't
get up. Don't get up.

477
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,800
Now you're gonna show me
the way out of here, okay? Okay?

478
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,375
Okay, backpacks upstairs,
let's get you guys changed.

479
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,943
Mommy has a friend
coming over for dinner.

480
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,193
- Is it Owen?
- No, it's someone
you haven't met.

481
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,599
Then why is Owen here?

482
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,147
I don't... what's going on?

483
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:26,011
Why don't you get the kids
squared away and we'll talk upstairs.

484
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,075
Okay. Alright, let's
go, guys. Come on.

485
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,899
This guy's been an
absolute train wreck.

486
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,919
- He said he'd need...
- I told you.

487
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,654
Someplace where people don't go,

488
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,022
- like a service elevator.
- I know. I know.

489
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,456
- Are you screwing with me?
- No. We just...

490
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,458
- 'Cause if you are...
- We just have
to get past him, okay?

491
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:51,760
Then we're fine.

492
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,811
I said, I don't know how he could
have broke it playing ping pong.

493
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,019
But, you know, just give
him a script for Keflex...

494
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,351
You got it. Thanks, doctor.

495
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:00,785
Hey, um, you need a hand?

496
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,870
No. No, we're fine. We're good.

497
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,627
Liver lac. Taking
him for a test drive.

498
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,347
- Really?
- Yeah, Minnick's orders.

499
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,443
Alright.

500
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,521
- Hey, where are we going?
- Here.

501
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,575
- You think you're funny?
- No, this goes straight down

502
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,976
- to the loading dock.
- You think it'll be funny

503
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,045
- when I cut your throat?
- It's either this or...

504
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,682
You told me I can't walk
and now you're sending me

505
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:33,050
down the stairs?
You're trying to kill me!

506
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,787
No, it's either this or the
elevator with the police!

507
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,977
This is... This is
what you want.

508
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,648
No!

509
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:44,129
No. No, you're not gonna run

510
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,564
and tell them where I
am. You're gonna help me

511
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:47,999
down the stairs.

512
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:50,323
Alright? Move! Come on.

513
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,806
I want someone with
that woman, every second.

514
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,475
- I want two officers
on this door.
- The patient's gone.

515
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,110
So is Edwards. I can't
find her anywhere,

516
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,415
she's not responding
to any texts.

517
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,103
Call a Code Orange.
Lock this place down.

518
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,611
Oh, will you quit that praying?

519
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,115
- I'm not praying.
- Then what do you keep saying?

520
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,552
I'm saying, "Please bleed
out. Please bleed out."

521
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:21,688
- Yeah, I guess
I kinda am praying.
- Shut up.

522
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,359
I said don't try anything!

523
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,031
See? See what happens? If you...

524
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,535
In here.

525
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,442
- Oh, evac.
- Yes.

526
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,071
- Hi.
- What the hell?

527
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:01,039
You need to go, you need to go
out that door, okay? Right now.

528
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,663
- It won't open again.
- Shut up.

529
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,883
- Hey, sweetie, what's your name?
- Don't tell him.

530
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,697
- Erin?
- Erin, where are your folks at?

531
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,932
In the ICU with my
baby sister who choked.

532
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,469
You need to go, okay,
and I'll let you out.

533
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,843
Hold on. Hold
on! Stop it. Stop it!

534
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:18,778
It's alright, sweetheart.

535
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,709
Just don't, don't, I'm
just gonna let her out,

536
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,429
and then you and I can keep
going where we're going. Okay?

537
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,013
- She'll tell them what she saw.
- She doesn't know what she saw.

538
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,752
- I want my mom.
- Okay?

539
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,270
Then we'll just go. We'll
go. Leave her locked in here,

540
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:34,522
and we'll go down the stairs,
and by the time they find her,

541
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,929
you'll be long gone, okay?

542
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,593
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

543
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,617
Okay.

544
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,217
No.

545
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,119
- No, no.
- Open it!

546
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:51,589
I can't! I can't. I can't. It's
locked. We're in lockdown.

547
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,613
Why?

548
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:54,961
Because a rapist
is in the hospital.

549
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,902
- What, we're trapped in here?
- We're trapped in here.

550
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:14,935
- So, and you're sure it's her?
- It's her.

551
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,964
The Army won't tell you
unless they're certain.

552
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,889
- And when is she coming?
- Now.

553
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,805
Tomorrow.

554
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,271
- Does Nathan know?
- No. Owen hasn't
even told his mom.

555
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,012
So, no, Nathan doesn't know yet.

556
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,777
I'll tell him.

557
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,746
Well, if he's coming
over, just wait.

558
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,921
No. If Derek were alive, I
would want to know right now.

559
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,585
- Can you watch...
- Yeah.

560
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,710
Okay, Ellis needs her
stuffie. Story and bed by eight.

561
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,045
Yup.

562
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,671
- Have they found him yet?
- No.

563
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,151
And no word from Edwards?

564
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,043
No. And I can't go looking
for her. I'm stuck here.

565
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Sit down. Sit down.

566
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:05,986
Look...

567
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:08,755
there are cops everywhere.

568
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,457
- They'll find her.
- I know, I just...

569
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:16,596
I left her in the room with him.

570
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,281
You know...

571
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:31,689
he probably got out before
they even called the lockdown

572
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,180
or they would have
found him. He's long gone.

573
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,730
Well, if that's true, then why
isn't she answering her texts?

574
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:42,283
Maybe it's locked on the other
side of a door from where she is.

575
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,427
I can't get to my
phone right now.

576
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,244
Yeah, maybe so.

577
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,613
I mean, maybe.

578
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,630
Hey, she's okay.

579
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,618
Edwards is fine.
Alright? She's fine.

580
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,090
You're not cynical.

581
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,259
I'm not cynical enough.

582
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,224
I was actually rooting for them.

583
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,481
You made up a good
story about a patient.

584
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,517
Every one of us has done that.

585
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,362
I liked your version a hell of
a lot better than the real one.

586
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,948
Why is he so mad?

587
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,598
He's having a bad day.
Let's just stay quiet, okay?

588
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,434
I want to go to my mom.
I want my mom and dad.

589
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,321
There's gotta be a way out of here!
There's gotta be a way to open it!

590
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:38,856
There isn't or I
would have tried.

591
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,194
- You open the door right now!
- I can't! Okay? I can't.

592
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,496
Nothing is gonna open those
doors except security calling off

593
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,720
the lockdown.

594
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,834
- Or... or, like,
emergency services.
- What... what do you mean?

595
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,041
It's like a fire, a
fire or something.

596
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,767
Come on. Come on! Come
on! Come on, come on!

597
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,333
Give me something
that I can start a fire with.

598
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,585
No... No. You can't, you're
not, you can't start a fire in here!

599
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:11,823
Shut up! Okay? I'm just
gonna set off the sprinklers.

600
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:14,358
Make the doors open.
There'll be an evacuation.

601
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:15,893
- Now, what can I use?
- No, that's crazy.

602
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,251
- You're gonna kill us all.
- Will this work?

603
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,774
Will this make a fire?

604
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,747
You're a good girl.

605
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,506
Yeah.

606
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,098
You got it, attagirl.
Bring it here.

607
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,267
- Set it on the floor
right there.
- Stop it. Stop it.

608
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,503
Now, go in there and get
one of those blue things.

609
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,694
- Stop making her help you.
- You can help me,

610
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,197
and I can stand here
with her. Either way.

611
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,162
Now, now squirt that
stuff all over the blue thing.

612
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,063
Don't do it! Don't do it,
Erin! Don't do it. Don't.

613
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,849
- She's not starting a fire
for you.
- Damn it!

614
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,183
- Don't do it.
- Damn it!

615
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,608
- Come here, come here.
- Come to me.

616
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,962
You stay right there. Right
there. You stay right there.

617
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:09,435
- I don't like him.
- It's okay. He's gonna go soon.

618
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:18,127
Okay, okay. okay.

619
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,549
Now, when the doors unlock,
I'm gonna take your card

620
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:25,246
- and the girl.
- What? No! No, no.

621
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,516
Nobody's gonna stop a guy
carrying a kid out of a burning building.

622
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,302
- No, she stays with me.
- No, you stay here.

623
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,309
Someone'll find
you at some point.

624
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,164
Okay, Erin? My name is Stephanie.
I want you to do me a favor, okay?

625
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,865
I just want you to turn
around and cover your eyes.

626
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,016
- Like hide and seek.
- Okay.

627
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,484
Okay, turn around.

628
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,453
- Keep them covered.
<i>- There are days</i>

629
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,877
<i>when you feel like you
can conquer anything.</i>

630
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,804
Yes. Yes!

631
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,308
Come on. Come on.

632
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,612
Come on. Come on.

633
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,786
<i>And it feels like
everything will be okay.</i>

634
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,472
<i>Like I told you, the
feeling doesn't last.</i>

635
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,220
<i>I'm not trying to be
cynical. It's just that,</i>

636
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:59,328
<i>even when a day
starts out so, so well...</i>

637
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:06,319
It's okay! It's okay! You're okay,
aright? You're okay! We're okay!

638
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,023
We're gonna go. We're gonna take
you to see your parents. It's okay.

639
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,286
Oh, God.

640
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,292
Oh, no.

641
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,328
What is it?

642
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,241
Go, go, all the way over
there. Okay? Stay over there!

643
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,315
- No, Stephanie!
- I'll be right back, okay?

644
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,217
<i>That day can end...</i>

645
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,453
<i>so, so badly.</i>
