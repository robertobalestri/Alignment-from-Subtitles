1
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:12,889
<i>In 1949, Edward Murphy
conducted a rocket-sled experiment</i>

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,492
<i>to see how much pressure a
human being could withstand.</i>

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,717
Good morning.

4
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,953
I've organized the
monthly rotation schedule,

5
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:29,856
I got up to speed on all the
upcoming general elective surgeries,

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,892
and I have some ideas about
which residents are ready

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,861
for the next phase of
Dr. Minnick's training.

8
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:37,497
Um, I could run
that by you, or...

9
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,534
<i>Murphy's experiment
failed. Spectacularly.</i>

10
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:41,668
Or not.

11
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:42,819
<i>Over and over.</i>

12
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,356
Whatever you like. Sorry.
What would Dr. Grey usually do?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,992
Uh, Dr. Grey wouldn't
talk to me about any of it.

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,717
She would just do it. Go. Do it.

15
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,580
Oh, okay, sure. Yeah.

16
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:57,684
<i>Needless to say, he didn't
start off on the right foot.</i>

17
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:01,388
Kepner. You don't
have to check in with me.

18
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:05,580
I trust you. You do you.
It's your department now.

19
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,297
<i>That's why it's
called Murphy's law.</i>

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,098
<i>Because if anything
can go wrong, it will.</i>

21
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,301
You may have thought you were
done talking about this, but I wasn't.

22
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,803
Richard, it was
three in the morning.

23
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,273
I have surgery, I needed
sleep. You need sleep. Come on.

24
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:21,941
You told Bailey to replace me.

25
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:25,845
No, baby. No. I told
Bailey there was a problem.

26
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,881
- You told her
there was a problem?
- Yes.

27
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,383
You see a problem in our
marriage, will I hear about it?

28
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,069
Or will some consultant come
and kick me out of our bedroom?

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,554
Stop. You know
me better than that.

30
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:37,179
No, Catherine. Right
now, I don't. I really don't.

31
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,294
Okay. Take OR Four,
and make sure you do

32
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,564
the post-op debriefing
with a resident, right away.

33
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,566
Is Dr. Grey out
sick or something?

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,903
Dr. Grey is suspended. I am
the interim department chief.

35
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,109
Until further notice.

36
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,845
- You are?
- Yes.

37
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,199
Yes.

38
00:01:58,736 --> 00:01:59,901
Yes.

39
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,522
Okay.

40
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:05,535
Oh, Dr. Kepner.
Dr. Bailey told me

41
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,436
you're filling in for
Dr. Grey as chief of general.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,110
- I am.
- Well, congrats!

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,808
Well, I didn't... I mean,
it was a necessary...

44
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,526
- I need your help.
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,728
I'm beginning phase two of
my teaching program today.

46
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,347
- Right. Phase two.
- And I need someone

47
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,449
to supervise Ben Warren
through a colectomy.

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,633
Dr. Hawkins was gonna do it,

49
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,301
but he's sick. Can you
assign someone else?

50
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,904
Okay. Yeah. Let's see
who has a colectomy.

51
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh...

52
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:28,141
Is there a problem?

53
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,375
No.

54
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,362
No, not at all. All good.
I do have a surgeon

55
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,565
available with one, and
I will just assign it to him.

56
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,538
- Great. Thanks.
- Sure, yeah.

57
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,055
Do you know where Dr. Webber is?

58
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,442
Did April say anything?
Like why she jumped ship?

59
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,311
I haven't seen her. She
was home late and out early.

60
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,885
Oh, she's slinking then.

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,517
She knows what she did. She's
slinking. Traitor. No offense.

62
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,470
Look, I can't believe that she
would have done this either.

63
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,188
I can't believe
Bailey asked her.

64
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,291
- How's Grey holding up?
- She's bored.

65
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,443
She's worried Kepner's
gonna kill all of her patients.

66
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,345
Kepner's a solid surgeon.
You have to give her that,

67
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,497
no matter how anyone
feels about her taking the job.

68
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,300
Yeah, of course, she's a great
surgeon. Guys, we're losing ground here.

69
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,301
Okay? We lost Grey,
we're now losing April.

70
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,871
And we don't have the
residents. They love Minnick.

71
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,123
And she's about to start
phase two of her program.

72
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,158
- Phase two?
- A resident gets
to be the primary

73
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,482
surgeon on their own case.

74
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,863
One procedure, pre-op
to post-op, start to finish.

75
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,915
- Under supervision, right?
- Yeah,

76
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,574
but the resident does it all.
The attending is there to assist.

77
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,059
The resident?

78
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:38,800
- Start to finish, baby!
- Ugh, would you quit bragging
already?

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,537
- Yes!
- I don't get it. Why you two?

80
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:46,653
'Cause Minnick recognizes
I'm the best resident. Obviously.

81
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,090
- I don't know why you got one.
- Special treatment.

82
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:53,309
- From his chief-wife.
- It's not special treatment.

83
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,544
And don't call her that.

84
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,595
Minnick told me she
drew names from a hat.

85
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,032
- Yeah, see?
- Whatever, Mr. Bailey.

86
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,969
She's really gonna let you do
a whole surgery with no help?

87
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,554
No hand holding,
no training wheels,

88
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,522
no safety belts,
no gutter bumpers.

89
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,575
- Phase two, baby.
- Shut up, baby.

90
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,196
Yeah, what happened to you? Last night,
you were like, "Let's start a revolution!"

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,398
Well, this morning, I would
say that we're winning.

92
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,556
Now, gosh, if you'll
excuse me, children,

93
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,304
Mama's gotta go do surgery.

94
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,043
<i>Dr. Sern, two-four-seven-six.
Dr. Sern, two-four-seven-six.</i>

95
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,418
- Good morning.
- Kepner.

96
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,489
April. How's your new job going?

97
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,526
So busy, as I'm sure you know.

98
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,356
Dr. Webber, can I
talk to you for a sec?

99
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,479
Sure.

100
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,394
Maybe could we go somewhere
a little more private, or...

101
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,268
Kepner, I'm pretty busy.
What do you have to say?

102
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:51,017
Um, it's about your
partial colectomy today.

103
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,540
It's now Ben Warren's.

104
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:55,471
- I beg your pardon?
- Start to finish.

105
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,862
I'd like Dr. Warren to
scrub in as primary surgeon.

106
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,867
- You'd like?
- And you can assist

107
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,616
and help only when requested,
but it will be Dr. Warren's OR.

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,007
Why don't you let
Bailey take this one?

109
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,584
Because I have
assigned it to you.

110
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,396
Well, I suggest
you un-assign it.

111
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,236
I would really rather
not, Dr. Webber...

112
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:22,804
sir.

113
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,897
Please... just... please?

114
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,905
Sure thing... Chief.

115
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,576
- There you are.
- Yes. And I'm ready.

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,079
I have Mrs. Mallenbaum's
labs, I booked an OR.

117
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,682
Edwards, unbook it. Mrs.
Mallenbaum had a complication.

118
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,801
What? Did she have breakfast?

119
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,458
No. She died.

120
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:18,626
Oh.

121
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,662
Oh, God. That's...

122
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:24,916
- That's awful.
- It's okay to be disappointed.

123
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,370
You were excited.
I was excited too.

124
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,200
So should I go down to the
pit or something instead, or...

125
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,003
You know what? Yes. If you're
gonna do a true start-to-finish,

126
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,729
we should both go down to the ER
and see if we can start one on intake.

127
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,933
- We're trolling.
- We're trolling.

128
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,670
Can you check Mr. Lewis's
drains for me, please?

129
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:51,804
Yes, doctor.

130
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,205
All right, I've been thinking.

131
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,097
All right, we are in a
corner. Okay? It's time.

132
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,279
One of us needs to talk
to my mother about this.

133
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,615
And I know what you're gonna
say, right? I don't care how...

134
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,173
- Jackson, she knows.
- She...

135
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,176
She knew before anyone.

136
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,345
- She's not with us.
- No, she...

137
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,262
This was my mother's idea? I
thought, I thought this was Bailey's.

138
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,799
So did I. But no,

139
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,801
- Bailey decided I need to...
- You should stop talking
right now.

140
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,637
- What?
- Dr. Webber.

141
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,456
Oh, need something, Warren?

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,458
Well, um... Well you, sir.

143
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,460
I have my start-to-finish
surgery today,

144
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,911
and you were assigned to...

145
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,634
Assist you. Yeah. Right.

146
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,555
- We'll talk later.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,126
- Warren.
- Jackson.

148
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,894
Boring. Boring. Weird and
gross. Exceptionally boring.

149
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:50,430
None of these are surgical.

150
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:52,248
Can I get a portable
ultrasound to Bed Two, please?

151
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,416
- Of course.
- Dr. Murphy.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,617
Talk to me about Bed Two.

153
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,886
It's a nine-year-old boy with
right upper quadrant pain.

154
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,504
I'm betting it's
acute cholecystitis.

155
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,456
But I've gotta get the
ultrasound to confirm.

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,591
Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,948
- That won't be necessary.
- Am I missing something?

158
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,128
Wait. No, no, no!

159
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,932
Dr. Edwards is taking over
this case now, from start to finish.

160
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,399
Thank you for
finding it for her.

161
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,953
No! I started it, I get to
finish it! I love gallstones!

162
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,322
- Yes!
- You'll get your turn,
Dr. Murphy.

163
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,381
And when that happens,
Dr. Edwards will be there to support you.

164
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,678
<i>Physical therapy to Five West.
Physical therapy to Five West.</i>

165
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,593
Wait, honey, tell me
again. Where's Dr. Grey?

166
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,762
Good morning, Ms.
Gagliano, I am Doctor...

167
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,253
Not Dr. Grey.
She's not Dr. Grey.

168
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,750
Where's Dr. Grey?

169
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,688
Dr. Grey is unavailable to
perform your surgery, Lynne,

170
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:52,374
so, Dr. Kepner will be
performing it with Dr. Pierce.

171
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,732
She's gonna take out my cancer?

172
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,881
Ms. Gagliano, I've successfully
operated on several esophageal cancer...

173
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:02,223
Listen, Dr. Not-Grey. I
don't care what you've done.

174
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,143
Dr. Grey found my cancer.

175
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,942
She told me about it. She held
my hand while I bawled about it,

176
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,434
she told me how she
was gonna take it out.

177
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,689
I've been going to the same
hairstylist for 23 years. Why?

178
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,592
Because she knows
how I like my roots done.

179
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,730
Dr. Grey knows my roots.

180
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,102
Let's cancel the surgery.
I'll wait for Dr. Grey.

181
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,586
Lynne, that kind of
loyalty is really appreciated.

182
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,770
Thank you.

183
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,761
Loyalty is so
rare in this world.

184
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,576
But we're not sure when
Dr. Grey will be back.

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,745
And with the risk of
your cancer spreading,

186
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,068
we can't wait.

187
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,840
But I'll be there. Your
roots are safe with me.

188
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,625
When did the pain start?

189
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,627
When we were in our car
on the way to the seaport,

190
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,262
Matty kept complaining
about his stomach.

191
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,297
It's been off and on
for the last few days,

192
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:08,233
but it kept getting worse, so we just
turned around and came back here.

193
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,236
I mean, it's probably
just a stomach bug, right?

194
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,860
We're going on a cruise.

195
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,762
- Ooh, that's fun.
- It's called an Explorer Cruise.

196
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:17,178
All inclusive,
three ports of call.

197
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,862
And they have rock-climbing
walls, and even movie nights.

198
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,181
And they teach you
to surf right on deck!

199
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,101
See... He's more excited
than Matty is about this trip.

200
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,965
- It's like I have two children.
- Matty, can you
raise your arms for me?

201
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,574
Also, if we get to the car within
the hour, we can still make it.

202
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,176
Dana... Maybe we're
just overreacting.

203
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,945
- Dana!
- I'm being optimistic.

204
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,697
Matty's been looking
forward to this for a year.

205
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,617
Hillary, Dana, I'm afraid
Matty has gallstones

206
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,101
and a very inflamed gallbladder.

207
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,737
Gallstones? But he's nine.

208
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,306
It's very rare in someone
Matty's age, but it can happen.

209
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,429
Oh, gosh.

210
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,559
Oh, sweetie.

211
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,701
- But will we still
be able to go?
- It's okay, son, don't worry.

212
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,221
Will we be able to go?

213
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,445
Not today, buddy.
You need surgery.

214
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,477
Oh, my God. That was so hard.

215
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,446
Hey, they can
reschedule a vacation.

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,781
You can't get caught up
in their story. Not your job.

217
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,851
No, it was so hard
to keep from smiling.

218
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,086
Especially when I said,
"You're gonna need surgery!"

219
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,589
I'm just happy that you're here.

220
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,053
I'm trying not to
hug you, right now.

221
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,841
Okay, make it quick.

222
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,932
- Thank you.
- All right.

223
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,418
Now, talk me through
your surgical plan.

224
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,242
Well, after trocar insertion...

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,550
Your very own start-to-finish
partial colectomy, huh? Pretty spiffy.

226
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,936
Yeah. Yeah.
Should be pretty cool.

227
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,273
What's the matter?
Oh, are you nervous?

228
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,609
No, it's not
nerves. It's just...

229
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,157
I wish I had a different
attending, that's all.

230
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,642
If people don't like what Minnick's
doing, they don't really try...

231
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,084
Well, who's the
attending? I'll talk to him.

232
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,452
Dr. Webber.

233
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,968
Yeah. Yeah. So
this should be fun.

234
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,020
Oh, and no, no,
you won't talk to him.

235
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,445
I have enough problems being
your first lady. Just stay out.

236
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,015
My first what?

237
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,745
Dr. Pierce, do you think
I might have a chance

238
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,614
to dissect the
thoracic esophagus?

239
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,748
No, Wilson.

240
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,483
I don't see why
not, Dr. Pierce, if...

241
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,542
Because we already have one
surgeon we didn't plan for, is why not.

242
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:32,878
Okay, I get it, you are
unhappy about Dr. Grey,

243
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,797
but I am not the one
who suspended her.

244
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,565
I'm unhappy about
the fact that Dr. Grey

245
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,701
and I worked hard to plan this
surgery, and you are skipping steps.

246
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,487
You just ligated a branch that
we might need for the anastomosis.

247
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,612
And now the esophagus is ready
to be excised, which was quicker.

248
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,019
V-fib! She's in cardiac arrest!

249
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,523
- Ready?
- Grab the paddles!

250
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,361
One, two, three.

251
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,103
Paddles! Charge to one-twenty.

252
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,567
Clear.

253
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,974
So, what now? Can
we still excise the tumor?

254
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,548
No. We can't.
She's too unstable.

255
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:22,961
We have to close her up,

256
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:25,569
do a cardiac work-up.
Observe her in ICU.

257
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,367
Sorry, Lynne. You're
gonna have to keep waiting.

258
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,970
Why are you looking at me? I
didn't give her a heart attack.

259
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:42,097
Dr. Bailey. Need something?

260
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,640
Warren is doing his start-to-finish
surgery, I thought I'd observe.

261
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,176
Really? Observe Warren or me?

262
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,080
You asked her to come in here?

263
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,226
You don't trust me
to follow the protocol?

264
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,596
No, sir, I didn't even know
that she was gonna come.

265
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,231
Uh, he didn't say that.
And I didn't say that.

266
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,535
You said that.

267
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,758
- I think we're good.
- I think I'd like to watch.

268
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,319
- I had a heart attack?
- Yes,

269
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,920
but we were able to
intervene very quickly.

270
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,122
But you didn't get
the damn cancer out?

271
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:27,442
No, we weren't able to remove
the tumor. After your heart attack...

272
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:31,180
I knew something was gonna go wrong
the minute Dr. Not-Grey showed up.

273
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,981
Dr. Grey wouldn't have
been able to do anything...

274
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,199
You know, why don't we...

275
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,943
why don't we give you a few
minutes of peace and quiet?

276
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,112
That poor woman's body
is still riddled with cancer.

277
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,046
We did just save her life. You'd
think she'd see that as a plus.

278
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,633
Shut up! Just shut your face!

279
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,474
- Maggie!
- I thought you were with us.

280
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,572
I thought you were with Richard.
And then you go and do this.

281
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:00,809
- I took a job! It was an opportunity!
- It's aiding the enemy!

282
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,444
I'm not saying I agree
with what Bailey did!

283
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,097
But you are saying that it's
not a deal-breaker. Not for you.

284
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,222
Not if it gets you
what you want. Traitor.

285
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:12,755
I'm doing my job!
This is my job, Maggie!

286
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,562
Someone here has
to act like an adult!

287
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,338
And now I am dividing
the white line of Toldt.

288
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,907
Beautiful dissection,
Dr. Warren.

289
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,661
Thank you, sir.
Dr. Webber, more suction.

290
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:36,584
Are you gonna be one of those
surgeons who plays music in this OR?

291
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,464
Yeah, I might be.

292
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:41,534
Well, choose your playlist
carefully. I once had this resident

293
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:43,019
who made it all
the way to close,

294
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,137
and then all of a sudden,
this music comes on.

295
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,456
It was the most ridiculous
song I've ever heard,

296
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,158
it was complete gibberish.
Stay away from the ureter.

297
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,210
Yep. More traction, please.

298
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,413
I was that resident.

299
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:57,349
And "MMMBop" was
very popular at the time.

300
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,453
That was you,
huh? It was catchy.

301
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,840
Dr. Warren, did you know

302
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,615
that my first solo surgery
was also with Dr. Webber?

303
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,630
Indeed. But somewhere
between then and now,

304
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,255
Dr. Bailey forgot that
I know how to teach.

305
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,593
No, what I'm saying is,
the chief gives an order,

306
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,579
you follow the order,
you try to make it work.

307
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,031
- Spoken like a true soldier.
- Spoken like a former chief.

308
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,883
- Right, on both counts.
- So you're neutral,

309
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,418
is what you're saying.
You're Switzerland.

310
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,252
I'm saying Bailey's the chief.

311
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:37,456
But that doesn't mean
that I'm against Webber.

312
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,057
Yeah, I get that. I really do.

313
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,692
But what are you supposed
to do when you're completely

314
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,327
against the order that
you've been given?

315
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,729
Well, that's called a coup.

316
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,164
Frowned upon, but
sometimes very necessary.

317
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,600
Oh, so that's what
we're talking about here?

318
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,417
Throwing Minnick out?
Or throwing Bailey out?

319
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,986
No, it's just we want Webber in.

320
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,938
That's all. I mean, I guess
that means Minnick has to go.

321
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,882
So what?

322
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,968
I don't know what we're gonna
do here, but we gotta do something.

323
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,860
So, Hunt, you with us? Or are you
too busy being Switzerland over there?

324
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,108
How's Kepner doing?

325
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,413
What do you mean
how's Kepner doing?

326
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,495
- She's a turncoat.
- But she's also a friend.

327
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,596
Yes, she's a friend.

328
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,098
She's a poor, misguided,
very confused friend.

329
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,351
It's like when you find out
that your friend voted wrong.

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,752
- Can you vote wrong?
- Yeah!

331
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,296
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,457
I'm sorry, but she
was leading the charge

333
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,426
and then Bailey
dangles a little carrot

334
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,844
and suddenly it's,
"See ya, Webber!"

335
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,244
I'm sure there's
more to it than that.

336
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,763
Well, it's not right,
what Bailey did.

337
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,855
You can't just throw anybody
in as chief of general surgery.

338
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,342
Keps is good, but Grey
put in the time for that job.

339
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,378
She deserves it. All right.
I'm gonna get back to work.

340
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,626
You know, Switzerland doesn't
engage in international conflicts.

341
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,847
It serves in peacekeeping missions,
and protects Switzerland itself.

342
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,900
Keeping the peace. And protecting
ourselves. That's what we're doing.

343
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,203
So we're all Switzerland,
then, aren't we?

344
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,659
Doesn't feel like it.

345
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:03,425
- What the hell?
- Is that the OR schedule?

346
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,961
Yeah, but why is a
resident listed as a lead

347
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,168
surgeon on a lap
chole on a peds case?

348
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,155
Damn it, Minnick.

349
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:15,171
I didn't want you out of the
way. Why would you say that?

350
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,256
- Anastomosis looks...
- Yes. Good. Good.

351
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,230
Yeah. We can
pull out the trocar.

352
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,577
- Let me see, okay, you fired me.
- I didn't fire you.

353
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,080
- Then you fired Grey.
- I suspended Grey.

354
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,434
Does the umbilical port get closed
with a deep or superficial closure?

355
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,751
- Both.
- Both.

356
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,154
You know, pretty soon, you're
gonna find yourself out of teachers.

357
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,256
It's tough to be a leader
when there's no one to lead.

358
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,993
I am not afraid to be unpopular
for the good of the hospital.

359
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,229
That's not you. I know that
Catherine put you up to this.

360
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,031
- I know it was her idea!
- Fascia's closed.

361
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,256
- I love my wife.
- "Great, Dr. Warren, keep going."

362
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,504
Three-oh nylon and Steri-strips.

363
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:52,024
I can stand up just fine.
And that's exactly what I did.

364
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,960
Who gave you permission to let a
resident operate on a nine-year-old?

365
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,228
We're implementing
phase two of my program.

366
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,248
No, you're not implementing
phases on a kid.

367
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,749
Look, he's really
big for his age.

368
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,302
It's a lap chole. It's
a simple procedure

369
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:05,170
that Dr. Edwards is
perfectly capable...

370
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:09,391
You're not a peds surgeon. You
are a sports medicine ortho surgeon.

371
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,609
I am scrubbing in.

372
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,078
I was trained in general
surgery, just like you.

373
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:14,763
And I teach for a living.

374
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,765
I taught five lap
choles last month,

375
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,101
but if it will make you
feel more comfortable,

376
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,404
then please, join us,
Dr. Robbins. I'd love to have you.

377
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,478
- Good.
- But only to observe.

378
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,781
I'm gonna go get Matty prepped.

379
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,700
No.

380
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,669
No?

381
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:35,116
No. You go give the
parents a pre-game.

382
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,176
You are the lead surgeon.
Which means I prep your patient.

383
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,495
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:42,896
Okay.

385
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,231
Look at that. See? When you
let yourself have a little fun...

386
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,251
Don't do that. Just... don't.

387
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,885
- Don't do what?
- That.

388
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,149
It was cute in the beginning,
but it's not anymore.

389
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,962
You'd rather sacrifice your
students than swallow your pride

390
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:05,798
and admit that someone found
a better way to teach them.

391
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,532
- Instead of...
- scissors.

392
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:11,336
You want to devote your time
to bringing this hospital down,

393
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,272
and me along with it,
hey, I can't stop you.

394
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,477
And I am done. Steri-strip
and dress the wound.

395
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:19,945
- Yes, well done.
- Good job, Warren.

396
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,365
- Really?
- Well, don't you think so?

397
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,872
No, I do. It's just...

398
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,988
This was my first time
as primary on a surgery.

399
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:33,091
It should have at least been fun.
But you two were so busy arguing

400
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,160
about how to teach
or not teach students,

401
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,024
that you forgot that
you had one in here.

402
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:42,589
I'm sorry, no
disrespect. It's just...

403
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,358
This was my first.

404
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,914
And I'm never gonna
get another one.

405
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,485
I need to go dictate the post-op
report. Thank you, everyone.

406
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,440
It's a really simple surgery.
I just make a tiny, little hole,

407
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,661
and in that hole, I insert my
camera and all my instruments.

408
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,546
- Okay.
- And you just end up

409
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,690
with an itty-bitty
scar right there.

410
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,402
Okay?

411
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,906
- Okay.
- All right.

412
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,301
I think it's time
to take you up.

413
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,503
I will come and talk to
you when we're done.

414
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,549
I said I think it's time to take him
up, which means take him to the OR,

415
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,484
um, and mark the incision spot.

416
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,571
I prefer an
infraumbilical incision.

417
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,205
You can give him
point five milligrams...

418
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,979
- Edwards. Rein it in.
- Yeah. Okay.

419
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,565
Her vitals look good.

420
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:48,450
How're you feeling,
Lynne? Any pain?

421
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,173
Lots. Thanks to you.

422
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,021
Okay, can we just
be nice for a minute?

423
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,806
Wilson, check the
repeat enzymes, please.

424
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,598
You know who was nice? Dr. Grey.

425
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,865
What? Dr. Grey is nice.

426
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,567
Yeah, no, I just... nothing.

427
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,857
I'm nicer...

428
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,888
than Dr. Grey. I mean,
ask anyone in this hospital.

429
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,591
There are comparisons that you can
make between myself and Dr. Grey,

430
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,932
but in a contest of
niceness, I take that win.

431
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,568
I win by a lot. I am the nicest.

432
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,982
Yeah, well, Dr. Grey
would've gotten my...

433
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,167
can...

434
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:26,522
Lynne? Lynne, what's
going on? Are you okay?

435
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,140
- Hard to breathe!
- She's tachycardic. Pressure's down.

436
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:32,327
- I need an EKG
and a portable x-ray.
- Is it another MI?

437
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,613
Dr. Pierce, there's
gastric fluid in her lungs.

438
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,615
The esophageal stump
must've perfed into her chest.

439
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:39,506
- My staples didn't hold.
- Lynne, there's been
a complication.

440
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,514
We have to take you
back to the OR right away.

441
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:48,231
You screwed up. I was dying
of cancer, and now I'm dying...

442
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,287
- You're trying to kill me.
- Let's move.

443
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,443
Okay, you can be in
here on one condition.

444
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,429
I can be in here however I want.

445
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,582
- This isn't about me,
it's about Edwards.
- She needs to feel confident.

446
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,501
And she won't if you're
standing over her shoulder.

447
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,702
You are welcome to observe,

448
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,571
but if you don't think you can
keep your hands to yourself,

449
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,711
- you have to leave.
- Fine.

450
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,240
In the peritoneum.

451
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,409
Optical trocar and
camera, please?

452
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,810
There's a lot of resistance. I'm...
I'm not sure how hard to push.

453
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,861
Right. You won't
know until you do it.

454
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,165
Keep going. You're good.

455
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,061
- It's all about the feel.
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,063
Together.

457
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,013
You're in.

458
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,721
That was the hard part.
The rest is a piece of cake.

459
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,056
- What now?
- Insufflation.

460
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,174
I knew you were moving too fast.

461
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,877
She was having a heart attack.
I stapled as quickly as I could.

462
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,078
I know.

463
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,370
So, what? Dr. Grey can
staple better than I can now?

464
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,091
- Lynne is prepped and ready.
- Thank you, Wilson.

465
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:42,157
- Dr. Pierce, you can go.
- What?

466
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,581
This is my revision. I
don't need you. You can go.

467
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,351
She's my patient.

468
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,065
No, actually, she's Dr. Grey's
patient. And I'm Dr. Grey now.

469
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,834
I'm in charge, whether
you like it or not

470
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:54,498
and until you get on board with
that, you are not welcome in my OR.

471
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,079
So you can stop
scrubbing. And you can go.

472
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,967
You're gonna need
an extra set of hands.

473
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,868
Wilson has hands.

474
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,800
- That was badass.
- Shut up.

475
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:31,022
Dissecting the gallbladder now.

476
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,691
- Just remember
to stay away from...
- From the CBD, got it.

477
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:35,299
Dr. Robbins, please.

478
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,136
Almost there. There's the duct.

479
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:46,338
He's tachycardic. His
pressure's trending down.

480
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:49,682
Edwards, can you see if there's
bleeding coming from the liver bed?

481
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,133
- Do you know how to do...
- Dr. Edwards knows what to do.

482
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,525
Checking the liver.

483
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,450
No bleeding. The
field looks clear.

484
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,634
Well, the blood's coming from
somewhere. So check the hepatic artery.

485
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,791
I don't see any... I
don't see any bleeding.

486
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,292
- Turn the camera.
- What?

487
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,550
Turn the camera. And check out
the rest of his abdomen. Just do it.

488
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:16,084
Oh, God!

489
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,669
All right. His pelvis
is filled with blood.

490
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,137
All right, pull the trocars!

491
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,488
He's been bleeding
out this whole time.

492
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,957
I don't understand. Why
would I have not seen that?

493
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,392
His pressure's bottomed out!

494
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,461
Hang two units! I
need platelets and FFP!

495
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,951
Move! Move! Back up!

496
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,804
Scalpel. All right, lap pads.

497
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,238
Bovie.

498
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,208
- Suction.
- Suction.

499
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,991
- Come on, Edwards.
- I don't understand.

500
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,464
More lap pads! Okay.

501
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,067
Edwards, suction.

502
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,578
All right. His
mesentery is bleeding.

503
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,020
Can you localize the bleeder?

504
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,211
Help me get some
proximal control of the SMA.

505
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,365
Suction!

506
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,779
There's an injury to the
superior mesenteric artery.

507
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,683
Must have nicked
it with the trocar.

508
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,080
All right. Lost his pressure!

509
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,681
Clamp! Clamp! Come on, come on!

510
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,145
He's bleeding out faster
than we can put it in!

511
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,314
Come on, you guys.
Come on. Clamp.

512
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,005
What did I do?

513
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,291
Did I... did I skip
a step? Did I...

514
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,715
Should I have done
something differently?

515
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,421
I mean, did I...
did I kill that boy?

516
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,849
Hey. Hey! Where are you going?

517
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,545
Neither of us is up
for cooking tonight.

518
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,492
So let's pick something up.

519
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,896
Or I could just make
reservations at our place.

520
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,203
No, I'm not hungry.

521
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,472
Come on. Can't we be civil?

522
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:49,593
I was always a fine surgeon.

523
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,374
But I am an excellent teacher.

524
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,810
And today, I was
a complete failure.

525
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,629
I know you thought this
program had problems,

526
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,280
but it sure as hell
has them now.

527
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,300
- Richard...
- Bailey was my favorite student.

528
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,809
I brought her in as an intern. I
saw her all the way through to chief.

529
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,029
She was my "start-to-finish."

530
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:11,882
And you turned her against me.

531
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,760
Come here, my little bug.

532
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:31,718
Oh, I thought you were... I
thought I was taking her home.

533
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,188
Hi.

534
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:37,391
I just wanted to
kiss her good night.

535
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:41,110
'Cause I'm gonna be here late
prepping for a department meeting.

536
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,047
- Got it.
- And then I've also got

537
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,450
my tumor debulking
to prep for, so...

538
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,219
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

539
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,800
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

540
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,120
You don't remember that you
and I started this for Webber?

541
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:57,194
I still support Webber.

542
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,157
So then you should
have told Bailey no.

543
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:01,626
And ignore my
responsibility to this hospital

544
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,094
because of a political
pissing match?

545
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,531
Yesterday, it was a noble
cause. What are you talking about?

546
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,883
Oh, but now, all of a sudden,
you've got your shiny new title, right?

547
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,854
- What? What does that mean?
- You realize how this looks,
don't you?

548
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,406
You realize what everybody's
saying? That you're an opportunist,

549
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,074
that you're an
overly ambitious...

550
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,831
And you told them that
they're wrong. Right?

551
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:22,435
Because you know me,
and you know better. Right?

552
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,123
I'm surprised by
you, that's what I am.

553
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,439
Look, Bailey gave you a
choice, that's what that was.

554
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,383
It was a choice.
You chose wrong.

555
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,044
It's not too late.
You can still resign.

556
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,612
You can still tell her
that you made a mistake.

557
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,269
Yeah, but I didn't
make a mistake.

558
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:43,852
I have a duty to this hospital, and
my chief asked me to step up, so I...

559
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,976
Did she? Or was
that my mom again,

560
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,499
telling Bailey that
she should pick you?

561
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,348
Why would you say that?

562
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,761
'Cause it's probably true.
It's not even your fault.

563
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,987
- It's her. It's what she does.
- No. No, it's you.

564
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,434
Because you refuse to believe
that I got this because I earned it.

565
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,238
- Because I'm good.
- That's... That's not...

566
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,922
What the hell is wrong with you?

567
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,146
She asked you a question.
She needed an answer.

568
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:27,044
- I know. What kind
of teacher are you?

569
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,314
I mean, you don't just teach
them what to do with their hands,

570
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:31,816
you teach them
what to do with this,

571
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,857
how to live through this. I
mean, you take it on yourself.

572
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,243
- I know.
- You don't!

573
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:40,964
You are the attending.
This is your loss!

574
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,227
Okay? You take the hit,

575
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,813
because if you put it
on her, she might quit.

576
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,515
She might think that
she can't survive it.

577
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,450
So you show her that she can.

578
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,235
You tell her, "When
this happened to me..."

579
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:52,525
It hasn't.

580
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:56,712
- What?
- It's never happened to me.

581
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,350
I never had a child die.

582
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,786
Never?

583
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:08,386
Not a kid. Not in residency,

584
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,429
not as a fellow, and
now I work on athletes.

585
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,030
And old people.

586
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,934
Old, broken hips. Torn
ligaments. Never a little boy.

587
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,688
I took that boy
from his parents.

588
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,992
And now I have to tell them.

589
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,961
And I don't know how.

590
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,367
How do you do it?

591
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:38,071
How do you stop
feeling like this?

592
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,239
You don't.

593
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,576
You... you just learn how to...

594
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,063
You learn how to feel
this way a little faster.

595
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,585
You let it hurt, and then you...

596
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,655
You put it behind you so that
you can face forward to the...

597
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,490
the next kid who needs you.

598
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,710
I remember my first...

599
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,531
like it was yesterday. So...

600
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,801
take your time.

601
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,591
And then we'll go.

602
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:37,030
Dr. Not-Grey. You're still here.

603
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,983
I am still here. And so are you.

604
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:43,314
- Dr. Wilson?
- The repair went very well.

605
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:46,634
- You fixed the thing you broke?
- I fixed the thing I broke.

606
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,627
And that nasty esophageal tumor is
in the medical waste, where it belongs.

607
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,693
You got the damn cancer?

608
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,017
We got the damn cancer.

609
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,652
You got it?

610
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,307
Well, Dr. Wilson and I did.
Full excision, good margins.

611
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,055
We still need to run some tests,

612
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,762
but it appears as though
you are cancer free.

613
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,400
What's your name again?

614
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,855
<i>Hemostasis was established</i>

615
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,746
<i>and the patient was sent to
post-op without complications.</i>

616
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,719
Dr. Webber? May I... may
I run something by you?

617
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:36,133
By me? I thought you were
working with Dr. Minnick.

618
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,308
Routine lap-chole,
nine-year-old patient,

619
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,722
the patient became
tachycardic and hypotensive.

620
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,491
Uh, I couldn't...

621
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,126
I couldn't locate
the bleeder initially,

622
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,184
then we discovered that his
pelvis was filled with blood.

623
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,299
Dr. Robbins
converted to an ex lap

624
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,185
and she found an injury to
the superior mesenteric artery.

625
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:56,643
Dr. Robbins tried a
repair, but the bleeding...

626
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,331
Edwards, what happened?

627
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:06,119
He died.

628
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,138
Okay.

629
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,438
- He was my patient and he died.
- Okay.

630
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,173
He was a little boy.

631
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,742
You know what? Here,
I want you to sit down.

632
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:18,965
No, I can't sit down.

633
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:24,248
A tear in a vessel with a
trocar insertion, it happens.

634
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:26,116
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not common,
but it happens.

635
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,868
And it's usually an easy fix.

636
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,393
But you can't fix
what you can't see.

637
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,529
I mean, you had no reason to
suspect bleeding, until you did.

638
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,710
By then, you were
racing the clock,

639
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,015
and the clock will
more often win.

640
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,437
Against all of us.

641
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,820
- I know you feel responsible...
- I mean, I am responsible.

642
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,324
You couldn't have known
you tore that vessel.

643
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:52,665
Dr. Robbins didn't catch
it. Dr. Minnick didn't catch it.

644
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:55,179
Anybody's hands could
have been on that trocar,

645
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:56,502
they wouldn't have caught it.

646
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:05,078
You lost. It's not
your fault, you lost.

647
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,649
Every good surgeon does.

648
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:14,754
It might be your worst,
but it won't be your last.

649
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,346
What was his name?

650
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,049
Matty.

651
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,452
Matty.

652
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,379
Matty.

653
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,896
What... what do I do next?

654
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,829
Okay, so if you think you're
gonna lose it, then I'll jump in.

655
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,933
I think I'll be fine. I just...

656
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,158
I guess I'm off the hook.

657
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,461
No. No!

658
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,541
I have a tip for you.

659
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:33,310
The work that's on the
page and not on the patient?

660
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,767
Take it home.

661
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,747
At least be comfortable.

662
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,491
Be in your pajamas.

663
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,042
- I'd just as soon stay here.
- Why is that?

664
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,073
Because my roommate
is a narrow-minded,

665
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,449
short-sighted, judgmental
and insulting piece of...

666
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,281
work.

667
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,606
Woo, and I am sorry, I should
not have said that to you.

668
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,774
He's mad you took the job.

669
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,096
Did you...

670
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,082
- Did you put me up for this?
- No.

671
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,502
It was all Bailey. I
thought it was smart.

672
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:15,069
April, Jackson can never
understand what you did.

673
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,526
He's not like you and me.

674
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:21,631
- Like you and me?
- He was raised with money.

675
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:26,369
Connections. A name.
You and I had to work for it.

676
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,134
I don't know. I mean,
Jackson has worked...

677
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:33,037
Jackson's always worked
hard. He worked hard in school.

678
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,689
He works hard now.

679
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:37,397
He's earned his
success. It's just...

680
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,967
He's never had
to worry, like us.

681
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,005
He's always known, if he
leaps, there's always a safety net.

682
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,325
The tough choices for
you and me are tougher.

683
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:53,223
I just, I felt like what
was asked of me

684
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,061
was bigger than me,
bigger than Richard.

685
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,385
It is. You saw that.

686
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,017
Put that away. Come on.

687
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,124
Let's go get some
dinner and celebrate this.

688
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:08,428
I don't exactly have a party
waiting for me at home either.

689
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:14,400
- I'd better not.
- Honey. You are the boss.

690
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,498
- Okay.
- All right.

691
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,117
Are we going to talk about
what happened today?

692
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,709
Can we not? Look,
I need a break.

693
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,023
I'm in the middle of
everything at the hospital, and...

694
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,724
You are in the
middle of everything?

695
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:04,016
Yes, me, Miranda.
I'm a resident,

696
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,064
so I want to side with them
because Minnick is great for us,

697
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,099
but the attendings
are my friends.

698
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:12,243
Now they stop talking when I'm
around because I'm married to you.

699
00:40:12,794 --> 00:40:14,360
Yeah, I'm in it.

700
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,832
Well, if you're so in it,
whose side are you on?

701
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,004
I would like to know.

702
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,386
I just want to go to bed

703
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,789
and turn my brain
off until I fall asleep,

704
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,362
and stay out of it.

705
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,321
<i>Once things start going wrong,
it's hard to break the cycle.</i>

706
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,426
<i>Murphy's law is not physics.</i>

707
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,525
<i>It's just a thing a guy said</i>

708
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,583
<i>to try and make
sense of a crappy day.</i>

709
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:56,013
<i>Just because things go wrong,</i>

710
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,882
<i>it doesn't mean they're
out of our control.</i>

711
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,504
Pop the hood!

712
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,390
- You don't have to...
- Pop your hood.

713
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,260
Can you not? This is bad enough!

714
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,825
I pulled out your horn wire, so
you are gonna need to get that fixed.

715
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,111
Thank you.

716
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:41,648
You're welcome.

717
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,519
I mean... thank you.

718
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,610
<i>It's on us to fix things.</i>

719
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,085
You know, you could have
friends here, if you wanted to.

720
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,509
<i>It's on us to take everything
that can go wrong...</i>

721
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,865
<i>and make it go right.</i>

722
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,770
<i>It's on us to try, anyway.</i>
