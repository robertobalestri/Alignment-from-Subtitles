1
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,659
<i>Curiosity killed the cat.</i>

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,794
I still don't get it.

3
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,763
<i>It also killed a lot
of ancient Greeks,</i>

4
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,065
<i>when Pandora had
to open that box,</i>

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,084
<i>full of death and
pestilence and stuff.</i>

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,902
Why did Diane want
to be buried here?

7
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,206
She's not from here.

8
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:28,788
It's weird.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,347
Maybe so she could be
close, so Maggie could do this.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,730
What's "this"? What
does she get out of it?

11
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,064
Don't ask me.

12
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,633
<i>Why do we have to know
what's behind door number three,</i>

13
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,969
<i>even when we're pretty
sure it'll be bad for us?</i>

14
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,305
I guess it's better
than the way I did grief.

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,130
- Which time?
- The time with the Oxy binges.

16
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,348
I go a little dark and twisty.

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,919
- But then I come back.
- "A little dark and twisty"?

18
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:55,737
You disappeared.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,167
You had a secret baby.

20
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,826
Please don't refer to your
niece as my secret baby.

21
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,060
I mean, maybe this
is what grief looks like

22
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:08,962
when you've lived
a whole, healthy life.

23
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,331
You know, before
anything terrible happens.

24
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,217
Like watching your father
get murdered when you're five?

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,758
Or like watching your mother
bleed out on the kitchen floor.

26
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,495
We're more alike
than we realize.

27
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,409
Come on. We
don't want to be late.

28
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,650
Are you ready for
your first day back?

29
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:26,969
So ready.

30
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:28,955
Weird.

31
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,299
- Morning.
- Morning.

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,470
- Morning.
- Morning.

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,274
- Hey, you guys carpool. Nice.
- Yeah, it's nice for the trees.

34
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,704
Brody, hold up. Not that one.

35
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,857
Let's go to exam four.
Bigger, more comfortable.

36
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,258
No. You don't have to do that.

37
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,226
Well, if I can't pull strings
for my friends, then...

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,528
Hon, take the upgrade.

39
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,631
- How do you all know each other?
- Owen rebuilt my hand.

40
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,134
He gave me a new
leg and saved my hip.

41
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,752
Not my spleen, though.
He threw that out.

42
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,221
Yeah. We spent time
together at the VA hospital.

43
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:09,940
Uh, and each other's weddings.

44
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,642
How is Amelia? We keep
missing her whenever we're here.

45
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,146
Um...

46
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,246
She's... she's good.

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,781
Yeah? You guys knocked up yet?

48
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,600
Leo, you cannot just ask
people if they're knocked up.

49
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,452
What? I mean, he used
to ask us all the time.

50
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,388
Because we would tell him
we were trying all the time

51
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,623
until we finally did it.

52
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,674
How's the baby doing?

53
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,459
Dr. Robbins placed
a shunt last week,

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,743
to help with the baby's heart.

55
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,712
Yeah, so she's gonna
make sure it's all working.

56
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,016
Fingers crossed.

57
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:38,162
<i>Chief Ortho resident to the E.R.
Chief Ortho resident to the E.R.</i>

58
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,155
- She's at 29 weeks now?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,557
I placed a pericardio-amniotic
shunt last week.

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,093
All right. So, as long as the
tumor doesn't grow too fast,

61
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,129
we can push surgery
till the baby's bigger.

62
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:50,981
I mean, ideally
until after she's born.

63
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,285
Yeah, fingers crossed.

64
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,591
It wasn't a carpool.

65
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,812
- Sorry?
- Me and Minnick in the car.

66
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,782
Oh, yeah I... I got that.

67
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,395
We're sort of just
keeping it to ourselves.

68
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,865
I got that, too. That's why I
said the dumb carpool thing.

69
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,049
- Yeah.
- Give you an out.

70
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,218
It's just people are so
full of opinions about Eliza.

71
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:13,586
You and her is
between you and her.

72
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,130
- Yeah. Whoa.
- People should
keep their opinions...

73
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,974
- Damn it!
- Ooh.

74
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,764
It's grown.

75
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,184
I mean, it's nearly twice
the size of the heart.

76
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,598
Yeah. The shunt's gonna be
no match for a teratoma that size.

77
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,050
Yeah, no. We have
to operate today.

78
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,652
- Yup.
- Hey.

79
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,987
- Hey, you're back! How are you?
- Hey.

80
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,129
I'm good. You know,
as good as... Thanks.

81
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,293
- What are we looking at?
- Riggs and I are excising

82
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,578
a fetal intrapericardial
teratoma for the first time,

83
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,202
- so... Sorry?
- Ooh, me?

84
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:44,178
This is exactly what I
need. It's perfect. I want it.

85
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,519
- Please.
- Pierce.

86
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:49,043
No, I know. I'm your
boss, but I can't just take it.

87
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,297
No, I'm taking it. I need it.

88
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,599
I'm sorry. You can watch.

89
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,432
Unless you have any objections.

90
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,782
It's your first day back,

91
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,584
- and I think that...
- It's a pretty big
operation, Pierce.

92
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,574
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,793
So, send me the chart.

94
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,993
Well, it was nice
almost working with you.

95
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,577
- Yeah, next time.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,932
<i>Satellite pharmacy,
extension 4977.</i>

97
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,084
- Hey, general consult?
- Abdominal pain, bed three.

98
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,268
Okay.

99
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,492
Good morning.

100
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,297
- Cross, you can't sleep here.
- I'm not sleeping.

101
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,182
I'm your patient.

102
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,502
For real?

103
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,964
For real?

104
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,884
As Dr. Minnick would say,
"This one's all yours, Edwards."

105
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:35,974
Enjoy.

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,563
Anyway, so, I wasn't
sure if Maggie was okay,

107
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,898
but I think she's
fine, and if she's fine,

108
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,783
then it's okay for
me to go to dinner.

109
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,484
If Maggie's fine,
you get to eat?

110
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:53,670
Dinner with Riggs.

111
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,538
- Oh.
- You know, I was holding off,

112
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,256
because I didn't
know if she'd be okay.

113
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,742
But I think she's fine.

114
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,794
So, I think it's fine
if I go to dinner.

115
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:02,968
With Riggs.

116
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,214
When did you become a grumpy
old man who doesn't like people?

117
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,955
I like people. I
don't like Riggs.

118
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,269
If you want to go to dinner
with the guy, go to dinner.

119
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,355
If you don't, don't. But
otherwise, pick up the pace.

120
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,958
- Why are we
stapling these again?
- Minnick's got me teaching

121
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,876
NICU procedures to
interns, so the sooner I start,

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,110
the sooner I can
get out of here.

123
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,612
Wait! Did I say
you could come in?

124
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,002
Go outside! Wait.

125
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,636
You are this close to telling
the kids to get off your lawn.

126
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,027
Stop acting like it's
something new... Go.

127
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,560
Once we access the
fetus, we'll excise the tumor,

128
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,296
giving your baby
instant cardiac relief.

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,115
We'll take your baby out of
the uterus, but only partially.

130
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,684
We'll remove the tumor, then
tuck her back in safe and sound.

131
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,620
We know. Dr. Robbins explained all
this when she diagnosed the tumor.

132
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,006
But we were hoping the
surgery could wait until

133
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,591
Jenna was further along.

134
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,335
I mean, is she
even strong enough?

135
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,116
Of course, I am.

136
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,195
- I meant the baby.
- I'm afraid
we don't have a choice.

137
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,967
Without surgery, the
baby will only get sicker.

138
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,119
Jenna, they wouldn't do the
surgery unless they had to.

139
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,343
She has to fight
before she's even born?

140
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,827
- And I can't help her do it.
- We can.

141
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,325
Dr. Pierce and I can.

142
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,145
What? What? I thought Dr. Riggs
was operating on the baby.

143
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,796
- So did I.
- Actually, Dr. Pierce

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,140
took over your case.
She's the chief of cardio.

145
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:15,923
- Well, why the switch-up?
- Is this another upgrade?

146
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:20,011
It is. Yeah, you're being bumped
to first class. I would take it.

147
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:25,700
Excuse me.

148
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,790
Robbins.

149
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,501
I know what you're gonna say.

150
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,320
This is Pierce's first day back.

151
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:36,305
She can't just swoop in
here and steal this surgery.

152
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,609
We all steal surgeries.

153
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,859
Listen, Riggs has followed this
case. He's studied the procedure.

154
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:42,161
- They know him. They trust him.
- Okay, Owen, I'm not...

155
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,052
I'm sorry, but Riggs is
the better choice here.

156
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,088
Well, then why isn't he the
one who's doing our surgery?

157
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,977
- Listen, Leo...
- Owen, tell me.

158
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,394
So, Dr. Hunt told you what?

159
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:14,415
I was talking with Dr. Robbins,
and I raised a concern.

160
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,836
We are going to stick
with the original plan.

161
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,815
Have Dr. Riggs do the surgery.

162
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,134
I'm sure that you're
a great doctor,

163
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,674
but this is just
too big of a deal.

164
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,142
I agree.

165
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,239
It is a very big deal.

166
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,857
I know that Dr. Hunt
is your friend...

167
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,647
- Owen is like family.
- Even better.

168
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,412
So, as your family, Dr. Hunt
is looking out for you.

169
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,782
But you should know that
his concerns have nothing

170
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,855
to do with my
surgical skill, do they?

171
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:39,441
No, of course not.

172
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,898
He's worried about me
because my mom died recently,

173
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,845
and he is worried that
I won't be able to work

174
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,831
through my personal
pain to get the job done.

175
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,073
But I can, or I
wouldn't be here.

176
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,376
Owen is... is that what it is?

177
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,972
I'm just...

178
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,518
concerned.

179
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,714
Well, so am I.

180
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,479
This is scary as hell,

181
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,014
which is why I
don't need a doctor

182
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,805
that has a happy
and perfect home life.

183
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,492
- I just need her to be the best.
- That's me.

184
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,359
That's why I'm the
chief of my department.

185
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,991
And, frankly, my
part of the surgery

186
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,365
is a walk in the park.

187
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:23,117
Your baby's mass
is easily extractable.

188
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,182
The truly risky part of the
surgery is when Dr. Robbins

189
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,250
has to open you up
to get to your baby.

190
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,486
- Wait, what?
- I know. Leo,
Dr. Robbins is good.

191
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,993
She is, and I am not
worried about her skill,

192
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,566
and she is not
worried about mine.

193
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,217
So I just want you to have
the facts before you choose.

194
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,673
You, please.

195
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,875
And Minnick and I are meeting
with the attendees next week

196
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,293
to review their
procedural checklists.

197
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,850
Oh, yes, let me see this.

198
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,155
Hey, I'm excited to
see where this goes.

199
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,287
And I'm excited to see

200
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,690
you and Minnick
working together,

201
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,425
that the trouble's behind us.

202
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,565
Um... Sure.

203
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,534
For the most part.

204
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,764
"The most part"?
What's the other part?

205
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,888
Uh...

206
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,990
You have yet to say it.

207
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:21,693
What have I yet to say?

208
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,245
- That you were wrong.
- That I was what?

209
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,163
Enjoy your day.

210
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm recently divorced.

211
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,659
Okay.

212
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,230
- Congratulations?
- So, it's new. Me and Minnick.

213
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,261
Right. Well, like I said,
it's none of my business.

214
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,525
I'm just...

215
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,415
I wasn't ready for it.
That's all I'm saying.

216
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,833
I mean, I wasn't trying
to make it happen.

217
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,820
I mean, I thought that it would
happen sometime, but not now.

218
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,426
No. I know the feeling.

219
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:57,995
I, uh...

220
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,349
I lost my fiancée. Years ago.

221
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,385
And I wasn't looking
for anything, either.

222
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,133
And you're right. You know,
it's a surprise when it happens.

223
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:08,973
Doesn't matter
how long it's been.

224
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,555
- So you're seeing someone, too?
- Yeah. Well, maybe.

225
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,413
I mean, we're trying.
I am, anyway. She...

226
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,662
We'll see if it goes anywhere.

227
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,720
Well, I hope so. Keep me posted.

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,652
- Wait, I'm keeping you posted?
- Yeah. This is happening.

229
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,337
We're now friends.
So, you know what?

230
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,829
You don't even need to
keep me posted. I'll ask you.

231
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,744
Why do I get a PEDS gown?

232
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,696
It's what they
brought. Symptoms?

233
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,315
Fatigue, night sweats.

234
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,033
Do you think it
could be Crohn's?

235
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,773
So far, it sounds
like menopause.

236
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,240
- Nice ducks.
- Why are you here?

237
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,793
I paged him because
one cure for internitis

238
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,844
- is peer humiliation.
- Internitis?

239
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,047
Yeah, it's a special
variety of hypochondria.

240
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,505
Cross here has abdominal
pain, and it is nothing,

241
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,937
- but he thinks it's everything.
- It could be something.

242
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,081
Cross,

243
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,755
you're an intern.

244
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,526
You're trained to find
the rare, special case.

245
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,812
It is the goal, it's the mother
lode, but this is not that.

246
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,102
You're just not that special.

247
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,539
What? What if I am?

248
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,491
Let's find out, shall we?

249
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,941
Okay. All right.

250
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,993
Dr. DeLuca, would you
like to do the rectal exam?

251
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,562
- No. Nope.
- No. No, no.

252
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,506
Okay, well then,
you can observe.

253
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:30,938
Cross...

254
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,857
roll over, baby.

255
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,889
I mean, so Maggie's doing
fetal surgery. So what?

256
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,090
I got next.

257
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,209
I mean, she's jumping
back in. What's the big deal?

258
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,294
Well, maybe Maggie should
wade back in with a, you know,

259
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,046
- a valve replacement, or...
- Is Maggie back?

260
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,181
Yeah.

261
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,925
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

262
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,916
- You sure about that?
- She's fine.

263
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,187
What do you think you're
doing? You can't cut.

264
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,011
- For half a turkey sandwich?
- You may cut.

265
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,491
- Oh, no.
- Seriously, though, you guys

266
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,993
should not try to tell Pierce
when and where she can operate.

267
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,345
I've made that
mistake with April.

268
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:01,297
I know, and I hate it,
but these are my friends,

269
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,498
- and it's their first baby.
- Is this Jenna and Leo?

270
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,218
Yeah. The tumor is growing
too fast. The baby needs surgery.

271
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,469
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

272
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,005
Oh, they asked for
you. You should...

273
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,229
You should go see them.

274
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,458
Anyway, Maggie
can do it. I mean,

275
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,010
she's buried her
grief in one place.

276
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,080
She goes and visits
it, brings it flowers,

277
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,630
and then she goes
about her business.

278
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,421
- It's weird.
- No, it's healthy.

279
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,434
I mean, Owen, do
you hear yourself?

280
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,853
Yeah, I know, but...

281
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,421
it's risky for Maggie, too.

282
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,005
I mean, what if
something goes wrong

283
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,557
with this high-risk
fetal surgery?

284
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,049
She just lost her mother.
She doesn't need this, too.

285
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,279
- It wouldn't hurt to check in.
- We work through stuff.

286
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,437
I have operated
through a miscarriage.

287
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,122
That's not normal.

288
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,695
Okay. So, we check in.

289
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,851
Hey, we heard.

290
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,130
Open fetal surgery.

291
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:53,221
Exciting, huh?

292
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:55,968
Yeah, that'll be the tiniest
heart you've ever operated on.

293
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,526
It'll be the tiniest heart I
have ever operated on.

294
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,543
You guys talked to Hunt, huh?

295
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,447
Yeah, we're just checking
in. I mean, it's a big operation.

296
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,615
A risky one.

297
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,551
I mean, it's an
ambitious first day back.

298
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,751
We want to make
sure you're okay.

299
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,857
Would you stop?

300
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,960
How is this supposed
to help me be okay?

301
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,041
How is this supposed
to help me go in there,

302
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,298
and do the impossible?

303
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,512
Now's the part where you guys are
supposed to tell me how awesome I am,

304
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,863
like I do for you all the time.

305
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,599
- I'm sorry.
- You are awesome.

306
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,422
I was having a great day.

307
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,570
I found a special surgery
that I was excited about,

308
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,256
that I knew I could excel at,

309
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,406
and I wasn't worried
for one second

310
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,392
about whether I'd
be able to perfect it.

311
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,032
Not for one second,
until you guys got here,

312
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,654
and now I'm a little worried,
so thank you for your support.

313
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,007
I don't understand why
you just can't say the words.

314
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,411
- I was not wrong. You were.
- Well, how was I wrong?

315
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,419
You refused to acknowledge
that I am the chief.

316
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,339
Bailey, I made you chief! I...

317
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,836
Look, I can't acknowledge
it any more than that.

318
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,172
You could treat me like
I'm the chief, but you don't.

319
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:10,826
You treat me like I'm your kid
that you got a summer job for.

320
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,029
And then you watch
me and you wait for me

321
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,080
to screw up and shake your head

322
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,665
and assume that
I'm still learning.

323
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,133
Well, you are!

324
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,652
You think you have
all the answers?

325
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:20,786
Well, it took me years.

326
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,637
And it'll take me years,

327
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,107
but I have to cut the
cord in order to do it.

328
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,660
And I can't keep
running every decision

329
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,666
past gnarled Old Man Wisdom!

330
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,037
Oh, that's how you think
of me, huh? Gnarled?

331
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,176
Cross would like
me to remind you

332
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,644
that he's allergic
to iodine dye.

333
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,048
I would like to remind you
that I am allergic to Cross.

334
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,405
I'd like an MRI next.

335
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,585
<i>Do you have any idea
how expensive that scan is?</i>

336
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:54,786
I have Obamacare,

337
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,570
I have a year
left, and I need...

338
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,658
- Look, an MRI wouldn't hurt.
- It would hurt me,

339
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,194
because there's zero
indication he needs one.

340
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:05,030
Smoking-related mesenteric
ischemia. It could be that.

341
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,306
<i>Do you smoke?</i>

342
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,719
My grandmother did.
Secondhand exposure.

343
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,445
No.

344
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,060
- No, no, no. No!
- What? Is it that bad?

345
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,518
- Yes, diverticulitis.
- Diverticulitis...

346
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,370
- is not even that bad.
- I know.

347
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:26,168
Except it is, 'cause now
I have to live in a world

348
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,472
where Cross was right.

349
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:32,814
Ten blade.

350
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,997
You watching to see
if Pierce melts down?

351
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,568
No. I'm just interested.
It's a very rare surgery.

352
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,320
A tumor inside a fetus?

353
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,568
Inside a womb inside a woman.
Yeah, it's like a nesting doll.

354
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,742
It's like nesting
dolls. It's fascinating.

355
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,597
Why are you here?

356
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,662
Uh, yeah. Same.

357
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,098
God. Why so many people?

358
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,156
- Well, it's pretty rare.
- It's fascinating.

359
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,042
Right.

360
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,611
She's gonna do fine.

361
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,739
Brody, next step?

362
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,763
You'll open the uterus
and exteriorize the baby.

363
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,914
Good. Then?

364
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,033
Dr. Pierce will perform
a fetal sternotomy,

365
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,417
then excise the tumor.

366
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,608
This is kind of the
point of no return.

367
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,911
Are you seriously
asking me if I'm okay?

368
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,087
We are about to take this
child from her safe, warm home.

369
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,383
She's leaving the
mother ship into cold,

370
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,335
dark space, and I want to
know that we can bring her back.

371
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,460
I want to know that
everything is okay.

372
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:54,662
Okay?

373
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:57,816
Okay.

374
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,723
Isaac, you have
perfed diverticulitis.

375
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:13,492
Diverticulitis? That's it?

376
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:16,195
Dr. DeLuca is prepping
an O.R. for Dr. Edwards,

377
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,396
who will be your lead surgeon,

378
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,830
and I will be there
the whole time.

379
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,649
It's just run of the
mill diverticulitis?

380
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,401
- Not even Meckel's?
- Okay, I wish
it were something cooler, too,

381
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:24,992
for my sake, but it's not.

382
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,623
I just had such a bad feeling.

383
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,375
That feeling is
called being an intern.

384
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,682
Okay, okay.

385
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,655
Dr. Shepherd, I discharged
your glioma resection.

386
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,723
And 2243's ICPs are coming down.

387
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,146
Okay. Keep me posted.

388
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,884
They are friends
of yours, right?

389
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,986
Yeah. Owen met them at the VA.

390
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,619
Jenna and Leo were in
the same unit in Afghanistan.

391
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,700
She literally dragged him
out of a collapsed building.

392
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,139
Yeah, and then they got married.

393
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,307
Then they got pregnant,

394
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,531
and then the kid has
a tumor in her heart.

395
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,000
I thought you had a TMR.

396
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,784
Yeah, I thought you had
a ventral hernia repair.

397
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,420
- I did. I pushed it.
- Me too.

398
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,907
- Robbins has you on standby?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

399
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,171
Well, I think it's a good idea.

400
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,216
Just in case.

401
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,222
Red rubber catheter, please.

402
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,052
Start the pump. Does
anyone know what it's for?

403
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,806
For irrigation to replace
the lost amniotic fluid.

404
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,230
- So cool!
- IV?

405
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,227
All right. Pulse aux

406
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,735
and IV in place.
Dr. Pierce, you are up.

407
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,145
Bovie.

408
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:07,913
Mayo's.

409
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,781
Retractor.

410
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,410
- That's the teratoma?
- Yeah, it's a big one.

411
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,168
- It's a monster.
- Let's slay a monster, then.

412
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,606
And...

413
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,662
there.

414
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,549
Monster slain.

415
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,286
Three-oh PDS.

416
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,166
Hmm.

417
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,706
- Now I'm just jealous.
- See, I told you. Healthy.

418
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,563
The baby's getting
bradycardic. All right, Pierce.

419
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:18,367
Pierce?

420
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,342
Dr. Pierce?

421
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,040
She's decompensating.

422
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,784
Dr. Pierce, what's
your move here?

423
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,046
Dr. Pierce, you
need to do something.

424
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,768
Dr. Pierce!

425
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,333
There's something
that needs to be done.

426
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,958
All right, push ten
cc's of saline now!

427
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,498
- Why isn't she moving?
- Come on. Is she freezing?

428
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,757
No, she can't. Riggs?

429
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:06,980
Come on, Maggie. Move.

430
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,380
Dr. Pierce, do
something! I'm not asking!

431
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,176
Baby's heart rate's dropping.

432
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,275
Well, go down there
and do something.

433
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,315
No.

434
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,266
Just wait.

435
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:32,150
All right, point-one
of atropine. Don't.

436
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,952
Don't push that IV.

437
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,736
All right, what's your
plan here, Pierce?

438
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,561
Do something!

439
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,782
- I'm not asking, Pierce!
- I hear you.

440
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,254
My plan is to give her a minute.

441
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,236
She just lost something huge,

442
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,820
something that has been
with her since day one.

443
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,057
Her heart just needs
to learn how to beat

444
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,361
without that extra load.

445
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,589
She just needs a
little time to adjust.

446
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:15,989
Heart rate's going back up.

447
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,816
Okay, little one, let's...

448
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,186
let's get you closed up.

449
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,588
Three-oh PDS again.

450
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,680
See? Pierce doesn't need backup.

451
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,082
He's actually not so
bad when he's quiet.

452
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,484
Suction. Lap pad.

453
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,641
Moving the bowel.

454
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:00,560
Wait. What are...

455
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,793
- What are all these...
- Huh.

456
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,412
- Has Cross traveled recently?
- No idea. Why?

457
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,796
Because it would appear that
he has abdominal tuberculosis.

458
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,052
So, we just opened
a big box of TB?

459
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,970
Wait. TB's transmitted
through the air.

460
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,405
Should we close? I
mean, are you sure

461
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,408
- we're not exposing ourselves?
- Well, I've already
been exposed.

462
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,609
I have the antibodies.
Also, I'm not a gutless wuss.

463
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,911
So, pick up some Metz.

464
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,312
I don't have the
antibodies. Do you?

465
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,498
- TB can kill you.
- Cross may have killed us?

466
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:29,668
You're not gonna die from someone
else's abdominal tuberculosis.

467
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:32,187
I mean, there's a remote possibility,
but it's not gonna kill you now.

468
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,672
Right now, you get
to fix someone's TB.

469
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,106
Isn't that worth it?

470
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,347
- I'm sweating. Are you sweating?
- No. Stop it.

471
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,044
Are they sealing off the exits?

472
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,469
Okay. Never mind.
Go away, both of you.

473
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:45,472
Someone page Dr. Warren.

474
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,854
Laparotomy closed.
Fetus and mom stable.

475
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,310
Nice work, Dr. Brody.

476
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,157
And welcome back, Dr. Pierce.

477
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,612
- Tonight. Sabrina's Restaurant.
- Sorry?

478
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:16,637
Let's go have a drink
and have a conversation.

479
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,767
- Like a date?
- No, it's not a date.

480
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,318
It's two people hanging out,

481
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,005
to see if we enjoy hanging
out, before I tell Maggie.

482
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,156
Oh, so when it goes
well, then you'll tell Maggie.

483
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,759
It could go either way. We
could end up hating each other,

484
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,344
and then there would
be nothing to tell.

485
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,129
- You don't hate me.
- I could hate you. I have before.

486
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,820
Eight o'clock.

487
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,073
- It's a date.
- It's not a date.

488
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,827
<i>Kepner, start talking.</i>

489
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,452
AFB stain came back.
Cross definitely has TB.

490
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,639
How did he get TB?

491
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,435
Uh, where are your residents?

492
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,970
Kicked 'em out
for being annoying.

493
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,107
Plus, I figured, fewer people
in here, the better. Suture.

494
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,048
<i>- You good to finish and close?</i>
- Yup.

495
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:05,002
All right, so what do we do
now? Does Cross get quarantined?

496
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,050
No. That's pulmonary TB.

497
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,318
Well, he's been walking around
treating patients while he's had TB.

498
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,393
- Yeah, there's protocol
for all that.
- And what's the protocol?

499
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,440
Just...

500
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:17,926
It's protocol, all right?
Just simmer down.

501
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,967
Well, I'd like to
know what it is.

502
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,819
I don't... remember.

503
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,851
I'm trying to remember
what the protocol is,

504
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,755
and if you stop with the
questions, I might remember it.

505
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:31,373
You're sure there is a protocol?

506
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,917
- I mean...
- Stop.

507
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,465
Oh, there's a protocol.

508
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,497
Hey, don't mind me. I'm
sure you have all the answers.

509
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,006
I'll just be over
here, all gnarled up.

510
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,457
Do you know what
the TB protocol is?

511
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,847
Well, in fact, I do.

512
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,033
Would you like me
to tell you what it is?

513
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,811
Yes. The answer is y...
What is happening right now?

514
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,024
I feel like I need ten showers.

515
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,676
It's TB. It's not
gonna just wash off.

516
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,146
What is happening? Are
we being quarantined?

517
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,514
Are they gonna stick
us in a bubble room?

518
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,023
- No, that's not happening.
- Oh, I think it's happening.

519
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:24,826
- No. No! No quarantine!
- No, not you. The O.R.

520
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,370
No one new is coming
in until it gets fumigated.

521
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,481
Okay, well, what happens
with Patient Zero in there?

522
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,634
He gets heavy antibiotics in
an isolation recovery room,

523
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,692
and you two get
to go get PPD tests.

524
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,392
I'm gonna kill Cross.

525
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,799
Hey, hey. Not so
close, not so... Easy.

526
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,892
Hey.

527
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,741
Congratulations. That
was something to watch.

528
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:57,342
And defied all
your expectations.

529
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,977
Come on. Nobody
thought you couldn't do it.

530
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,401
You just said I
couldn't... all day.

531
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,566
Maggie, I think people
were just surprised,

532
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,589
you know, that you
were doing so well.

533
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:09,243
I'm not doing well.

534
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:13,997
I'm doing my job.

535
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:18,118
I feel awful.

536
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:23,284
But... I'm doing my job
while everyone is staring

537
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,036
and telling me that
I am not up for it.

538
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,780
I am doing my job, 'cause
that is what we all do, right?

539
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,778
Right?

540
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,655
Right.

541
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,934
When someone
comes to us for help,

542
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,425
we find a way, we figure it out.

543
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,341
How to help them.

544
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,825
We don't give up.
We don't tell them

545
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,910
that there's nothing left to do.

546
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,785
- Maggie, look...
- So why couldn't you
do your job?

547
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,673
My mother came to you for help,
and you said that you would help her.

548
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,842
That is the job.

549
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,628
So why the hell
couldn't you do it?

550
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,726
<i>Cross?</i>

551
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:18,512
Cross. Hey.

552
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,231
- Hey! Hey, Cross.
- Hey.

553
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,578
Am I dead?

554
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,946
If you were dead, I
wouldn't be visiting.

555
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,815
Hey, have you left
the country recently?

556
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,205
Uh...

557
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,085
Just a Baja cruise with my mom.

558
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,229
Hmm.

559
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:36,129
Oh, and India... for
a month volunteering.

560
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,232
Nobody noticed I was gone?

561
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,486
- You got TB, pal.
- TB?

562
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,888
Wow!

563
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,293
- Wait. You fixed me, right?
- Well, Dr. Kepner did.

564
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:53,642
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
for giving you a hard time earlier,

565
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,433
and for sticking
you in a duck gown.

566
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:59,269
You're really sexy...

567
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,005
and pretty...

568
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,236
and smart. Wait.

569
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,740
Don't tell Dr. Wilson I said that.
She and I have a little thing on.

570
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:09,844
Goodbye, Cross.

571
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:13,066
- Enjoy your isolation room,
buddy.
- Thanks, buddy.

572
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,036
I just don't understand that...

573
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,349
stubborn, stubborn man.

574
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,919
Everyone's getting along,
and he just wants to bicker.

575
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,960
It's like he enjoys
pressing my buttons.

576
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,141
It's like he likes to fight.

577
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,247
Huh.

578
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,534
- What? Do you think he's right?
- Uh, no.

579
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,053
Good.

580
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,489
But have you considered
that he might just be lonely?

581
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
No.

582
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,379
I had not.

583
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,148
You do me.

584
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,550
So, we got to wait
another eight weeks

585
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:55,225
and then inject ourselves again
just to see if Cross gave us TB?

586
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:58,306
I mean, are you
sure we don't just

587
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,541
hit ourselves with a dose of
rifampin and get ahead of it?

588
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,911
Uh, it doesn't work
that way, I'm afraid.

589
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,018
And you know this.
You're a doctor...

590
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:06,965
ish.

591
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,287
Thank you.

592
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,749
That's a good catch
today, Edwards.

593
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,945
You know, undiagnosed,

594
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,960
Cross's TB would have
only gotten worse with time.

595
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,984
Yeah, I didn't
catch it. Cross did.

596
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,049
- Well, how is that?
- I thought it was internitis.

597
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,318
I made up my mind about it
before I even took his temperature.

598
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:30,142
- Well, it was still
a good outcome.
- Yeah, despite me.

599
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:33,108
I was an obstruction
to his care today.

600
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,999
Cross advocated for
himself, and I just dismissed it.

601
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,415
Just like those doctors used to
do to me when I was a little kid.

602
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,655
How did I get like this?

603
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,644
Edwards...

604
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,874
there isn't a doctor
in this hospital

605
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,677
who hasn't found themselves
making the same mistake.

606
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,100
You were wrong today...

607
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:58,166
but you're able to admit
it, and you'll learn from it.

608
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,973
And, you know, it's
an admirable quality.

609
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:03,443
Not everyone can do that.

610
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,526
You never went to
see Jenna and Leo?

611
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,914
No.

612
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,383
They'd like to see you.
You don't have five minutes?

613
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,869
They're your friends, Owen...

614
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,021
from...

615
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,515
before.

616
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:41,455
They're your friends.

617
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,110
Hey.

618
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:55,962
- Hey, you saved a family today.
- I did.

619
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,731
Well, things are
looking up for me, too.

620
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,169
- I got a date tonight.
- Is it someone in the hospital?

621
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,199
- I didn't say that.
- Your face did. Who is it?

622
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,589
I'm not gonna say.

623
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,386
If she wants to, she can,

624
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,393
but it seems like she
doesn't, so I won't.

625
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:13,108
- Noble. Is it Kepner?
- No.

626
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:16,378
Is it Edwards? Reaves?
Wilson? Is it Hunt? Is it Hunt?

627
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,484
Is it Hunt? Yeah? No. No.

628
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,315
- Um, Bailey?
- Nope, she's married.

629
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,485
Yeah, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

630
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,369
All right, moving on. Shepherd?

631
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:28,623
Grey? V... Your
face twitched at Grey.

632
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,059
- I did not twitch.
- Is it Grey? Is it Meredith Grey?

633
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,361
- I never said that.
- Oh, my God!

634
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,030
I mean, I understand why
you're into her. She's hot. Wait.

635
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,198
She likes you?

636
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,834
What? Okay, I'm gonna
try not to be offended at that.

637
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,098
No, no, no. No.
It's just that Derek...

638
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,739
Derek was epic for her.
They were the great love story.

639
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:48,681
I mean, that girl's heart beat
for Derek Shepherd. It's just...

640
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,780
It never occurred to me that she
would ever be with anyone else.

641
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,121
He was perfect. He
was everything. I mean...

642
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,255
that man turned her world. It...

643
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,739
I spooked you.

644
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,788
Don't be spooked.

645
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,400
No. Don't be spooked. Do
not be spooked, okay? This...

646
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:10,162
This is good. This is good,
because you know what?

647
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:11,822
Love is good, right?

648
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:15,727
Right.

649
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,680
Wow. Don't you look nice?

650
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,654
The babysitter is
upstairs. I'm going out.

651
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,285
Out? "Out" sounds
like a date. Out where?

652
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,042
- I am going out.
- And that
is a date-worthy outfit.

653
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:35,746
- Bye.
- Who's your date with, Mer?

654
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:55,932
I want my mom.

655
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,087
I don't know what
to... what to do now. I...

656
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,190
What do I do?

657
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,779
It's okay.

658
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,522
Hey.

659
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,087
- I can't go.
- Okay. Why not?

660
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,974
Because Maggie came home from
work early, and she's very upset.

661
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,278
I thought she was doing fine.

662
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,894
- No, she's not fine. She's a mess.
- Okay. Can we reschedule?

663
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,880
I have... You can't
be here. Goodbye.

664
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,202
Come on.

665
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,300
"Come on"?

666
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,551
Okay, you weren't
supposed to hear that.

667
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,526
- Her mother just died.
- I know.

668
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:43,007
But, come on, you and I both
know how grief comes and goes.

669
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,793
Look, Pierce will be going
through this the rest of her life.

670
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,817
I know you think she needs
backup, but she can handle herself.

671
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,955
I have people to take care of,
and you are not one of them.

672
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,230
Get up.

673
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,936
- What is happening?
- Come on. Get up.

674
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:23,497
- What? Mer.
- Come on. We're dancing it out.

675
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,601
- Oh, God. Really?
- Yes, really. It's this or cry.

676
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,691
Come on. Get up.

677
00:36:56,081 --> 00:37:00,344
Oh, there she is. The
woman who knows everything.

678
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:02,184
I'm willing to
admit I was wrong.

679
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:03,857
Oh, really?

680
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,922
Under two conditions.

681
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:09,909
- Name 'em.
- One...

682
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:14,675
I'm willing to admit
this over dinner tonight

683
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,334
while we iron out all of our
differences and move past this.

684
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,881
- I could do that.
- And, two...

685
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,050
you also have to
admit you are wrong.

686
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,874
- Well, how am I wrong?
- Are you back home
with your wife?

687
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,892
Yeah, I didn't think so.

688
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,766
Look, you have your work wife
back. Now get your real wife back.

689
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,412
I am not wrong.

690
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,473
Well, then, you buying dinner.

691
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,817
Hey.

692
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,946
I don't want to...

693
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,654
talk or discuss or
dance or whatever.

694
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:01,110
Okay, um...

695
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,829
How about Diane's
medical records?

696
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,671
Your mom knew she was sick.

697
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,109
She knew even before I did.

698
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,545
By the time she came to
me, these were her charts.

699
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,432
All of this?

700
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,329
She was pretending that
she didn't know she was sick.

701
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,036
Maggie, she lied to both of us.

702
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,375
She didn't want it to be true. She
thought her doctors were wrong.

703
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,745
Yeah, I think you're right.

704
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,784
Oh, there's more.

705
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,090
How could there
possibly be more?

706
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,103
When did she do all of this?

707
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:03,389
After she found out
how sick she was.

708
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:11,597
- Is she...
- Skydiving.

709
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:16,202
- My mother is afraid of heights.
- Well...

710
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:20,590
- This is insane! She's insane.
- In the best way.

711
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:30,516
She gave these to you?

712
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,189
She didn't come to see
me because I was the best.

713
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:40,092
She came here because
she knew that she was dying.

714
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,563
And you and I...

715
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:46,148
we're kind of like family.

716
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,480
She figured I would do my best

717
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,203
to take care of you
and she was right.

718
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,239
She asked me to
hold on to those...

719
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,126
until you needed them.

720
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:01,213
I think you needed them.

721
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,385
<i>Put yourself in Pandora's shoes.</i>

722
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,790
<i>She's given a gift,
a wondrous box,</i>

723
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,710
<i>filled with things she
never even knew existed.</i>

724
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,417
<i>Of course she opened it.</i>

725
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:40,152
<i>Wouldn't you?</i>
