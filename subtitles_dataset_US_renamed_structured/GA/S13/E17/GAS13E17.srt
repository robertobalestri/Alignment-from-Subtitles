<i>Previously, on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,154
Oh, uh...

3
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,439
I'm... sorry.

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,372
Mom! What are you doing here?
What's going on? Are you okay?

5
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,257
Just a little consult.

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,676
- Breast cancer?
- I am so sorry.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,211
Would you like me to
grab Maggie for you?

8
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,400
Oh, no.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,598
- I had a baby.
- Had?

10
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,835
He lived for 43
minutes without a brain.

11
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,102
And it almost killed me.

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,403
- Tell you not to come home?
- I cannot keep doing this.

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,587
- Doing what? I'm not...
- I don't want to have a baby!

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,916
I think about you a lot,
and I'm telling you, I am in.

15
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,102
If you are. What do you think?

16
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:47,528
Keep it moving, folks. Come on.
Move out, please. Move on out.

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,577
So he says to me
that when I figure it out,

18
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,536
I should give him a call.
I mean, who says that?

19
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,289
She found her mom
in baggage claim.

20
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,452
Anyway, he's an arrogant ass.

21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,889
And Maggie has
terrible taste in men.

22
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,029
I don't like the guy.

23
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,927
I mean, the sex is great.

24
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,244
Maybe I shouldn't be
picky about great sex.

25
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,152
You should be picky
about sex. You're hot.

26
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,865
Well, you have to say that
because I let you eat my food

27
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,066
- and live in my house.
- Yes,

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,840
- but it's still true.
- Thank you!

29
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:18,337
There she is.

30
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:20,201
<i>Stuff comes apart.</i>

31
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,480

<i>A window will never unbreak.</i>

33
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,497
Thirty seconds in, she's
talking about her boobs.

34
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,637
That's what's on her
mind. Her boob job.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,418
Her boobs, which are
perfectly fine, by the way.

36
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,786
You know what? When
she gets in the car,

37
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,688
you look at them, and you
tell me they're not perfect.

38
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,707
I'm not gonna check
out your mom's boobs.

39
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,577
<i>It's called the Second
Law of Thermodynamics.</i>

40
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,251
<i>It's also called life.</i>

41
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:49,218
- Oh, it's good to see you,
Meredith.
- Hi! It's good to see you!

42
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,392
Alex, right?

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,032
What did you tell them?

44
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:58,817
What?

45
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,432
I'm not the one getting
the ginormous boobs!

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>Stuff rarely comes together...</i>

47
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,908
<i>but it'll always come apart.</i>

48
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,226
Wait. You're saying that you don't
have the budget for dozens of babies

49
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,311
- and their tiny,
beating baby hearts?
- Don't. Uh-uh.

50
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,863
No. Every time
you want something,

51
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,532
you say, "But the tiny
babies. The teeny, tiny babies."

52
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,218
But you are the doctor
who cried, "Tiny baby."

53
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,170
Doctor Webber, you tell her.

54
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,539
Robbins wants new
wireless fetal monitors,

55
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,463
- when the ones we have are...
- Not my concern.

56
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,750
Well, damn.

57
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,964
It's not you, it's me.
I pissed him off, too.

58
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,628
- Not like I did.
- Yeah, a little bit
like you did.

59
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,274
- What did you do?
- I have a patient.

60
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,679
<i>Dr. Spano to Oncology.
Dr. Spano to Oncology.</i>

61
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,359
- Hello.
- Incoming!

62
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,651
DeLuca! Incoming.

63
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,208
ETA less than a minute.

64
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,206
I didn't know you were back.

65
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,775
They said one of the
patient's had syncope.

66
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,593
You'll need a neuro consult.

67
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,932
I just meant how are you doing?

68
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,117
It's nice to be working.

69
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,402
But it's... But it's
gonna be a busy day.

70
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,906
I'm hoping this will
be quick and easy.

71
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:21,177
Elsie Clatch, 95,
fainted while hiking,

72
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,501
but now GCS is
15, vitals are stable.

73
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:29,302
- Gently, gently. She's been injured.
- Please, Lewis, all this fuss.

74
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,355
- Hiking?
- How do you think
I made it to 95?

75
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,613
- Alert and oriented times three.
- Sir, did you injure your wrist?

76
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,560
Uh, no, it's fine.

77
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,646
He fell, too. He wouldn't
let go of my hand.

78
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,830
No reason to take a
chance, sir. Let's go.

79
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,438
Her syncopal episode
lasted at least 60 seconds.

80
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,225
Oh. It sounds like you've been
watching a lot of medical shows, sir.

81
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,817
- He's not gonna like that.
- I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon.

82
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,684
One, two, three.

83
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,539
Don't be pompous.

84
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,792
You were a surgeon, so was I.

85
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,563
- They're surgeons now.
- She'll need a head CT.

86
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,360
Still, we'd like to
rule out other injuries.

87
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,130
It's nothing. I just got
a little lightheaded.

88
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,486
You don't know it's nothing.

89
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,889
I know as much as you do.

90
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,408
I fell down.

91
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,228
I'm old. I'm allowed.

92
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:27,565
We'll need an EKG and
labs with cardiac enzymes.

93
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,045
You heard the man.

94
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,930
- Hey.
- Hi.

95
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,298
Pierce asked if she
could discharge the triple-A

96
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,318
that you guys were working on,
if you didn't have any objections.

97
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:53,492
Nope, not at all.

98
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:55,858
Great.

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,680
So, did you have a...

100
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,564
chance to think about it?

101
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,615
Oh, no. I don't need to think
about it. You can discharge him.

102
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,339
No, no, no. I mean the
thing that I said about...

103
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:12,010
- how I think about you.
- No, I haven't thought
about it. I...

104
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,045
I have three kids.

105
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,498
And a job. I'm a surgeon.

106
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,099
Right.

107
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,888
Take your time.

108
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,462
How are you feeling?

109
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,776
I'm good. Just a little tired.

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah.

111
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:38,437
Chemo's not my
idea of a great time.

112
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,617
Sure. Well, I spoke
with your oncologist.

113
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,109
She gave me a full report,
and the chemo's been working.

114
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,340
Your repeat scans came back,
and they show a good response.

115
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:48,863
You are her star patient.

116
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,629
Ooh, and the prize
is a mastectomy.

117
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,815
Your reconstruction is gonna
go perfectly. It'll be my best work.

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,101
Today, we just focus on
getting your pre-op taken care of,

119
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,974
and we get our
oncologist up to speed.

120
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,446
Did you want, um, Maggie
here before we continue?

121
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:13,700
- Diane, you didn't tell her yet?
- It's too much stress.

122
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,818
Which is exactly why
she needs to know.

123
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,303
This is gonna be
stressful enough for you.

124
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:20,156
- We're already fighting today.
- No, as your doctor,

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,708
I can't, in good confidence,
continue to let this go on, all right?

126
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,928
It's bad for you both.
It's bad for everyone.

127
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,670
- Well, just not yet.
- When? Your surgery is tomorrow.

128
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,919
After.

129
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,575
I can just have the
surgery and tell her then,

130
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,530
and I can tell her
that I had cancer

131
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,849
and not that I have it.

132
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,685
That's not the best idea.

133
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,736
It's how I want to do it.

134
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,874
Is that understood?

135
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,162
<i>Dr. Fields to the NICU.
Dr. Fields to the NICU.</i>

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,509
So did Doctor Avery
answer all your questions?

137
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,699
He sure did.

138
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:18,069
So you discussed
everything? Even size?

139
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,223
We discussed everything
I needed to discuss.

140
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,749
So what did you
decide, size-wise?

141
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,791
I just want to be prepared, you know?
I've been hugging the same person

142
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,226
for the last 30 years,
you know? This is a big...

143
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,078
- Maggie.
- This is a big renovation.

144
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,102
Maggie...

145
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,687
I don't want to
discuss this with you.

146
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,108
- Just leave it alone.
- Fine.

147
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,562
Well... I hope you'll
enjoy being a nice,

148
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,966
self-involved, lonely person
with an incredible rack.

149
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,585
Pretty straightforward
modified rad.

150
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,954
I'll remove the breast tissue,
then do a lymph node dissection

151
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,924
and leave you to
the reconstruction.

152
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,028
Sounds great.

153
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,594
Need something?

154
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,563
Yeah, I'm on your service today.

155
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,216
No, you're not. I didn't
request a resident.

156
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Dr. Minnick assigned me to you.

157
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,539
All right, I'll talk to Dr. Minnick
after I finish up here,

158
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,443
but no, thanks. I
don't need anyone.

159
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,948
- Okay, sorry. You all set?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,361
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thanks very much.

161
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,050
This is Diane Pierce?

162
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,086
No, no, no. Do not look at
that. You're not on this case.

163
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,937
Is this Maggie's mother?

164
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,589
- Wilson, please.
- Jackson!

165
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,613
Hey.

166
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,809
What the hell?

167
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,695
Why am I locked out
of my mother's file?

168
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,647
- I'm a doctor.
- Yes, well,
she requested privacy.

169
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,888
I'm her daughter.

170
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,136
She can't handle the fact I might
have an opinion about her boob job.

171
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,888
She's anxious because
she's going into surgery.

172
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:51,290
Now you're telling me how
my mom feels, Jackson?

173
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,681
What is going on
here? Level with me.

174
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,968
You saw what happened
the last time she was here.

175
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,016
And I thought we
could actually fix it.

176
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,483
I wanted to talk
and actually try,

177
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,808
but she has been shutting
me out from moment one.

178
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,594
Why is she doing this?

179
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,974
You know, I really...
I really couldn't say.

180
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,410
Is she embarrassed
about the boob job?

181
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,354
- Then why is she getting it?
- She's scared...

182
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:16,432
about her surgery. I
mean, she needs support.

183
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,736
She needs your support

184
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,652
So I'm awful is
what you're saying.

185
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:21,687
It's... You know
that's not what I mean.

186
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:22,711
Okay.

187
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,332
I'll try. I will leave
it alone. I will try.

188
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:28,699
Thank you.

189
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,681
Just tell me, are they
gonna be "huge" huge?

190
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,185
Maggie, please. Just trust me.

191
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,386
Okay, thank you.

192
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,443
Wow!

193
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:41,824
No, no, no, don't. I don't need
to remind you of HIPAA, right?

194
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,281
Okay? Nothing to be discussed.

195
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,167
Right. Sorry.

196
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:49,554
Well, you know now.
So I guess I can use you.

197
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,318
- Only if you can...
- I... I can.

198
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,675
All right. Then go
ahead. Get prepped.

199
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,211
Close the door, please

200
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,901
We do this hike every other day.

201
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,743
I don't know why
today I got so wonky.

202
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,940
Squeeze my fingers,
Elsie? Hard as you can.

203
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,379
- Very good.
- I'm sorry.

204
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,398
Are you<i> the</i> Doctor Clatch?

205
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,087
Uh...

206
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,405
I'm one of two, yeah.

207
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,574
You... you are.

208
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,089
Uh-huh...

209
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,953
You worked with Doctor Raven.

210
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,526
Jeez, don't remind me.

211
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,396
You helped develop the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

212
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,766
The man was a
blowhard and a grabass!

213
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,267
- That is true.
- Right.

214
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,604
So, were you there when
he first connected a child

215
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,891
- to his mother's circulation?
- Okay, let's all focus, please.

216
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,114
Was I there?

217
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,566
- Yeah.
- I did most of it.

218
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,969
DeLuca, take her to CT, and
page me when she's done.

219
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,288
All right. Dr. Clatch,

220
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:05,190
I'll be happy to show you
where you can wait, okay?

221
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:07,993
No, you will not. I'm
gonna stay with my wife.

222
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:11,786
- Oh, stop. You don't know brains.
- I know enough!

223
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,850
Doctor Clatch? Okay.

224
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,925
- Follow me.
- Huh? Yeah.

225
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,343
Would you page me when
her studies are back, please?

226
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,764
- Hey.
- Just stop it.

227
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,779
- Stop what?
- Pretending like we're doctors.

228
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,723
- We are doctors.
- I'm your husband!

229
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,705
You can't hide in plain
sight from me and...

230
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,518
ignore the fact that we haven't
talked, and that we have things...

231
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,587
- I'm at work. We're...
- You're trying to act...

232
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,011
like nothing happened.
You ran out on me!

233
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,814
You ran away from home!

234
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,277
From your husband.
You're married.

235
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,728
- We got married!
- I know!

236
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,032
We took vows...

237
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,651
for better or for worse.

238
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,349
Amelia, you...

239
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,971
Running out, acting this way...
It's not how a marriage works.

240
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,190
So I need you to
tell me right now.

241
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,226
Are you ever coming home
so we can work this out...

242
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,266
or not?

243
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,463
Perfect.

244
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,459
You need to decide
what you want.

245
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,682
Because I know.

246
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,770
I know what I want.

247
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,864
And at some point, you
need to figure that out, too.

248
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,011
Just pull it together.

249
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:59,576
So, you weren't into the idea
of her being a surgeon at first?

250
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,958
- I was.
- He wasn't!

251
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,996
I was halfway through my
residency, and Lewis said to me,

252
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,502
"Elsie, this surgeon business
is not making you any friends.

253
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,846
You need to think of
something else to do."

254
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,195
I was trying to
take care of you!

255
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,533
- But you didn't, did you?
- I did not.

256
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,595
- Good.
- Because you knew
what you wanted.

257
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,619
Oh! This one gets it!

258
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,584
Well, it was a different
time back then.

259
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,241
It was. It was.

260
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,772
All right, let's give
the Clatches some air.

261
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,359
They are not here for your
entertainment, guys. Time to go.

262
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,444
Oh, let them stay. How
else they gonna learn?

263
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,097
They have a lot of work to do.

264
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,605
Well, this is a teaching
hospital, right? So teach them!

265
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,765
It's all right. Come on back.

266
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:55,166
I can see by your faces
that the news is bad.

267
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,818
So just tell me how bad.

268
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,640
You have a brain bleed.

269
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,195
A loculated acute on
chronic subdural hematoma.

270
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,466
Oh, God!

271
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,486
Elsie, the bleed is only
gonna keep increasing.

272
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,989
It could become
catastrophic at any time now.

273
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,209
Now, I could do a craniotomy...

274
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,944
and decompress the hematoma.

275
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,558
With a chance it would
give me some more time?

276
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,587
Yes, but Dr. Shepherd
doesn't think that's a good idea.

277
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,634
She didn't say that.

278
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,358
Didn't say, "I want
to" or "I need to."

279
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:40,027
She said, "I could."

280
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,327
That's what we tell our patients

281
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,311
when we don't want
to give them nothing.

282
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,731
I'm sorry, kids. Lesson's
over. Got it, folks? Okay?

283
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,409
- Hey! How's it going?
- Boobs.

284
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,805
Oh, you have to let that go.

285
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,149
My mother wants basketball
boobs. You let it go.

286
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,798
Mom boobs again?

287
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,578
It doesn't stop.

288
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,487
What reason does she have
to defile her body that way?

289
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,466
Are you sure you
want to know that?

290
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,369
My mother wouldn't let me
pierce my ears until I was ten.

291
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,693
She told me that
masturbating made Jesus cry.

292
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,558
She said that nail
polish was for prostitutes.

293
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,433
That woman wants stripper
boobs? Yes, I want a reason.

294
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,805
Her reasons are for sex.

295
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,860
- Why would you say that?
- Okay, well maybe she
just wants her, um...

296
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,373
shirts to fit better.

297
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,430
Okay, now, that's
almost understandable.

298
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,477
To get more sex.

299
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,220
I am asking you guys for advice.

300
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,173
Okay, okay. Sorry,
sorry, sorry. Okay.

301
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,292
Okay, tell me again.

302
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,844
Am I just...

303
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:09,211
supposed to accept that this
horrifying thing is happening?

304
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,686
Am I just supposed
to get on board, fold?

305
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:16,309
Make a decision to
support my G-cup mom?

306
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,578
No, you're right.

307
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,814
- You do need a reason.
- I do!

308
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:28,468
She can't expect you to
just blindly jump on board.

309
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,059
You should demand a reason.

310
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,001
- That is bad advice.
- It is?

311
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,582
She doesn't owe
you an explanation,

312
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,934
and you don't have a right to
tell her what to do with her boobs.

313
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,324
No, I'm... I'm...

314
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,455
- not...
- It's her body. It's her boobs.

315
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,941
She doesn't have to justify
her decision to anyone.

316
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,983
I mean, don't come at her
demanding anything. Just...

317
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:00,868
give her some support.

318
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,458
I wanna know what you
did to Richard Webber.

319
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:13,792
Nothing.

320
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:15,878
- Oh, it was bad. Really bad?
- Okay! Shh!

321
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,136
I kissed Eliza Minnick
and he caught me.

322
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,767
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm.

323
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,275
Mm-mm, what?

324
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,473
I get why he's mad at you. That
was way worse than what I did.

325
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:29,608
How is that worse?
You gave away his job.

326
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,077
And you put your mouth
on the person who took it.

327
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,085
See, mine was a business
decision. You made it personal.

328
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,733
That doesn't even make
sense. I mean, listen.

329
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,984
This has nothing to do with him.

330
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,342
Bros before potential
love interests.

331
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,056
I wouldn't talk to you, either.

332
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
That's...

333
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,854
unprofessional, disappointing.

334
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,151
You know what?
You just feel guilty.

335
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:53,081
You know that you did wrong, and you're
just trying to make yourself feel better.

336
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,825
- Whatever helps you
sleep at night. Mm-hmm.

337
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,010
Lewis, let her talk.

338
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,556
I've...

339
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,397
I've heard all I need, Els.

340
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,933
A successful surgery would
definitely buy you more time.

341
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,048
But as you know, the amount
of shift, combined with your age

342
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,585
and aspirin usage are
bad prognostic signs.

343
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,059
Surgery holds higher
risk for you, much higher.

344
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,490
So it's settled. No surgery.

345
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,926
- Nothing's settled.
- But she just said...

346
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,480
I know, but if we don't do
anything, I'm gonna go, anyway.

347
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,449
Well, that's better than me
walking out of here alone tonight.

348
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,256
Will you listen to me?

349
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,125
You're not getting this surgery.

350
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,173
- Will you excuse me, Lewis?
- El...

351
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,882
But I would like to
talk to my doctor alone.

352
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,771
Dr. Clatch, how about
we go get a cup of coffee?

353
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:45,941
Okay.

354
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,245
Now, you were saying?

355
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,449
Elsie will talk her into a
surgery. She's stubborn.

356
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,504
I need to talk to that gal's boss
right away. He needs to back her up.

357
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,651
She is the head of
the neuro department.

358
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,670
She is the boss, and she's
as stubborn as hell too.

359
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,938
Dr. Clatch,

360
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,912
I know Dr. Shepherd...

361
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,894
very well, and
you can trust her.

362
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,495
She's not gonna be
talked into anything

363
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,719
that she doesn't
want to do, okay?

364
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,338
Okay, come on.

365
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,535
<i>Dr. Cooper to
Occupational Therapy.</i>

366
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,742
<i>Dr. Cooper to
Occupational Therapy.</i>

367
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,421
Come on.

368
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,964
Dr. Clatch, I worry you
won't survive the surgery.

369
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,661
And based on your age alone...

370
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,018
it could kill you.

371
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,721
Or it could give me more time.

372
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,774
I need more time.

373
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,428
I need time to help him
learn how to be alone.

374
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,433
I also want more time with him.

375
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,985
You believe...

376
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,689
60 years is not enough?

377
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,758
<i>Nurse Friedman to
the Instrument Room.</i>

378
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,715
<i>Nurse Friedman to
the Instrument Room.</i>

379
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,369
I can take no for an answer.

380
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,743
- Don't.
- I prefer it, actually,
to no answer.

381
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,739
Why do you always
have to do that?

382
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,176
Why do you always have
to make a joke of everything?

383
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,967
- Are you serious, or aren't you?
- Of course I am.

384
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,498
Because I'm not joking.
This isn't funny to me.

385
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,049
You know, you keep pushing me,

386
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,393
but you're not giving
me anything to go on.

387
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:30,305
Man. We have been going around
and around with this for months.

388
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,409
I feel like I don't know you.

389
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,626
And everybody that I
know, that knows you,

390
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,647
they don't like you.

391
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,351
And you just keep making jokes like
somehow that doesn't matter to me.

392
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,975
That's not true.

393
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:47,633
This isn't up to me to make a choice.
It's up to you to give me a reason.

394
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,598
Okay, you want a reason?

395
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,520
Yes.

396
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:01,475
Okay, there are, there are
all sorts of reasons to like me.

397
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,772
Actually.

398
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:06,748
Name one.

399
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,519
I have to go.

400
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,904
- I thought
you weren't doing surgery.
- I never said that.

401
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,322
You said you thought
it was a bad idea,

402
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,940
and I practically assured
Lewis that you wouldn't.

403
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:24,292
Why would you do
that? She's my patient.

404
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,662
I thought you'd made
a decision, or at least

405
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,430
consult with him before
you changed your mind.

406
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,471
Okay, enough! Stop it, Owen!

407
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,172
No more.

408
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,907
All your pre-op tests
came back looking terrific,

409
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,658
so just two more things

410
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,578
before we get you home
for some much needed rest.

411
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,098
Okay, number one, no
eating after midnight, right?

412
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,533
- Okay.
- And number two, we...

413
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,940
are gonna tell Maggie.

414
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,728
Oh no. I told you,
uh, after the surgery,

415
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,109
- after the cancer is out.
- I'm not gonna
perform the surgery,

416
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,695
Diane, unless we tell Maggie.

417
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,331
- You can't do that!
- Of course I can. I'm your doctor.

418
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,666
- But it's not your business.
- And it would be

419
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,201
an irresponsible
course of treatment.

420
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,220
Okay? Maggie is your
only support system here.

421
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,656
- I'll just get
another doctor then.
- No, you won't.

422
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,575
She told you I was
the best 'cause I am.

423
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,119
You trusted her then,
and you trust her now.

424
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,831
I understand. It's
okay to be afraid.

425
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,804
You don't have to
be afraid for Maggie.

426
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,272
She's not scared of cancer.

427
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:29,696
She would just want
to fight this with you.

428
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,072
Let her be there for you.

429
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,335
I should've told her months ago.

430
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,803
- It's not too late.
- It's too late.

431
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,922
Mom?

432
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,875
You ready to go home?

433
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,712
- Maggie, sweetheart, I...
- Mom, it's fine.

434
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,665
Good luck tomorrow.

435
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,072
I hope that your implants are
everything that you want them to be.

436
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,219
- I'm not getting implants.
- Mom, it's fine.

437
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,660
I have breast cancer.

438
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:04,815
I have breast cancer, and they're
doing a mastectomy tomorrow.

439
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,636
What are you talking about?

440
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,175
What is she talking about?

441
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,384
Here.

442
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,818
Come here, honey. Let...

443
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,149
She really said that? "I
need more time with him"?

444
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,533
That's what she said.

445
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,776
Deluca, suction there.

446
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,922
Sixty years of
marriage. Wow, that's...

447
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,780
It's never enough time.

448
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:30,016
If it's 60 years
or it's six weeks.

449
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,248
It's never gonna be enough time.

450
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,784
Well, these people
are an anomaly.

451
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,809
What? You're saying two people
can't have a long and happy marriage?

452
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,264
I'm saying maybe this is an
unrealistic ideal of marriage.

453
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,029
Sixty years of good,
bad, and ugly. That's...

454
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,053
everything.

455
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,621
What's wrong with wanting that?

456
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,425
Nothing.

457
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,043
There's nothing wrong
with wanting that, DeLuca.

458
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,478
Scissors.

459
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:03,211
Well, Webber's pissed. And,
honestly, he's got a right to be.

460
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,380
When does it end, though?

461
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:09,600
It doesn't solve anything, for
him to walk around scowling at me.

462
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,619
When does the
cold shoulder stop?

463
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,111
Yeah, well... he'll come around.

464
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:19,649
Oh, uh, Shepherd's decompressing
the hematoma. Fingers crossed.

465
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,119
Mmm.

466
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,837
- Sixty damn years.
- Mmm, Right?

467
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,731
You have it in you?

468
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,294
Hey, when I said "I
do," I meant "I do."

469
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,420
Even though I know what
you're gonna be like in 60 years.

470
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:37,045
And what am I going
to be like, Dr. Warren?

471
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,601
Bossy.

472
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,132
You'll be retired and
jonesing for the days

473
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,040
when you ran a whole hospital,

474
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,770
bossing me around,
and Tuck, and...

475
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,345
Tuck's poor wife!
Lord, help that woman.

476
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,476
Ah, like you're gonna
be some walk in the park.

477
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,451
Me? I'm gonna be distinguished
with a little touch of gray.

478
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,450
And one of those guys that tells
the same stories over and over

479
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,535
and exaggerates it every time.

480
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,171
"And then I sliced a woman open

481
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,012
on the kitchen table
during a rainstorm."

482
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,916
You have it in you?

483
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,495
If the stories come
with foot rubs.

484
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,746
Deal.

485
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,340
Huh. Hi.

486
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:42,976
Saturation levels have...

487
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,562
remained the same all night.

488
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,882
She's stubborn,

489
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,563
but she's right, as usual.

490
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,332
Sixty years, not many
couples last that long.

491
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:55,789
You want to know the secret?

492
00:27:56,692 --> 00:28:00,110
- Everyone wants
to know the secret.
- I'll take it if you have one.

493
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,831
There isn't one.

494
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,182
Just stayed married
to her, I guess.

495
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,136
I would never have had
the life I did without her.

496
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,308
So I just stayed married to her.

497
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,295
If there's something
else, some other secret...

498
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,681
she's the one who knows it.

499
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,051
I don't know a damn thing.

500
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,472
'Cause you never stop yapping.

501
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,657
Oh, Elsie!

502
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:44,685
No more.

503
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,653
No more locking me
out of my mother's chart.

504
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,504
I want to know
anything and everything.

505
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,574
I want to be CC'd
on every chart,

506
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,393
every post-op
report, every test.

507
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,537
No secrets.

508
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,602
I did want to tell
you, you know.

509
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,322
How could you let
me talk to her like that?

510
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,829
You could've stopped me.

511
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:11,742
What is wrong with you?

512
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:14,846
We're supposed to be friends.
Why didn't you just tell me?

513
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,767
Why didn't you just tell me?

514
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,922
I am your friend,

515
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,192
Maggie, but I'm also her doctor.

516
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:26,487
Go fix her.

517
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:47,011
I want two-hour neuro checks and
call me immediately for any signs

518
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,436
- of increased ICP.
- Got it.

519
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:51,438
Nice job.

520
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,357
Thanks.

521
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,705
I know I was against it, but
it looks like you were right.

522
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:58,745
I think you gave that
couple more time together.

523
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,042
I don't care what you think.

524
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,584
Amelia, stop.

525
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,830
You don't have any
right to an opinion.

526
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,360
And you certainly don't
have the right to bully me.

527
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,475
Bully you?

528
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:14,772
You don't have the right

529
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:17,525
to give me ultimatums
about when to come home

530
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,829
and make up my mind.

531
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,050
- Okay.
- For better or for worse.

532
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,067
That's what you said.

533
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:26,022
Well, guess what?
This is the "for worse"!

534
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,737
And you don't have the right to just
decide that I don't have myself together.

535
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,424
Okay? You... You don't
make me the one who is wrong.

536
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,176
I am tired of being the
messed-up one, okay?

537
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,129
Because I'm not. You are
at least as messed up as me.

538
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,937
- You disappeared!
- You are suffocating me!

539
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,690
- That is unfair.
- Really?

540
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:48,878
I would love to ask Christina
how suffocated she felt by you,

541
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,594
by your needs, by your idea
of a baby, by what you want!

542
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,778
All right!

543
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,370
Stop!

544
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,820
Not here.

545
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:04,855
I only wanted the same
thing you said you wanted!

546
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,058
- You told me...
- Okay, why do you even
want a baby?

547
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,810
- Have you asked yourself that?
- What?

548
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,394
- Why do I want a baby?
- Yes, yes.

549
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,113
What do you need
that you don't have

550
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,937
that you think a baby
is going to bring you?

551
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,173
- I want a family.
- You have one!

552
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,675
You and me, that
makes one. What else?

553
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,710
What do you need?

554
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:24,609
- I mean, it's normal to want...
- No, you don't get to call

555
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,699
what is normal!

556
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:27,901
You don't know!

557
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:30,653
You want a dream, Owen.

558
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:34,090
And when you have a child,

559
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,972
you might not get to
have what you asked for.

560
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,463
You get what you are given.

561
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,331
And it might be wonderful.

562
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,453
And it might be painful,
and it might be both.

563
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,406
I know you're scared, but...

564
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:53,126
Amelia, I think you'd
be an amazing mom.

565
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,564
I was already an
amazing mom, Owen.

566
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,399
For better and for worse.

567
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,637
Are you here for that?

568
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:07,974
Are you here for that?

569
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:22,572
Or do we just play by your
rules, by your "normal" rules?

570
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,941
'Cause that's not life.

571
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,344
It's not a marriage.

572
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,030
Not one that's gonna last.

573
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:07,393
How we doing? Feeling
better? A little more...

574
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,965
Sixteen twenty-two.

575
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:15,218
I'm sorry?

576
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,704
Sixteen twenty-two.

577
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,823
The time of her death.

578
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,412
For when you
want to put it down.

579
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:27,446
I looked.

580
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:07,298
<i>Dr. Fields to Medical Records.
Dr. Fields to Medical Records.</i>

581
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,882
- Okay, all right.
- Got it.

582
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,897
I think that we should talk about
what you saw with Eliza and I.

583
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:20,094
Arizona,

584
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,870
you've always had
a active love life.

585
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,900
If I worried about who
you've been kissing on,

586
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,887
it would leave me little
time for anything else.

587
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,073
Okay, you're mad.
You didn't mean that.

588
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,217
Yes, I did.

589
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,117
No, I didn't.

590
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,195
Damn it.

591
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,265
This is what I've turned into.

592
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:45,392
I've become this person who
takes sides and counts votes.

593
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,890
It's ugly, and it's
bitter, and it's small.

594
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:52,932
- This is what
Bailey's done here.
- I'm... I'm so sorry.

595
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,166
You said you were
with me, Robbins.

596
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,940
- I believed you.
- I was. I am.

597
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,659
I just...

598
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:05,762
I just didn't expect to feel this
way, okay? I... I didn't try to.

599
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,654
Okay, you know what?
I need some time, okay?

600
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:10,297
I'll...

601
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,268
I'll come around, but...

602
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,071
I need some damn time.

603
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,540
Take all the time you need.

604
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:34,207
Well, I can call the morgue
and I can finish her paperwork.

605
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:37,458
Hey.

606
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,079
Hey, look, she was 95.

607
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,244
Okay, you were right. They
had way more time than most.

608
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,433
They wanted more.

609
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,769
She wanted more.

610
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:49,572
That was the only
reason to do the surgery.

611
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,327
And we took away
what little time they had.

612
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:58,075
Shepherd said her co-morbidities
made it unlikely that she'd...

613
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,265
Why do we do it?

614
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,671
Why do we do any of it? Why...

615
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,006
If we can't do...

616
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,959
what we say we
were gonna do, then...

617
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,312
If we actually
have no control...

618
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,385
then how dare we tell
them we can, you know?

619
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,908
I think I'm in love with Jo.

620
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,997
I might be. I...

621
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,019
I'm pretty sure.

622
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,037
Stop talking. Stop talking.

623
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:40,524
I want more.

624
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,366
All right.

625
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:44,955
- Hey.
- Go away.

626
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,579
- I'm sorry.
- Go away.

627
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,467
- Hey.
- No!

628
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,455
It's okay.

629
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,393
<i>I don't have a good reason.</i>

630
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,319
<i>I tried to come up with one.</i>

631
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,124
So then I thought,
"Well, why do I like her?"

632
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:16,689
<i>And I don't know.</i>

633
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,074
<i>From the first time I saw you,</i>

634
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,309
you were at the O.R. board.
You were talking with Pierce,

635
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,533
and she said something
that made you laugh, and...

636
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,754
<i>I couldn't move.</i>

637
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,047
<i>Then I had to wait for you to write
your name on the board because...</i>

638
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,337
<i>I just needed to
know who you were.</i>

639
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,128
So, I don't have...

640
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,697
<i>a good reason
for you to like me.</i>

641
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,752
I didn't even try to like
you. I didn't want to.

642
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:46,575
I certainly don't want to have to
think about you all the time, trying to...

643
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:48,824
<i>come in early, see
your name on the board,</i>

644
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,672
come up with that one
thing that's gonna make you

645
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,230
smile so your eyes
do that thing they do.

646
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,436
Anyway, so that's why
I joke so much and...

647
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:02,066
to keep from having
to say anything like this.

648
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,808
So, I don't have a good reason.

649
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:07,994
<i>I'm sorry. I wish I did.</i>

650
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,587
Okay, so you should
ask me out to dinner.

651
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,797
- Do you want to go
out to dinner?
- Yes.

652
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:29,982
Dr. Grey, Dr. Pierce needs you.

653
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,600
Okay. Sorry.

654
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,256
So, another signature here.

655
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,247
- Um...
- Do you know what funeral home
you want yet?

656
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,350
No, our church might know.

657
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:53,088
Do I have to fill all this out now?
Can I do this in the morning?

658
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,321
Of course, you can. Everything
can wait until tomorrow.

659
00:39:57,345 --> 00:40:00,374
- Okay.
- Is there anything else
I can do for you?

660
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,675
Well,

661
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,884
I don't have a car.
Elsie and I came...

662
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,619
in an ambulance.

663
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,849
Well, let me call you a cab.

664
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,174
No, it's... it's fine. Just...

665
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,229
tell me where I can get
one. I'm all turned around.

666
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:20,750
Well, just go out here, turn
right, and at the corner. But...

667
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,730
Dr. Clatch, please, let me just

668
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,354
- get you a...
- No, I...

669
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,556
I have to figure things
out for myself now.

670
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,126
I... I... Okay.

671
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,289
- Go home.
- Thank you.

672
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,863
- Here. That's for you.
- Oh...

673
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,816
Thank you.

674
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,901
<i>Everything comes
apart at some point.</i>

675
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,570
<i>We all will. It's the law.</i>

676
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,057
<i>It's what we were
designed to do.</i>

677
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,057
My mom is really sick.

678
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,246
<i>We have to face
it and accept it.</i>

679
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,908
<i>And try to hold it together...</i>

680
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,917
<i>for as long as we can.</i>
