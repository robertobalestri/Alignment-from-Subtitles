1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:09,286
<i>You know that story, where a
child gets trapped under a car...</i>

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,654
<i>and their parent finds
the superhuman strength</i>

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,013
<i>to lift the car and
save the child's life?</i>

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,501
<i>I always wondered
if that was real.</i>

5
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:19,812
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

6
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,233
- I could go with you.
- No, I'm fine. I just need a second.

7
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:26,719
I could go with you. I have the
day off. And you need people.

8
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:28,572
It's good to show them
that you have people.

9
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,774
You don't want to look like some
lone-wolf assailant with no friends.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,677
All they're doing is
setting a trial date.

11
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,001
It'll take, like, ten minutes.
The security line will take longer.

12
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,387
- Stop fussing!
- Okay, fine!

13
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,291
If you're sure, fine. Good luck.

14
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:46,107
<i>If someone I cared about,
was hurt or trapped...</i>

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,848
<i>would my instincts kick in?
Would I know what to do?</i>

16
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,881
- You want to sit a minute?
- No, I'm fine. I got to go. Bye.

17
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,950
Okay. Well, call me or text me.

18
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,841
And try to come
home early, okay?

19
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:02,055
<i>Would I lift the car?
Jump in front of the bullet?</i>

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,563
<i>Would I be able to beat
somebody senseless?</i>

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,842
<i>I like to think I would.</i>

22
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,049
Alex?

23
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,387
- Maybe we sit a minute.
- Okay.

24
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,186
We have time.

25
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,780
I guess this line could
go slower. Except no.

26
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,049
There's no such thing as moving
slower than not moving at all.

27
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,484
So never mind. I take it back.

28
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,719
Yeah, I thought half an
hour early would be enough.

29
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,177
9/11, man. Everybody's
a suspect now.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,225
Look at that lady. Does
she look dangerous to you?

31
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,409
Not really.

32
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,361
Maybe that guy if you
took his coffee away.

33
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,585
I look more dangerous than that
guy and I'm just here for traffic court.

34
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,322
Contesting a ticket.

35
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,486
I totally didn't stop
at the stop sign,

36
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,455
but I'm banking on
the cop not showing up.

37
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,656
They almost never show.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,046
I do not have the money to
throw away on this right now.

39
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,849
Just got knocked up.

40
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,284
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,003
What are you in for?

42
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,450
Just setting a trial date today.

43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,057
Trial date? Are you dangerous?

44
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,306
How far along?

45
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,628
Early still. Sixteen weeks.

46
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,881
That redness on your
hand, you had it long?

47
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,246
Like a week or so.

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,282
Any unusual symptoms?
Leg swelling, abdominal pain?

49
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,284
Okay, you definitely
seem a little weird now.

50
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:41,309
Sorry. It's a habit. I'm
a doctor at Grey Sloan.

51
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,623
You should get
that rash checked.

52
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:45,491
No. I got to stick
to the budget now.

53
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,793
I got enough doctor's
visits coming up.

54
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,161
I do not need to add more.

55
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,466
You can afford to see me. I
work at the free clinic there.

56
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,722
Damn it! I'm late.

57
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,029
Get that rash
checked! Think about it!

58
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,058
Yeah.

59
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,860
That's me, the
girl with the rash.

60
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:04,884
Thanks.

61
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,697
They're setting the trial
date right now, as we speak.

62
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,348
I'm still waiting to hear.

63
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,484
Date? Wow. Makes
it all feel so real.

64
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,986
Yeah, and I know it's good news.

65
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,888
It means the end's
near, but things finally

66
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:17,223
just started feeling
more normal again here.

67
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,825
Yeah, brings it
all right back up.

68
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,426
You still talk to
Karev at all, or...

69
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,695
We don't talk. We barely
even see each other.

70
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,581
It's a little like he and I
never even existed so...

71
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,485
Yeah.

72
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:31,037
Gotta go. I'm on Bailey's service.
Tell me if you talk to your lawyer.

73
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,061
All right.

74
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,907
Robbins, have you
met the new resident?

75
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,345
She is great! No, amazing! She's
better than some of my attendings.

76
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,578
Woah! Hold on a second.

77
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,114
I didn't know we
got a new resident.

78
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,538
Yeah, Webber just hired
her. She's... Hold on.

79
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,205
Dr. Robbins, this is...

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,323
Murphy!

81
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:52,080
Dr. Robbins. Hi.

82
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:53,796
You guys know each other?

83
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,150
- Umm.
- Yes.

84
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,984
Leah... Dr. Murphy used to...

85
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,920
- I used to work here.
- Yes.

86
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,944
I have patients.

87
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,627
You realize your shenanigans
this morning made me late.

88
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,464
Well, you own the hospital.
You can be as late as you want to.

89
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,367
And you can't tell me my
"shenanigans" weren't worth it.

90
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,718
I don't like being late.

91
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,121
- Big surgery?
- Meeting with Bailey.

92
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:22,689
- Really? What about?
- Well...

93
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,174
You hired Leah Murphy back?

94
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,242
Why? Why? Why?
Why would you do that?

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,294
With Blake gone, it
seemed like perfect timing.

96
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:31,348
I thought you fired her because
she wasn't cut out to be a surgeon.

97
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,899
Yeah, why would
you bring her back?

98
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,184
She did the work
to prove me wrong,

99
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,687
and Foster's Residency
Director said she excelled there,

100
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,951
and I think she deserved
a second chance.

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,558
Don't you believe
in second chances?

102
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,582
No!

103
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,786
I mean!

104
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,786
Hey. I'm just
headed up to surgery.

105
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,306
Just wanted to say good morning.
You were gone when I got up.

106
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,495
I get early surgery.

107
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,044
Listen, you... You want
to talk later, maybe?

108
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,985
- I mean, we didn't last night.
- Nope!

109
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,166
Amelia...

110
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,952
people don't always get pregnant

111
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,537
their first try, and I just
don't want you to feel...

112
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,271
Are you kidding? I'm fine!

113
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,789
- You're fine?
- Yeah, I'm good.

114
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,075
I'm great, even. Yeah, for sure.

115
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,745
That's good. That's
good that you're so good.

116
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,447
Incoming! Any second. MVC.

117
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,117
Kid with possible head trauma,
dad with multiple abdominal issues.

118
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,191
- We could use neuro.
- Right behind you.

119
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,358
Robbie Reeves, 12, MVC.
Restrained passenger. Vitals stable.

120
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:35,061
No LOC on the scene.
Small scalp laceration.

121
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,847
- It was like a roller coaster!
- All right. Robbie,
I'm Dr. Shepherd.

122
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,799
Where's my dad? I got to ask
him how fast we were going.

123
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,551
It looks like he's
pulling in behind you.

124
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,553
- Your head's hurting?
- Barely. Can I ask him?

125
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,337
In a minute. I'm gonna
check you out first.

126
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,711
Bob Reeves, forties, the driver.
Some abdominal bruising, tenuous BP.

127
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,013
Large wounds on the left leg.

128
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:56,065
Robbie? Where's my son?

129
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,684
Somebody tell me
if my son is here.

130
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,070
Sir, he's here. They just
took him inside, okay?

131
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,476
Okay. Okay. Good. Thank you.

132
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,790
You got some nasty bruising.

133
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,342
You got pretty banged
up out there, Mr. Reeves.

134
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,714
You should see my car.

135
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,850
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

136
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,119
All right. Contact
dermatitis, bed four.

137
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,877
Hey, look who showed up.

138
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,606
Well, I can't be
the pregnant lady

139
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,792
who ignores unsolicited
medical advice.

140
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,862
- That lady's a jerk.
- Let's see this rash.

141
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,030
That's all it was,
right? Medical advice?

142
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,366
Because, if you got me worried

143
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,934
just to get a date or get in
some pregnant lady's pants,

144
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,488
- that would make you the jerk.
- Just doing my job... promise.

145
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,222
How long have your
hands been itching?

146
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,113
Uh, like a week, maybe more.

147
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,712
Not that I'm not available.
I am, or, I could be.

148
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,465
A baby belly doesn't
exactly equal baby daddy.

149
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,666
There is a baby daddy.

150
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,117
He's not attached,
I mean, not to me.

151
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,486
- You don't have to explain.
- I kind of do.

152
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,621
Hospitals give me the
creeps, so talking helps.

153
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay, so there's a baby daddy.

154
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,175
Jeremy, my best friend,
since we were kids.

155
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,211
We made one of those pacts,
you know, if we both wound up

156
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,062
single at 40, we'd make a baby.

157
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,948
I thought it would be
needles and test tubes,

158
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:05,706
- turns out that's really pricy.
- Yeah, it's up there. Look this way.

159
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,243
Look the other way.

160
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,074
All right, good.

161
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,944
So, one night, there was
a lot of tequila, and boom!

162
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,330
I got this little parasite
that sucks all my energy.

163
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,415
Silver lining, though...
I've been losing weight.

164
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,050
I always thought that
would go the other way.

165
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,424
You're losing weight. How much?

166
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,658
I don't know,
enough to drop a size.

167
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,356
What? What's that look?

168
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,242
Just want to run some tests. Can
you hang out here for a while today?

169
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,494
You've got me worried again.

170
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,363
Is there something wrong?
Should I call the baby daddy?

171
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,020
Well, if you're stuck here, a
little company couldn't hurt.

172
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,287
You've made no
move to fire Karev.

173
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,973
There's no replacement
surgeon. What is the plan?

174
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,443
Karev's been removed from
surgical service, pending his trial.

175
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,179
I don't understand why
he's still working here at all.

176
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,466
If a doctor on our staff has been
charged with a felony assault,

177
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,401
he should not be a
doctor on our staff.

178
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:58,655
Well, he's innocent until proven
guilty. We have a justice system.

179
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,908
I don't wanna throw away
a good surgeon's career,

180
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:05,361
- because of one mistake.
- I know. That's your tendency.

181
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,797
That's my tenden...
What's my tendency?

182
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,921
Leniency. You have a
tendency towards leniency.

183
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,790
Are you joking?

184
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,077
You know what my
nickname used to be?

185
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,164
- They called me the Na...
- Benjamin Warren.

186
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,369
Dr. Bailey, I believe in you.

187
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,468
I think you have an
extraordinary future ahead of you.

188
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,170
And I wouldn't dream
of coming in here

189
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,812
and telling you
how to do your job.

190
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,916
But if you don't take some
steps to replace Dr. Karev...

191
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,786
I will.

192
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,971
- You paged?
- Yeah, come take a look.

193
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,735
All right, assist the head lac.

194
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,919
Sir, I'm gonna need to take
a look at your wound, okay?

195
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,675
Okay, that's really deep. We're
gonna need to get this debrided

196
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,644
and covered with a local
muscle flap, right away.

197
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:12,895
Looks like he took a beating.

198
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,814
Car hit the median. They're
lucky everyone survived.

199
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,834
My kid was in the car with me.
This guy was all over the road.

200
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,752
- There's blood in his abdomen.
- Better book the CT.

201
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,704
Three lanes he whipped
across to cut me off.

202
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,773
I mean, what the
hell? Who does that?

203
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,457
Oh, God. Robbie.

204
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,494
What's happening with
my son? Is he okay?

205
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:32,048
We passed a bunch of cars, and
we kept going faster and faster!

206
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,072
Follow my finger with your eyes.

207
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,420
- Ow.
- That is quite a cut
you've got there, Robbie.

208
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,612
- Does it hurt?
- I can take it.

209
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,143
Is my dad okay? 'Cause I
should probably check on him.

210
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,294
Right.

211
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,667
I mean, he's my dad.

212
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,352
- You okay, Robbie?
- I'm fine, Dad.

213
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,487
- Thanks for waiting.
- It's fine.

214
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,479
Jackson can cool his heels
for a few more minutes upstairs.

215
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm not hurt. I'm
really okay, Dad.

216
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,884
Mom's on her way, buddy, okay?

217
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,366
Listen to the doctors until she
gets here. You hear me? Behave.

218
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,402
I always behave, not
like that jerk that cut us off.

219
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:12,522
I bet next time he'll think
twice. I bet we did teach him...

220
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,923
All right, all right. Buddy...

221
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,947
All right, dad.

222
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,414
I paged Bailey over an hour ago.

223
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,050
How long does it take to
walk over to the damn clinic?

224
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,471
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

225
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,022
I am, too, but
boundaries, remember?

226
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,091
I can't hold your hand?
I've held your boobs.

227
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,993
Can we please not talk about
how the sausage is made?

228
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,728
Can we not call
our baby a sausage?

229
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:37,763
Sorry, guys, just
another minute.

230
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:40,115
And, by the way,
you said it was lovely.

231
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,417
It was, in its own way.

232
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,741
I also said let's never
speak of it again, remember?

233
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,674
So, what was all that about?

234
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,975
Is there something
we need to know?

235
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,228
Yes, but I need a surgeon
to officially assess you,

236
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,645
and I can't seem to get one.

237
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,521
So, if you guys could just hang
tight, I'll be right back, okay?

238
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,915
Hey. My bladder rupture
repair... done and done.

239
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,151
And I'm about to scrub
in on a nasty volvulus.

240
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,737
- What do you got?
- A kid in a car accident.

241
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,039
He's lucky, though. I'm
not seeing much of anything,

242
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,942
just a small congenital
AVM, nothing to do there.

243
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,767
If he's clear in a few
hours, I'll send him home.

244
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,952
Hey, you got a minute to talk?

245
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,349
Owen, there's
nothing to talk about.

246
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,036
But you love to talk, and
you're not talking about this at all.

247
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,821
Hear my words and just
take them at face value.

248
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,471
And I know, I
wouldn't mind talking.

249
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,764
I am fine. It's just...
Why the rush, you know?

250
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,866
What?

251
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:45,064
Well, I mean, we were barely
engaged, and now we're barely married,

252
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,349
and we're already
trying for kids?

253
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,602
Why all the pressure?
Let's just be us for a minute.

254
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,904
You know, enjoy us
and feel what it's like

255
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:56,331
to be two people in a
marriage, newlyweds,

256
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,660
before we add to it, right?

257
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,884
Is um...

258
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,804
If that's what you want.

259
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,974
Great.

260
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,192
- She gave you an ultimatum?
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:16,712
And she called
me lenient. Lenient!

262
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,080
You were lenient.

263
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,200
- I was not! I was not lenient.
- Yes, you were.

264
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:25,537
You were a lenient
and kind and wise chief,

265
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:29,663
- who ruled with fairness.
- Yes, I was fair. I was fair-minded.

266
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,644
Lenient makes me sound weak.

267
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,363
- I know.
- And I believe
in second chances.

268
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,616
Look at Leah Murphy. She
persevered, and she improved.

269
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,051
She asked to come back.

270
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:42,004
I feel that kind of
fortitude is to be rewarded.

271
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,456
And more so, I
believe it will reward us.

272
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,180
That's how I feel about Karev.

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,049
And I'm right.

274
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,188
- Right?
- You have to decide that.

275
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,069
I mean, that's why they call
them the tough calls, Bailey.

276
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,588
"That's why they call
them the tough calls"?

277
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,828
That's all you got? I
just called you wise.

278
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,548
Heads up.

279
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,961
Look, the clinic
is a joke, I know.

280
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,295
And nobody wants
to go over there.

281
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,997
But it's not a joke
when a pregnant lady

282
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,832
has to wait over an hour
for someone to come over

283
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,700
and confirm that she has cancer.

284
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,519
I've paged you multiple times!

285
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,388
I'm the Chief of Surgery. Why
aren't you paging a resident?

286
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,824
I want you! The surgeon
with the most expertise

287
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,659
to give this patient
the best chance!

288
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,195
Look, you stuck me over
there. It's your freaking clinic.

289
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,347
At least have the decency to
answer your own damn pages.

290
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,518
Not today, Karev. You do
not want to push me today.

291
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,825
Meet you there in five.

292
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,801
You were saying about
not wanting to fire him?

293
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,191
- Hey.
- Hi.

294
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,993
I'm on Dr. Bailey's
service, so...

295
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,017
Right.

296
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,729
- I'm Dr. Bailey.
- Hi. Jeremy.

297
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,221
Wow. This is a lot
of fuss for just a rash.

298
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,424
Okay. So hit me.

299
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,740
The symptoms that
Dr. Karev noticed...

300
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,909
your weight loss, the
itching on your hands,

301
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,883
when we see those symptoms
together, it's a red flag.

302
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,201
So, we took a look at your MRI and
detected a mass on your pancreas.

303
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:21,353
Oh, God. Is it... cancer?

304
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,706
- It's... too soon
to know for sure.
- But it could be?

305
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,099
We'll need to do a biopsy to
confirm, and we can go from there.

306
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,364
And you figured all this out
just by looking at my hands.

307
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:34,054
I was hoping I
was wrong. Still am.

308
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,588
You and me both.

309
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,228
All right, let's get
some irrigation in here.

310
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,051
I don't get road rage.
Do you get road rage?

311
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,044
I don't chase people
down. I'm not crazy.

312
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,280
Yeah, but other people.

313
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,947
- Other people are crazy.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,250
Well, actually sometimes,
April, you get a little crazy.

315
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,152
What? Warren, bovie this.

316
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:55,388
Well, somebody cuts you
off in traffic, you unleash

317
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,223
a stream of obscenities that'll
tear the paint off the walls.

318
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,458
Kepner? Really?

319
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,827
Well, it's just a release.
They can't hear me.

320
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,145
Yeah, they just think
you're on the phone. Yeah.

321
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,880
Oh, God. You don't do that
with Harriet in the car, do you?

322
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,733
- No, never. I would never.
- Oh, and you can't honk.

323
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,351
That just makes
crazy people crazier.

324
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,187
No, no honking, not ever.

325
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,988
When I flip someone
off, I always do it

326
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,157
below the dash, where
they can't see it, you know?

327
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,701
Or maybe you don't do anything.

328
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,353
- Solid advice.
- Absolutely. Clamp.

329
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,571
You're not even chewing.

330
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,163
I'm hungry, no time.
Waiting on biopsy results.

331
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,343
Did Pierce tell you about
her new favorite resident?

332
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,712
I can't operate, I don't care.

333
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,597
I mean, technically,
it's an old resident.

334
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,054
Leah Murphy.

335
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,084
- She's back?
- I love her.

336
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,358
Really great suture
techniques, steady hands.

337
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:50,297
- How are you?
- Great! Married.

338
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,851
Newlywed of two
months, going strong.

339
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,386
Super strong.

340
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,467
Can Webber really rehire
her? I mean, I am on the board.

341
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,852
What is the problem?

342
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,920
We needed a new resident,
and she's a good one.

343
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,073
- Robbins slept with her.
- So did Alex!

344
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,491
If you go there, be
careful. She gets attached.

345
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,515
Excuse me.

346
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,279
- Have you seen her yet?
- No.

347
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,515
I mean, do you think it's
weird she hasn't called us

348
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,817
to let us know
she's coming back?

349
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,561
- Who's back?
- Leah Murphy.

350
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,587
She was in our intern class,

351
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,589
then she left in the
second year of the program.

352
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,358
- Not by choice.
- What happened?

353
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,243
She didn't fight hard
enough to get in the OR,

354
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,812
- or study or prepare.
- Yes, she did.

355
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,997
She drilled through a patient's
leg all the way down to the table.

356
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,115
Yikes.

357
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,368
- That was an accident!
- Did I also mention she almost

358
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,587
brought the hospital down
with harassment lawsuits

359
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,305
and complaints
against attendings

360
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,690
because she was
sleeping with attendings?

361
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,209
Well, in fairness, I
slept with an attending.

362
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,566
Attendings.

363
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,462
Both Robbins and Karev.

364
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,597
- Robbins and Karev?
- Don't remind me.

365
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,067
Not that I care, but still,
just don't remind me.

366
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,552
It screwed with her head,
so Webber asked her to leave.

367
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,616
Just goes to show...
don't crap where you eat.

368
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,314
Hey, guys! Someone sitting here?

369
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,647
Hi! No! Sit. We
were just talking...

370
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:02,753
Talking about me?

371
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,689
Figures.

372
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,488
Umm.

373
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,026
Anyway, uh, welcome back.

374
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,653
- Damn it.
- Advanced pancreatic cancer.

375
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,763
I say we start with
neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

376
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,478
Hope it'll shrink the
tumor, then we can resect it.

377
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:35,681
- Follow up with more chemo.
- But she's pregnant.

378
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,850
How can the fetus
survive that kind of chemo?

379
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,619
- It can't.
- We'll have to recommend
termination.

380
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,038
If we can schedule
it for this afternoon,

381
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,141
we could start the first cycle
of chemo as early as tomorrow.

382
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,227
This isn't some accidental pregnancy.
There has to be some other option.

383
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,946
This is the best option.

384
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,698
You don't know that.
You don't know her.

385
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:55,033
I know what I'm looking
at on these scans.

386
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,752
Then look harder. I
mean, there has to be...

387
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,054
Okay, you marched
across the street.

388
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,740
You yelled at me to come
and assess your patient.

389
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:05,310
Me. Nobody else would do.
And now I'm here. I am assessing.

390
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,062
I can't help if you
don't like what you hear.

391
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,697
I convinced her to
come to our clinic.

392
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,099
I told her we could help her.

393
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,167
It's pancreatic cancer.

394
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,870
- There's only so much
help we can give.
- You're not even trying!

395
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,857
Okay, you are on
thin ice, Karev. Thin!

396
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,447
This is not the time to get...

397
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,519
I am the surgeon. I know
my recommendation.

398
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,021
We're done here.

399
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,526
Robbie, I have some good
news. Your dad's out of surgery.

400
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,945
So, as soon as your mom gets
here, she can bring you to see him.

401
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,889
My mom will be
pretty happy about that.

402
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,521
Yeah, I bet she will.

403
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,656
She's probably pretty scared.

404
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,076
I bet she is.

405
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,548
Robbie...

406
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,835
if you are scared, it's okay.

407
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,904
I mean, it's all
right to be scared.

408
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,457
It's all right to say
you are, talk about it.

409
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,962
He got so mad.

410
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:12,744
- Yeah. It's okay.
- And we went so fast.

411
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:15,128
I thought we were
gonna go off the road.

412
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,356
I thought we'd die.
I just want my mom.

413
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,525
She's coming. She's on her way.

414
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,195
And you're safe now, okay?

415
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,677
Okay? Robbie?

416
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,745
- I just want...
- What's that?

417
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,149
- Hurts...
- Robbie? Do you know
where you are?

418
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,554
Can you squeeze my hands?

419
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,587
Okay, I'm right here with
you, and I'm gonna help you.

420
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,888
- This is Robbie's...
- Warren, get in here!

421
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,490
- Robbie?
- We need some help here!

422
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,275
- Get her out of here.
- What's happening?

423
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,798
We need you to step back.

424
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,861
Okay, somebody call upstairs.

425
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,569
Bump whoever's in CT out.
We're coming up there now.

426
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,570
Let's go.

427
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,387
What's wrong with him?
They said he was fine.

428
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,428
And he was, but I
really have to go now.

429
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,497
His CT was fine. No
contusion, no fracture.

430
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,249
He has an incidental
AVM in the left temporal.

431
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,383
It must have ruptured.

432
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,802
If his AVM ruptured,
that's bad, right?

433
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,887
- Really bad.
- I want an OR on standby.

434
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,393
Make that happen right now.

435
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,783
- Robbie's in surgery?
- Yeah, he had a brain bleed.

436
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,518
They took him up as
soon as they detected it.

437
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,367
Today was supposed
to be a good one.

438
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,925
Robbie said he wanted me to
take him to buy a comic book.

439
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,761
Yeah, that kind of thing
doesn't happen much anymore.

440
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,030
He's 12 now.

441
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,934
And everything I do pretty
much embarrasses him.

442
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,654
But today, when that guy
cut me off, I was so pissed.

443
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:45,120
I mean, he could have killed
us. I just... I took off after him,

444
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,478
and then we hit a slick
spot and we lost control.

445
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,331
We hit the wall.

446
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,635
He's with Dr. Shepherd
now. And she's excellent.

447
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:58,216
Hey, sweetie. How's Robbie?

448
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,560
There's no news.
He's still in surgery.

449
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:05,496
Bob, what happened?
I don't understand.

450
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,583
I'll check back in a few.

451
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,774
This guy cut me off,
and I just got so mad.

452
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,093
I'm sorry, but it sounds like...

453
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,474
you want me to
terminate my pregnancy.

454
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,607
Oh, man.

455
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,676
We need to begin treatments
as soon as possible.

456
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,494
And the baby
couldn't survive them.

457
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,564
So, the baby's healthy.

458
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,621
The thing that's wrong
here is me, right?

459
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:53,555
Well, how much time do I
get? If I do what you're asking

460
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,929
and I get all the treatments,
how much time will I have?

461
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,801
Less than a year.

462
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,790
Then what is the point?

463
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,371
Why can't we just wait
until the baby's born,

464
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,773
and then you can nuke my
body full of chemo all you want?

465
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,317
You're not listening.
She's not listening.

466
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,108
They're saying...

467
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,065
that without the treatments,

468
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,734
the cancer will kill you
before the baby's even born.

469
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,209
In a month, two months,
you'll both be dead.

470
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:32,477
I went to court... to
fight a traffic ticket

471
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:36,987
so I could save 360 dollars, so we
could buy an organic crib mattress.

472
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,707
This is how my day
started. And now I'm...

473
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:47,214
All day long, I have been
thinking that there is...

474
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,696
there's a reason
that I was in that line.

475
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,369
There's a reason that I met you.

476
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,917
And I don't believe in
God or fate or anything.

477
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,703
- She doesn't at all.
- But this is it?

478
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:01,294
I met you so you can tell
me that our baby has to die...

479
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,915
and then go crawl off
somewhere and die myself.

480
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,054
These are my options?

481
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,156
Just death?

482
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:13,991
And more death?

483
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,573
- What about a Whipple?
- A Whipple?

484
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,663
A what?

485
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,612
The baby wouldn't survive
being under that long.

486
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,036
Then we do it open.
Cut the time in half.

487
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,835
We forgo the first round of
chemo and do this surgery instead.

488
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,637
Remove the cancer from your
pancreas without harming the baby,

489
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,006
then close you up.

490
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,991
And that will save them...
that will save them both?

491
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,843
No, but it could keep
you alive long enough

492
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,897
to deliver a healthy baby.
It'll buy you both some time.

493
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,336
Dr. Karev.

494
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:48,553
What the hell? You are not
some hotshot surgeon right now.

495
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,505
You are a doctor in the clinic.

496
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,475
You cannot go around
suggesting outrageous procedures.

497
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,143
I was giving my
patient her options.

498
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,296
The patient you only have
because I gave you the chance

499
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,214
in the clinic in
the first place!

500
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,238
I'm sorry!

501
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,869
But I wasn't wrong. I didn't
promise the impossible.

502
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,054
Yeah, I overstepped,
and I'm overstepping again

503
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,873
and pissing you
off, and I don't care.

504
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,442
Go on, get mad at me, but
don't take it out on the patient.

505
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:11,915
Just give her a freaking chance.

506
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:21,892
When I tell you to know your
place, know your damn place.

507
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,580
- Push 25 of Mannitol.
- This happened so quickly.

508
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,365
Spontaneous hemorrhage,
but we are gonna get him back.

509
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,250
We have to get him back.

510
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,107
V-fib. Charge paddles to 120.

511
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,888
Clear.

512
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,207
Asystole.

513
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,631
Push another 25 of
Mannitol. Check his pupils.

514
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,141
Fixed and dilated.

515
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,361
Let me see that.

516
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,300
No, no. No, no!

517
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,037
No!

518
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,605
He's gone. You did
everything you could.

519
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:22,397
Seem to have poor back-bleeding
from the inferior mesenteric.

520
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,998
Murphy, what do
you do about that?

521
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,401
Create a circular button around
the artery's origin, harvest it,

522
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,336
- and then re-implant
it in the graft. How?

523
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,822
Use a partially occluding
clamp on the graft to make a cuff

524
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,441
incision and over-sew the
inferior mesenteric artery

525
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,343
- with running 4-0 Prolene.
- And then what?

526
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,245
After the completion
of anastomosis,

527
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,709
we check the Doppler signals
on the sigmoid mesentery.

528
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,239
Exactly.

529
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,701
You've double-checked
every suture I've made,

530
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:46,471
and you're pimping me
with complicated questions.

531
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:49,541
- They told you my story.
- What? No.

532
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:52,416
- What story? Is there a story?
- Who cares?

533
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,532
What they didn't tell you, what
they couldn't have told you...

534
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,050
is that when I left here,
things really sucked.

535
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,585
Then I got into the
program at Foster,

536
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,354
and I worked harder
than I've ever worked,

537
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:06,163
and I became the best. And
then, Dr. Pierce... you happened.

538
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,327
I'm sorry?

539
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,395
During a cardio
rotation, I found the article

540
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,298
you wrote about awake
VATS, and I was riveted.

541
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,752
So I researched other
things you had written,

542
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:20,510
and... it became very clear to
me that I'm not just a surgeon.

543
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,896
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon,

544
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,461
and I had to find you...
and learn from you.

545
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,096
I found out that
you'd been hired here,

546
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,333
and I thought, "Well, crap."
And then I realized, "Well, crap,

547
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,951
I have to figure out a way
to get back here somehow."

548
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:38,479
And now, I'm in an OR
with the Maggie Pierce.

549
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,133
- Sorry, Dr. Riggs, no offense.
- No, none taken. I get it.

550
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,737
I just hope that
whatever you heard...

551
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,289
I can't control that.

552
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,071
You know, when I first got here,

553
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,457
I was so miserable, I tried
to quit after two weeks.

554
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,226
People hated me so much,
I got punched in the face.

555
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,286
- Had exactly one friend.
- Kepner. She likes everybody.

556
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,390
Um, should we wait
for Jeremy to get back?

557
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,826
No, his stomach goes
bonkers when he's stressed out,

558
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,133
so he might be a while.

559
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,839
I wanted to talk to you
about scheduling the D&E.

560
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,520
Dr. Karev said there was a surgery.
Why aren't we doing that surgery?

561
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:29,925
Because it's very risky
to you, to the baby.

562
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,893
I already have
an expiration date.

563
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,950
Aren't we past a little
worried about some risks?

564
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,355
If we did this,

565
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:42,270
if we could remove the tumor
and keep your pregnancy intact,

566
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:43,921
by the time you deliver,

567
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:47,709
the cancer will have still
grown, unchecked for six months.

568
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,612
It'd be too far along
by then for us to treat it.

569
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,213
I mean, you would literally

570
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,139
be sacrificing your
own life for your child's.

571
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,943
I can see it, you know?

572
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,033
See what?

573
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,042
Jeremy pushing
our kid in the swing,

574
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,178
touching his toes
when they're in the sky.

575
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,780
And the baby
thinks it's so funny.

576
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:11,255
I can see them
growing older together...

577
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,058
getting to the good stuff.

578
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,927
Jeremy showing him<i>
Star Wars</i> for the first time.

579
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,963
<i>Episode IV,</i> 'cause you
can't start anywhere else.

580
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,350
High school, college...

581
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,251
his first apartment.

582
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:29,973
Jeremy's there, and
he's the best dad.

583
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:34,277
I picture that, and all
this crap is for something.

584
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,446
A happy ending.

585
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,950
I die, but there's
something good, still.

586
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,319
There's something good to see.

587
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,806
I picture it your way...
and everything goes black.

588
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,625
There's nothing.

589
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:50,978
Only death.

590
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:56,866
If this is the only chance
that my baby has to survive...

591
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,803
I am not looking
for a guarantee.

592
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,188
I'm looking for a chance.

593
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,148
Where'd you take Veronica?

594
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,196
She's in pre-op.

595
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,638
I was explaining to Jeremy
what to expect after her Whipple.

596
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,726
Thank you, Dr. Bailey,
for everything.

597
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,728
Have you seen a... hoodie?

598
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,055
Veronica's hoodie.
It's black, had a hood.

599
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,404
I was looking for it and
Dr. Bailey came up and...

600
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:41,839
- You sure she left it here?
- No, I'm not.

601
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,008
I'm not sure because I
wasn't paying any attention.

602
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,952
So, who knows? Who the
hell even knows where it is?

603
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,090
I can't... I can't do
this. I can't raise a kid.

604
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,804
Not by myself, not without her.

605
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,175
This was a good idea because we
had it, because we were gonna do it.

606
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,277
She's the one that thinks of
things, who keeps track of things.

607
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,663
I'm in charge of fun ideas. She's
in charge of, like, common sense

608
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,487
and where the
freaking hoodie is!

609
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,886
The next hoodie I lose,
my kid might be wearing it.

610
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,910
What if my kid is
wearing the hoodie?

611
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,146
I've worked with a
lot of parents, a lot.

612
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,662
- There's only one trick.
- What's the trick?

613
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,432
Show up. That's it.
Be there. Be around.

614
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,335
It's what you're doing for
your kid and his mom now,

615
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,744
and you're already good
at it. Give yourself a break.

616
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,081
She's my best friend.

617
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:40,994
She's always been there.

618
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,474
Always.

619
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,363
You ready, Veronica?

620
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,954
Is Dr. Karev gonna
be in the surgery, too?

621
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,307
Uh, he's needed in the clinic.

622
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,579
Then will you tell him
"thank you" for me?

623
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,481
The accident caused damage
to a weak spot in his brain.

624
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,133
We tried to repair it, but...

625
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:17,135
Robbie went into
cardiac arrest on the table.

626
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,470
No.

627
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:21,477
- I'm so sorry.
- We did everything we could.

628
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,596
Mrs. Reeves.

629
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,083
Laura.

630
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,508
If there's anything
that we can do...

631
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,575
I wish it was you.

632
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,819
It should've been you.

633
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:42,944
It should have been you!

634
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,550
Should've been you!

635
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,370
Mrs. Reeves.

636
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,339
Mrs. Reeves, come
with me, please.

637
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,573
You want to talk about it?

638
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,165
I'm just waiting to
hear how surgery goes,

639
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,538
so I got some time to kill.

640
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,410
Or not. I'm cool either way.

641
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,565
Or maybe just sit.
Sometimes sitting helps.

642
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,253
I'll just go.

643
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,827
I had a baby.

644
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:29,429
A baby boy.

645
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,617
- I had a son.
- Had?

646
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,335
When I was living in L.A., um...

647
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,072
He was born with
anencephaly but...

648
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,744
without a brain.
So, he lived for...

649
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,249
43 minutes...

650
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,038
And I held him.

651
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,259
I got to hold him.

652
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:05,765
And then it was time.

653
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,218
And he was...

654
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,656
He donated all of his organs.

655
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,415
And then I let him go.

656
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,099
And it almost killed me.

657
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,644
I didn't know.

658
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,156
No, you wouldn't, um...

659
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:36,279
I never told my family.
Not... Derek, not Meredith.

660
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:37,847
No one.

661
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,687
I haven't told Owen all of it.

662
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,240
And I don't think I can.

663
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:52,412
He wants a family so bad.

664
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,417
How do I tell him that...

665
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:04,941
- He won't look at me
the same way.
- Are you kidding?

666
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,162
He's gonna hate me.

667
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,811
I don't think so. It's Hunt.

668
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,436
Uh...

669
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:20,852
I took a pregnancy
test last night. I, um...

670
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,977
And I thought I might...

671
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,861
And, as I sat there
waiting for the result,

672
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,418
I just watched him get
more and more excited.

673
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,188
He wanted it so badly.

674
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,028
And the longer I sat
there, the more I felt like...

675
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:44,731
I was dying.

676
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,641
I couldn't breathe,
I couldn't move.

677
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,341
And when that
stick was negative,

678
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,626
Owen's heart broke.

679
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:00,646
And...

680
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:05,385
I was so relieved.

681
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,490
I could breathe again.

682
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,782
See.

683
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,920
Now look me in the eye and
tell me that he won't hate me.

684
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,041
Thank you.

685
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:44,185
Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
if I was weird earlier.

686
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,342
I was just...

687
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,255
I didn't know you were coming
back, so I was a little thrown.

688
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,279
Yeah. Yeah. I've
been thrown all day.

689
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,165
Yeah. But it is good to see you.

690
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,713
I saw that you went
into fetal medicine.

691
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,304
- That's very impressive!
- Yeah. Thank you.

692
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,536
I'm gonna get these
labs to Dr. Riggs.

693
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,743
- I will see you around.
- Bye.

694
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,632
You okay?

695
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,535
I can't stop thinking about it.

696
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,216
I watched Robbie stand
there and talk to his dad.

697
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,624
I mean, he was
fine. Then he wasn't.

698
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,499
Hi, baby.

699
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,356
- Just...
- April, it's secure, I'm sure.

700
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,995
I know, I know.

701
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,622
- I just wanted to double-check.
- Yeah.

702
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:51,341
One second.

703
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,332
Yep. Looks okay.

704
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,615
<i>Dr. Lair, 4612. Dr. Lair, 4612.</i>

705
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,772
DeLuca!

706
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,822
Hey, did you hear from
your lawyer about a trial date?

707
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:14,091
Yeah, it's coming
up soon. Goodnight.

708
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,515
Wait. Wait. What's up?

709
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,585
- Nothing.
- Try again. What's up?

710
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,598
We shouldn't talk
about the case anymore.

711
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:22,639
Wait. What?

712
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,224
I know you're talking
with Karev. I saw you.

713
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,392
And after all
that stuff you said

714
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,760
about how you guys
never talk anymore?

715
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,612
We were working
on a case in the clinic.

716
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,253
I didn't exactly have a choice.

717
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:40,083
What? You think I'm some
sort of double agent, and I'm...

718
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,807
No. No, I don't think...

719
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,312
You just... You
pick the bad guy.

720
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,710
Jo, the guy who hurts
you or hurts other people,

721
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,700
and... you deserve better.

722
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,038
Maybe you can't
see that, but I do.

723
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,167
When I see you
with him, I just...

724
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:03,146
Whatever, I... I got to go.

725
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,117
Hey, I'm about to head
out. You gonna be long?

726
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:15,486
I thought maybe, I'd throw
something on the grill, and...

727
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,356
No, I have a cervical spine
dislocation that just came up.

728
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,291
I will be a while.

729
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:22,626
Well, you know, I'm
not hungry. I can wait.

730
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,890
You shouldn't.

731
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,120
I'll be pretty late, so
don't wait up, okay?

732
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:38,909
Um, I'm sorry...

733
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,644
They were supposed
to tell you not to wait.

734
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:43,736
- I had a Whipple.
- I know. I waited anyway.

735
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,621
We need to talk.

736
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,425
You're right. We do.

737
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,162
Because, I'm not
firing Alex Karev.

738
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,359
You think this is lenient.

739
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:58,267
You think this is about
my personal feelings.

740
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,119
You're right.

741
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:03,417
You don't train a surgeon without
becoming personally involved.

742
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,824
At least, I hope not!

743
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,305
Now, I've made mistakes,
and those who trained me

744
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:11,275
afforded me the
opportunity to grow,

745
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,510
and I'm damn sure
continuing that tradition

746
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:15,251
with a surgeon as good as Karev!

747
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,121
So, Alex Karev stays
right where he is.

748
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,757
<i>When someone you
love is in physical danger...</i>

749
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,093
<i>finding the strength you
need to save them is easy.</i>

750
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,862
That's fine.

751
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,343
I'm sorry?

752
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,567
It's fine. Karev can
stay where he is.

753
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,464
We have a much bigger
problem than Karev.

754
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:36,873
After this morning, I started
looking into Alex's record,

755
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,355
and Ben Warren's,
and this Leah Murphy,

756
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,457
and all these people
who got second chances.

757
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,697
April Kepner, Meredith Grey.

758
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,861
And I wondered, why
did they need chances?

759
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,931
Why did they screw
up in the first place?

760
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,866
I'm sorry. I don't
see what you're...

761
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,319
We used to be the leading education
program on the whole West Coast.

762
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:59,562
So why would a Leah Murphy, fail
here only to thrive... somewhere else?

763
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,426
It's how we're teaching.

764
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,652
There is a fundamental flaw in
how we are teaching our residents.

765
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,422
And we have got to fix this.

766
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,019
- You and me.
- And Dr. Webber.

767
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,760
The Residency Program is
your husband's department.

768
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,031
I know. I know it is.

769
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,801
<i>But sometimes, the
threat isn't physical.</i>

770
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,537
<i>Sometimes, it goes deeper.</i>

771
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,676
<i>In which case, no
instincts can save you.</i>

772
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:35,280
<i>No superhuman strength.
No adrenaline rush.</i>

773
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:46,358
You didn't call, you didn't text, you
definitely didn't come home early.

774
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:48,423
I had to check on a patient.

775
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:52,415
- How did that go?
- Fine. She's still gonna die, though.

776
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,870
- How did court go?
- Fine. Not a big deal.

777
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,807
<i>You can't power your way
out from under the crashing car.</i>

778
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:04,410
I want waffle Sundays.

779
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,591
Am I supposed to
know what that means?

780
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:10,249
Well, every Sunday...
I want to do waffles,

781
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,997
like a family, all of us...

782
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:17,540
you, me, the kids, Pierce,
everybody, all together.

783
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,926
- Okay.
- I want to do that
as long as we can...

784
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,979
before, you know, I go away.

785
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,996
It's important to me.

786
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:32,738
- Okay.
- And Amelia. She should come, too.

787
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,774
You need to be nicer to
her. You need your sisters.

788
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,038
I'm not gonna always be
around. You're gonna need them.

789
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,467
<i>All you can do is sit...</i>

790
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,837
She talks so much.

791
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,406
So let her. Okay?

792
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,827
- Okay?
- Okay.

793
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,791
<i>And wait...</i>

794
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,740
Do I have to help
make the waffles?

795
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,004
That's my thing.
Stay out of the kitchen.

796
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,887
<i>And wish things were different.</i>
