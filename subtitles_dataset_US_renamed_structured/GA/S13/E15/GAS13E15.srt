1
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:09,719
<i>There's an old story of a
father who had two sons.</i>

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,356
<i>When he knew a civil
war was about to break out,</i>

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,030
<i>he sent one son to fight for
the North, and one to the South.</i>

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>He figured if he had
sons on both sides,</i>

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,338
<i>there'd be a better
chance one would survive.</i>

6
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,855
<i>Because when you fight a war at
home, the casualties are your neighbors...</i>

7
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,314
<i>your friends, your family.</i>

8
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,021
<i>Leaving you all alone.</i>

9
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,061
I need you to do something.

10
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:12,899
I told you I'd do it. Just
separate out the delicates.

11
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,090
Not laundry. My thing is fun.

12
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,887
I need you to clip an
aneurysm at the hospital.

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,951
- I'm on leave. Yeah, I
need you to be off leave.

14
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,509
- No.
- Please. Come on,

15
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,329
it's a sweet little old nun and
she needs open heart surgery,

16
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,031
but she can't have it until
her brain aneurysm is clipped.

17
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,335
It's so sad.

18
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,769
- Poor Sister Agnes.
- Don't "nun" me.

19
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,172
The nun detail was a
little bit much. But please.

20
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,442
Please, come on. I
need you. You're the best.

21
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,965
And don't tell me that
you don't miss the O.R.

22
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,492
Just one little clip, and you
can scratch that itch. Just...

23
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,139
One little clip.
You'll be in and out.

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,144
And I'll make sure that Owen
doesn't see you. I promise.

25
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,315
Give me ten minutes.

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,248
Morning. Good to have you back.

27
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,717
- Morning. Thank you.
- So, um, when I was chief...

28
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:05,741
Interim chief.

29
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,005
I took the liberty
of catching you up

30
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,523
on all your backlogged
resident reports,

31
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,859
department budgets,
supply orders, so...

32
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,377
- I was gonna do that.
- Of course, you were.

33
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,179
I just figured, you know, same
way you fill the tank with gas

34
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,654
- when you return someone's car.
- You stole the car.

35
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,241
You're welcome.

36
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,027
Ah. Look who's back.

37
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,576
Have to say, I thought
you'd last longer.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,394
- You folded quick.
- I didn't fold.

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,146
You're here, aren't you? And
the chief didn't fire Minnick.

40
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,499
Dr. Webber asked me to come
back. There was no folding.

41
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,803
If you say so.

42
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,724
If you're into the guy,
why not just be with him?

43
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,760
- Because I don't want to
be with him. Oh, come on.

44
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:48,645
Is it because of
Maggie? She'll get over it.

45
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,464
- No, I don't wanna be with him.
- Okay. You do, though.

46
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,172
But I don't.

47
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:59,613
<i>Pain Management to the ICU.
Pain Management to the ICU.</i>

48
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,951
- So, listen, are we cool?
- What do you mean,
"Are we cool?"

49
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,166
I don't want there to be
any problems with patients.

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,334
It's just...

51
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,620
are we cool, I mean,
to work together?

52
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:17,290
- We're cool.
- I had to ask. It's kids.

53
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,859
- We're cool.
- Okay. Good.

54
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:24,119
<i>Dr. Jacoby, 1011.
Dr. Jacoby, 1011.</i>

55
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,215
- The mattresses?
- Yes.

56
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,535
You need to replace every mattress
in every on-call room. Unacceptable.

57
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,103
He's not wrong.

58
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,957
These mattresses are lumpy, they're
misshapen, zero lumbar support.

59
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,759
Our surgeons need solid rest,

60
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,028
- not spinal damage.
- Noted.

61
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,981
You might tell Dr. Webber
that if he wants to sleep soundly,

62
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,101
he should come home
and sleep next to his bride.

63
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:50,006
I'll take this under advisement.

64
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,411
- New mattresses!
- Hey. You okay?

65
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,152
No. My back hurts.

66
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:59,833
Oh, and there's nothing like
having your dirty laundry aired

67
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,901
- for everyone to see.
- Hm, it's that bad, huh?

68
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,343
Yeah, as long as Minnick's
here, it's gonna stay bad.

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,142
I-I don't know what to do,
except maybe give up and give in.

70
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,562
No. No, that's not acceptable.
Everyone's behind you.

71
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,119
Everyone was behind me.

72
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,565
The longer Minnick's here,
the more people like her.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,767
And the more people like her...

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,236
Well, I'm behind you,
then, so... Hey, listen.

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,155
Why don't you stay at my
place? I have a guest room,

76
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,129
- and it's got
a very good mattress.
- I-It'll be fine.

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,802
Arizona, thanks for sticking
with me. You're a good friend.

78
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,573
We're losing ground.
Everybody loves Minnick.

79
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,425
I wouldn't say that. I
mean, who said that?

80
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,928
- And now Meredith.
- I stood up for him
and got suspended.

81
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,345
Yeah, and now you're
back. You rolled over.

82
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,315
- Because he told me
to come back!
- That's not what it looks like!

83
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,716
All right, you weakened
our position here.

84
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,187
Well, we don't have a position
if he is asking us to stop.

85
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,139
- Meredith has a point.
- The problem isn't Minnick.

86
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,623
The problem is that
her program is good.

87
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,526
And now everyone
knows it, including Richard.

88
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,311
You guys are unbelievable.
You're just gonna abandon him now?

89
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,578
- No, we're not.
- No.

90
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,531
Well, I'm not gonna do
that. I'm gonna fight for him.

91
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,998
- How?
- My mother's not the only Avery

92
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,272
in this hospital.

93
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:15,708
Seems like the colovesical
fistula closed off on its own after all.

94
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,250
No abdominal
reconstruction needed.

95
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,814
Good. I was hoping to avoid
having to call Jackson in.

96
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,466
Things still difficult at home?

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,551
I'm not sure I can
stay there anymore.

98
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,602
I mean, I want to.

99
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,622
It's been so easy
with Harriet, but...

100
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,592
But everything's so much harder
than it needs to be right now.

101
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:34,978
- I know.
- Yeah. And...

102
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,602
And what?

103
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,601
It's just embarrassing,
being demoted.

104
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,874
You were not demoted.

105
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,254
From chief of general surgery to
trauma attending? It looks like it.

106
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,230
April. April. A title is only as
good as the person who earned it.

107
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,811
Grey is very good, but
when she wasn't here,

108
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,153
the person they
turned to was you.

109
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,512
- Oh, I know...
- Do you?

110
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,951
Then act like it.

111
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,117
So, hey. Heads, he's Leo.

112
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,781
Let's just wait until
we know he's okay.

113
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,889
Oh, come on, stop. You agreed
that we'd decide with a coin toss.

114
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,570
I noticed a systolic murmur
at the post-birth exam.

115
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,338
It's probably nothing,
but I called just in case.

116
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,913
I'll check it out.
DeLuca, get a pulse ox.

117
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,651
Baby, our little guy is
gonna need a name.

118
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,532
Hey, definitely before school,
but probably before we leave here.

119
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,216
So...

120
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,925
Heads, he's Leo. Tails, August.

121
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,763
- Okay, why is the name
I like tails?
- Fine. Heads, he's August.

122
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,155
- Heads?
- August it is.

123
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,602
Pulse ox is slightly
below normal.

124
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,344
Yeah. Let's get some
labs and page Cardio.

125
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:55,674
Uh, what's
happening? Is he okay?

126
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:58,778
He's got a heart murmur. I need
to take him to get some tests.

127
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,122
I'll let you know
more as soon as I do.

128
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,874
- What's the little guy's name?
- Gus.

129
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,189
Gus.

130
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,966
Hey. You got a minute?

131
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,196
Uh, just got paged
to the pit. Can it wait?

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,614
- Thanks.
- I need to talk to you

133
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,733
- about this Minnick situation.
- What situation? She's doing great.

134
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,535
Don't pretend you don't
know what you did, Mom.

135
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,587
People have been fighting this
since the minute you brought her here.

136
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,756
- Bailey brought her here.
- At your urging.

137
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,708
And since I am the voice of
the Avery Foundation at this...

138
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,643
Wait. I'm sorry.
You're the what?

139
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,429
I'm the foundation's
representative on the board, right?

140
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,614
A position that you gave
me, that you made me take.

141
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:38,817
Yes, and you kicked and screamed
and whined every step of the way.

142
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,475
And then I took it on.

143
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,757
So I am the Avery of this hospital.
The foundation speaks through me.

144
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,293
The foundation
oversees, we guide.

145
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:48,761
We do not interfere
in hospital politics.

146
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,668
How can you say that to me?

147
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,883
You started this by effectively
ousting Richard Webber.

148
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,590
Which, by the way, our rank and
file finds completely unacceptable.

149
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,323
I'm gonna be making
the decisions from now on.

150
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,624
I'm gonna go to
the governing board,

151
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,531
I'm gonna get Richard
back in and Minnick out.

152
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,216
I'm going over your head.

153
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,415
I don't understand. He's never
been that interested in the foundation.

154
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,268
I know. He does not appreciate
our role, or the scope of it.

155
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:33,606
Seventy-seven hospitals nationwide,
forty-three full service clinics.

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,725
Not to mention the
Worldwide Health Initiative.

157
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,761
Oh, somebody's been
doing her homework.

158
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,196
I've just been curious.

159
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,687
Or maybe you just
like being in charge.

160
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,868
You know, the thing is...

161
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,986
- I was good at that job.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,656
I like doing that stuff, the
admin work, the scheduling.

163
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,941
Meredith doesn't even like it.

164
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,516
You know, I want you to see the
Avery Trauma Center in Chicago.

165
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,830
They do things very
differently than you do here.

166
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,332
- We should go.
- Absolutely.

167
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:00,716
I would love to see
how they run things.

168
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,974
No, honey. I want them
to see how you run things.

169
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,071
Oh, yeah. I'd love
that. Thank you.

170
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,335
Trauma One.

171
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,109
- What have we got?
- Turkey fryer accident.

172
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,311
Propane tank exploded.
Blew shrapnel everywhere.

173
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,031
His family's behind him, minor injuries,
but he caught got the brunt of it.

174
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,633
Full-thickness burns to the neck,
down the left side of his body,

175
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,101
extending into the perineum.

176
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,377
- Left leg partially degloved.
- One, two, three.

177
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,181
Suture kit and trauma dressing.

178
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,928
All right, check on that gauze.

179
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,647
Oh, wow.

180
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,149
His bowel is eviscerated.

181
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,551
I need to examine this
wound and the perineal burn.

182
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,935
- Somebody call Plastics!
- On it.

183
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,864
Yeah. So this kid
definitely has HLHS.

184
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,378
- Start him on PGE.
- Labs are back.

185
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:48,497
All righty, Gus. Let's
take a look at your labs.

186
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,283
- They landed on Gus, huh?
- How did their OB
not catch this?

187
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,636
Okay, DeLuca, we need to get
him on the transplant list ASAP.

188
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,729
Hold on. No, we're
gonna do a Norwood.

189
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,309
Well, I don't think so. He
has mitral valve regurg.

190
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,112
I don't think the little kid can
survive a full reconstruction like that.

191
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,456
I know he won't survive the
wait for a newborn donor heart.

192
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,822
He's stable for now. He
can tolerate a Norwood.

193
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,569
- So, what's next?
- Parents are freaking out.

194
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:11,976
We go talk to them next.

195
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,930
- Where did they take Dad?
- Let me check you out.

196
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,448
It's okay, Pammy.
It's gonna be okay.

197
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:25,718
Your fiancé just deep fried
our father! That is not okay!

198
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,470
- This is from a turkey fryer?
- It's the one thing

199
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,172
I know how to cook. I was just
trying to do something special.

200
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,042
You mean unforgettable? Like
"that time you killed my dad"?

201
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,479
- Pam! Come on! He didn't mean to!
- Rodney, Dad's leg melted off!

202
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,482
- You have no eyebrows!
- I'm so sorry, honey. So sorry.

203
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,317
- I know.
- Your arm has
a partial thickness burn.

204
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,851
You'll need to learn to
dress it while it heals.

205
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,575
I can help. How can I help?

206
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,273
Oh, I don't know, go back
in time when I told you,

207
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,257
"Deep fryers are
dumb" and listen to me!

208
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,577
Can you tell me
how my father is?

209
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,819
- Pam, I'm sorry.
- Maybe just stop talking.

210
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,849
Someone will come dress those
burns. And I'll go get an update.

211
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,540
All right, he's got a
lot of neck swelling.

212
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,792
Um, can you get me a
fiberoptic scope, just in case?

213
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,777
This wound extends deep.
The bladder is destroyed.

214
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,980
I need to get him in
an O.R. for a repair.

215
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,581
No, you can do the
bladder repair later.

216
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,167
I need to do an ex-lap with
an abdominal washout first.

217
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,702
Yeah, I can't even
see his vocal cords.

218
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,604
- Here. Let me try.
- No, I got it. I got it.

219
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,074
Okay. Warren, call up to the
O.R., tell them to place the patient

220
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,876
in lithotomy position
for a perineal evaluation.

221
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,978
Warren, let them know we
need a perc nephrostomy setup

222
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:28,080
and a possible ileal
conduit for reconstruction.

223
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,865
His small bowel is
sticking out of his abdomen.

224
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,217
What ileal conduit
are you talking about?

225
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,936
Jackson, the tendon is exposed.
He's gonna need a skin flap.

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,105
- No, no, that can wait.
- I'm just saying...

227
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,940
I know when flap coverage
is warranted and when it isn't!

228
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,130
And another bickering
family. Fantastic.

229
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,761
- Warren, did you say something?
- I said I'm gonna book an O.R.

230
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,062
- Okay, well, hop to it then.
- Hurry up.

231
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,046
- Get going, child.
- Come on, let's go.

232
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,421
Sister Agnes is good to go. It
went great. In, out, no problem.

233
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,740
- Feels good to be back, huh?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,348
Back at work.

235
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,602
I'm still not ready to see Owen.

236
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,099
I just, uh, don't know
what I would say to him.

237
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,975
Okay, well, I'm just riffing here,
but you could start with, "Hi, Owen."

238
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,009
Sorry. When you're
ready. No judgment.

239
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,228
Uh, could you just check the
hall so I can get outta here?

240
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,452
Yes, of course. Okay.

241
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,608
All clear. Go. Go, go.

242
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,659
It's called Hypoplastic
Left Heart Syndrome.

243
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,646
The left side of Gus's
heart is underdeveloped,

244
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,750
so it can't deliver oxygenated
blood to the rest of his body.

245
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,190
- Okay. So, what do we do now?
- He'll need surgery?

246
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,654
There are two options.
A heart transplant,

247
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,956
or an open-heart surgery
to reconstruct Gus's heart

248
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
called a Norwood. I
think we go with that.

249
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,012
And I think that we should consider
waiting for the heart transplant.

250
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,548
I'm concerned that your little
guy doesn't have the strength

251
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,366
to withstand a staged procedure.

252
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,019
- A staged procedure?
- Yeah. The Norwood is the first

253
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,937
of three separate surgeries
that will be performed

254
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:02,057
over the first three years of his life, as
opposed to just one for the transplant.

255
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,327
But, with a heart like Gus's, the
wait could be more time than he has.

256
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,096
Also, you're looking at a
lifetime of anti-rejection drugs.

257
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,916
As opposed to the strain
of multiple surgeries,

258
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,302
often resulting in a transplant
in the long run, anyway.

259
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,522
And in Gus's case, we have a bit of time
before his symptoms become intolerable.

260
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,107
I'm not willing to
accept that risk.

261
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,776
Okay, but he... he says that
Gus won't survive your thing, the...

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,428
- Norwood. And I think he can.
- Yeah, but he's a heart surgeon.

263
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,013
And I operate on
babies all the time.

264
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,683
I've seen more of these cases
than he has, I know how well they do.

265
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,552
Also, I'd rather
invest in a sure thing

266
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,088
than wait for a donor that
might not show up in time.

267
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,356
Okay, so you're just
saying that there's...

268
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,046
Okay, well, then
just tell us what to do!

269
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,960
My baby is dying, and I
don't know how to help him.

270
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,568
You're just confusing
us. Just... what do we do?

271
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,707
I think that we should

272
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,331
- just go with the transplant.
- Norwood.

273
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,120
Um...

274
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,622
You said that we
have some time, right?

275
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,441
What the hell, man? They're
overwhelmed, they just had a baby.

276
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:10,860
What, so they shouldn't
hear the whole story?

277
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,461
They don't need to
hear you argue with me.

278
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,413
Well, you should have heard me
out before you went running in there.

279
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,348
There's nothing to
hear. He's my patient.

280
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,767
He's a good candidate
for a Norwood.

281
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,335
- Well, I disagree.
- Or at least he is now.

282
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,679
He might not be once they
spend a bunch of time deciding.

283
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,389
DeLuca, let me know
when they're ready.

284
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:32,186
Call UNOS. Put that kid
on the cardiac transplant list.

285
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,750
I think Dr. Karev's really
into the Norwood idea.

286
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,536
Yeah, well, Dr. Karev's not making
the decision. The parents are.

287
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,805
And when they decide on a transplant,
I don't want to have missed out

288
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,224
on a heart because we
waited. Just put him on the list.

289
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,448
And don't tell Karev. I
don't want to hear about it.

290
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,243
The bladder isn't the
only thing at stake.

291
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,611
That's why I'm
saying I need to do...

292
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,063
I'm saying we do it first.
The patient's prepped.

293
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:07,149
- No. We delay
soft tissue coverage.
- No, it's a Gustilo type three.

294
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,718
- It's an obvious fix and flap.
- Not on a dirty wound like this.

295
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,653
Okay, we need to do a
delayed reconstruction,

296
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,138
not a primary bladder repair.

297
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,373
No, the reconstruction
should happen now...

298
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:15,807
We have a penetrating
wound to explore.

299
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,671
- before the tissues
become edematous.
- Okay, what about this?

300
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,779
Webber and Kepner
explore the wound

301
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:23,366
as Avery evaluates the burns to
determine the need for more coverage.

302
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,817
The other Avery can
do a perineal evaluation,

303
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,093
and after a full assessment,
it'll become clear how to proceed.

304
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:37,217
I just, you know... Minnick said that
we should work the problem with you.

305
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,422
Actually, Warren, that
should work. Thank you.

306
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,087
- What?
- You called it with Riggs.

307
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,433
- What do you mean?
- The guy's a snake.

308
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,237
- I didn't say that.
- He just made a mom cry.

309
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,957
Well, her kid's in the hospital.
There's a high probability of tears.

310
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:07,621
He thinks he's a cardio god or
something, like he knows everything.

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,828
When I'm the peds
guy, I know things,

312
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,572
if he would just listen. The guy's
a total snake, just like you said.

313
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,923
Well, I definitely
never said that.

314
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,504
Unfortunately, that's
all we have at this point.

315
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:20,605
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You're back!
- Oh, well, actually...

316
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,074
I'm so happy!

317
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,626
Dr. Minnick's method is awesome,

318
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,028
but I've really been
wanting to do it with you.

319
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,497
- Edwards...
- And I... wait. Stop. Hey.

320
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,282
Are you anti-Minnick?
Please don't be anti-Minnick.

321
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,634
- Stephanie!
- What? What?

322
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,618
- I'm not here. You didn't see me.
- Oh. Oh.

323
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,997
Would you mind just walking through
the ER to see if Owen is in there?

324
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,608
- No.
- Thank you.

325
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:43,045
No, I mean no. I have to work.

326
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,548
I don't want to get dragged
into your marriage again.

327
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,954
You know, boundaries.

328
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,842
- Right. Yeah, of course.
- Sorry.

329
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,143
Come back! Okay? Bye.

330
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,582
- Hi!
- Hi yourself.

331
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,445
How big is your stove?

332
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,064
I don't... I don't know
how to answer that.

333
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,250
I want to make pierogi for
you, but my stove sucks.

334
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,851
Oh, that sounds
nice. Uh, what is it?

335
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,704
- Something I do very well.
- Okay.

336
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,379
I don't have to stay or
anything. Just... pierogi.

337
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,868
Once you taste my pierogi,
you won't want anyone else's.

338
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:21,533
I've no idea what you just said,
but I'd like you to say much more of it.

339
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,119
- I'll see you around eight.
- Okay.

340
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,708
- I'll bring everything.
- Okay.

341
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,610
Let's divide the segment

342
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,252
and then I'll prepare
for a diverting colostomy.

343
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:38,016
Instead, actually, I think we can do
the primary bowel repair right here.

344
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,503
Kepner, you're no longer
running general surgery.

345
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,689
- So how about you let me
do my job?
- But she is running this case.

346
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:46,547
She brought in the trauma.
Her department, her patient.

347
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,850
Three-oh Vicryl for
bowel anastomosis.

348
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,970
I checked my
calendar for Chicago.

349
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,472
And I'm pretty booked
for the first two weeks,

350
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,691
but the weekend of
the 25th might work.

351
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,994
- Yeah, sounds good. All right.
There's an architectural boat tour.

352
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,613
Oh, I've done that.
It sounds boring,

353
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,464
- but it's actually fascinating.
- Oh, fun.

354
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,283
- What is happening?
- Weekend of the 25th,

355
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,385
I'll be out of town.
So you'll have Harriet.

356
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,788
- You two taking a vacation?
- It is not a vacation.

357
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:17,372
You're taking a boat tour, Mom.

358
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,556
If you're going to Chicago, you
really have to take that boat tour. It's...

359
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,396
We're visiting the Avery
Trauma Center there.

360
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,298
Trauma Center? Oh, why's that?

361
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,934
Is our trauma program
next on your chopping block?

362
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:35,142
I'm also getting
us <i>Hamilton</i> tickets.

363
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,915
- Yay!
- You're going to<i> Hamilton</i>
without me?

364
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,685
<i>Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.
Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.</i>

365
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,938
Hey. Oh, I'm starving.

366
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,158
I've been in this complex
sarcoma excision for seven hours.

367
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,261
And guess who got to dissect the
tumor from the vascular structure?

368
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,219
That's right. Me.

369
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,601
What's wrong? Is
there something wrong?

370
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,542
No. I, uh...

371
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,062
It's just...

372
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,742
I'm on a case with two attendings
who want different treatments

373
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,900
and have given me
competing instructions and...

374
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,287
I don't know what to do.

375
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,992
Well, you'll make the
right choice. You always do.

376
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,584
I gotta go.

377
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,087
Incoming MCC, I'm on it.

378
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,652
<i>Dr. Taylor to the
Instrument Room.</i>

379
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:56,460
<i>Dr. Taylor to the
Instrument Room.</i>

380
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,010
- MCC?
- Unhelmeted.

381
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,379
GCS of four. Intubated on the
scene. He's got an open skull fracture.

382
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,648
- Conscious at the scene?
- No.

383
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,988
He has decorticate
posturing. Page Neuro now.

384
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,640
Neuro's here.

385
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,362
Let's go, let's go!

386
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,565
Minnick's method doesn't
just get residents up to speed,

387
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,767
it gets them there faster.

388
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,668
Faster isn't better. Unless
you're cutting corners,

389
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,137
- or creating some kind
of factory.
- I'm doing no such thing.

390
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,522
- In your opinion.
- You know what?

391
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,524
This stitch that I just did?
No one else does it like this.

392
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,942
And do you know why?

393
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,327
'Cause Mark Sloan took the
time to teach me how to do it.

394
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,364
'Cause I watched him and I
watched him and I learned from him,

395
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:42,617
much in the same way so many
surgeons have learned from Dr. Webber.

396
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,776
Learned from his artistry. And you're
telling me what? Those days are over?

397
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,508
Dr. Webber makes artists
here. Dr. Minnick makes robots.

398
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:50,692
Three-oh silk, please.

399
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,644
Bringing Dr. Minnick
here was not the right call.

400
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,412
Okay, you know
what? To be clear,

401
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,132
that particular decision was made
by Bailey. Isn't that right, Warren?

402
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,767
Let's just leave me out of this.

403
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,502
Even if Minnick's program
was good, the way you two

404
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,137
went about implementing
the entire thing

405
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,239
had zero respect for the
history of this institution.

406
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,691
Certainly no respect
for Dr. Webber.

407
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,709
- Jackson, that's okay.
- I mean,
are you really telling me

408
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,312
this is good management, Mom?
You think this is good for morale?

409
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,064
Maybe if you hadn't
talked the entire staff

410
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,599
into forming a coup,
you might have listened.

411
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,585
- Patient is getting
coagulopathic.
- Mayo scissors.

412
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,104
And you know what? You
have no clue about management.

413
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,839
I almost forgot. You got
a new minion in the deal.

414
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,973
Oh, come on.

415
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,542
What is it you wanna
learn from my mom exactly?

416
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,894
How to get an entire hospital
to turn against you in a day or...

417
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,684
Jackson, stop it! Just stop it!

418
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:31,216
You keep saying, "I'm an Avery,
I'm an Avery!" But you're not,

419
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,301
not in the way
you're trying to be.

420
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:37,395
Title doesn't mean anything.
It's the person who owns it.

421
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:42,060
Yes, I took your father's
name, but it's what I did with it.

422
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,536
It's what I made with it.
That's what matters. You...

423
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,606
You are an outstanding surgeon.

424
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,220
He's too far gone for us to
do anything more tonight.

425
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,960
We should take him to the ICU,

426
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,640
start fresh tomorrow. Agreed?

427
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,065
- Yeah. We're done here.
- Yeah, this isn't working.

428
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,520
Those sutures should
control the bleeding,

429
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,405
but he's got a big open
skull fracture up here.

430
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,559
- FAST exam negative.
- Pupils are sluggish.

431
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,335
I didn't realize you were back.

432
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,216
There's no other obvious injuries. I'm
gonna need to see those trauma films.

433
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,935
I just stopped by,
uh, for some stuff.

434
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,487
- Stuff?
- Stuff.

435
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:45,207
I was shopping. Odds
and ends. I needed floss,

436
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,642
and realized I had a bunch here.

437
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,445
Then this guy pulled
up. Positive Babinski.

438
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,902
- Floss.
- Can't sleep without it.

439
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,965
Yeah. I know.

440
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,935
Labs are back.
Trauma films are clear.

441
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,654
Thank you, Edwards. Page
someone from Neuro, please.

442
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,257
What? Why? It's fine. I'm...

443
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,841
This looks like it's
gonna be an uphill climb,

444
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:04,976
and if you're not
actually back...

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,451
Owen, stop. Edwards,
show me this skull fracture.

446
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:20,142
I just spent the day trapped
on a case with my wife.

447
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,094
And Jackson. And April.

448
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,545
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

449
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,398
So, if I may, I would
love to take you up

450
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,822
on your offer after all,
and stay at your place.

451
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,087
Enjoy some good company,
and, get a good night's sleep.

452
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,957
- Oh, okay. Uh, tonight?
- If the offer hasn't expired.

453
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,426
Yeah. Well, I mean, I have a
date now. But I can cancel it.

454
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,062
- Oh, no, no, don't.
- No, no, no. I can. Listen.

455
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,497
I just made it today.

456
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,699
And I probably shouldn't
be doing it anyway.

457
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,468
- So I can cancel.
- No. I wouldn't dream of it.

458
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,137
- You go have fun.
- Are you sure?

459
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,939
Yeah. I've got a patient
who's touch and go.

460
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,796
I should probably stick
around here anyway.

461
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,666
So, give me the dirt tomorrow.

462
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,813
- Oh, you're still here?
- Still here?

463
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,295
Uh, I got pulled onto a case.

464
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,247
Oh, okay. Well, Sister
Agnes is recovering well.

465
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:18,801
Her neuro scans
are perfect, great job.

466
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:19,952
- Thanks.
- Thank you

467
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,403
- for coming in this morning.
- No problem. Thanks, Pierce.

468
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,476
So you've been
here since morning?

469
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,280
Look at that, the scans are up.

470
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:42,996
Hey, first day back, and
pulling an all-nighter. Ambitious.

471
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,736
- What's going on?
- Why are you being a jerk?

472
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:53,752
- What?
- Alex said
you were being a jerk.

473
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:57,160
- Oh, of course. He tattled.
- Let me make something
very clear to you.

474
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,899
If you want to get anywhere with
me, messing with Alex is not the way.

475
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,562
Do not contradict
him in front of patients,

476
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,615
and please don't speak
to him like he's an idiot.

477
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,939
Okay. Back it up. Get anywhere
with you. So you admit it.

478
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,319
- Admit what?
- There's somewhere
to get with you.

479
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,705
Don't change the subject.
I'm talking about Alex.

480
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:17,292
Karev is pissed because I'm giving a
really sick baby a chance at a miracle.

481
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,732
He's giving it a Band-Aid.

482
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,046
Maybe he just wants to
play it safe, I don't know.

483
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,497
But whatever it is,
I really don't care.

484
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,399
- Why don't you care?
- Because I'm right!

485
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,623
And I don't have
to keep justifying...

486
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:28,009
Forget it.

487
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,704
Wait. Where are you going?
We're having a conversation.

488
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,161
No. I'm done.

489
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,331
- So you're just gonna walk away?
- Damn right! I'm a jerk!

490
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,205
But when your father
began to decompensate...

491
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,954
We decided to hit pause,
give him some time to rest

492
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,106
and get stronger
before we continue.

493
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,580
Oh, God. Oh, God.

494
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,794
- Can we see him?
- We? Who is we?

495
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,803
- Jim!
- I meant you guys, obviously.

496
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,350
- Can they see him?
- That's not really
a good idea, Jim.

497
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,953
He's not out of the woods
yet. I'd really like him to rest,

498
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,038
so we can go back in tomorrow.

499
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,108
Right now, you guys should just get
some food, get some rest yourselves.

500
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,582
No, we aren't going anywhere.

501
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,986
Tell you what, you guys stay
here, and I'll bring us in some food.

502
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,705
Food?

503
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,858
You're gonna get us food? You?

504
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,011
Rodney...

505
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,553
Maybe you should go.

506
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,739
Sure.

507
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,770
Okay, I'll come back in a bit,

508
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,234
- just shoot me a text and...
- No.

509
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:39,513
I know you meant
well, but my father is...

510
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:41,915
I can't.

511
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,741
It's all I'll ever think
about when I look at you.

512
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,439
Oh.

513
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,078
- Oh. Rodney...
- You should just go.

514
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,391
Okay, this guy's got
an epidural hematoma

515
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:15,210
and diffuse axonal injury.

516
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,662
Surgery may not
help, but we can try.

517
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,987
Obviously, even if
it is a lost cause...

518
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,479
You've been
working? Doing cases?

519
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:31,348
No.

520
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,355
Were you planning on
seeing me at all today?

521
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,103
No.

522
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,227
So you're just hiding.

523
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,535
- Is this your first time
coming in?
- Yes!

524
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:54,665
I-I came in as a favor
to Maggie. That's it.

525
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,674
Patient's prepped. We're ready.

526
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,864
You should leave.

527
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,918
- We're scrubbing in.
- You said it yourself. It's a lost cause.

528
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,620
Well, page another
trauma surgeon, then,

529
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:17,404
if you don't wanna
go in. I'm going in.

530
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,346
There are no lost causes.

531
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,190
I'm late, I know. Did
I miss the window?

532
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,525
No. No, I'm good. I'm ready.

533
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,228
Oh, no. You're tired.

534
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,230
- Why would you say that?
- 'Cause you were sleeping.

535
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:46,306
- And because I'm tired.
- I'm so, so tired.

536
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:50,054
I'm wiped. Residents are a
bottomless pit of questions.

537
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:53,008
And it's cute, but it's
also unbelievably draining.

538
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,250
Well, why don't
we rest a minute.

539
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,781
Like, just for...
just for a minute.

540
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,115
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

541
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,056
- Then rally.
- Mm-hmm. One minute.

542
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,492
Forty-five seconds.

543
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,894
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hello?

544
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,293
Okay, so O.R.
Seven if it's available.

545
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,794
What's going on?

546
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,412
I've got good news. Great news.

547
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,880
So try not to let
it piss you off.

548
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,150
- Just tell me.
- We got a heart
for the Endris baby.

549
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,835
- A perfect match.
- How?

550
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,003
- He's not even on the list.
- I put him on the list.

551
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,057
Without telling me?
Without the parents' consent?

552
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,931
Did you know about this?

553
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:48,071
- Well, if he wasn't
on the list...
- Karev,

554
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,447
this is a good thing.

555
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,782
Okay, all we gotta do now is
have an awkward conversation

556
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,441
with the parents and
then we save a kid's life.

557
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,817
You're unbelievable.
You know that?

558
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,993
I can talk to the
family with you.

559
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,596
Do you want to be married to me?

560
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,833
- Yes.
- Then why won't you talk to me?

561
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,639
- I'm not ready.
- For what?

562
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:29,053
- The fight.
- There doesn't have to be one.

563
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,938
There does. We are
on opposite sides of this.

564
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,524
We both want
completely different things.

565
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,829
We can't both have what we
want. So there will be a fight,

566
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,617
and somebody has to win.

567
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,472
Or no one wins.

568
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,343
I'll talk to the family.

569
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,262
Hold on.

570
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,582
This is why you called me all
the way in here at this hour?

571
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,201
Look, he went behind
my back. He lied to me.

572
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,119
- Hey. What's going on? We ready?
- Hold on.

573
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:02,086
Look, I don't trust him.

574
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,694
I don't want him
in the O.R. with me.

575
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,523
Uh... What?

576
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,442
Dr. Karev has raised a
complaint against you.

577
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,727
- Oh, come on! He
says that you've been...

578
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,214
We had a disagreement
about treatment. That's all.

579
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,998
- He would have survived
the Norwood.
- Or he wouldn't.

580
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,950
Now we don't have to
risk killing him to find out.

581
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,169
No, you just killed some other
kid by directing that heart here.

582
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:20,193
- Congrats on that.
- All right, all right! Enough!

583
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,698
The only fight here is
to keep this child alive.

584
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,797
To fix his heart. You
won. You won that battle.

585
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:31,399
Now, finish the freaking
war. You two figure out a way

586
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:34,535
to work together long enough
to put that heart into that baby.

587
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,839
Understood?

588
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,045
What happened? Blood
was seeping out of the vac

589
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,180
and his pressure was dropping.

590
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,664
So they rushed him up
here to find the bleeder.

591
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,333
- Have lap pads ready.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's...

592
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:51,619
Got it. Yeah, I got it.

593
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,906
- Sorry, I was right here. So I...
- No, no, no. Nice work, Warren.

594
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,676
- Go ahead.
- Can you see the source
of bleeding?

595
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,461
Uh, yes, yes. I see it,
it's, it's in the mesentery.

596
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,604
DeBakeys at a right angle,
please. Should I keep going, sir?

597
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,805
- Here. I'll suction for you.
- Really.

598
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,741
The patient's a little unstable.
You don't want to take the lead?

599
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,892
Well, I don't think I need
to. I think Warren's got this.

600
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,633
So why are we even here?

601
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,790
Warren? You feel
like you got this?

602
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,726
Yes, sir. Two-oh silk, please.

603
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,913
More laps.

604
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,765
- You called UNOS behind my back?
- I did.

605
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,111
- I thought we were cool.
- We are.

606
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,048
You went behind my back
when I specifically said...

607
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,573
Look, it's like
you said. It's kids.

608
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,896
So what was that?

609
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,577
- Excuse me?
- You're just giving in

610
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,029
to this new way of teaching?

611
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,870
I was teaching a capable
resident. Same as I always have,

612
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:45,666
- long before Minnick.
- No.

613
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,208
No, in there that
was... that was different.

614
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,006
Look, we can win
this thing. All right?

615
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,425
There are strings that I can
pull, you know? I have a voice.

616
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,145
Jackson, don't do it. It'll tear
you and your mother apart.

617
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,514
Tear us apart? What about
you? You're her husband.

618
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,165
You don't think this whole
thing is pushing you away?

619
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,334
You don't know the first thing about
my relationship with your mother.

620
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:04,991
And you don't know my mother.

621
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,071
I mean, you don't know
this is what she does.

622
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:08,856
She finds a weakness,
and she exploits it.

623
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,226
She's gonna fight you all the way
here. She's gonna fight and fight...

624
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,751
We fell in love fighting
over this hospital.

625
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,817
- We'll be okay.
- Yeah, except she's
not gonna stop.

626
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,368
All right? She's gonna
fight until she wins,

627
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,460
no matter the
cost. Don't let her.

628
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,646
Well, your father's
out of surgery.

629
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,921
His recovery is going
to be a long haul,

630
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,757
- but he will recover.
- Oh, thank God.

631
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,791
Okay. I can take you to see him.

632
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,063
What are you doing?

633
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,794
It's just that... Jim loves Dad.

634
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,498
- You're kidding, right?
Pam, it was an accident.

635
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:10,406
- Uh, which way?
- Oh, there.

636
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,052
How could you do that?

637
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,334
How can you do this to
somebody you care about?

638
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,570
Jackson, you need to
stop this foolishness.

639
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,355
What? I just need to know.

640
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,057
I need to know if business is really that
much more important to you than family.

641
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,759
This has nothing
to do with family.

642
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,199
Of course it has
to do with family!

643
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,753
Look, I get it, all right,
business is business.

644
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:59,755
If you need to fire someone
or replace them, do it.

645
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,076
But if it's someone
you love, you just...

646
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,178
Does that mean nothing to you?

647
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,378
Jackson, you and I are
two very different people.

648
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,298
Yeah, no kidding. I've never been
happier about that fact in my life.

649
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:17,618
You have never shown one
ounce of interest in this business.

650
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,487
- That's fine. Fine.
- Yeah, that's fine,

651
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,910
because you have
April now, right?

652
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:22,707
Yeah, 'cause you can
finally get that Avery

653
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,531
- that you always wished
that I was.
- No! No, son.

654
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,678
No, you've always
been your own man.

655
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,380
You've always made your own way.

656
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:32,355
Nothing could make a
parent more proud than that.

657
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:39,845
Nothing. I am so happy
with who you are. I am.

658
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,833
I just wish you were, too.

659
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,219
- Saved the baby.
- Oh. Excuse me?

660
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:06,272
The baby, the one
that Karev and I were...

661
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,192
- Anyway, the kid's alive.
- Oh, well, that's great news.

662
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,679
Okay, now you're
the one being the jerk.

663
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,742
Because Alex
was right about you.

664
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,193
Oh, yes. Of course.

665
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:19,330
'Cause everybody's always
in your ear, telling you

666
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:22,166
- what to think about me. Maggie...
- Nobody tells me what to think.

667
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,268
Okay, good. 'Cause I
don't want their opinion.

668
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,753
Okay? I care about
what you think.

669
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,772
About you? Actually,
I think a lot of things.

670
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,747
No, no, no. No
banter. No more quips.

671
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,449
I'll tell you what I think.

672
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,616
I think about you.

673
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:41,041
A lot. Okay? I can't stop.

674
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,359
I am telling you, I am in.

675
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,729
If you are. I am in this.

676
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,492
So I'm just... I'm just
gonna ask you outright.

677
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:53,833
What do you think?

678
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:57,941
Actually, don't answer.

679
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:01,928
Not till you know.

680
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,518
And when you do,
just... give me a call.

681
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,530
What time is it?
Did we fall asleep?

682
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,796
I don't know. I feel rested.

683
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,140
Oh, my God, that's
because it's almost morning.

684
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,339
Um...

685
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,876
So I guess we just
spent the night together.

686
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,563
I guess we did.

687
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,501
Oh, uh...

688
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,753
I'm sorry. Sorry.

689
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:53,963
<i>War isn't civil.</i>

690
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,251
<i>You pick sides and
defend them. You attack.</i>

691
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:09,629
<i>You hurt people. You get hurt.</i>

692
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:12,281
How was it today?

693
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:16,185
- Bad as you thought it would be?
- Kind of.

694
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,307
We need to talk.
We have to, but...

695
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,728
No, you don't. At
least, not tonight.

696
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,249
You weren't even supposed
to be here today. Come on.

697
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,271
<i>You fight and you
fight and you fight.</i>

698
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,490
<i>To what end?</i>

699
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,881
Come home.

700
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,896
<i>What are we fighting against?</i>

701
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,869
<i>What are we fighting for?</i>

702
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,992
Just get a good night's sleep.

703
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,353
I never wanted to come
between the two of you.

704
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,704
You and Jackson.
I never wanted that.

705
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:10,456
I know.

706
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,593
<i>When is it time to just
quit all this nonsense...</i>

707
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,631
Well, good night.

708
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,269
<i>And simply...</i>

709
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,471
<i>surrender.</i>

710
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,939
- That's one nasty throat tumor.
- Oh, God.

711
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:52,248
- En bloc resection?
- Maybe. Maybe.

712
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,536
Got a patient up at the
Avery hospital in Montana.

713
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,439
I might have to go
out there for a consult.

714
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,189
- Huh.
- "Huh" what?

715
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,174
I'm going to an Avery hospital,

716
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,426
now you're going
to an Avery hospital.

717
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,897
- Oh, come on, really?
- Yeah, it's not that.

718
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,050
Are you... are you
jealous? Is that it?

719
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,435
Jealous of my mom
manipulating you? No.

720
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,192
Oh, stop.

721
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:22,442
I'm not some puppet.

722
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,665
I have my own brain. I
have my own opinions.

723
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,695
Working with your
mom and the foundation,

724
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,680
it's full of
opportunities for me.

725
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:32,064
And I get that you never
wanted that, and that's fine.

726
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:34,941
- But she sees something in me.
- All right, I'm going to bed.

727
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,622
What is going on with you?

728
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,658
Nothing's going on with
me. Just leave it alone.

729
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,832
- Jackson, I...
- It's not your business!

730
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:48,895
Good night.
