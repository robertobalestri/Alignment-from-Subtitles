1
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,634
<i>There's a reason the punch line</i>

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,775
<i>to so many doctor
jokes start with,</i>

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,605
<i>"I've got good news
and bad news."</i>

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,143
Bad news. The
air-conditioner coil is broken.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,666
- And?
- And, it's hot.

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,932
That's all. There is no more.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,400
Come on, it's
freaking fall already.

8
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,101
It's global warming already.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,391
Close the fridge.

10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,161
- Zola!
- Can you fix it?

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,663
Can I fix it?

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,899
I am a heart surgeon.

13
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,995
Right, I can fix anything.

14
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:37,631
No, I fix people.

15
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:39,816
That's an air
conditioner. You fix it.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,135
I don't want to screw up
my hands. I'm a surgeon, too.

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,087
- Eh.
- What do you mean "Eh"?

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,811
- You work in a clinic.
- Shut up.

19
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,373
Close the fridge!

20
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,442
Can we just get the hell
out of this sweat box already?

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,617
Gladly. Zola, Bailey!

22
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,622
<i>Often, the bad news is so bad
when something good comes along</i>

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,507
<i>we tend to go a
little overboard.</i>

24
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,476
It's a glorious day
is it not, Dr. Grey?

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,013
Well, I could do with 20 degrees
cooler and an air-conditioner repairman.

26
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,648
It's the kind of day
when people say,

27
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,683
"Dr. Bailey, why did
you become a doctor?"

28
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,268
you think of a
day like this one.

29
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:16,869
Ask me why it's a glorious day.

30
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,838
Do you really need me
for this conversation?

31
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:21,007
I have a liver
transplant for a patient

32
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:24,411
who's been waiting
forever on the UNOS list.

33
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,863
Patient is a sweet old grandma.

34
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,700
Do you know how many people
pushing 80 get livers, Grey?

35
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,936
Not many people make
it to the top of that list.

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,172
Not many people have
Miranda Bailey in their corner,

37
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:40,799
but this one does and so today, I
am Ed McMahon with a big check.

38
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,963
It's a glorious day.

39
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,406
<i>Dr. Reed to Medical Records.
Dr. Reed to Medical Records.</i>

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,912
Oh, hey, you're back.

41
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:57,327
Yeah. Of course, I'm
back. Why wouldn't I be?

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,145
No, I mean, you're back early.

43
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,664
Nope 29th. Always been the 29th.

44
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,299
Well, then I have
good news for you.

45
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,625
You still get three days with your
baby because today's the 26th.

46
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:09,255
Nope. 29th, see?

47
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,773
- Really?
- Oh, trust me.

48
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,292
I have been looking
forward to this day.

49
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:15,645
I mean, it's been great
and I love my baby...

50
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,515
but God, I missed work
and talking to people

51
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,854
who can actually talk back.

52
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,194
Talking to yourself
is overrated.

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Hello?

54
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,496
Excuse me.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,040
And I'm still talking to myself.
"Great to have you back, Kepner."

56
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

57
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,113
- Good morning.
- Morning.

58
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,593
Edwards. What are you doing?

59
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,425
I was inputting data into
Dr. Shepherd's amygdala hijack study.

60
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,812
Or you can scrub in with me
on a massive cardiac myxoma.

61
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,082
It's a very difficult procedure. I
need the best resident I can get.

62
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:56,520
I'm sorry. The best resident?
How is she the best resident?

63
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,209
You weren't
supposed to hear that.

64
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:00,239
- You up for it?
- How is that a question?

65
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,396
Let's go.

66
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,811
The best resident? What the
hell? Does everyone say that?

67
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,802
Come on define best.

68
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:08,787
DeLuca you're with me.

69
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,370
Oh, Chief, I'm free if you want
a senior resident over an intern.

70
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,072
I need DeLuca. That's
why I said DeLuca.

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,096
DeLuca move.

72
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,862
Here. Get up to speed.

73
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:25,664
- I think I'm on O.B. today, actually.
- You're with me, now.

74
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,500
I can do that. I have power.

75
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:31,093
Okay that's... Oh,
wait, am I in trouble?

76
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,506
You've had a rough few weeks.

77
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,927
I thought you'd like some unmitigated joy,
so today you're going to be Ed McMahon!

78
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,879
I don't know who that is.

79
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,934
Now see that makes me feel
old. I just said I was giving you joy.

80
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,003
Do you really want
to make me feel old

81
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,056
in response to my joy giving?
Do you think that's wise?

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,509
Do you think that will make
me more likely to give you joy?

83
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,434
- No.
- No, DeLuca. No, it will not.

84
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,070
You are quite young.

85
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,341
I'm a baby and Ed
McMahon is a god.

86
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,178
And here comes the joy.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,266
My hero!

88
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,333
Now, hold on. Hold on.

89
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,219
Let's just make some
room so the doctors can sit.

90
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,472
The poor folks have
been on their feet all day.

91
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,807
We're fine. No, Lily,
I'm not taking your seat.

92
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,850
Well, then we're not listening.
Oh, come on, rest your doggies.

93
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,982
- Get over here.
- All right.

94
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,006
Okay.

95
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,774
I knew you wouldn't
want to take that off.

96
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:42,718
- Did I tell you?
- You were right.

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,428
I'm gonna have
something for you, too,

98
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,897
but today my hand's
just a little bit shaky.

99
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,016
That's okay. I wasn't
really expecting anything.

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,318
Well, you're gonna
get snickerdoodles

101
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,170
whether you were
expecting them or not.

102
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,874
- Samantha.
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,414
- Ta-da.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,477
- Dr. DeLuca,
you want to present?
- Oh, yes.

105
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,015
- June Crowley...
- No, call me Granny June, honey.

106
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,501
- Everybody does.
- Granny June Crowley.

107
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,069
Class 3, MELD 20,

108
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,887
end stage liver disease,
scheduled to receive

109
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,675
a transplant today after
waiting, wow, three years.

110
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,226
Three years.

111
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,362
Donor liver arrives at 16:30.

112
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,607
This time tomorrow you
are gonna be a new woman.

113
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,911
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,593
Well, I feel blessed

115
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:37,002
having the world's nicest
doctors taking care of me.

116
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,657
Karen.

117
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,842
He's a hottie, right?

118
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,290
No, he's a hottie.

119
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,998
Oh, my God, Granny, stop.

120
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,536
But, yes.

121
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,930
So, don't be shy.
Give him a hug.

122
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,488
Well, heck, I'll give him a hug.

123
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:03,512
See?

124
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,926
Granny's gonna
get a liver today!

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,390
- Yes!
- Yes, she is!

126
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,300
How can I help?

127
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,535
Chelsea here took a
run in the triple-digit heat.

128
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,704
Motorists found her collapsed
by the side of the road.

129
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,862
Core body temp... 40.2.

130
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,527
EKG looks fine. It's a
clear-cut case of heat stroke.

131
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,231
She'll need to be cooled
down and admitted.

132
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:30,166
Wilson call ICU. I'm
gonna need CBCs, LFTs,

133
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,417
- and a CK level.
- Okay.

134
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,075
We should get myoglobin
levels on blood and urine.

135
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:38,207
Chelsea, we're gonna take you upstairs
and try to get this temp down okay?

136
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,260
Why are all these
people here? Where am I?

137
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,312
Chelsea, you're in the hospital.
You got a little overheated.

138
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,482
- Is there someone
we can call for you?
- My sister.

139
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,189
She's my emergency
contact in my phone.

140
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,370
All right, let's get her
on the cooling blanket.

141
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,705
I'll grab one.

142
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,769
Try to hang in there, Chelsea.

143
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,377
Pierce says your
air conditioner died.

144
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,018
I thought maybe I could help.

145
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:05,034
- You can fix an air conditioner?
- No, I don't need to.

146
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,385
Mine's not broken,

147
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,156
and I'm willing to share it
with a colleague in need.

148
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,780
See I'm, I'm a giver.
See it's my weak spot.

149
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,478
That's not an offer
a colleague makes.

150
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,880
We're just talking
about the weather.

151
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,832
Colleagues talk
about the weather.

152
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,605
You need a cooling blanket.

153
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:27,229
I'm gonna get her.

154
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,059
Oh, hi.

155
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,390
Hi.

156
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,429
What do you need?

157
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,649
Cooling blankets.

158
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,837
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

159
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,409
Really? 'Cause you
look super sketchy.

160
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,341
Close the door.

161
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,517
You're not looking
for drugs, right?

162
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,247
- No. Meredith!
- Oh. Well, I don't know.

163
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,666
I mean, I'm supposed
to ask if I care, right?

164
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,973
I'm pregnant.

165
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,969
Congratulations!

166
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,271
I didn't even know you
were trying. That's wonderful.

167
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,706
We just started.

168
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,076
Oh, my goodness,
I'm thrilled for you guys.

169
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,095
- Owen must be thrilled.
- I don't know when to tell him.

170
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,030
I don't want to get his
hopes up until I'm sure.

171
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,355
He's really excited about this.

172
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,722
You just think you're pregnant?

173
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,662
I'm late. I'm never late. Never.

174
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,895
So, this isn't real?

175
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,385
I can't find the freaking
pregnancy tests.

176
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,566
Wait. I hugged you and you
haven't even peed on a stick yet?

177
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,789
I can't find the sticks.

178
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,258
Tell Owen now or
later. That's your call.

179
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,565
Tell me when it's real.

180
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:14,903
Hi.

181
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,756
What?

182
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,539
Do you have a minute?

183
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,407
Oh, hey. Bring a
Daughter to Work Day?

184
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,959
Yeah, it's April's
first day back,

185
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,860
but I got paged for an
emergency hand de-gloving.

186
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,412
Guy's got his hand
caught in a metal press.

187
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,864
Got to get her to the
daycare. You seen April at all?

188
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,866
I saw her in the pit.

189
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,435
Hey, you want me to
take Harriet up there?

190
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,055
- No, no, I wouldn't ask.
- Kepner's busy. I'm free.

191
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,924
- I'm happy to help...
- That would be
really great actually.

192
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,092
Thank you. Hang on.

193
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,750
I just want to get in there
'cause this poor guy just came in.

194
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,181
Okay, just walk her
around for like 15 minutes

195
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:51,467
and just get her to sleep, you know,
before you take her to the daycare.

196
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,171
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

197
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,906
- Did you need me for something?
- What?

198
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,931
- I said, did you need me
for something?
- Later. It'll wait.

199
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,599
What?

200
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,940
You can't just
steal my resident.

201
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,880
She's a resident
not your resident.

202
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,588
The best resident.

203
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,407
- Your words.
- She's mine. You can't have her.

204
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,205
- You can't say that.
- She doesn't belong to anyone.

205
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,523
Also, standing right here.
I can absolutely hear you.

206
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,943
That thing you need to do,
you don't need Edwards for that.

207
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,861
- So, we're good then?
- No, we are not good.

208
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,546
- Meredith. What?
- Did you tell Owen yet?

209
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,021
I tried to but he
already had a baby.

210
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,242
What's going on?

211
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,590
She's late.

212
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,090
Meredith, Edwards is right here.

213
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,607
Oh, now you're
aware I can hear you.

214
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,876
Oh, my God, you're
pregnant? Oh, my God!

215
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,146
No "Oh, my Gods", and no
hugging until she pees on the stick.

216
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,199
I'm so happy for you.

217
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,117
Can I have Edwards then?

218
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,959
No. No, you can't.

219
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,155
Yes, of course.

220
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,994
Hey, hey. I need
to get you into bed.

221
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,146
I beg your pardon?

222
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,864
You can't leave. You've
barely been hydrated.

223
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,282
I'm surprised you're
still on your feet.

224
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,717
- Nurse...
- Wait, wait, no.

225
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,558
I'm not Chelsea. I'm
Chandler, her sister.

226
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:18,794
We're twins.

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes.

228
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,512
I just got that, yeah.

229
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,048
Chelsea, why would you even
go for a run on a day like this?

230
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,756
'Cause I'm not a wimp.

231
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,809
That would sound cooler
if you weren't hospitalized.

232
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,122
She's just dehydrated, right?

233
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:41,076
Unfortunately, Chelsea's heat stroke
has caused her to develop a condition

234
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,779
that's compromised her liver.

235
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,063
Compromised?

236
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,798
Her liver is shutting down.

237
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,567
We are treating the
symptoms aggressively,

238
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,791
but so far, the liver
is not responding.

239
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,254
What does that mean?

240
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,318
Worst case it means
she'll need a liver transplant.

241
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,910
I can be her donor, right?

242
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,712
No, stupid. You need your liver.

243
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,465
Actually, we'd only take
a portion of hers for you.

244
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,068
See, dummy? I told you I
can give you a piece of mine.

245
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,286
And it'll be exact same match.

246
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,204
We're like the
same person twice.

247
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,656
We're the same everything.

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,892
Just test me, please.

249
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,978
We're not quite there
yet but, yes, okay.

250
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,922
Wilson, let's get
her tested, okay?

251
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,617
- Trade places?
- You wish.

252
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,690
When we were kids
and we got in trouble

253
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,677
we had this joke that you
could call a "trade places"

254
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,030
and the other one
would go get yelled at.

255
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,553
And you had to do it.

256
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,488
Yeah.

257
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,186
Chelsea? What's
happening to her?

258
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,306
Wilson, she's seizing.
Get her on her side.

259
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,763
I'm right here.

260
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,110
Chandler, you need
to step away right now.

261
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,578
- I'm right here, Chelsea!
- You don't want to see this.

262
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,762
Get her out of here.

263
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,667
- Chelsea. Chelsea.
And let's push lorazepam.

264
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,902
So, what do you think?

265
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,788
She's fine. She's crying.

266
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,322
Take her to daycare.
Make her their problem.

267
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,958
Avery told me to take
her when she was asleep

268
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,543
and she won't go to sleep
and she won't take her bottle

269
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,894
and she has a clean diaper.

270
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,047
Maybe it's the heat.
It's pissing me off.

271
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,131
So I should take
her someplace cool?

272
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,582
No, you should
take her to daycare.

273
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,885
Here, let me see.

274
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,523
Okay, all right.
What did you do?

275
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,747
Nothing. Maybe it's you.

276
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,594
- What do you mean
"maybe it's me"?
- I don't know.

277
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,480
Babies can tell when
you're tense or freaked out.

278
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,636
It freaks them out.

279
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,560
Maybe you're not a baby guy.
Babies just don't like some guys.

280
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,832
It's okay. The bad man's gone.

281
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,719
I'm a baby guy. You
can see that, right?

282
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,323
You like me.

283
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,819
You like me.

284
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,504
Andrew Billings, 59.

285
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,608
Admitted for resection
of cardiac myxoma.

286
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,025
6.2 centimeters
in the left atrium.

287
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,778
Otherwise healthy
with an ASA score of 1.

288
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,282
She's gonna help
dig out my ticker?

289
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,432
- You any good?
- The best.

290
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,917
Reputedly.

291
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,090
She'll do.

292
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,855
Let's skip to the
possible complications.

293
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,273
- Okay.
- Again?

294
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,579
Legally, we have to.

295
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,811
Excessive bleeding,
coronary artery spasm,

296
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:15,397
myocardial infarction,
valve regurg,

297
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,733
extreme risk of stroke
due to tumor debris

298
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,920
- or emboli to the brain.
- We get it. It's a dumb idea.

299
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,155
But, what else were
you gonna do today?

300
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,740
Andy was a shuttle commander.

301
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,076
He's been shot into
space on a big missile, so...

302
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,340
Wasn't so tough. No
traffic that morning.

303
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,353
- So, you're okay with risk.
- Yeah.

304
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,450
Besides, she tells
me without the surgery

305
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,124
I'll be dead inside a month.

306
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,144
That is true.

307
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,929
So, let's buckle in, right?

308
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,082
Let's do this.

309
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,517
Thanks.

310
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,918
She's stable.

311
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,970
I just got off the
phone with UNOS.

312
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,889
They did give her 1-A status,

313
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,008
which means she's
at the top of the list.

314
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,077
- What about me?
- I thought you were
testing for my...

315
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,813
- Yes, your results
did come back.
- So fast?

316
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,482
That mean good...
It's good news?

317
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,552
Chandler, you cannot
be a donor for your sister.

318
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,576
I can't?

319
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,991
Because you're pregnant.

320
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,583
- Are... are you serious?
- Yes.

321
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,165
Sorry if that's not what
you wanted to hear.

322
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,334
No, no, it's, it's good news.

323
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,558
It's the best news that
you could've given me.

324
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,913
My husband and I... It's good.

325
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,316
Just means I won't be
able to save my sister.

326
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,134
- Hey.
- Oh, can't talk.

327
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,054
My patient's seized.
She's in acute liver failure.

328
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,422
Why do you smell like Christmas?

329
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,475
These are homemade cookies
courtesy of Granny June.

330
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,811
- Granny June?
- Yeah, she's
the chief's patient.

331
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,646
She's getting a new liver today.

332
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,566
- You're calling her
"Granny June"?
- No, she asked me to.

333
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,719
It just feels right, you know?
She's like a human sunflower.

334
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,971
Wait, you get to scrub in
on a liver-transplant surgery

335
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,840
for a sweet old
cookie-baking grandma?

336
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,276
- With the Chief.
- Oh, God, I hate today.

337
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,856
- Have a cookie.
- Shut up.

338
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,109
You're pregnant?

339
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,045
Congratulations!

340
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,260
Oh, Owen must be so excited!

341
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,178
I'm sure he will be.

342
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,880
Wait. You haven't told him yet?

343
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,749
- How did you tell Jackson?
- Okay, stop.

344
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,685
Whoa! Stop talking right now.
What if I run into him today?

345
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,020
I'll be trying not to say it

346
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,521
which means I could
say it before you say it.

347
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,322
I just want it to be perfect.

348
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,293
Okay, just pretend that you
didn't tell me and tell him, okay?

349
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,496
Just make sure that
Owen is the first to know.

350
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,965
You can avoid a lot of
aggravating family court that way.

351
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,989
True story.

352
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,273
I got your page. What
are you doing in here?

353
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,775
Well, it's cool dark and quiet.

354
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,428
- How long is Avery
gonna be in surgery?
- No idea. I'm with Foster today.

355
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,796
- What's the matter?
- I'm fine. I'm just a little...

356
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,297
I was talking to the baby.

357
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,333
Oh. Hey, did Tuck cry like this?

358
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,118
Was there a way that
you'd carry him or...

359
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,870
Well, Tuck was four
when I met him so, no.

360
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,087
He just had some
chicken nuggets.

361
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,256
I didn't carry him much 'cause
it didn't seem appropriate.

362
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,360
- That's a good call.
- Yeah, I thought so.

363
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,361
- Maybe it's just colic.
- What is colic anyway.

364
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,047
Well...

365
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,615
- I don't really know.
- Yeah.

366
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,200
You want me to just
hold him for a little bit?

367
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,801
No, no, I got it.

368
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,487
- Want me to get Kepner?
- No, no!

369
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:43,005
I can stop a baby
from crying, Warren.

370
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,373
Of course, you can.

371
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,641
But, you know, if Kepner's
free then it might be...

372
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,765
Yeah.

373
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,523
We are hitting Chelsea with
antibiotics, lactulose, diuretics,

374
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,319
but look at these numbers.

375
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,026
We're buying time.

376
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,263
She needs a liver transplant or
she'll be dead maybe tomorrow.

377
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,984
I mean, we need a viable
liver in this hospital, right now.

378
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,520
What?

379
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,573
We might already have one.

380
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,075
Oh, hell no!

381
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,674
Our patient is in acute failure.

382
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,610
The liver coming to June is
a perfect match. I checked.

383
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,179
The liver's already
been allocated.

384
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,265
It's June's liver.
Surgery's been scheduled.

385
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,650
UNOS will allow her to
give up her place in line

386
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,337
and it will go to Chelsea,
but June has to agree to it.

387
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,971
The request has
to come from her.

388
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,924
Well, I haven't heard her
make any requests. Have you?

389
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,559
No, June can get the next match.

390
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,877
Damn it! Damn it.

391
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,980
Damn it. Grey, she's
been on the list three years.

392
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,717
Which means she's very
strong and she can wait.

393
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:47,936
Our patient will die in
hours. She needs this.

394
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I know she does.

395
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,011
And so does Granny June.

396
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:56,345
And since this little old
lady is the closest thing

397
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,129
to Mother Theresa I've ever met

398
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:02,050
I know if I ask she's
gonna say "yes".

399
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,041
- Damn it!
- We have to ask.

400
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:09,363
I swear you try to have one
damn day of joy around here.

401
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:14,330
So, she needs a
liver, too? My liver?

402
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,587
This girl is in immediate need.

403
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,402
If she doesn't get a
liver... It's very dire.

404
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,287
You said "girl." How old is she?

405
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,956
Well, privacy rules
won't allow us...

406
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,275
She's 25.

407
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,461
- Oh, good lord.
- Oh, my goodness.

408
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,780
How long do you think she has?

409
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,533
Well, without a transplant
her doctors don't think...

410
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,318
She might not make
it through the night.

411
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,387
The poor lamb.

412
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,322
Wait, so she's gonna
get mom's liver?

413
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,574
- That's not fair.
- No, Samantha. Shush.

414
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,831
Let her finish.

415
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,771
If you do choose to go this way

416
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,252
you would go back on the list

417
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,488
and, hopefully, the
next liver would be yours.

418
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,708
Believe me, if this wasn't
an urgent situation...

419
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,266
Of course. We
totally understand.

420
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,330
It's your decision.

421
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,905
Yeah. It's my decision. Yeah.

422
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,730
But screw her.

423
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,231
You know how long I've
been waiting in this line

424
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,735
and if somebody's
gonna try and take cuts,

425
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,759
well, no.

426
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,844
Now, she can go find
her own damn liver.

427
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,463
No cuts.

428
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:37,100
- So, your answer is "no"?
- My answer is "hell, no".

429
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,031
Right?

430
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:42,273
Granny's gonna
get a liver today.

431
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,671
- That was... Really unexpected.
- Didn't see that coming.

432
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,622
You didn't. I've been
treating her for five years.

433
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,775
I didn't think she could
say the word "screw."

434
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,328
- Such a good baker.
- She's an organ hog.

435
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,662
I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,515
She could just be cranky from
not eating before the surgery.

437
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,716
Don't apologize.

438
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,118
It is absolutely her
right to say "no".

439
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,120
It's just so unlike Mama.

440
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,294
She volunteered for
Meals on Wheels. She...

441
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,064
I'm just surprised.

442
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,529
And that poor girl does
she get another chance?

443
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,036
There's no guarantee.

444
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,668
Look, Lily, that is why
we have a UNOS list

445
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:36,605
so that people can wait
their turn and get a chance

446
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,608
fair and square, and that's
what Granny June has done.

447
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,960
Well, I wish you luck
with the other girl.

448
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,200
I'll be praying for her.

449
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,698
Granny's getting a liver.

450
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,383
Oh, it's not funny.

451
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,441
I have to go call UNOS.

452
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,495
Oh, find the joy, DeLuca.

453
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,798
Yes, I'll hold.

454
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,212
Nothing?

455
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,714
No. I'm checking
incoming traumas.

456
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,858
You know, I still can't believe
Bailey's patient actually said "no".

457
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:07,752
Selfish old biddy.

458
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,671
I mean, I'm sorry,
but if living that long

459
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,490
doesn't teach you a little
compassion and generosity

460
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:13,680
then what have you learned?

461
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,077
Don't say that to Bailey
because she's full-on Team Biddy.

462
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,718
Maybe I'll change her mind.

463
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:23,902
That's admin. And
then enter, enter, enter.

464
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,626
- Okay.
- Bailey.

465
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,624
- Chelsea's in her 20s.
- And?

466
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,342
And June is almost 8 almost 80.

467
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,466
And?

468
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,200
Whatever offensive ageist
thing you are implying,

469
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,402
I'm gonna need you to say it.

470
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,571
Look, Chelsea, has her
whole life ahead of her.

471
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,307
And June has had a lifetime
of enriching experience.

472
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,075
And she can get
another damn liver.

473
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,412
I cannot believe that you
of all people are saying this.

474
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,414
Now what does that
mean, "me of all people"?

475
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,366
I mean, how can you be so ageist

476
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,870
- when you are...
- Yes?

477
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,876
So wise?

478
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,106
- Hey, who's ageist?
- Dr. Webber believes

479
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,909
that old people matter
less than young people.

480
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,994
That's terrible. I have
a lot of old friends.

481
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,968
- You're my old friend.
- Robbins.

482
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,167
- Older friend. Older than me.
- Why am I not just a friend?

483
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,124
See that's what ageism is.

484
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,054
I'm gonna go check on June.

485
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:19,641
You know, listen, you
don't look a day over 45.

486
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,198
You look amazing.

487
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,634
You can go.

488
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,551
I'm just saying, Edwards
has been like my right hand

489
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,321
and my right hand is no good
to me if it is in your pocket.

490
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:36,397
Amelia, I am not stealing
Edwards. I am borrowing her.

491
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,910
We do this all the time,

492
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,797
like when I got that sweater
and I needed your cute shoes.

493
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,320
Oh, I'm shoes now.

494
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,116
What happened to best resident?

495
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,936
You know, go check and see if
Andy's nitrous oxide study is done.

496
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,976
Thank you.

497
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,726
See? You should not be
ordering her around like that.

498
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,862
I should be ordering
her around like that.

499
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,330
You two need to learn to share.

500
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,083
I have a 25-year-old
with liver failure

501
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,753
who will die because old
ladies don't know how to share.

502
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,417
Your thing is not a problem.

503
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:08,178
I need her back.

504
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,631
I might really need her
back if I'm, you know.

505
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,952
Have you peed on the stick yet?

506
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:17,788
Because if you haven't
peed on that stick yet

507
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:20,468
- stop talking!
- Come on, Mer. She's excited.

508
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,989
I just... I don't know if I
should tell Owen before or after.

509
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,440
How did you tell Derek?

510
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,377
I gave Zola a shirt that
said "Best Big Sister."

511
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,129
That's sweet, but not helpful.

512
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,593
And then with Ellis, I was off
the hook because he was dead.

513
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,361
Well, this was fun for a minute.

514
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,398
This is it, Andy,

515
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:47,812
if you're ready.

516
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,382
Last chance to scrub
out of this mission.

517
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,900
Nah.

518
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,092
- I'll see you on
the other side then.
- Yep. See you then.

519
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,444
Okay, Andy, we're getting
ready to start the induction.

520
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,230
You're gonna feel a little
drowsy and then we can...

521
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,848
You know any jokes?

522
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,032
I'm sorry?

523
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,869
This could go one of two ways.

524
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,933
Thought it might be
good to go out laughing.

525
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,309
- You got a good joke?
- Yeah, yes.

526
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,498
Uh...

527
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,754
Uh...

528
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,407
Um.

529
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,085
Shoot.

530
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,143
Hey, wait, wait. I got one.

531
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,317
No, that's... that's okay.

532
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,970
Andy. Andy?

533
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,694
Hey. Are you gonna
take her down?

534
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,245
Shh.

535
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,785
I just got her down.

536
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,289
- Was she crying the whole time?
- Just...

537
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,743
- All right, you know what? I could...
- Just go. Just go.

538
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,526
The liver's on its way here.

539
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,344
What are we doing out here?

540
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,712
I need some air.

541
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,096
This isn't air. This is steam.

542
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,900
I could steal the liver.

543
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,141
I could just like
run up and grab it.

544
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:40,408
Or I could walk up to the guy
and say, "Hello, I'm Dr. Bailey.

545
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,443
- "Right this way."
- Do that.

546
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,795
Then you'll lose your job, too,

547
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,714
and we'll have more
time for movies and stuff.

548
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,004
I mean, what's another
week or two to June?

549
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,441
She'll get another one.
People die every day.

550
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,091
Maybe I should
go talk to her again.

551
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,444
She probably didn't even hear
Bailey or understand a thing she said.

552
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,997
She said "no". You
go back that's coercion.

553
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,683
Oh, it's not coercion. I'm
just gonna reason with her.

554
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,940
You'll get the hospital
sued. You'll get sued.

555
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,325
Damn it.

556
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:14,481
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- No!

557
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,450
Remember when you
talked to DeLuca for me?

558
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,304
You only made it worse.

559
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,856
You're gonna throw
DeLuca in my face now?

560
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,787
I'm not going to threaten her.

561
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,473
I'm just gonna maybe
show her a picture of the girl,

562
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:30,275
shame her a little.

563
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,299
Beg?

564
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,167
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

565
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,970
Did you find out?

566
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,790
No. Not yet.

567
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,870
Please tell me you
at least told Owen.

568
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,706
I'm just not sure how.

569
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,948
Just tell him. I mean,
he'll be excited, right?

570
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:08,902
Yeah. I guess.

571
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,778
- I didn't have to
do this last time.
- What do you mean last time?

572
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,497
The last time I was pregnant...

573
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,499
I didn't have to tell the father

574
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:25,669
'cause he was dead.

575
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:44,237
Did you call UNOS?

576
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,607
Yeah.

577
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,261
You should go home
and get some rest.

578
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,290
You gonna stay?

579
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,700
Yeah. Gonna wait out
the clock on this one.

580
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,738
I'll let you know if I
have any good news.

581
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,855
You and Shepherd
don't wait around do you?

582
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,078
You always said that
you wanted a pile of kids.

583
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,647
So did you.

584
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,854
I remember up at the
lake when you and...

585
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,275
Yeah, Megan and
I talked about it.

586
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,611
She liked the name Bernard so...

587
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,755
That slowed the
conversation a bit.

588
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,540
- And the universe
had other plans.
- Yeah.

589
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,147
Owen.

590
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,080
Something's happened.

591
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,102
Something terrible.

592
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,505
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

593
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:11,541
- Grab that diaper bag, will you?
- Yeah, stat.

594
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,724
Oh. That's bad.

595
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,982
Wipes.

596
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:21,796
Whoa, that's a crime
against humanity.

597
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,019
Damn it, more wipes.

598
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,323
More, more. Thank you. Good.

599
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:32,863
So, what about you and Shepherd?
You guys, talk about it yet?

600
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,990
- Diaper cream.
- Diaper cream.

601
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,804
Yeah. Yeah, we're
trying actually.

602
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,624
Oh, that's amazing,
man. Outstanding.

603
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:45,626
Diaper.

604
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,412
Okay.

605
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:51,425
You know, what?
Give me another diaper.

606
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,400
- We're gonna double up on this.
- Smart.

607
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,937
- Hey, you're good at this.
- Well, I just have a knack,
I guess.

608
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,284
Babies like me.

609
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:01,892
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

610
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,742
We'll know we were successful

611
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,450
when we see the
vasculature looks normal.

612
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,471
It's like fireworks.

613
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,373
Congrats, Andy.

614
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,710
Thank you for this.

615
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,641
It's like a
one-in-a-million shot

616
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:27,284
- and it was incredible
to be a part of.
- My pleasure.

617
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,153
You know, you have
a real knack for cardio.

618
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,919
Thank you, and that's very
flattering, but I love neuro.

619
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:37,839
Don't worry. I'll return
you when I'm done.

620
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,141
You're like a neighbor's
snow plow, you know.

621
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,659
There's no need to
buy one for yourself

622
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:43,333
but come in handy sometimes.

623
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,376
Can we go back to
when I was shoes?

624
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,075
V-tach.

625
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,471
Push 75 of lido.

626
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,695
I don't understand.
He was stable.

627
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,014
Damn it, Andy.

628
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
Crash cart.

629
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,884
V-fib.

630
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,517
Paddles now.

631
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,324
Charge to 200. Clear.

632
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,228
3-0.

633
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:16,482
I usually love a
good transplant.

634
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,246
Taking something
no longer needed

635
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,284
reusing it... It's
like composting.

636
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,103
- You compost?
- No, it's gross.

637
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,356
But it's good and
virtuous and people do it.

638
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,610
Dr. Grey, has
turned a compost pile

639
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,218
and turned it into a
regular old pile of poop.

640
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:37,164
Suction.

641
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,977
She stole the joy
from me, from June.

642
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:48,509
I was even trying to make a
little joy for you today, DeLuca.

643
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,128
Well, if it's any consolation

644
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,969
this is the best day
I've had in a while so...

645
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,006
No.

646
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,169
I'm sorry?

647
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:00,644
No, it's no
consolation. Scissors.

648
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,996
He must've thrown a clot.

649
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,816
Apnea test shows no
spontaneous respiratory drive,

650
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,689
no brain stem reflexes.

651
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,242
He's brain dead.

652
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,007
We'll do an EEG
to confirm but...

653
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,047
I thought we got
him back in time.

654
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:23,117
I'm sorry.

655
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,830
A stick.

656
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,159
What?

657
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,192
What do you call a boomerang
that doesn't come back to you?

658
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,810
A stick 'cause a boomerang's
supposed to return.

659
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,367
I get it. No.

660
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,303
- Why are you telling me?
- 'Cause he wanted a joke.

661
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:49,192
He just wanted one
joke and I went blank.

662
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:53,246
I could've thought of
something, anything.

663
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,532
He just wanted to laugh.

664
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,415
Well, the good news is
that was a terrible joke.

665
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,583
I know.

666
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,285
If the clot hadn't killed
him that joke would have,

667
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,753
so it's a really good
thing he didn't hear it.

668
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,311
- That's not funny. How can you...
- Edwards.

669
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,164
No, you have to find the good.

670
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,717
Andy did.

671
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,921
He knew this was a long shot.

672
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,168
He knew he might die,

673
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,470
and he could've died at
home from acute heart failure

674
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,322
instead of here in post-op.

675
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:27,157
But then he wouldn't have
been able to donate his organs,

676
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,681
and that was important to him.

677
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:32,452
And that's good. He...

678
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,208
Come with me.

679
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,271
<i>Are you sure?</i>

680
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,625
I don't want to get
excited if this isn't real,

681
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,494
and I don't want to tell
them if this isn't real.

682
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,929
He's ABO compatible.

683
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,747
And UNOS has been notified.

684
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,666
He's 180 pounds.

685
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,001
He's a non-drinker.
He's a non-smoker.

686
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,865
- His liver is...
- It's perfect.

687
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,013
It's real, Mer. We
have a liver for her.

688
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,061
Oh, Dr. Bailey was right.

689
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,319
This is a glorious day.

690
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,014
And the liver pinked
up almost immediately

691
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,550
which is a good sign.

692
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,904
Of course, we still have to
watch for signs of rejection

693
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,908
in these first 24 hours,
but so far so good.

694
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,398
Let's hear it, you guys!

695
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,017
Oh, shh.

696
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,516
- We can't thank you enough.
- Oh.

697
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,105
Oh, Karen, give him the scarf.

698
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,828
- Mama made me finish it so...
- Thank you.

699
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:58,204
Oh, group pic!
Group pic. Come on.

700
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,169
This is for the Christmas card.

701
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,313
All right.

702
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:05,739
All right, "liver" on
three. One, two, three.

703
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,213
Liver!

704
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,051
Okay, let's get ready for
the vascular anastomoses.

705
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,758
I've got the vena cava.

706
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,262
So how is the old biddy?

707
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,375
She's fine.

708
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,399
Hoarder.

709
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:32,338
No, I get it.

710
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,152
If it were you, if you
were in June's position

711
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,437
I'd want you to have it.

712
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,145
And if someone asked,
I'd say screw them, too.

713
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,954
Just how old do you think I am?

714
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,508
We not going home?

715
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:53,971
No. I want to see this.

716
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:57,697
I want to get as much
of my joy on as I can.

717
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,352
This is the worst day.

718
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:04,148
This is the best day.

719
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,433
I should be in that surgery.

720
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,669
My patient can't
catch a break all day,

721
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,521
and the second that
something good happens

722
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,073
I get bumped again

723
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:15,326
because Pierce told Grey that
Stephanie's had a really tough day.

724
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,711
She really needs it.

725
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,996
- That happened
to me today, too.
- Pathetic.

726
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,021
I'll take it where I can get it.

727
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:25,441
You should really
get that treated.

728
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:28,622
- What?
- Your self-pity gland.

729
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,924
It's incredibly swollen.

730
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,673
Go to hell.

731
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,012
I'm a doctor. I can
see it from here.

732
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:36,797
Well, I'm gonna
treat it with alcohol.

733
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,833
That's the recommended
course. I support that.

734
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,208
- And, push two more of these.
- Oh. Thank you.

735
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,960
So, she ate about an hour ago.

736
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,845
You had her all day? I thought
you were gonna take her to daycare.

737
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,180
Yeah, I wasn't that busy.

738
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,867
He didn't want to put
her down is what it was.

739
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,802
Happened to me all the time.

740
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:59,854
- It's the way her head smells.
- Yeah.

741
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,989
Yeah, I know.

742
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,093
I'm just glad she didn't
give you any trouble.

743
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,944
I was fine. She was great.

744
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,078
- Okay.
- Easy.

745
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,736
All right, thanks again.

746
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,502
You and Shepherd ought to
get on getting one of those.

747
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:30,039
Yeah, so she's getting
the transplant tonight.

748
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:35,161
So I'm, I'm just gonna... I
want to stay tonight, yeah.

749
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:39,065
I don't know when
I'm gonna be home.

750
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,421
Yeah me, too.

751
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,637
Oh, Rick, I'm pregnant.

752
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,921
No, I wanted to tell
you when I saw you

753
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:53,307
but then I... I
didn't want to wait.

754
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,798
I couldn't wait.

755
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,528
I couldn't know
without you knowing.

756
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,864
<i>Every cloud has a silver lining.</i>

757
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:00,888
Yeah.

758
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,939
Yeah.

759
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,377
I love you, too.

760
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,963
<i>But it's still a cloud.</i>

761
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,634
What is this?

762
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,262
Well, I was gonna
wrap it like a present,

763
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,600
but then I thought I
would hand it to you

764
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,552
and you'd hand it to
me and then I'd pee on it,

765
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,570
so that felt weird.

766
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:42,556
Um, but then I just
thought I would take the test

767
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,691
and hand it to you on a plate,

768
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,144
but then we couldn't use
the plates anymore so I...

769
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,350
Amelia, are you...

770
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:51,938
- Are you pregnant?
- I might be.

771
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,422
I think I might be.

772
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:01,931
<i>A cloud can mean
a shower or a storm.</i>

773
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:05,913
I was gonna wait until I
knew for sure but I don't know

774
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:09,305
I just wanted you to know,
too, so do you want to find out?

775
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,794
<i>So you take your good
days where you can get them.</i>

776
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,442
- We have to close it.
- One more minute.

777
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:22,012
One more minute of cool
air or a week of spoiled food.

778
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:24,348
- You guys, she's pregnant.
- We don't know that.

779
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:25,633
Who's pregnant?

780
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,368
It's my first sister's
pregnancy. I missed all of yours.

781
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,636
Amelia's pregnant?

782
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,255
- Maybe.
- I hope so.

783
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,346
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

784
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,875
She'll be talking for two now.

785
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,167
<i>You try to stay positive.</i>

786
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,436
Hey, did I tell you I spent
all day with Harriet today?

787
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,770
It was so much fun.

788
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:50,062
After a while it... it just... It
felt like I'd done it forever.

789
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,994
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Good. Got that part down.

790
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,786
- What's it say?
- Takes a minute.

791
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,166
Want to sit?

792
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,707
- Okay. Go ahead. Let's sit.
- Yeah.

793
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,837
So I was thinking that

794
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,729
we could turn the
study into the nursery.

795
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,494
Or maybe we should just
have the crib in with us.

796
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:13,013
I mean, we haven't
even talked about this.

797
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,922
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

798
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,956
You know, and then we can
turn the nursery into his room...

799
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,607
Or her room.

800
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,392
I mean, it's a good
room for a kid, right?

801
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,932
We don't need a study and...

802
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,135
What? What?

803
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,329
<i>You try to remember that
even in the bad news...</i>

804
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
That's okay.

805
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,402
You know, it's...

806
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,071
We just started.

807
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,408
We'll keep trying. Okay?

808
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,175
<i>There's good news for someone.</i>
