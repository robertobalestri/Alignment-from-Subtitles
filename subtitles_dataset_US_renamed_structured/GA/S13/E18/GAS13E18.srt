1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,897
<i>When my mother's
Alzheimer's got bad,</i>

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,973
<i>I was going through her
bills and I found a notepad.</i>

3
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,475
<i>Written on it were the words,</i>

4
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:14,129
<i>"Important. Tell
Meredith not to..."</i>

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,501
<i>And that was it. She never
finished that sentence.</i>

6
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,062
<i>Tell Meredith not to what?
Not to drink too much?</i>

7
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,080
<i>Not to pet strange dogs?</i>

8
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,900
<i>Not to give her heart away?</i>

9
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,954
<i>Not to leave the sprinklers on?</i>

10
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:35,827
<i>We didn't exactly
talk a lot in those days.</i>

11
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:37,946
<i>I regret that.</i>

12
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,249
<i>I wish we had.</i>

13
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,130
I thought you and Dr. Cohen had
clean margins in the mastectomy.

14
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,149
Yeah, we did, but
then a spot showed up

15
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,868
on the latest scans,
alongside the chest wall here.

16
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,553
- So you didn't.
- It could be nothing.

17
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,122
Or it could be leftover cells that
weren't taken out, and kept growing.

18
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,746
- Maggie.
- I'm sorry, I...

19
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,345
- Keep going.
- We don't know
what it is, really,

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,549
- until we get in there.
- I'll do a wide local excision,

21
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:04,567
explore the area,
remove anything I find.

22
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,202
We may need to
do a muscle flap just

23
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,771
- to cover the defect,
but simple.
- Tomorrow?

24
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,089
Ah, we're thinking next week.

25
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,591
No. It has to be tomorrow.
The next day at the latest.

26
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,411
We should let her
get stronger first.

27
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,747
She is strong. And we don't want it
to spread past what it already has.

28
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,415
Of course we don't,
but it's a big surgery,

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,279
- so I'd like...
- I can handle it.

30
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,628
I'm fine. I want the next
surgery as soon as you can do it.

31
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,583
- How'd it go?
- Thank you.

32
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,767
Okay, I think...

33
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,458
Her radiation caused some fibrosis,
which made things a little tricky.

34
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,197
You know, I would have
preferred to wait another week.

35
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,074
I wanted to wait, too.

36
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,130
Hmm.

37
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,305
I'm sorry, I haven't followed
up on the... the thing.

38
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,615
Dinner.

39
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,460
It's not because I don't
want to. It's just that I...

40
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,726
Sure. I mean, you know...

41
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,283
- there's a lot going on.
- There is a lot going on.

42
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:43,538
It'll happen... sometime.

43
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,792
Sometime.

44
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,044
I'd better get in there.

45
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,512
- Boo.
- Oh, God.

46
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,934
- You can't sleep?
- Wide awake all hours.

47
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,381
This chair's the only place

48
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,739
my stomach and back
can get comfortable, so...

49
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:23,511
- What are you doing up?
- I have three kids. I don't sleep.

50
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,097
Motherhood.

51
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,053
I always wanted more kids.

52
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,591
So Maggie could have
a sister or a brother.

53
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,293
I was worried when she
wanted to move out here.

54
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,466
She was happy in Boston, but...

55
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,788
I'm really glad she found you.

56
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,681
You said your stomach
is bothering you?

57
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,099
Damn it.

58
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,112
Richard?

59
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,535
What are you gonna say?

60
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,653
You're sure it's a met?
It's right where the bile

61
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,927
drains from your liver, so
that would explain your pain.

62
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,993
- You're saying
I have another tumor?
- No, no, she's saying that cells

63
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,130
from the original tumor have
traveled and grown in another place.

64
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,430
In my liver?

65
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,894
- Yes.
- Maybe.

66
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,258
So, I know this
is a lot to take in...

67
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,794
so why don't the
two of you, um...

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,409
take the night and we can
meet again in the morning

69
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,733
- and discuss it further, okay?
- We're here now.

70
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,715
- But I just meant that...
- Can you
remove it laparoscopically?

71
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,250
- What? Well, that
would be better than

72
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,018
an open procedure
at this point, right?

73
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,402
Then we wouldn't have
to stop her chemo regimen.

74
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,731
Unless you have a
different surgical plan?

75
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,326
Would you like to
discuss this outside?

76
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,394
No, no, we're discussing
my mother's treatment.

77
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:09,562
We can discuss it with her.

78
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,700
Okay, Diane, typically,
with aggressive cancers,

79
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,901
we only operate where
the original tumor began.

80
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,319
In this case, it
was your breast.

81
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,607
Once the cancer spreads beyond
that, surgery is not curative...

82
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,615
But it could prevent further
pain and complications,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,163
which there will be if the met keeps
growing or spreads even further.

84
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,598
And we would work to
prevent that using other options.

85
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,201
Sure, pump her with more chemo.

86
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,553
Well, a second ago, you were
worried about stopping her chemo.

87
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,855
- Just take out the met.
- You're asking me
to perform a procedure...

88
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,407
You can barely
see it on the scan.

89
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,042
That'll not only cause
her pain, but put her at risk

90
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,410
- for many complications.
- It's my mom.

91
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,663
I'm asking you to think beyond
the standard and typical...

92
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,032
And I'm asking you to listen
to yourself as a surgeon,

93
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:48,216
- who should know better.
- Oh, good God, enough!

94
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,887
Both of you, I can't
even hear myself think.

95
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,396
- Mom, we just... We need one...
- Are you saying
that you can't do the surgery

96
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,635
- to remove the, um...
- The met.

97
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,331
- Can you do it?
- I can, but I'm saying
that I won't.

98
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,867
Because in my professional
opinion, I think it's a terrible idea.

99
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,470
Meredith, if you won't do
the surgery, you should go.

100
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,044
We'll find another
surgeon who will.

101
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,978
- No, it's not...
- No.

102
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,531
Maggie, this is not
your decision to make!

103
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,906
Meredith, dear...

104
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,454
I'm firing you.

105
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,679
You're no longer
one of my doctors.

106
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,821
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.
Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

107
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,063
Thank you for meeting
with me this morning.

108
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,032
I found something that, um...

109
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,935
It is called the BXP protocol,
and it started at Gillman.

110
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,001
They're experimenting
with humanized antibodies

111
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,136
for late-stage cancer
immunotherapy.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,271
Um...

113
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:00,240
- Clinical trial.
- Is this successful?

114
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:02,575
The trial's next phase
was rushed into approval

115
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,976
due to favorable outcomes.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,478
And your mom meets the criteria?

117
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,947
Once we remove that met
that's obstructing her bile duct,

118
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,333
her liver enzymes will
go down. Then she's in.

119
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,553
Um, Meredith doesn't
feel that surgery is wise.

120
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,310
Meredith is no
longer on the case.

121
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,407
And now that I
know about this trial,

122
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,124
there's even more
reason to do the surgery,

123
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,748
and I'd like one
of you to do it.

124
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,709
Oh.

125
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,053
You know, um...

126
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,353
I think we should
read up on the trial

127
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,778
- and then come up with a plan.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,198
- Does that sound good to you?
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

129
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,050
- Anyone think
this is a good idea?
- No.

130
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,653
- Not at all.
- All right,
so we're together on that.

131
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,322
So I'll bring up Diane's
chart, we'll pull together

132
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,191
some other research
and get together,

133
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,426
see what we can
come up with, huh?

134
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,370
You know, I'd
prefer to work alone.

135
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,481
Me too.

136
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,985
No, no, no, no, guys,
that's not a good idea.

137
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,476
Great.

138
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:09,341
A biliary bypass wouldn't work
given the location and size of the met.

139
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,245
Are you actually
going to resect it?

140
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,352
The met? I'm not
going near that thing.

141
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,049
No one would.

142
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:18,985
Right now, I'm just trying to
figure out how to lower her LFTs

143
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,675
to get her into this trial.

144
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,714
- Did you consider stenting her?
- That's still surgery.

145
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,494
I mean, with her condition...

146
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:31,030
But if it's done percutaneously,
under minimal sedation.

147
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:33,249
Yeah. It could give
more long-term relief,

148
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,451
hopefully, avoiding
re-intervention.

149
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,809
And get her LFTs
down. I like it.

150
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,413
Well, it's better than
a complete bypass.

151
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,781
That's true.

152
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,685
Okay. Good. I was never here.

153
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,831
How are her LFTs
post-op? Any change?

154
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,266
Well, the procedure worked.

155
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,702
I relieved the obstruction,
a hundred percent.

156
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,926
And her LFTs are
trending down, yes.

157
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,430
- So she'll qualify
for the trial?
- Yes.

158
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,950
- She qualifies for the trial.
- Really?

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,548
Oh, my God. That
is amazing news!

160
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:26,135
Ah! Thank you, Dr. Bailey,
for doing the procedure!

161
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,705
Oh! I gotta call my
contacts at Gillman. I...

162
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,089
I gotta go! All
right, thank you!

163
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,716
- Damn it.
- Yup.

164
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,264
No one wanted to mention
that we think that the trial

165
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,649
- is a completely terrible idea?
- You need to sit her down

166
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,802
- and let her know
what's going on!
- Me? I'm not doing that!

167
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,037
- You're her friend.
- Who kept her mom's cancer
a secret

168
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,760
from her. No, you're
her dad. You do it.

169
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,242
- You're Diane's surgeon.
- So was Avery.

170
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,678
Oh, come on! You led the
procedure that brought her LFTs down

171
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,163
and got her the
trial in the first place.

172
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,048
A trial I never believed in.

173
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,117
- Yeah, well, you're the chief.
- Well, who's head of the board?

174
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,825
- Now you care about that?
- Never mind! I'll do it.

175
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,369
She's awake.

176
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,743
Don't want to bother you.

177
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:19,059
Oh, come in, come in!

178
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,408
Maggie went to get me
some tea or something.

179
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,784
Oh, that's fine. You
know... I wanted to chat.

180
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,138
- Well?
- About the clinical trial.

181
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,194
- Did I get in?
- Well, yes, you... you will, but...

182
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,023
Listen, there's
some things that...

183
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,898
Maggie will be
so excited. She...

184
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,319
She wants to start right
away the, um... the thingy.

185
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,789
- Protocol.
- Protocol.

186
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,658
Will you be doing the protocol?

187
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,678
I want to make sure you
have a complete picture.

188
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,145
- The trial is very aggressive.
- That's what we want, right?

189
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,052
Yes, but, um...

190
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,256
the toll it's gonna
take on your body...

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,000
it will be difficult,
extremely difficult.

192
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,929
I know.

193
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,332
But...

194
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,918
- Maggie says it's a good idea.
- Diane...

195
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,137
there's a reason
we don't let doctors...

196
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,038
treat members of
their own family.

197
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:27,144
Sometimes, the need to
help someone you love can...

198
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,461
cloud your judgment.

199
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,119
She wouldn't do anything
to make me worse.

200
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,691
- She's my daughter.
- Here we go. Hi!

201
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,983
Hi.

202
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,162
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

203
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,981
Everything's great, sweetie.

204
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,398
Uh, you know what? I'm
gonna let you get some rest,

205
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,866
and, um... we'll talk tomorrow.

206
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,775
I appreciate that. See you then.

207
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,710
- Here you go, Mrs. Pierce.
- Oh, well, no need

208
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,360
for special treatment.

209
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,514
I'm happy in the other
chemo room, the regular one.

210
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,618
Right, Mom, it's a clinical
trial, so they have to be able

211
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,953
to control everything
in your environment.

212
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,773
The room temperature,
your temperature, everything.

213
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:35,063
Oh.

214
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,767
I was going to ask Aurora if
Lee finally passed his driver's test.

215
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,503
- Who?
- Aurora, my chemo nurse.

216
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,851
Her son, Lee, has failed it
twice, and he was supposed to go

217
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,241
to the DMV today.

218
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,045
Maggie, you work with these
people. How do you not know this?

219
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,432
Um...

220
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,065
- How we doing in here?
- They're making a fuss.

221
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:04,409
Um, we will need you
to sign these forms.

222
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,244
- All of these?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,747
The thing with
clinical trials is...

224
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,347
they can list a million
ways your body might react.

225
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,921
But the truth is,
they just don't know.

226
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,670
That's why it's a trial.

227
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,244
You need to be
prepared for anything.

228
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,367
You... Here, let me... let me
walk you through this, um...

229
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,538
Um...

230
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,135
So, what this says is

231
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,209
you may experience
some nausea and vomiting.

232
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,647
There's, uh,
dehydration, weakness,

233
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,083
dizziness. There's fatigue.

234
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,007
<i>Night sweats.</i>

235
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,893
<i>And chills.</i>

236
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,182
<i>Skin irritation.</i>

237
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,304
<i>Wound infections.</i>

238
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,009
<i>Extreme fluid build-up.</i>

239
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,365
<i>In short, it will get bad...</i>

240
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,536
<i>then really bad.</i>

241
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:26,273
And then... if it starts
to work, hopefully,

242
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,528
you'll start to
get a little better.

243
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,766
This treatment is killing
her faster than the cancer.

244
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,669
- It's what Diane wants.
- You mean what Maggie wants.

245
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,473
Mom?

246
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,921
- Why aren't you resting?
- Oh, I woke up hours ago.

247
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,078
Feeling great.

248
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,065
So I watched the
news, did a little laundry.

249
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,963
Then I noticed that the
pantry was a little cluttered,

250
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,949
- so I reorganized it.
- Mom, you don't have to do that.

251
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,124
Well, I did. And you got
up at the perfect time.

252
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,294
- It's lasagna time.
- Lasagna?

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,958
You're going to make my lasagna.

254
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,910
Oh, no, Mom. I don't...

255
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,396
I... that's your thing. I
don't know how to make it.

256
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,003
Well, you need to learn.

257
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,307
No. Stop it.

258
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,933
I don't want you passing
things down. That's not...

259
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,764
- I... I don't like that.
- Oh, that's not why.

260
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,783
It's just that I have decided I
don't have to do this anymore.

261
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:48,016
I am a woman of a certain
age, and I have earned the right

262
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,042
to sit down, put my feet
up and let you cook for me.

263
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,174
- Mom.
- You're not gonna like it

264
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,132
when I'm gone and
you're missing my lasagna.

265
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,870
Invite your
friends. It'll be fun.

266
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:06,751
Okay. I just need to
go, um... take a shower.

267
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,392
Uh-huh. I don't think so!

268
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:11,662
- Grab that flour.
- We're doing this now.

269
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,032
Okay... That's awesome.

270
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,003
- Hi! Why are you
all here at once?
- Hi!

271
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,705
We carpooled. We
thought it'd be fun.

272
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,557
- Yeah, Webber drove us.
- And we have wine.

273
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,859
You guys, she made me
make the noodles from scratch.

274
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,963
You know you can buy
noodles in a box, right?

275
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,783
- Wait, hold on. You were two?
- Two years old!

276
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,075
And when I say she was
reading, it was reading.

277
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,123
Maggie was not sounding
out words or anything.

278
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,308
- Okay, Mom.
- And you didn't teach her?

279
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,466
Oh, nobody could teach
her. My baby was a genius.

280
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,320
- That brain of hers.
- Okay, thanks, Mom.

281
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,535
I've you to thank
for that, I guess.

282
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,325
Well, I don't know about that.

283
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,177
Oh, and your mother.

284
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,664
I'd like to pay my
respects to Ellis.

285
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,795
I'm here, I'm
staying in her house.

286
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,969
I mean, it's the
right thing to do.

287
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,583
Well, that's very nice, but
you don't need to do that.

288
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,558
Oh, but I want to.
Where is she buried?

289
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,881
Um...

290
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,565
- A place that she loved...
- We dumped her ashes

291
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,509
- in a scrub sink in O.R. Two.
- By the water.

292
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,026
- Oh, my God!
- Well, it was her favorite O.R

293
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,701
and it seemed like the
right thing at the time.

294
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:44,771
We're terrible people.

295
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,787
I love it! I love it!

296
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,517
Oh, no.

297
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,852
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay,

298
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,451
I just heard. An
esophageal tear?

299
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,270
Yeah. Hopefully, it's contained

300
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,743
and I don't have
to open her chest.

301
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,833
- What are you doing?
- I should do the EGD.

302
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:44,124
You're too close. Go
take care of Maggie.

303
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:45,993
Let me do this for you.

304
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,196
Don't pretend you're
doing this for me.

305
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,577
You've made it very clear for
some time that my well-being

306
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,929
is the lowest of your priorities

307
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,235
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

308
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,189
If I needed help...

309
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,392
you'd be the last
person I'd call.

310
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:12,697
- You had to do a thoracotomy?
Yeah, the tear was full of thickness.

311
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:15,161
Conservative management
wasn't the way to go here, Maggie.

312
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,558
No, you're right. Thank you.

313
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,561
So, we'll start
her on tube feeds?

314
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,430
Um, we're... we're...
we're not there yet, uh...

315
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,429
She's on TPN for now, and
I'm also concerned about sepsis,

316
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,070
so we've started her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

317
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,641
She's still sedated for the pain,
and we'll keep her on PCA, okay?

318
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:35,977
Keep her comfortable.

319
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:40,297
Do you need anything from home?
Do you want us to get you anything?

320
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,711
We need to get her
on her feet A.S.A.P.

321
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,213
If she misses any of her
infusions, she'll lose her position

322
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,448
- in the study.
- Maggie...

323
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,832
I'd like to get Diane
through the next 24 hours.

324
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,481
Okay? And then we'll see
where we are from there.

325
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,727
Maggie?

326
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:14,766
I really don't need you trying to
talk me out of anything right now.

327
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,664
This protocol is
making Diane so sick

328
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:22,656
- that her esophagus tore.
- That could just be
from the cancer.

329
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,720
But you can't wait to get
her to her next infusion.

330
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,311
Because my mom wants to live.

331
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,275
And this clinical trial
could give that to her.

332
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,844
She wanted to do it.
She could have said no.

333
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,981
How? How can she say no when
her daughter, who is a surgeon,

334
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,983
is standing right there,
pushing it on her?

335
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:40,087
There have been
favorable outcomes.

336
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,373
We just need to get her
to the end of the treatment.

337
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,908
She won't make it to
the end of the treatment!

338
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:48,109
She's already dying.
And now she's suffering

339
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,017
- because of it.
- At least I'm doing something.

340
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,937
At least I'm not just
giving up and saying no.

341
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,424
We are only doing her harm.

342
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,061
You don't get it! You wouldn't.

343
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:05,009
Meredith, I love my mother
enough not to say "screw it,"

344
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,900
and throw her down a damn drain.

345
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,412
What do you need? What can I do?

346
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,764
- Where's Maggie?
- Diane...

347
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:42,369
you don't have to keep
putting yourself through this.

348
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,222
Not if you don't want to.

349
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,128
I was born in a two-room
shack with an outhouse.

350
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,512
Six brothers.

351
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:57,835
Not a lot of food...
or love, or anything.

352
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,055
Getting out of there was...

353
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:09,997
When that social worker
put this little baby in my arms,

354
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:14,217
when I looked
down at my Maggie...

355
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,055
Maggie...

356
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,942
is the universe
giving me a gift.

357
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,895
She is...

358
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,009
a happy person.

359
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,217
She's... cheerful.

360
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:35,205
Maggie is rare, she's special.

361
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,620
This...

362
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,461
This will give her darkness.

363
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:48,130
How could I do that to
the most special person

364
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,652
in the whole world?

365
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,508
When I die...

366
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,974
she needs to know
that she did everything

367
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,415
that she could.

368
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,418
Diane, she has.

369
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,471
Maggie's done
everything there is to do.

370
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:13,243
I can't stop. I... I
can't do that to her.

371
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:16,280
Well, she can take
it. You may not see it

372
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,922
because you knew her
since she was a little girl.

373
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,719
I mean, I didn't. I only
know the woman you raised.

374
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,740
And that woman is smart...

375
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,659
and strong as iron.

376
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,172
Especially for the
people she loves.

377
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,477
Now...

378
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,675
Well...

379
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,770
Now I see where she gets it.

380
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,827
I don't want to die.

381
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:07,675
Hey.

382
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:11,696
So I'm gonna put out a couple
of calls to some old professors

383
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,640
from Boston. Do you
remember Dr. Luckett?

384
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,640
- He specializes
in radioactive...
- Maggie!

385
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,393
Don't you dare quit on me now.

386
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,537
You can't... You
can't quit on me.

387
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:30,854
We can beat this. You
have to fight. I'll help you.

388
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,158
Sweetie...

389
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,711
Sit down and let me talk to you.

390
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,800
- You all right?
- No.

391
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,075
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

392
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,696
I just wish my dad was here.

393
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,145
Maggie.

394
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,549
- Meredith doesn't get it.
- She's just worried about you.

395
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:14,041
I just got started!

396
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,595
My mom has been sick for
months without me knowing.

397
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:20,931
Months!

398
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,745
I feel like I left the
house with the oven on

399
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,397
and went about my business
and came back to find

400
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:28,305
the whole house
engulfed in flames.

401
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,008
And no one will let me in.

402
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,377
No matter what I
do, I can't get inside.

403
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,113
I can't save anything!

404
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,018
I could've stopped
it if I had known.

405
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,406
So, I can't give up. I
can't give up, not now.

406
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:52,295
- Hey.
- What are you doing? What?

407
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:54,348
Come here.

408
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:03,851
Thank you.

409
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,896
Thank you.

410
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:31,551
She's gonna go

411
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,638
and I'm not ready.

412
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,034
Not ready.

413
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:43,363
You're never ready.

414
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,716
You just do it.

415
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,653
Listen to her.

416
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,602
Talk about whatever
she wants to talk about,

417
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:57,261
and record her voice in your
mind. And memorize everything.

418
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,163
Just keep sitting there.

419
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,790
- Orgasms.
- No.

420
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,656
- It's not a dirty word.
- No, no.

421
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,542
I'm dying.

422
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:52,115
- I have to impart wisdom.
- This wisdom? Right now?

423
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,530
You've got time. You don't
have to go there right now.

424
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,554
Hmm.

425
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:01,358
- I've had orgasms.
- Oh, well, good.

426
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,678
They are not a
gift. It's your right.

427
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,663
Don't let anyone
tell you otherwise.

428
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:12,669
And this is important,
at least once a day.

429
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,417
Sometimes I like to wait

430
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,007
- until right before bedtime,
but...
- No! God, no, Mom! Stop.

431
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,095
You are too intense.

432
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,675
Have some fun.

433
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,899
I have plenty of
fun. Which color?

434
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,652
- The darker.
- Okay.

435
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:33,084
Oh, and did you call
about my eyelashes?

436
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,686
You know I want to die
with my eyelashes on.

437
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,230
Eyelashes are tomorrow.

438
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,630
Good...

439
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,651
You were always so good.

440
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,858
What do you mean?

441
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,074
Incredible grades,

442
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,529
a clean room, and
you never talked back.

443
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,750
And you never messed
around with the boys.

444
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:04,153
- Most parents
would appreciate that.
- Oh, I did...

445
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:07,073
Then. But now?

446
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,060
You need to
shake it up a little.

447
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:12,646
Um...

448
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,333
Be a little lazy
or a little slutty.

449
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,022
- Make a mistake.
- I have a job.

450
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,203
Well, you're never
gonna look back and say,

451
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:28,289
- "I wish I'd been more uptight."
- Okay, Mom, you have to

452
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,291
be still or else I
can't finish this.

453
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,529
And stop always saying
what everyone wants to hear.

454
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,030
Tell someone off.

455
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:40,006
It's good for 'em,
and better for you.

456
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:44,094
Especially if it's a
car sales person.

457
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,346
- Do you like the color? Okay.
- I do.

458
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,034
- And don't forget the...
- The top coat, I know, I know.

459
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,702
You want some water?

460
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,972
Want me to keep going?

461
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:23,734
I brought my
engagement ring to Seattle.

462
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:28,204
It's at the house,
in my jewelry bag.

463
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,407
I want you to have it.

464
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,443
- Mom...
- Your father gave it to me.

465
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,147
He'd want you to
have it, too. So, please.

466
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,932
Okay.

467
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:42,102
Thank you.

468
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,124
I want you to fall in love.

469
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:52,195
And it has to be
somebody who's worthy.

470
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:55,159
Find a decent man

471
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:58,651
who loves you just a little
more than you love him.

472
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:00,901
Well, equally as
much. How about that?

473
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:05,069
No, he needs to think
he is lucky to have you,

474
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:07,460
- and not the other way around.
- Other hand.

475
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,749
Never make yourself
small for anyone.

476
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,586
Be your own person.

477
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,986
And try wearing
a little lipstick.

478
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,687
You know, Mom, if you
keep going at this rate,

479
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:26,024
you're gonna run out of
advice before tomorrow.

480
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:27,464
Mm. Oof.

481
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,051
- This polish smells.
- Want me to open a window?

482
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,054
That would be nice.

483
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:44,497
It stopped raining.

484
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,365
Okay, I'm not going to leave it
open too long or you'll catch a chill.

485
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,384
Typical.

486
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:56,008
Bring you to a hospital,
help you catch a cold.

487
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,091
Mom?

488
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,012
Mom?

489
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,920
Mom?

490
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:09,639
Mommy?

491
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,630
Listen, I... I... I
know the flight...

492
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,535
the helicopter had to
be expensive, and so...

493
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,588
- I'll write you a check.
- No... no need, no.

494
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,092
This is family.

495
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,664
Thank you.

496
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,723
Thank you.

497
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,152
Daddy, Daddy.

498
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:43,653
Hey.

499
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,874
- Hey, how's Pierce?
- Not great.

500
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,946
Yeah, sorry to hear about Diane.

501
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,267
She's gonna need me now.

502
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,486
For how long, I don't know.

503
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,906
Yeah, I know.

504
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,961
Our timing's just off, I guess.

505
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,505
<i>I think about my
mom's note all the time.</i>

506
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,938
<i>"Tell Meredith not to..."</i>

507
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,608
<i>Not to cave? Not to care?</i>

508
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,594
<i>Not to give up so easily?</i>

509
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:27,213
<i>Not to fall in love?</i>

510
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:29,882
<i>Not to have children?</i>

511
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,201
<i>Not to tell a lie?</i>

512
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:37,257
<i>She left me wondering.</i>

513
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,476
<i>What to do.</i>

514
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,578
<i>What not to do.</i>

515
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:43,934
Damn it.

516
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,027
What?

517
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,280
<i>She left me knowing
everything was up to me.</i>

518
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,818
<i>And me alone.</i>

519
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,064
Ellis never forgave me.

520
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,434
She went to her grave
without forgiving me.

521
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,789
It robbed me of so many things.

522
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,562
So many things.

523
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,467
Let's not do that to each other.

524
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,128
<i>And she left me
with no one to ask...</i>

525
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,397
<i>so I would decide
what she meant to write.</i>

526
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,270
<i>"Tell Meredith
not to be afraid."</i>

527
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,541
<i>Goodbye, Mom.</i>
