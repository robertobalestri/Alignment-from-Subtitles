1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,816
<i>Surgeons fight.</i>

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,452
- I didn't bring it up. He did.
- Well, what? It's the truth.

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,904
I said we're not
talking about it.

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,039
<i>We fight against
death. It's our thing.</i>

5
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,926
Well, on the plus side, it's
your last day in the clinic.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,594
- Clinic wasn't so bad.
- What did I just say?

7
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,047
- We're drinking tonight, right?
- Not about this.

8
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,382
Mer, the trial's tomorrow.

9
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:24,868
It could be our last chance
for, like, eight, ten years.

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,792
<i>But eventually, if
history is any indicator...</i>

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,122
<i>death is gonna win.</i>

12
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,525
Or you could win, and we
could drink tomorrow night.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,759
Yeah. Right.

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,296
- There's a chance.
- Yeah. Slim to none.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,798
<i>We may win the battle,</i>

16
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,604
<i>but we're never
gonna win the war.</i>

17
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:41,984
What about a plea?

18
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,221
Didn't they offer you a
plea for, like, two years?

19
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,706
I turned it down. Maybe I
shouldn't have turned it down.

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,381
Two years is still a long
time. Zero years is the goal.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,020
<i>So the trick is to
go down fighting...</i>

22
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,049
<i>to fight for the right
cause, for the right person.</i>

23
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:58,251
We're drinking tonight.
It's my last day on Earth.

24
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,270
Stop! Stop talking
about drinking.

25
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,094
Stop talking about
last days on Earth.

26
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,190
The world is not
coming to an end.

27
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:07,260
<i>And if you go down,
you all go down together.</i>

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,027
Oh, we're drinking tonight.

29
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,615
We are the eye of the
storm on this, people.

30
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,185
Everything and everyone
is coming our way.

31
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,420
Code Yellow has been declared.

32
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,857
Disaster protocol is in effect
until you hear otherwise.

33
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,659
I'm recalling
all surgical staff.

34
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,895
Already recalled my nurses.
I've got the ER covered.

35
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,864
Klein's manning the OR floor.
Who do you have up there on...

36
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,933
Doctors Grey, Shepherd,
Baker, and Lowes

37
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:51,437
are on nonstop cut-and-paste
in ORs one through four.

38
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,689
Okay. I got one
from the supply room.

39
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,358
Also, why do we
keep these, anyways?

40
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,060
Who needs an
instant photo anymore?

41
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,329
Because an apartment
building collapsed

42
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,881
in the middle of Seattle.

43
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,750
Look, right now, we're getting
the victims, the survivors.

44
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:06,086
Then, in about 20 minutes,
we're gonna start getting

45
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,204
the people who love the victims,

46
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,457
their moms, and
husbands, and girlfriends,

47
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,776
and grandmas, and
friends, and children,

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,745
and wives with
babies in their arms.

49
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,532
This waiting room is going
to fill up with hopeful people

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,467
wanting to know where
their loved ones are.

51
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,903
Now, some of their
loved ones are here,

52
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,872
but most of their
loved ones are buried

53
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,107
under the rubble of
that collapsed building.

54
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:33,330
The only way to know for sure,
the only way they can identify

55
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,287
who made it to this
hospital and who didn't...

56
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,207
This photo... is
a golden ticket.

57
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,949
I want a photo of
every single patient...

58
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,847
on this board in the next hour.

59
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,449
- Got it?
- Got it.

60
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,584
Dr. Minnick. I have
surgical privileges.

61
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,021
Dr. Minnick! Well, I didn't
expect you until Monday.

62
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,890
I was unpacking and
I saw it on the news.

63
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,207
They said the injured
were coming here

64
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:04,010
and I thought, "Hey. I
work here. I should help."

65
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,279
- Yeah. Appreciate that.
- I better get into some scrubs.

66
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:08,181
Hey, jump in, and then
when this calms down,

67
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,983
- we can grab a cup of coffee.
- I'd love to.

68
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,152
Be a chance to get you
up to speed before I start.

69
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,456
I will find you.

70
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,506
Get me up to speed?

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,275
We have two incoming!
Dr. Webber, you're up!

72
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,032
Hey! You gotta
clear the driveway!

73
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,113
My kid's hurt! My kid's hurt!

74
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,177
Someone help, please!

75
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,584
- Someone help, please!
- Sir.

76
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,870
Sir. You need to
move your car now.

77
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,427
My kid's hurt real bad! Please!

78
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,592
Please help my baby!

79
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,695
Okay. Don't move
her. Don't move her.

80
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,452
Get me a gurney out here now!

81
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,208
- Whose patient is this?
- I've got O-neg!

82
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,555
- Another round of epi!
- Excuse me.

83
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,891
Ma'am, squeeze my fingers.
Need you to squeeze my fingers.

84
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,015
O-neg!

85
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,362
- Yeah?
- I gotta go home.

86
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,896
- I need to go home.
- No, you need to...

87
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,880
- My wife. My wife.
- You need to lie down, sir.

88
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,345
I need a priest. I'm dying.

89
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,366
- Sir, no, we...
- A priest, a pastor, anybody.

90
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,935
I need to talk to God.

91
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,552
- Andrew.
- Great. I could use
an extra hand.

92
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:22,488
Can you put these chart numbers
on the photos as I take them?

93
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,092
- Did you know about this?
- Know about what? The photos?

94
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,894
No. Bailey gave
me this huge lecture.

95
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,963
No, no. The trial.
They want me to testify.

96
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,731
They're calling me
to the stand tomorrow.

97
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,466
What? But they said
you didn't have to.

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,468
They said you were
drinking. You're not reliable.

99
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,532
Well, someone's
calling me to the stand.

100
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,490
Did you tell them? Did
you tell them about...

101
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:44,060
Jo, hey, hey. I
wouldn't do that, okay?

102
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,462
- Here.
- Well, they must know.

103
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,998
Somehow, they...
They started Googling,

104
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,566
and they figured out
that I changed my name,

105
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,619
and that there's a point where
Jo Wilson just isn't a person.

106
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:55,154
They might not know anything.

107
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,846
What if they ask?

108
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,342
If they ask, then
I have to answer.

109
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,500
Well, you don't have to.

110
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,088
It's court. Excuse me.

111
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,554
If I lie under oath and
get caught, it's a felony.

112
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,057
I would lose my medical license.
I have to tell the truth if they ask.

113
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,545
If I tell them, it's public record.
My husband could find me,

114
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,354
and everything that I
built is... is gone, done.

115
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,003
I'm sorry, Jo.

116
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,337
One minute, you're
fine, and the next minute,

117
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,801
everything just
collapses around you.

118
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,977
Jo...

119
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,809
Yeah, I've got a
depressed skull fracture.

120
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,211
- Is Shepherd here yet?
- I don't know.

121
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,379
Didn't you come in together?

122
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,798
Kepner, your guess is as
good as mine where she is.

123
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,417
- Is everything okay?
- Hey. I gotta get home.

124
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,386
- Sir, you need to lie down.
- My wife is...

125
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,444
I understand that,
sir. What's your name?

126
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,724
- Charlie.
- Okay, Charlie.

127
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,147
What I need you to do...

128
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,111
- All right.
- Thank you, Charlie.

129
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:53,446
- We got you. We got you.
- Okay.

130
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,314
I need an intubation
tray and a central line kit.

131
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,866
Draw a CBC and a cross-match.

132
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,092
Guys, open up a trauma room.
Riggs, we're gonna need a hand here.

133
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,824
No. I called. The
chaplain's MIA.

134
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,860
There may be a rabbi
up in geriatrics though.

135
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,628
- Could you do it?
- What? No.

136
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,330
All you have to do is listen to
him, nod your head a few times.

137
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,967
No. It's got to be
illegal or something.

138
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:15,768
- You're not gonna go to jail.
- Go to hell.

139
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,203
Please. You don't
believe in that.

140
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:18,705
But he does, and
that's good enough.

141
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,262
- Sir.
- Oh!

142
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,126
You're the priest?
I was gonna...

143
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,396
- No, sir.
- I was gonna... fix it.

144
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,564
Fix it?

145
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,499
They said it was the
earthquake last year.

146
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,401
The foundation was crumbling.

147
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,352
Is he talking
about the collapse?

148
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,256
I was getting the money.

149
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,312
And now...

150
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,048
all these people...

151
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,296
Please, please, forgive me.

152
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,319
Okay, okay, okay. Sir, sir...

153
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,007
I killed all these people.

154
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,977
Sir? Sir? Sir?

155
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,208
- I'll get
a crash cart.
- Okay. Notify CT.

156
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,284
Give five lorazepam
and start a benzo drip.

157
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,836
And somebody get a damn priest!

158
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:10,845
I'm here.

159
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,243
Right-sided hemothorax.

160
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,331
Put in a chest tube. It's already
drained 300 cc's of blood.

161
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,718
Winnie... sweetie, we're
right here. We're right here.

162
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,836
- How old is she?
- She's 12.

163
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,105
We just went to get coffee.
We were about a block away.

164
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,291
This is fresh blood.
She's actively bleeding.

165
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,476
Mr. Adkins, maybe you and
your wife should wait outside.

166
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,912
No, no, I'm not leaving my
daughter here. Please, no.

167
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,813
Cross her for eight and
set up a rapid infuser.

168
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:37,567
- I need a central line kit.
- Get the family
out of this room now!

169
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,801
It's gonna be... No.

170
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,703
Baby, we're gonna
be right outside, okay?

171
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,871
- I understand.
- We'll be right out here, okay?

172
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,161
We have to do our job.

173
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,095
<i>Dr. Carlyle to Peds.
Dr. Carlyle to Peds.</i>

174
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,032
- So, where is the landlord now?
- CT. Then he's going
in with Grey.

175
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,496
She's holed up in the OR doing
back-to-back surgeries all day.

176
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:59,055
Hmm, nice work, Father
Warren. Do you do weddings?

177
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,790
Okay, stop it. It was not cool.

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,694
He said, "Please forgive me."
What am I supposed to do with that?

179
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,517
Maybe, don't
pretend to be Jesus.

180
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,480
I think we got pictures of all
the patients in the back hallway.

181
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,417
He confessed to me. What
do I do? Do I go to the cops?

182
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,853
I think there's some sort of
confidence with priests, right?

183
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,388
He told you in confidence
as a man of God.

184
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,490
- I am not a priest!
- Amen.

185
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,593
Okay, what about
doctor-patient confidentiality?

186
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,917
- That doesn't apply.
- Fine. I'm out.

187
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,031
Does that apply?
How does that apply?

188
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,466
I'll tell you what applies.

189
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,835
Maybe you don't let
somebody confess to you

190
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,170
in the first place.

191
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,160
Because once you
know, you can't un-know.

192
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,708
The landlord knew that
there was earthquake damage,

193
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,692
and he didn't do
anything to fix it.

194
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,313
- Shady as hell.
- You at least tell the tenants.

195
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,749
You don't sit around hoping
the building doesn't fall down.

196
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,773
- 'Cause, guess what? Yeah.
- It's gonna fall down.

197
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,666
- That's my niece! That's Marissa.
- Okay. Just give me a second.

198
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,416
Okay, Marissa's
got a broken femur.

199
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,680
She's in post-op. I can show
you where she is, all right?

200
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,856
Yes, that's my husband.
He threw up blood?

201
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,274
Charlie threw up blood?

202
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,376
Yes, your husband has a gastric
injury and a tear in his diaphragm.

203
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,633
Oh, my God!

204
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,698
Dr. Riggs and I will be
taking him up to the OR now.

205
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,750
How did this happen?
What happened to him?

206
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,135
Your husband was in your
apartment when the building collapsed.

207
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,642
We don't live in an apartment.

208
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,580
Well, I'm sorry. I'll
update you, okay?

209
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,336
There he is.

210
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,624
Yeah, that's the guy. We're
gonna take him right up.

211
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,993
We were just in bed one minute.

212
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,429
Then the whole world caved in.

213
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know why... I was
okay and he was hurt so badly.

214
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,500
Look, I'll update you
as soon as we know.

215
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,007
Thank you.

216
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,711
I updated Charlie's wife.

217
00:09:58,048 --> 00:09:59,680
- Charlie's wife?
- Yup.

218
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,952
Charlie's married?
Our patient, Charlie?

219
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,706
- What's the matter with you?
- I just updated
Charlie's girlfriend.

220
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,147
Oh.

221
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's okay. It's okay.

222
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,145
Hey, I need some
oxygen over here.

223
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,382
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

224
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,016
Take some deep breaths,
deep breaths. Deep.

225
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,551
O2 is right here.

226
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,333
Okay.

227
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,074
It's okay. Lungs are clear.

228
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,876
Okay, make fists with your toes.

229
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,869
Tight, tight, tight
fists. Good job.

230
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,101
Wow. I haven't
seen that one before.

231
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,720
Slow, deep breaths.
It just distracts them.

232
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,689
- It's your first day?
- Sort of.

233
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,125
Just... jumping in where I can.

234
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,095
- Well, welcome.
- Thanks, Dr. Robbins.

235
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,097
Told you I wouldn't forget.

236
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,165
- Forget?
- Your name.

237
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,073
- Huh?
- You don't remember.

238
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,370
Wow. Okay, uh... Forget it.

239
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,822
I just... Last time I saw
you, I said you had a name

240
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,875
I couldn't forget,
and so I thought...

241
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,593
- Oh. I'm sorry. I don't...
- No.

242
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:08,761
It's fine.

243
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:11,002
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

244
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,039
Did you see that? Did
you see me winning?

246
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,307
You're saying he knew? Micah?

247
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,226
That's what we heard.
That for almost a year,

248
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,660
he knew there was
earthquake damage,

249
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,145
and he didn't do
anything about it!

250
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,329
What he did is criminal!

251
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,998
- It's negligence!
- Murder's what it is.

252
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,234
I heard Rhonda Coley didn't
even make it out of surgery.

253
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,668
- He can't get away with this!
- Harry.

254
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,436
He won't! If I have
a say, he won't!

255
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,322
Harry, Harry, the
doctors are here.

256
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,946
- Hi.
- How is she?

257
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,748
Winnie's injuries
are very severe.

258
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,017
Most urgently, she's
bleeding into her chest.

259
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,319
The tube we placed
is still draining blood.

260
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,476
So we'll need to
operate on her right away.

261
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,146
And then she's
gonna be okay, right?

262
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,481
Hey, hey. What'd they say?

263
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,333
- How's Winnie?
- She's in surgery.

264
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,302
Look, he's not gonna
get away with this!

265
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,326
That's exactly
what I'm trying to...

266
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,126
- Are you kidding me?
- I do not like the vibe here.

267
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:28,429
- Did you hear
that I was subpoenaed?
- Yeah, I...

268
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,593
My attorney's really
good. She says that...

269
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,251
Probably... I don't think
that we should talk about it.

270
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,914
Yeah, I don't
want to. It's just...

271
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,919
after tomorrow, we might
not get a chance to talk.

272
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,427
I might not see you after.

273
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,331
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

274
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,077
Alex, you've said that. I know.

275
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,969
I mean for the things I said.

276
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,489
You're not trash. Don't
ever let anyone say that.

277
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,044
I'm sorry, and I...

278
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,834
You're not trash, Jo.

- Dr. Minnick! You're here!
- Not yet. I start Monday.

281
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,709
I'm just volunteering today,
helping out where I can.

282
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:33,989
That's so cool.

283
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,091
Doesn't look like we'll
get our cup of coffee.

284
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,127
I can send you some
papers if you want.

285
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,761
And, you know,
you'll just be observing

286
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,365
the first few days anyway,
getting a sense of how it works.

287
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,132
That'll actually help
with the transition.

288
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,574
Transition? I thought you
two were working together.

289
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,377
Yes, we are.

290
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,081
- Has Dr. Bailey spoken with you?
- You know what?

291
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:58,503
- I think you and I should
sit down...
- You should talk to Dr. Bailey.

292
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,307
They're closing in
OR four. We're next.

293
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:10,609
Right on. So, what
do we do here?

294
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,344
I don't think we need
mesh for the diaphragm,

295
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:13,845
- just a running nylon suture...
- No, no.

296
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,748
Are we supposed to update
this guy's wife and girlfriend

297
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,484
separately, hope they never
meet? Do we sell them out?

298
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,519
Or are we enabling some
guy to cheat on his wife?

299
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:21,754
We don't have to do anything.

300
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,395
You cheat on your wife, it's
gonna come back to bite you.

301
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,835
We had our own problems.

302
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,056
Megan and I. That's...
that you're saying, right?

303
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:38,854
But we had problems, and
we were working on them.

304
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,963
And I'm not just making excuses,
but you weren't in our thing, so...

305
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,310
- You don't know...
- Riggs.

306
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,734
And you hold me
responsible. I know that.

307
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:52,356
But I promise you can't judge me
harsher than I judge myself everyday.

308
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,560
It's a life sentence, mate.

309
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,358
And you...

310
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,983
Well, maybe you can't
understand that 'cause you're...

311
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,186
Well, you'd never do it.

312
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,182
You're better than that.
You're better than me.

313
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,486
You always have been.

314
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,559
I'm not better.

315
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:16,897
I've made my mistakes.

316
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,698
Not...

317
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:20,869
Yeah.

318
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,052
You cheated?

319
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,421
On Shepherd?

320
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,442
On my first wife.

321
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,850
She made it sound like
you're stepping down.

322
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,002
You're not stepping down.

323
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,499
Have you talked to Dr. Bailey?

324
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,990
I tried paging her.
She's in surgeries all day.

325
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,337
Eliza Minnick
needs to stop talking

326
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,572
like she is running this
program if she's not.

327
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,197
Okay, Maggie. I
will talk to Dr. Bailey.

328
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,166
How's she doing?

329
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,369
The hilum's clamped,
but the PA is still bleeding.

330
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,971
Edwards, suction.

331
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,739
I saw Dr. Minnick earlier.

332
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,895
She's here already.

333
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,552
Lap pads.

334
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:12,203
- That's awesome.
- Edwards, more lap pads.

335
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,058
So, I was thinking
in honor of that...

336
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,356
do you think maybe I could
have a shot at repairing...

337
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,908
- You're not doing a repair.
- I've assisted Dr. Pierce
and you.

338
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,342
Dr. Minnick would say
I'm more than ready.

339
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,645
But Dr. Minnick would not
say that you could do this one,

340
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,514
because I've done over a
thousand, and this one's not holding.

341
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,778
And if I can't, you
sure as hell can't.

342
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,560
Father?

343
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,908
- Sir...
- I thought I was gonna be dead.

344
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,411
- Now, sir...
- I knew all those people.

345
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,014
The Goldmans, the
Richters, the Flemings.

346
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,415
I heard their stories.

347
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,783
I heard their problems,
their little victories.

348
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,275
I saw their children come
home from the hospital...

349
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,878
Elliot, David... Winnie.

350
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,126
They were my
family, these people.

351
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,183
That place, how
was I gonna fix it?

352
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:03,848
Couldn't raise their rent. Some
of them couldn't pay me already.

353
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:07,620
- Sir, I'm not a priest.
- I know. I don't care.

354
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,460
I just need someone
to forgive me.

355
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,411
I need them to know...

356
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,082
how sorry I am...
and to forgive me.

357
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,184
Will you, please?

358
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,603
Will you?

359
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:21,923
Will you forgive me?

360
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,742
Please?

361
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,776
Sir?

362
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,149
I need an intubation kit!

363
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,798
Pierce, try to gain
control more proximally.

364
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,083
DeBakey.

365
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:41,954
Pressure's dropping.

366
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,444
Come on! Come on!
Pierce, I can't see.

367
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,050
Damn it!

368
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,921
She's bleeding out. Damn it.

369
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,821
Damn it. Damn it! She's
in v-fib. Get a crash cart.

370
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:33,878
Charge to 200.

371
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,001
Charge again!

372
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,265
Hey.

373
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,488
Hey.

374
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,464
I'm married.

375
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,788
What?

376
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,404
I'm married.

377
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,040
What the hell are
you talking about?

378
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:06,725
Since before I met you,
and... I should have told you,

379
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:11,329
but I'm married to a guy
who almost beat me to death.

380
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,654
And... I can't divorce him...

381
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,224
because I ran away from him.

382
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,660
And I'm not...

383
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,566
Jo Wilson isn't my real name.

384
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,171
That's why I couldn't marry you.

385
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,842
That's how this whole
thing started, and...

386
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,245
I should have told you.

387
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,355
You're married?

388
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,243
Yes.

389
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,162
And you didn't tell me.

390
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,599
- I was scared. I...
- Scared of what?

391
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,363
Did you think I'd get mad?

392
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,047
You thought I'd get
mad at you for trying...

393
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,684
No, not at me, at him! I
thought you'd want to kill him!

394
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,185
And that you'd try
something stupid

395
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:10,923
and you'd get hurt, or
killed, or you'd get in trouble,

396
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:13,881
- and you... you'd...
- Wind up in jail.

397
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,688
It might all come
out in court tomorrow.

398
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,076
I wanted you to hear it from me.

399
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:55,672
After the trial, if I just take off, if
I leave, it's not because of you.

400
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,393
It's because my testimony will be a
matter of record, or whatever, but...

401
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:05,466
I don't want you to
think that it's you... ever.

402
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,638
Hey.

403
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,041
Don't go anywhere, no
matter what happens, okay?

404
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,528
I don't want him to find me.

405
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,383
- He can't find me.
- This is your life.

406
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,295
You're Jo Wilson.
You belong here.

407
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,781
<i>Vascular specialist to the E.R.
Vascular specialist to the E.R.</i>

408
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,152
Is she okay?

409
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,488
Sit down.

410
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,343
Sponge stick.

411
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,146
How did I not know you
were married before?

412
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:29,867
- And she moved to Finland?
- Switzerland. Suction.

413
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,599
We wanted different things.

414
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,869
I wanted a kid. She
did not want a kid.

415
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:40,593
No middle ground, no
compromise. Either or.

416
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,009
And here I am again.
Different person, same place.

417
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:47,645
- I'm right there again.
- Yeah, no, you're not.

418
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,109
You've been there once.
Now you know better.

419
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,616
Hey! How's the kid?

420
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:05,469
- The hyperventilating kid.
- Fine.

421
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,037
Oh.

422
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,755
- I like girls.
- What? Oh. Okay.

423
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,791
I mean, I feel like you
can't tell or something,

424
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:18,243
that I like women,
that I'm flirting with you.

425
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,228
You're not getting it,
and I'm really good at this.

426
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,264
I have game. Which means
either you're not into women

427
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,767
and the world is upside-down
bonkers, because I know,

428
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,270
or... you're not into me and
I'm totally deluding myself.

429
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,326
No.

430
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,876
- You are not deluding yourself.
- I'm not?

431
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,278
No. I am a human rainbow.

432
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,937
And you do. You've got a lot of
game. You have a very sexy...

433
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,240
somethin'-somethin'
going on, believe me.

434
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,072
But there's a thing about
you that bugged me.

435
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:49,491
You walk around like you
own the place. It's annoying.

436
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,381
Hmm... It's charming.

437
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,114
Do you want to grab
a drink some time?

438
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,317
See? That. That is what I mean.

439
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,319
No. I don't want to
grab a drink with you.

440
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,354
Yes. Yes, you do.

441
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:04,973
Shut up. Fine. I'll
have a drink with you.

442
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,714
And I promise,
you will not regret it.

443
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,091
Go away.

444
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,652
Who's next?

445
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,120
Splenic lac with
blood in the abdomen.

446
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,378
- We had to resuscitate her
in trauma.
- Show me.

447
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,248
Okay.

448
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,856
Finish up prepping her for
an ex-lap and I'll be right in.

449
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,531
Mer, you got a sec?

450
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,367
No. Not really. Unless
you want to scrub in.

451
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,791
- I won't tell Bailey.
- No.

452
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,804
Well, you're not gonna start with the
end of the world crap again, are you?

453
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,128
Jo's married.

454
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,408
Wait. What?

455
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,176
She's married, and
she's freaking out

456
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,979
that she has to take the
stand tomorrow and testify

457
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,113
and put herself on the line.

458
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,515
Herself on the line?
This is your trial.

459
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,185
- Your life is on the line.
- Look, she's scared, Mer.

460
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,619
What're you even
saying right now?

461
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,271
I just need to figure
out what to do.

462
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,658
Figure what out? You're not
even making any sense right now.

463
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,127
- You don't know the whole story.
- Okay. So tell it to me.

464
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,730
Dr. Grey, her BP is 90 over 40.

465
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,748
Okay, so hang two
units. I'll be right there.

466
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:04,933
You should go.

467
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,485
- I...
- Dr. Grey.

468
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,993
Yes. I'm coming. We're not done.

469
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,406
When this surgery is
over, I'm going to page you.

470
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,507
You're gonna come and tell me

471
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,792
- the rest of the story. Okay?
- Go.

472
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:14,816
Come back!

473
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,618
Ma'am, can I help you?

474
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,042
I'm looking for my husband.

475
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,465
Good. Yeah, he could...
He could use some company.

476
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,121
You haven't spoken to
the chief yet, have you?

477
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,069
- It's fine.
- No, it's not fine!

478
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,304
What Dr. Minnick said
is not fine. It sounds like

479
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,123
- she's taking your job.
- No. Pierce...

480
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:20,608
And what's worse is it sounds
like nobody has told you.

481
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,792
Maggie.

482
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,495
<i>Let me in!</i>

483
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,764
- What?
- It's Micah's fault!

484
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,908
Oh, no.

485
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,766
Just let us in.

486
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,886
I need you all to calm down.

487
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,887
- I have a right
to know where he is!
- I'm so sorry.

488
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,673
You don't, and I can't
give you that information.

489
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:37,292
- He killed my little girl!
- Please step back! Step back!

490
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,396
- Now, what is the problem?
They're looking for the landlord.

491
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,846
He's intubated right now,
but he was talking earlier.

492
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,434
He had a tough time. He
was... he was asking for a priest.

493
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:01,972
Thank you, Doctor.

494
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,077
Uh, I'll leave you two alone.

495
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,615
- Get out of our way!
- Move. Move now!

496
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:19,584
No one is hunting down
a patient in my hospital.

497
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:21,386
You want to get out
of my way right now!

498
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,110
- Harry. She's gone.
- No!

499
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:28,626
Winnie is gone! This is
not going to bring her back.

500
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,395
You'll go to jail.

501
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,415
And then your wife will lose
you both. This will not help.

502
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,755
Oh, my God!

503
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,057
She's gone.

504
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,311
Security! Security!
We need security!

505
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,958
- No, please!
- Damn it.

506
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,582
Up the O-2, 100 percent.

507
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,947
- What happened?
- She tried
to disconnect his vents.

508
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,850
She tried to suffocate
him. She tried to kill him!

509
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,870
Someone has to be
responsible. He knew it!

510
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,262
He has to be held
responsible for this. Please.

511
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,324
I have been in OR all day.

512
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,081
Well, you missed some things.

513
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:24,738
Ben feels terrible, says he
led the woman right to him.

514
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:29,309
She would have found him on her
own. Ben saved his life, is what he did.

515
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,497
I heard you were looking for me.

516
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,616
Bailey, who's running this
program? Me or Eliza Minnick?

517
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,557
I planned to tell you today.

518
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:47,010
Then she showed up
early, and all of this...

519
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,880
Today? Planned to tell me today?

520
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:54,196
And you'd have
tomorrow and the weekend

521
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,756
to adjust to the situation,
have your... feelings...

522
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,958
Start fresh on Monday.

523
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,125
That was me.

524
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:09,693
That's how I taught
you how to fire people.

525
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,329
No. No one's getting fired.

526
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,614
Yeah, right. But she'll
be running the program.

527
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,633
She's the Curriculum Director.

528
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,536
You are the Chairman of
the Residency Program.

529
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,478
- You're overseeing
the whole thing.
- I'm ornamental, you know it.

530
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,574
You didn't want to
discuss it with me.

531
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:24,775
You don't want to
hear my opinions

532
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,733
about a program that I
built, that I trained you in!

533
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:31,699
- That's not respect.
- I made a decision

534
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,136
about what is best for the
hospital moving forward,

535
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,605
and I didn't want
my personal feelings,

536
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,941
my Very strong
personal feelings,

537
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,900
to get in the way
of that decision.

538
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,921
If I do that, I won't
be able to do this job.

539
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:51,626
Bailey...

540
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,873
we reach into people's bodies

541
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:59,461
and hold their lives and
their futures in our hands.

542
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,686
There's nothing more
personal than this job,

543
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,267
in how we treat a patient,

544
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,243
in how we raise our doctors and
teach them how to do this work.

545
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:15,665
Every decision you make
should be a personal one.

546
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,203
If it isn't, then you have
no business being chief.

547
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,101
- Hey, do you have a second?
- Not really.

548
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,702
Look, I don't wanna
put you on the spot,

549
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,404
but you're on the
board of this hospital.

550
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,039
Almost done here.
You're doing great.

551
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,774
You're an Avery.
It's an Avery hospital.

552
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,331
Land the plane, Pierce.

553
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,434
- Eliza Minnick works here now.
- I'm aware.

554
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,448
She thinks she's the
new Residency Director,

555
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,288
like she's Richard
Webber's boss.

556
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,874
Minnick said that?

557
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,882
What is it, Karev?

558
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:08,980
I need to adjust
my pension account.

559
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,037
I need it signed over so
the money goes to my mom.

560
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,720
- Can you set that up for me?
- What are you talking about?

561
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,311
Can you send it to my
mom every month, please?

562
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,266
You don't think it's
gonna go well tomorrow.

563
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,883
Karev, what are you about to do?

564
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,791
You were right about the clinic.
It got my head back in the game.

565
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,522
You are not leaving this office

566
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,214
until you tell me
what is going on.

567
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,627
Okay, you have five
minutes. Let's go.

568
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:11,609
I'm going to the district
attorney's tonight,

569
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,617
and I'm gonna take
the plea he offered.

570
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,652
Okay, that's not funny.

571
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,386
What're you talking about?

572
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,970
I'm gonna plead out.
I'll be gone two years.

573
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,756
- I just... I just wanted to say...
- You're not doing this!

574
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,142
I am. It's my choice.

575
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,832
Why? Because of Jo?

576
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,664
No. Because I did it. And
I'm gonna go say I did it.

577
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:34,865
No, you're not.

578
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,917
It'd save everyone a
lot of time and trouble.

579
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,454
Alex, you're gonna go home
and get a good night's sleep.

580
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,639
- And then, tomorrow...
- There's not gonna be
a tomorrow.

581
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,624
Yeah. Tomorrow you're
gonna go into the court,

582
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,326
and you're gonna
tell them who you are,

583
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,612
that you're a surgeon
who saves children,

584
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:49,964
that you make
waffles for children,

585
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,033
that you did one stupid thing.

586
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,451
And you will face whatever
it is you have to face,

587
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,153
but you are not
going to throw yourself

588
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,824
on the mercy of whatever,
and walk into prison, okay?

589
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,425
You'll be okay.

590
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,949
Me? This is about you!

591
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,297
You think this is noble,
what you're doing?

592
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:09,038
It isn't. It's giving up.

593
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,953
It's buying into everything
you've ever said about yourself,

594
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,104
and I won't let you do it!

595
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,761
- Look, you'll be fine.
- You are not going to jail!

596
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,309
You'll be just fine.

597
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,161
Stop making this about me!

598
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,830
Stop using me as an excuse
to make yourself feel better.

599
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,089
Of course, I will be fine! I'm
always fine. Don't you know that?

600
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:29,692
This is about you!

601
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,364
You will be destroyed. Your
life, your career, everything...

602
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:36,683
will be finished.

603
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,819
Who you are will be gone.

604
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,804
I'd hug you goodbye,
but I'm not scrubbed.

605
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,673
Well, because this
isn't goodbye, Alex.

606
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:51,526
You don't walk in here when
I'm in the middle of a surgery.

607
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,945
Dr. Grey? We're
ready for you in the...

608
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:55,896
- I need a minute.
- Kiss the kids for me.

609
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,317
No, Alex. Alex, you're
not gonna walk out of here.

610
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,140
- Dr. Grey.
- I heard you!

611
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,226
Goodbye, Mer.

612
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,629
Alex!

613
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,345
- He did very well.
- Your husband
came through great.

614
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,497
- Everything went just fine.
- He's awake and responsive.

615
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,401
- Can I see him?
- When can I see him?

616
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:34,207
Don't see why not.

617
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,888
As soon as you'd like.
I'll get a nurse, okay?

618
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,473
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

619
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,017
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,799
- Not our business, right?
- Not our business.

621
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,237
Look, you want to grab a beer?

622
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:51,791
Actually... I want to go
home and see my wife.

623
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:54,071
I get it.

624
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,206
Another time? Rain check.

625
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,510
Right on.

626
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,824
- Hey, let me know
how it goes, huh?
- Yeah.

627
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,851
They don't get to
make this decision.

628
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,653
There is nothing
wrong with this program,

629
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,487
and it is totally
disrespectful to you.

630
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,790
- Maggie...
- If they want a fight,
they can have it.

631
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,448
- I am not scared.
- Maggie! Look, I appreciate it.

632
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,234
But, um...

633
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,504
I'm not sure this
is a fight I can win.

634
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
I'll fight with you.

635
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,959
I'm touched... that you want to.

636
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,396
I really am.

637
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,013
Come here.

638
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,365
Look, I know a lot of you guys
didn't come up in this program.

639
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,922
But I did. April did.

640
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,986
And the difference
between the education

641
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,205
that we got at Mercy West
and what we got under Webber?

642
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:46,324
- No. There's no comparison.
- This is ridiculous.

643
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,631
He is the program.

644
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,662
So, if you guys are
as pissed as we are...

645
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,354
- Yes!
- and you really,
really should be...

646
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:00,343
See? It's not just me.

647
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,689
Hey.

648
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,794
You okay?

649
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,798
You want to talk about it?

650
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,720
I know. I know.
Church and state.

651
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,906
No.

652
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:36,195
No. To hell with
church and state.

653
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,208
It's not working.

654
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:42,101
It's not worth it. It's
not how to do this job.

655
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,104
I need to talk to you
about something.

656
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,124
Okay, okay, look, I didn't
impersonate a priest exactly.

657
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:51,477
What? No. I'm
not talking about...

658
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,731
- Wait. What?
- What are you talking about?

659
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,534
Alex Karev.

660
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,918
- Hey.
- Oh. Sorry.

661
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,687
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave.

662
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,525
I got pulled on a case. But you
want to see something gross?

663
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,727
Look, about tomorrow...

664
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,411
Oh. I told Alex.

665
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,164
I told him everything.
And you were right.

666
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,639
I should have told him right
away because... it was okay.

667
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,027
And we are... we're...

668
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,224
I just feel like whatever
happens tomorrow

669
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:30,694
is gonna happen,
and... I'm not worried.

670
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:32,835
Not gonna worry. I feel okay.

671
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,621
Well, uh...

672
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,806
I'm sorry. I have to go.

673
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,026
- Right.
- Okay.

674
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:57,772
You're here to see
the district attorney.

675
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,274
- Is he expecting you?
- Tell him it's Alex Karev.

676
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,176
I'm the defendant
in the trial tomorrow.

677
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,544
I'll let him know.

678
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,844
<i>Alex, listen to me.</i>

679
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:38,668
Grab my phone, call Alex Karev,
and put it on speaker for me, please.

680
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,268
<i>You've just reached
Dr. Alex Karev.</i>

681
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,292
<i>I'm not here right now,
so leave a message.</i>

682
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:48,778
Alex, listen to me.

683
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:52,381
<i>You're better than
this. You're stronger.</i>

684
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,797
<i>Don't make this all your fault.</i>

685
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,186
<i>I know you.</i>

686
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,589
<i>That's what you do.</i>

687
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,996
<i>But, please...</i>

688
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,099
<i>Please don't do that.</i>

689
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,922
<i>We can't just give up,
not after all this time.</i>

690
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,175
<i>We have to stand
together. We have to fight.</i>

691
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,328
Because it's just us now.

692
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,682
There were five of us,
and now it's just you and I.

693
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,352
And it can't be
just me. It can't be.

694
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:34,018
<i>I will go down
swinging for you, Alex.</i>

695
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,174
<i>You know I will.</i>

696
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,851
<i>But that means
you can't give up.</i>

697
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,512
<i>You don't throw the fight.</i>

698
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,596
<i>So, whatever
you're doing this for...</i>

699
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,897
Mr. Karev?

700
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,099
<i>Please...</i>

701
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,421
He'll see you now.

702
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,957
<i>Don't.</i>

703
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,159
Mr. Karev?

704
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:12,928
Mr. Karev?
