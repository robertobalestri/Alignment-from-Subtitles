00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,679
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,115
I want a wife and a
house and a family!

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,484
Amelia and Owen's
wedding today, I want that!

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:11,188
I can't marry him, because
I'm already married.

5
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,323
Don't do that, okay?
Let's get you into bed.

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,414
All right. Stop!

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,312
- Dr. Karev,
hold on! Okay?
- Hey!

8
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:20,468
Alex!

9
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:23,616
<i>You made an astonishing
error in judgment!</i>

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,686
If you had been anyone else,
you wouldn't have been suspended.

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,872
You would've been fired!
I'm done talking about this.

12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,029
Church and state!

13
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:34,410
<i>My baby is dying! Its blood
supply is cut off and it's going to die!</i>

14
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,880
You saved two lives today.

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,064
- I like him.
- Who?

16
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,154
<i>Riggs. I really like him.</i>

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,287
<i>Don't you wish you
could just, take it back?</i>

18
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,273
<i>That thing you said?
That thing you did?</i>

19
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,525
They look very happy. They do.

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,660
Yeah, that won't last.

21
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,463
I'm not saying I don't want it
to. I'm not just being an arse.

22
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,239
- Actually.
- It's never been
my experience of happiness...

23
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,953
That it lasts.

24
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,872
<i>There's no undo button.</i>

25
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:22,709
<i>There's only hoping we can
learn, we can change. Right?</i>

26
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,260
<i>We can do better.</i>

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,984
Has it been yours?

28
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:30,851
- But we have to do this
right now? You're right...

29
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,084
time and place, my bad.

30
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,304
They did literally
just get married,

31
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,123
so let's try to be happy for
them for, like, five minutes.

32
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,608
- Absolutely!
- Okay.

33
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,328
Yes! Let's be happy.
You want to dance?

34
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,517
I'm not that happy.

35
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,059
All right. Well, then... you
want to get out of here?

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,971
- And do what?
- Be somewhere... else. Together.

37
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,822
<i>Can't take back what we've done.</i>

38
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,908
- So are we doing this?
- Doing what?

39
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,877
Dancing! It has been
a very stressful day,

40
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,815
and now it is over. The newlyweds
are wed, mission accomplished!

41
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:05,168
And now is traditionally the time
when we dance. So who's with me?

42
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,592
- Not her.
- I guess it's you then.

43
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,532
<i>We can't undo the past.</i>

44
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,732
<i>'Cause the future
keeps coming at us.</i>

45
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,985
- What we got?
- Male, mid-twenties,

46
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,072
status post blunt trauma
to the face and neck.

47
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,757
Oh, my God, DeLuca.

48
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,059
Possible zygomatic
fracture, a broken nose.

49
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,317
- He might have a brain injury.
- What happened?

50
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,632
We'll need a CT. All right,
let's get him to Trauma One.

51
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,583
- Let's go.
- Page Avery!

52
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:40,069
- Two champagnes.
- You got it.

53
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,671
I thought you were
dancing with Maggie.

54
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,557
Ah, Webber cut
in. Where were we?

55
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:52,799
- You have to stop.
- Stop what?

56
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,987
You have to stop being
where I am, talking to me.

57
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,857
Sounds unreasonable, with our jobs.
Besides, I like being where you are.

58
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,282
Stop. We have a
problem. I have a problem.

59
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,786
- What's that?
- Hold this. My phone is ringing.

60
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,507
Jo. Hey, Wilson. What's up?

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,594
Wilson? Slow down, slow
down, slow down. Take a breath.

62
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,480
What happened to DeLuca?

63
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,469
You're too good! I
can't keep up with you.

64
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,549
You should have
seen me in high school.

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,575
In high school, I only
danced in my room.

66
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,407
Meredith's a good dancer! Meredith's
always trying to get people to dance.

67
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,542
Something has
happened to DeLuca.

68
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,177
- What?
- He's in the ER.

69
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,746
He's been hurt.
That's all I know.

70
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,298
- I should go. Should I go?
- Go.

71
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,699
She's been drinking.
Can you drive her?

72
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,203
- Sure.
- Where are you going?

73
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,445
- God!
- What happened?

74
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,415
Broken nose, bleeding
posteriorly. I paged Avery.

75
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,416
No, Karev, what happened to him?

76
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,651
He's got a hyphema.

77
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,175
The anterior chamber of
his eye is filled with blood.

78
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:09,214
DeLuca, look up for
me? Yeah, it's entrapped.

79
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,431
DeLuca, DeLuca!

80
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,599
- It's all right.
- He's bleeding into his airway.

81
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,667
- He's aspirating.
- We need to intubate him.

82
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,341
Push 20 of etomidate.

83
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,454
Chief? The police are here.

84
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,457
-Where's Avery? ISAAC:
I put a call to plastics.

85
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,425
I didn't ask for plastics,
I asked for Avery!

86
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,029
I'm here, I'm here.
What the hell?

87
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,031
Looks like orbital floor
fracture with entrapment.

88
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,707
Who did this? Well, head
and face CT are pending.

89
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,394
Look, can you just
reset his nose, please?

90
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,782
What happened, Jo?

91
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:53,502
He shouldn't have come back
here. Shouldn't have come back here.

92
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,939
- Who shouldn't have
come back here?
- Here you go. Just take it easy.

93
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,359
- Jo, where is Alex now?
- Now's not the time.

94
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,722
- Will you stay with her?
- Me? She called you.

95
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,904
I need to reduce this
fractured septum...

96
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,391
bruising around the clavicle. There's
an obvious deformity. He broke it.

97
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,926
All right, let's
get a chest film.

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,444
Start him on a lorazepam drip.

99
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:56,215
All right, on my
count. One, two, three!

100
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,918
CT's ready.

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,171
Alex, may I speak
to you for a moment?

102
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,373
- Ready to go?
- I got it.

103
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,291
- Alex?
- All right, let's go.

104
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:07,916
- Alex!
- I got this.

105
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,436
- Now.
- All right. Let's move him.

106
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,036
- Say something.
- What do you want me to say?

107
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,578
You think no one is gonna realize
this is you? Look at that hand!

108
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,226
You could go to
jail. This is assault.

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,766
I'm a doctor. I have a
duty to report you to Bailey.

110
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,106
I came home. He
was on top of her.

111
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,275
Jo was drunk.

112
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,246
He was... he...

113
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,999
Mer, come on.

114
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,970
You're gonna turn
me in to Bailey?

115
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,098
You slipped in the rain.
That's how you hurt your hand.

116
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:11,296
Mer! Hey! Have you seen Andrew?

117
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,743
- I heard it's bad,
they said it's bad.
- They're taking him to CT.

118
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,569
Oh, my God! What happened?

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,573
I don't know.

120
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:46,725
- DeLuca. He's a surgeon here?
- Uh, he's a surgical resident,
yes.

121
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,177
You don't know the
nature of the incident?

122
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,080
Well, his face is
smashed in, so...

123
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,098
- I mean as it pertains to...
- That's all I know.

124
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:55,301
It might have... He
might have been mugged.

125
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,886
Might've been a bar fight.

126
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,506
He was with one of our doctors
when he came in, Dr. Karev.

127
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,941
That's...

128
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:05,778
K-A-R-E-V. I'll
tell him to find you.

129
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,429
<i>Seattle to 11-93.</i>

130
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,183
Excuse me. Tatum, go ahead.

131
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,227
Chief, you want me
to page Dr. Hunt?

132
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,440
On his wedding night?
Why would you that?

133
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,231
Kepner's out. Hunt's out. I'm just
wondering who's covering trauma.

134
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,033
Uh...

135
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,003
uh... looks like it's you.

136
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,833
Come on.

137
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,818
What, you mean
it? I'm coming back?

138
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,953
I said it looks
like you, didn't I?

139
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,639
Um, look, if you see
Karev, have him find me.

140
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,058
Why? What do you think happened?

141
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,898
I don't know what happened,
that's why I want to find Karev.

142
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,202
Miranda.

143
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,271
What?

144
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,124
Nothing, nothing.

145
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,361
All right.

146
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:59,070
DeLuca came into the ER,
apparently beaten pretty badly.

147
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,789
Can you tell me what happened?

148
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,494
I don't remember anything.

149
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,243
Was he here with you?

150
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,921
Jo... did DeLuca hurt you?

151
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,852
Do I need to call the
police? Did he try...

152
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:24,312
No! No, no. He... It wasn't
his fault. It was my fault, I...

153
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,877
I ruined it, I
ruined everything.

154
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,846
- How?
- He brought me home

155
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,919
and then I told him...

156
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:35,957
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

157
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,754
- What? You told him what?
- I have to go to the hospital.

158
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,122
I have to see Alex. I
have to talk to him...

159
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,475
No, you're not
gonna go anywhere.

160
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,095
Now, is there someone I could
call? Your mom or your dad?

161
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,388
I don't have... You
don't know anything.

162
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,073
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,508
- Wilson, who can I call?
- Just please go.

164
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,142
No. Not when you're like this.

165
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,679
Yes, because I am drunk and
gross and I am your surgeon.

166
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,865
I'm one of your surgeons.
I'm a good surgeon.

167
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,505
This isn't me. So I just...

168
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,091
I'm okay now.

169
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,939
So I will see you again,
when I am a surgeon, okay?

170
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,759
- So just please go.
- No, no, you drank too much,
okay.

171
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,962
You screwed up, and now everything
is crashing down around you.

172
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,097
Just go.

173
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,965
Hey, well, you
came to the right guy.

174
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,389
Because I've done it
more than you ever will.

175
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,658
And I can tell you
from experience.

176
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,683
With a little coffee,
and a little sunlight,

177
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,820
your troubles will get smaller.

178
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,073
And the world
will keep standing.

179
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,261
I promise. Okay?

180
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:50,615
Okay.

181
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,887
- I have coffee.
- Good.

182
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,227
We'll get you some
food... and some aspirin,

183
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,664
and... you'll feel better.

184
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,201
You know it'll...
come back to you.

185
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,716
And whatever
happened, you can tell me.

186
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,402
Or you can tell me
who you'd like to talk to.

187
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,226
Sound all right?

188
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,831
Well, hell.

189
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,301
Go around the block!

190
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:33,369
<i>69-06. Dr. Marlin...</i>

191
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,759
What's wrong?

192
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,813
Nothing. It's
just... It's weird.

193
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,699
We broke up... Badly.

194
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,403
I'm not sure I'm the
person he wants to see.

195
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,774
Forget it! I'm being crazy.

196
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,554
- Huh.
- What?

197
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,746
No, I thought you
were still with him.

198
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,833
With DeLuca? Me?
No. You thought that?

199
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,113
Yeah, I mean, you were very...

200
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,840
No! No. He broke...
We broke... It ended.

201
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,571
- Okay.
- Yeah, a while ago.

202
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,490
- Okay.
- It was just too hard, you know,

203
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:11,690
with us working together...

204
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:14,093
- Yeah, well, I get that.
- Not that it couldn't work

205
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,546
at work with work
people. I think it can.

206
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,852
It could! With the
right work people.

207
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,053
Oh, God!

208
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,485
Hi. It's Maggie. I'm here.

209
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,716
Has he been conscious?

210
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,060
He was on intake,
but we had to tube him.

211
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,537
- What's it look like?
- His head CT's clear,

212
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,794
but he does have an
eight-ball hyphema.

213
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,609
- Who did this?
- We don't know.

214
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,027
Karev brought him in, but we
haven't heard what happened yet.

215
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,746
We should find out
who we need to call.

216
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,481
I'm gonna go grab
his personnel file.

217
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,856
His mother. She's
probably at work.

218
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,425
I'll call her. She knows me.

219
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,623
How is he? Is
there a brain injury?

220
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,405
- He just got out of CT.
- Did you see his scan?

221
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,807
Well, no, but the
radiologist said they're clear.

222
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,142
Will you look at it yourself?

223
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,844
- Alex, they said...
- What if they missed something?

224
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,497
What if he has a delayed bleed
and he drops dead tomorrow?

225
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,504
I will. I will look
at the scans.

226
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,719
Alex, this is really bad.

227
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,022
It's bad. I know. I know.

228
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,681
I just... I went
crazy. I just... I...

229
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:46,106
What if I talk to DeLuca, just,
you know, before he says anything.

230
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,771
Maybe you should
talk to the police.

231
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,757
No, no, no. Can we wait
until we find out how bad it is?

232
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:55,699
You know, just... go... Go
check his scans, please.

233
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I will go check the scans.

234
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,540
Hey, um, have you
talked to the police yet?

235
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:12,111
Uh, yeah. Uh, no.
I mean... Uh why?

236
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,118
Miranda said you
should come see her.

237
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,999
- How's the hand?
- What?

238
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,267
It looked like it was
giving you trouble earlier.

239
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,625
Oh. I slipped in the rain.

240
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,290
Look, man, uh...

241
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,760
DeLuca's gonna clear everything
when he gets out of surgery,

242
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,134
- so... is there anything...
- There isn't.

243
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,452
Okay.

244
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,157
You know, I got the guy
here. I helped him, okay?

245
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,187
Hmm...

246
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,784
This eye's a big problem. His
pressure is getting out of control.

247
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,769
Need to get him to OR
with an ophthalmologist.

248
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,455
- Could he lose his eyesight?
- The thing is the eye
is paralyzed.

249
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,907
Trapped in the fractured socket.

250
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,409
We get in there, we free
it, then we drain the blood.

251
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,245
I've called in Jan
Reger, she's great,

252
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,730
- but she's in Whidbey Island. So...
- You can't do it?

253
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,482
Uh, technically,
yes, I could do it.

254
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,667
Then, why wait for Jan Reger?

255
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:09,017
She's an ophthalmologist.
I'd rather have...

256
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,071
It's his eyesight. It's his
career, Jackson. Let's not wait.

257
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:14,162
She's right. Avery,
if you can do it, do it.

258
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,547
I'll do it.

259
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:21,869
- How's Kepner doing?
- She's good. She's sleeping.

260
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,465
What are you doing?

261
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,370
Hey! I'm here, I'm here.

262
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,985
She was just
fussing a little bit,

263
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,645
so I thought you could use the
sleep, and I just swooped her up.

264
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,731
We are bonding.

265
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:55,570
Somebody's just fascinated
with their grandma.

266
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,256
Riveted! Yeah!

267
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:04,590
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay. Hurt.

268
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:08,933
No doubt. April, I can't
believe what you went through.

269
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,502
It was worth it.

270
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:17,908
She's beautiful. She's
just absolutely beautiful.

271
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,326
Mm-Hmm.

272
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:22,382
I just wish I knew
what to call her.

273
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,767
- Jackson didn't tell you?
- No, I just got here.

274
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,982
He'd probably want
to be here to tell you.

275
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,005
We don't have to wait for him.

276
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,612
Well, uh...

277
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:44,230
We wanted something
strong... memorable...

278
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:48,890
Is it Catherine? Are
you little Catherine?

279
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,361
We thought there could
only be one Catherine.

280
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,247
Her name is Harriet.

281
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,768
Harriet!

282
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,520
Mm-hmm.

283
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:09,560
I like it. Tubman.

284
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,880
Exactly. Tubman.

285
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:17,029
Also<i> The Spy.</i> Which
is a very good book.

286
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:22,940
I love it. Harriet Avery.
It's beautiful, it just flows!

287
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,393
I'm sorry. Who said
her name was Avery?

288
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,287
Are those Andrew's head
CTs? I thought they were clean.

289
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,922
Yeah. I'm just double-checking.

290
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,462
I want to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

291
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:48,132
- They look good.
- Thanks.

292
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:52,653
God! What do you think happened?

293
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,969
I don't know. Maybe a
mugging or something?

294
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,913
I just got off the
phone with his parents.

295
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:06,979
And, apparently... he neglected
to tell them that we had broken up.

296
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,669
Oh, God.

297
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,266
Mer, was I really crappy to him?

298
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,486
DeLuca? He broke up with you.

299
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,026
He's a good, good guy.

300
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,441
Am I being stupid?

301
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,144
Chasing after Riggs, when
DeLuca was right there?

302
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,052
- I mean, am I being stupid?
- I don't know. Maybe.

303
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,466
I was gonna talk
to Riggs tonight.

304
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,210
At the wedding, while we
were dancing, I was gonna say,

305
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,043
"Hey, how about you and me?"

306
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,808
And then Richard
Webber jock-blocked me.

307
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:37,512
Of course.

308
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:40,618
And now, Riggs thinks
I'm in love with DeLuca.

309
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,237
I swear, maybe this is just...

310
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,073
Hey!

311
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:48,703
What are you doing in scrubs?
I thought I'm going in on Avery.

312
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,912
Yeah. I'm going in.
Not to operate. Just...

313
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,762
- I don't know.
- To hold his hand.

314
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,919
- I guess so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

315
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,117
- It's stupid.
- It's not at all! He's a good guy.

316
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,786
Nothing wrong with that.

317
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,420
I know, but I'm
not... I don't...

318
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,695
Come on, he's gorgeous.
You can't do much better.

319
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,916
Good luck. I hope it works out.

320
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:14,902
Okay.

321
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,505
Thanks.

322
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,237
Hmm. You all right, then?

323
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,852
Thank you for bringing Maggie.

324
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,253
I said "Are you all right?"

325
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,323
I'm fine. You don't need to do
that. You don't need to check on me.

326
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,858
What? I'm a nice
guy. I'm being nice.

327
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,076
- It's what I do.
- You were very nice.

328
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,684
You did a nice thing for
Maggie. But now you're ruining it.

329
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,338
You okay?

330
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,302
Listen, Alex, it wasn't...

331
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,493
You were drunk. It
wasn't your fault, I know.

332
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,539
What are you talking about?

333
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,443
DeLuca. He pushed
himself on you, right?

334
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,261
You were drunk, he
tried to take advantage...

335
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,481
No! No, no, no, no...
Alex. I was drunk, yes,

336
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,766
because I was upset
you had left and I...

337
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,585
You were upset
about us? About me?

338
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,920
Yes, of course!

339
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,040
This is what you do? You bring
this guy back to our place to screw?

340
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,607
If you would just let me talk...

341
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,710
- Oh! 'Cause you were upset.
- Just listen to me!

342
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,067
You know what? Forget it.

343
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,287
It's like I said... you can't
help it, it's not your fault.

344
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,317
It's easy for you to
throw people away,

345
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,158
to just move on
when things are bad.

346
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,246
It's not you. It's the way
you were raised or not raised.

347
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,600
I wanted to marry you.

348
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,337
I was asking you for
something you're not capable of.

349
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,540
I should have known better.

350
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,865
Okay. So, first, the muscle
of his eye... is trapped here...

351
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,192
in the bone fracture, so
I'm just gonna... pop it out.

352
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,090
There we go. All right.

353
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:41,026
- Micro scalpel, please.
- Will he see again?

354
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,313
We'll see. Once I am able
to flush the blood out of there,

355
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,733
his intraocular pressure
should come down,

356
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:50,907
and his vision should
return. But don't worry.

357
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,156
His eyes should be
just as pretty as ever.

358
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,824
Will everyone stop doing that?

359
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,165
I want his eyes to work
because they're his eyes.

360
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,178
Sorry. You're right.

361
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:03,387
And he's a surgeon. He can't
be one with one eye. Okay?

362
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:09,042
It doesn't mean that I love
him or I miss him or I'm pining.

363
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:10,841
He's a friend.

364
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,858
No, he's not a friend because
the breakup was a train wreck,

365
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:16,712
and he probably hates
me, but he is a person,

366
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,720
or was a person, that
I was personal with.

367
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,334
I mean, you had feelings.
You had huge feelings,

368
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,620
you can't be expected just to

369
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,939
turn those feelings
off like some robot.

370
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:29,941
Especially if you've been through
something horrible together.

371
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,076
- I get it.
- Yeah, you do.

372
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,947
- Try having a baby with him.
- That's okay. I'm good.

373
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,648
- Fair enough.
- How we doing?

374
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:39,189
Good. Almost done here.

375
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,088
How is he?

376
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,491
He's got a grade four hyphema.

377
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,055
Dr. Avery's trying
to drain it now.

378
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,163
- But?
- I'd be worried about re-bleeds,

379
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,177
- long-term vision loss.
- Which would mean...

380
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,521
Whoever did this just ended
his career as a surgeon.

381
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:18,194
You know, I, um... I
think I know who it is.

382
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,819
- Why haven't you said anything?
- Not sure.

383
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,381
I think because I can
guess what he did.

384
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,669
He reacted. In a split
second, in the moment,

385
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,744
and a horrible thing happened.

386
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,614
I know what that's like.

387
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,768
What about you?
Is it just blind loyalty?

388
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,272
It's not blind. He's earned it.

389
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,637
When I first got here,

390
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,579
he was one of the worst
people I had ever met in my life.

391
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,264
And now he's one of the best.

392
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,635
And I know both of those
people are still in there.

393
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,503
I just want to make
sure the right one wins.

394
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:09,013
Well, anyway, I... I don't
think it should come from me.

395
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,332
Me, either.

396
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,709
- Okay. There you are.
- What are you doing here?

397
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,811
Webber called, said he
thought you might be with me.

398
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,581
He said DeLuca got beat
up, and then you ran off.

399
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,750
Look, I'm here 'cause I'm your
friend, dummy. What happened?

400
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,023
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

401
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,798
- Okay, fine. I'll drive you...
- No, I'm leaving, leaving.

402
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,168
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.

403
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,165
You're quitting the program.

404
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,668
And you're not gonna
tell me what this is?

405
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,603
- I can't.
- You... Okay, hey!

406
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:55,770
What the hell? Jo.

407
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,281
What happened with
DeLuca? You can talk to me.

408
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,219
I'm the one that left you
at the bar with him. What?

409
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:13,393
She was upset about Karev.
She was also really drunk.

410
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,291
- So you left her with DeLuca?
- To keep her safe, yes.

411
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,926
I didn't want to
leave her there alone.

412
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,945
He made sure she got home
okay. And you have to understand...

413
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,799
I do! She wanted
to hurt Alex back.

414
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,416
But she may have hurt
him for good, this time.

415
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,368
I mean, this could
end his career!

416
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,572
I mean, this goes well beyond
just sleeping with another guy.

417
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,891
- She didn't sleep with DeLuca.
- Did he force himself on her?

418
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,800
No, he... He kept her safe!

419
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:39,697
He got her home, he
made sure she was okay.

420
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,567
DeLuca was kind and
nice and thoughtful.

421
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,819
And DeLuca was trying to
keep her from getting hurt,

422
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,572
or from hurting herself.
And then you walked in.

423
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,908
Okay, how do you know Edwards
isn't lying about the whole thing?

424
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:52,728
Because I wanted her
to be. Which is awful.

425
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:56,264
But I was hoping for some reason
that you beat that man half to death,

426
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,284
that doesn't make you a monster.
You know she wasn't lying.

427
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,918
Is DeLuca out of
surgery? Did he wake up?

428
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,510
You have to go to
Bailey and say something.

429
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:09,400
- If he presses charges...
- He should
press charges.

430
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,014
He's not the bad guy here.
And Jo isn't the bad guy.

431
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,267
We're the bad guys,
really bad guys.

432
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,419
If I don't say something, if
you don't say something...

433
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,323
- I want to run.
- You can't run.

434
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:28,079
I thought I'd grown up. I
said this to Jo yesterday.

435
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:31,165
I went back there to talk to
her and make things right.

436
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,923
To do the grown-up thing.

437
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,442
Alex...

438
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,713
Let me talk to DeLuca.
Just let me try. Okay?

439
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,163
Wilson.

440
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,679
Did you hear what happened?

441
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,688
Not yet. But I know it's
not worth leaving here.

442
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,044
I made a mess. I can't fix it.

443
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,065
I can only make it worse.
So I am walking away from it.

444
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,048
It's better for everyone.
Okay? Move, please.

445
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,034
No! I don't know what happened,

446
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,710
but whatever it is, you won't
get it fixed by running from it.

447
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,929
And you won't gain
anything by quitting.

448
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,499
We don't quit!

449
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:35,668
I won't let you.

450
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:42,654
Now, you ditched me once today.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

451
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,665
I mean, she's your baby. You
can call her whatever you want.

452
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,441
Just as long as it's Avery.

453
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,945
I'll say this... Avery
wasn't my name either.

454
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:04,959
But I took it on and
built it into something.

455
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,602
And the name that I built,
will open doors for this girl.

456
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,982
I'm just thinking of her future.

457
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,640
Yeah, well, the name
Kepner means something, too.

458
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:15,875
What?

459
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:22,682
Where I come from, it means
good people. A tireless work ethic.

460
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,069
A fair and honest
price for quality pork.

461
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,517
The people you call
when you're in trouble.

462
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,493
Yeah, it may not open doors,
but Kepner means something!

463
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,040
Now, can I have my...

464
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,943
It's all right. It's all
right. I've got her.

465
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,363
No, Catherine, I can
hold my own baby.

466
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,454
No, April, you
can't. No, you can't!

467
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,169
You nearly died bringing
her into this world.

468
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:52,629
You did something superhuman,
so now you get to rest and heal.

469
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:56,166
Harriet's just fine.
She's got her grandma,

470
00:28:56,618 --> 00:29:01,120
that's what grandmas
are for. So now, just relax!

471
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:06,076
Sleep for an hour. You're gonna
have her whole life to hold her.

472
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:11,531
Rest and heal. She's
gonna need you.

473
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:22,621
Couldn't you hyphenate?
Avery-Kepner?

474
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:24,611
- We are hyphenating, Mom.
- Oh.

475
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:30,734
- That's what we decided. Right?
- Yes. Kepner-Avery.

476
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,481
Well, why didn't you say that?

477
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,556
Because she's my baby.

478
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,593
That's your baby.
She is my baby.

479
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,836
<i>Dr. Leone, call the pharmacy.
Dr. Leone, call the pharmacy.</i>

480
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:59,996
Who's there? Who is it?

481
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,916
- Is somebody there?
- I'm sorry.

482
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:08,222
- Jo. Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

483
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:14,105
You were pretty drunk and... I was
out. I was worried that he was gonna...

484
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,514
No, I'm, I'm fine. I'm
perfectly fine. How are you?

485
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,818
You tell me. How am I looking?

486
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:26,134
You look... Really ugly.

487
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:29,893
Don't make me laugh.

488
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,561
I'm sorry... for putting
you in that position.

489
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,747
Don't. It was just...
Wrong place, wrong time.

490
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,016
No, you were trying
to help me. And I just...

491
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,459
Jo, it wasn't you. It was him.

492
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,897
Please don't tell anyone...

493
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,345
What I told you
about... That I...

494
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:58,104
- That you're married.
- Yeah. Please.

495
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:01,742
Oh, I see. That's
why you came here.

496
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:05,439
Huh? I thought you came
here 'cause you cared.

497
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,408
No, that's, that's not... I...

498
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,934
Jo, I know it. Don't worry. It's
cool. Your, uh, your secret's safe.

499
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,371
You know, you
could pick better guys.

500
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,943
- Jo?
- What are you doing here?

501
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,779
Can I talk to you, please?

502
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,660
Get... get away
from me. No! Please.

503
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,079
- Listen, DeLuca, I didn't know.
- Go away! Get out of here!

504
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,213
- You came to my house...
- Leave!

505
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,348
- I saw you on top of her.
- Alex, go!

506
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:33,172
- Somebody! Somebody!
- Go!

507
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:37,494
- Help! Help!
- I'm sorry.

508
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:41,309
- Call security, somebody?
- Sir, just calm down, all right?

509
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,699
Let's calm him down.

510
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,847
You all right? Oh, sorry,
nope. Forget I asked.

511
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:00,661
Well, you can tell Maggie
that her boy's angio

512
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,883
showed no vascular
injury, so... no worries.

513
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:08,019
Thanks. He's not her boy.

514
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:10,160
He's hurt. She's
just being kind.

515
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:13,813
All right.

516
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,201
I have to do something.

517
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,087
That I don't want to do.

518
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,206
- Then don't do it.
- I have to.

519
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,891
Then do it.

520
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,494
I will.

521
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:30,964
Nathan...

522
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:34,701
Come and sit with me a while.

523
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:38,081
What? Grey, what?
I don't have time to...

524
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,924
- It was Alex.
- What was Alex?

525
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:53,479
The person who beat
up DeLuca... was Alex.

526
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:03,101
<i>Dr. Ryan, Radiology.</i>

527
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,076
- When did you know?
- I knew!

528
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,556
Something happened
between Wilson and DeLuca...

529
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,246
Oh, stop. Just stop!

530
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,496
- Dr. Bailey...
- Hey, call security.

531
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,963
Tell them to find the police.

532
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,732
Tell them Dr. Karev does
not leave this hospital.

533
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:23,810
What? Meredith. It's Alex?

534
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:25,762
Yeah, come on.

535
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:28,882
You knew it? And you
didn't say anything?

536
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,839
Karev.

537
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,785
What's going on?

538
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,437
You're under arrest for assault.

539
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,739
He walked up and turned
himself in. Made it real easy.

540
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:44,476
He'll be in city lockup. You
have the right to remain silent.

541
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,411
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

542
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,563
You have the
right to an attorney,

543
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,681
and to have an attorney
present during questioning.

544
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:53,451
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

545
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,687
Do you understand these
rights as I read them to you?

546
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:56,943
Yes.

547
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,799
You were just gonna
lie to everyone?

548
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:12,762
- Did you know about Karev?
- No! I didn't!

549
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:17,584
Not for sure.

550
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,652
Ben Warren!

551
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:22,917
I have been lied to by so many
people today. If you lied to me, too...

552
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,253
Look, I guessed,
okay? I had suspicions.

553
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,171
What? And you didn't tell me?

554
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:28,978
Because I didn't know.

555
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,292
You can tell your wife
when you have suspicions,

556
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,516
but you can't tell the chief.

557
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:35,718
And you weren't my
wife. You were the chief.

558
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:37,704
Church and state.

559
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,198
I wasn't going
to lie to everyone.

560
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,605
You lied to me.

561
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,859
I asked you what
happened and you lied.

562
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,573
Alex and I were trying to...

563
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,795
Trying to what?

564
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,984
Trying to figure out a way to justify
the beating he gave to Andrew? What?

565
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,769
I don't know.

566
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,171
I poured my heart out to you...

567
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,154
all day... and you knew this.

568
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,939
It wasn't about you, Maggie.

569
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,379
I am your sister.

570
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,827
- I know.
- Do you?

571
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:45,371
'Cause it means something different
to me. You encouraged me to stay.

572
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,820
You offered me a home
and a family, and I accepted.

573
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:52,962
And I wasn't kidding, I will
go down swinging for you.

574
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,448
It means something to me.

575
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:58,846
I thought I could trust you.

576
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,002
You can.

577
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,541
From here on out.

578
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,146
Don't do it again.

579
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:13,967
Don't lie to me again.

580
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,536
Okay.

581
00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:19,667
Okay.

582
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,358
I'm, I'm gonna get that.

583
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,944
Oh, God. What
are you doing here?

584
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,098
- I want to know
what the problem is.
- What?

585
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,049
At the wedding, you
said we had a problem.

586
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,985
I want to know
what the problem is.

587
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,643
The problem is you
showing up here, looking for...

588
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,241
- What are you looking for?
- I'm not looking for anything.

589
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:44,730
It's right here.

590
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,002
Meredith! Hey, listen.

591
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,781
- There's something
happening here.
- Shh.

592
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,537
We both know it.

593
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,993
So, what's the problem?

594
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,050
- Someone is going to get hurt.
- Well, I can handle it.

595
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,330
Not you.

596
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:08,914
And from what I can see,
you seem indestructible.

597
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,193
So, what's the problem?

598
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,009
Tell me.

599
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,452
The problem is... You're wrong.

600
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,573
I don't feel the same way.

601
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,226
So, let's just drop it. Okay?

602
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,280
Good night.

603
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,734
<i>Best to keep the
past in the past.</i>

604
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:46,476
<i>Move on. Learn from it.</i>

605
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,078
Who was that?

606
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,316
Oh... that was no one. It's just
someone looking for directions.

607
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,680
Where are you going?

608
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,289
<i>If we don't learn
from our mistakes...</i>

609
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:03,693
<i>we wind up locked into a
future we'd never choose.</i>

610
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,184
- It was nice knowing you.
- Shut up.

611
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,621
What, you think I'm keeping
my job? Or my medical license?

612
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,306
We don't know what's
going to happen.

613
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,491
I'll tell you what
isn't gonna happen.

614
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,782
Me ever setting foot
in that hospital again.

615
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:31,938
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

616
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,739
You didn't punch the guy.

617
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,688
- But I told Bailey.
- You did?

618
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,062
Yes. I had to.

619
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,310
I know.

620
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,211
It's better. You
did the right thing.

621
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,048
Right now, being the guy who
got beat up would feel better.

622
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,972
You said it yourself.
We're grownups.

623
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,910
We can't run. We have to face
up to the stupid things we do.

624
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:58,742
Supposedly, if you face up to
them, something good comes out of it.

625
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,062
- I don't know what, but...
- Fifteen to 20, probably.

626
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,388
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

627
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,526
<i>The past is written.
There's no changing it.</i>

628
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,345
<i>What's done is done.</i>

629
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:20,152
<i>But the future is ours to
choose. For better or worse.</i>
