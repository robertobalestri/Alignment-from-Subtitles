00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,680
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:07,851
I'm married to a guy who
almost beat me to death.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,485
- You do this everywhere you go?
- Do what?

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,720
Turn the place against you.

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,072
She's really gonna let you do
a whole surgery with no help?

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,491
<i>The resident gets to
be the primary surgeon</i>

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,276
<i>on their own
case... start to finish.</i>

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,894
<i>What did I do?
Did I kill that boy?</i>

9
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:21,064
You are the attending!
This is your loss.

10
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,249
You could have friends
here, if you wanted to.

11
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,868
<i>Bailey, who is this woman?
I do not support this.</i>

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,454
Then you no longer have an O.R.

13
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,578
You're suspended...
effective immediately.

14
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,560
<i>I don't do reunions.</i>

15
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:36,663
<i>High school,
undergrad, med school...</i>

16
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:38,498
Alex, you've got five
minutes. I mean it.

17
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:39,688
I know.

18
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:42,335
I can't be late. I have
two consults this morning.

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,259
So many teeny-tiny socks.

20
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,095
I can't be late, either.
It's my first day back.

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,264
And none of them match. Why?

22
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,878
<i>I don't need to make
superficial conversation</i>

23
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:53,985
<i>with a bunch of people
I barely remember.</i>

24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,853
Mer. Mer!

25
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,263
- Hey. I just, I need
to grab my lunch.
- Sorry. Go.

26
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,657
Hey, you know, maybe tomorrow
I can pack a lunch for you,

27
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,964
seeing how I have all
the time in the world now.

28
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,528
I told you to think of
this like a vacation.

29
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:09,902
These are folded all wrong.

30
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,271
Vacation or prison?

31
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,624
Ooh, sorry. Too soon?

32
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,758
Hey, you don't get to act tired when
you got a full night's sleep in my bed.

33
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,993
You made me take the room.

34
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,778
Yeah, when I thought you
were gonna be here for one night.

35
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,880
- I didn't think you'd move in.
- I haven't moved in.

36
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,214
I do not live
here. I'm crashing.

37
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,449
No, you crash on a
couch. You live in a bed.

38
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,153
And you're living here. I
crash on the couch, and it sucks

39
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,121
because I woke up with a
Cheerio stuck to my face.

40
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,013
You can have my bed because
I'll be dead from boredom.

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,626
Can that happen?

42
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,128
Can your hypothalamus
just curl up and...

43
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:44,130
stop working from
lack of stimulus?

44
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,099
No. I mean, technically, yes.

45
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,268
Hey, how can she suspend
you? Don't you own the hospital?

46
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,692
Oh, she can. I
checked the by-laws.

47
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,429
Checks and balances...
This is how bored I am.

48
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,209
Alex, car, now.

49
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,378
- I want my bed back.
- I do not live here.

50
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:01,631
<i>If I want to keep someone in
my life, I keep them in my life.</i>

51
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,622
The band is back together again.

52
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,026
<i>Or maybe it's just that I don't
know how to get rid of them.</i>

53
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,734
Anyone?

54
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,106
- That's a kidney.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,909
And here?

56
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,828
That is a very sick kidney.

57
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,443
Hold on. Are we gonna
do a kidney transplant?

58
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,984
Technically, a kidney
recovery and a transplant.

59
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,805
So, who thinks they're
ready to run lead on those?

60
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:42,996
I'm not ready.

61
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,808
That is the right answer.

62
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,477
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,451
Okay, great. I am not ready.

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,382
Put your hand down, intern.

65
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,951
None of you are
ready, but you are ready

66
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,536
to do as much of it as you can

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,322
under the extremely close
supervision of an attending

68
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,507
with the reminder to
pass it off if you need to,

69
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,360
which means you'll be that
much closer to being ready.

70
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,685
The donor will be in O.R. 2
supervised by Dr. Webber.

71
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,383
That'll be you, Warren,
with Cross assisting.

72
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,907
- Yes!
- Thank you, Dr. Minnick.

73
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,810
No.

74
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,539
Edwards and Wilson,

75
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,197
you'll be in O.R. 3 working
on the boy with Dr. Karev.

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
- The boy?
- Yes.

77
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,029
The kidney recipient
is a 16-year-old

78
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,899
in chronic renal failure
from interstitial nephritis.

79
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,934
He's required dialysis
three times a week

80
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,519
while waiting for a
donor, and he just lost

81
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,721
his last access site,
so today is the day.

82
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,423
The donor is...

83
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,127
The boy's mom. She's
giving him one of her kidneys.

84
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,146
The organ procurement
led by Dr. Warren will...

85
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,048
It's a kid. Are you okay?

86
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,606
Yeah, I don't have
much of a choice, do I?

87
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,308
It's Karev. Are you okay?

88
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,143
I'm fine.

89
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,795
Welcome back, Karev.

90
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,831
My name's finally on
the O.R. schedule again,

91
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,833
and I'm not even allowed
to do any of the surgery.

92
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,422
Yeah, welcome to phase two.

93
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,458
Prep the patients and run labs?

94
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,060
That's resident scut. Sucks.

95
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,580
Well, the good news is
I'll be right there with you.

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,250
Yeah, you're right. It sucks.

97
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,033
So, how long will my
kidney last in there?

98
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,785
It should last up to 15 years.

99
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,688
Oh, so, definitely
through college then.

100
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,007
Perfect, it'll be like a
guardian angel kidney.

101
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,109
- I will be watching over you...
- Mom!

102
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,127
Like your conscience... I'll
be whispering in your ear,

103
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,614
"Christopher, do your homework.
Christopher, change your sheets.

104
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,716
“Christopher, put down
the Jägermeister...”

105
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,367
You got to interrupt
her. She'll never stop.

106
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,337
I'm not the one in
charge. They are.

107
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,805
If you don't have
any more questions,

108
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,557
then Dr. Edwards and I
will see you in surgery.

109
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,710
Uh, just one thing... Tell
my son it is mandatory

110
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,913
to kiss his mother before she
goes under the knife for him.

111
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,614
- Stop!
- It's mandatory, dude.

112
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,732
Thank you.

113
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,901
Doctors Karev and
Webber will be in in a minute

114
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,136
to prep you for surgery.

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

116
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,939
Thanks.

117
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,274
That was good, but don't
be afraid of taking the lead.

118
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,731
Embrace it. Be assertive.

119
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,936
<i>Dr. Schiavo, extension 2217.

Riggs finishing up the
cardio consult at bed 5,

121
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,475
but I think it's gonna be...

122
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,790
Make it hurt... They
make... They make it hurt.

123
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,491
Ma'am, can I help you?

124
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,343
No. No help.

125
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,778
There's no help out there.

126
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,469
They come and they go
and they crack the whip.

127
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:23,472
Who's uh...

128
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,768
- I...
- No help.

129
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,225
Do you need something, ma'am?

130
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,189
Ma'am, you can't be back there.

131
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,575
- Snakes...
- You might need
to call security.

132
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,977
There's no snakes here.

133
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,344
- There's no... There's no snakes...
- Okay,

134
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,130
- we're gonna get you
over to someone.
- Did you do this? Did you?

135
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,199
Did you... did you...

136
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,590
Whoa.

137
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,004
No. My son's name
is Chris, Chris Daniels.

138
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:46,773
He's in surgery today
to get a new kidney.

139
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,291
Let me see if I can
find what room he's in.

140
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,609
- Thank you.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Wilson.

141
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,027
I'm one of Chris' doctors.

142
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,128
Oh, hi.

143
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,619
I hit so much traffic on
the way over here, and I...

144
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,833
So, he's not in surgery yet?

145
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,635
Well, if he is then I'm late,
because I'm his surgeon.

146
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,338
Good. Okay. So, I
haven't missed it?

147
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,257
No, you haven't missed
it. I can take you to him.

148
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,642
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,714
BP looks good.
You're ready to go.

150
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,281
Well, we need to
start prepping you, too.

151
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,683
I know, but...

152
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,506
can't it wait just
another minute?

153
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,653
I am not ready to leave him.

154
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,355
- He is my...
- Don't say it, Mom!

155
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,379
My baby!

156
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,648
Chris, Cynthia, you
about ready for surgery?

157
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,772
You can start his
prep in the O.R.

158
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,364
Thank you, Edwards.

159
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,748
Hey, guys. Good news. Guess
who I found looking for you?

160
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,277
Dad?

161
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,528
What the hell?

162
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,448
Cynthia, look, I just
wanted to check on Chris.

163
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,479
How did you know where we were?

164
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,068
He posted it online.

165
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,999
Today's "kidney day."

166
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,250
I had no idea he was
even getting a new kidney.

167
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,770
You need to leave,
Ken... right now.

168
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,723
- Cynthia, I swear to God...
- All right, now that's enough.

169
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,408
- That's enough.
- I'm so sorry, sir,
why don't you...

170
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,728
- Hey!
- Chris is my son, too.

171
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,896
Now, I let you do a
lot of stuff without me.

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,998
Let me?

173
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,333
He is my kid, too. I
have a right to be here.

174
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,037
- I just want to know he's okay.
- Get out!

175
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,671
Chris, buddy, talk
to your old man here.

176
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,294
Dad, go.

177
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,209
Get the hell out of here.

178
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,244
- Okay, let's go now.
- This is my son.

179
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,612
- Get out!
- Look, I understand...

180
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,748
I have a right to be here.
You hear me? I have rights!

181
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,255
Hey, why don't we sit down?

182
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,334
Why'd you bring him here?

183
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,175
- I'm sor...
- Why would you do that?

184
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,256
Cynthia, do you
want to sit down?

185
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,371
- Hey, big transplant today.
- Don't talk to me.

186
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,173
- I'm mad at you.
- Oh, God, did you go?

187
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,875
Yes. Now I want to
eat there every night.

188
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,610
I told you. Did you
have the steak things?

189
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,274
I had two, and then
the dessert tray came.

190
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,266
I'll come look, but I
think that you're right

191
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,086
to delay your patient's ACL
surgery until after she delivers.

192
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,110
Thank you for the
consult, Dr. Robbins.

193
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,158
I do not know how you do it.

194
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,693
I don't know how you
can be polite to her.

195
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,462
- Oh, I know. She's the worst.
- Yeah. I couldn't do it,

196
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,598
not after the way she
screwed Webber over.

197
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,689
Yeah, right. Got to go.

198
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,671
All Minnick did was take
a job she was offered.

199
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,272
No, she stole that job.

200
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,240
But you're rather
familiar with the concept

201
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,142
of job stealing, aren't you?

202
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,279
Uh, Kepner, are you up to speed
on the big resident transplant?

203
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,647
- Yes. Yes.
- Good.

204
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,632
You are running the
show. I have to leave.

205
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,218
- Are you up for that?
- Yes. I... yes.

206
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,642
Uh, where are you going? I
thought you were running the show.

207
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,646
Camp David for a summit meeting.

208
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,193
Wait, actual Camp David?

209
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,744
Well, she's gone.

210
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,368
Maybe you can
steal her job, too.

211
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,836
You paged me for
a temp pacemaker?

212
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,861
Yeah, she needs a permanent
one, but can't get consent, so...

213
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,691
Well, you need
approval? You got it.

214
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:54,360
What is she,
intoxicated or something?

215
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,862
Jane Doe, no I.D. She's
confused and disoriented

216
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,753
- to the time and place.
- Ma'am,

217
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,783
can you tell me your name?

218
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,519
No, no names.

219
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,010
Names are for
hats, not for cats.

220
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,757
You put the snake in the hat.

221
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,658
We did ask that.

222
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,444
I'll tell Grendel. Grendel
has all the patterns.

223
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,612
She sees the patterns.

224
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,081
She sees the patterns,
I see the patterns.

225
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,617
- You don't see the diagram...
- Okay.

226
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,936
- Because I see the diagrams!
- Okay, okay, ma'am.

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,538
You don't know the diagrams.
You don't know the diagrams!

228
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,423
We're gonna give you
something to relax you, all right?

229
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,841
Two I.V. of lorazepam.

230
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,843
-CBC, chem one and
a tox screen, -Okay.

231
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,387
- And call psych.
- So...

232
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:30,969
how old is that pacemaker?

233
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:33,866
That is the Ford
Pinto of pacemakers.

234
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,984
Right.

235
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,086
Okay, ma'am, we're gonna
take that old pacemaker out

236
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,171
and give you a brand new,
shiny one. How's that sound?

237
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,345
For the snakes?
It's for the snakes.

238
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,385
- Yeah.
- For the snakes.

239
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,028
Your BP is through the roof.

240
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,713
We've got to get that
down before surgery.

241
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,383
We're gonna give you a little
something to calm you down, okay?

242
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,934
He's downstairs
in the waiting area.

243
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,686
He's asking for updates.

244
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,188
You can't make him leave?

245
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,791
I'm so sorry. He never mentioned
that you were divorced or...

246
00:09:58,815 --> 00:09:59,831
They're not.

247
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,083
They should be, but they're not.

248
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,569
I left with Chris

249
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,666
almost a year ago.

250
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,290
And you should
have done it sooner.

251
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,754
- He hit her.
- Chris!

252
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,594
- What?
- What? It's why we left.

253
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,431
I didn't have a job.

254
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,829
Chris was sick all the time,

255
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,753
and I thought I
could make it work.

256
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,238
But the day that
he went after Chris,

257
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:28,175
we left that night, and
now he's showing up

258
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,757
pretending that he cares,
pretending that he is a father?

259
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,282
Mom, it's all
right. We'll be fine.

260
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:38,202
Okay, I just want you to focus
on why you are here today.

261
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,705
I can't believe him.

262
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,454
Today was supposed
to be such a good day.

263
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,911
And it is. It still is.

264
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,247
Think about Chris.

265
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,838
- Hey.
- Thank you.

266
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,532
- Hey, thank you.
- Hey, Dr. Hunt?

267
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,952
Make that man leave.

268
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,256
Did something happen?

269
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,487
Listen, do you need
me to call security, or...

270
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,112
I just... I need him
to go away, please.

271
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:24,983
Okay.

272
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,499
Excuse me, sir, um, you've
been asked to leave the premises,

273
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,851
- so if you can follow me...
- I'm not bugging anyone,

274
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,115
I'm not hurting anyone.

275
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,920
- I have every right to be here.
- Sir, do you want me
to call security?

276
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,271
- Because I need you to leave.
- Oh, this again!

277
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,773
You're gonna threaten
me with... Sir, sir!

278
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,837
Do not touch me!

279
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,049
First scrubbed... I
make the first cut.

280
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,553
You okay?

281
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,934
What do you mean, am I okay?

282
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,268
The thing with the
husband. Are you...

283
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,812
I'm fine.

284
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,677
Let's use the pelvic
brim as a landmark.

285
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:58,877
Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,346
Dividing the ureter...

287
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,615
- How we doing?
- Very well.

288
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,583
Cross, can you
enlarge the incision?

289
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,056
Yep. Got it.

290
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,869
A whole, healthy kidney.

291
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:25,171
Nice work, guys...
like seasoned pros.

292
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:28,091
More like very good
residents who are learning

293
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:32,077
an advanced procedure and
still needing help and guidance.

294
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,621
Which you are clearly giving
them. Nice work, Dr. Webber.

295
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,326
Good news...

296
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,157
Warren and Cross have successfully
removed their patient's kidney,

297
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,341
which will soon be
your patient's kidney.

298
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,611
- So, who wants to...
- I'll get...

299
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,031
I'll get the kidney. I have
crossed the sterile field.

300
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,487
I'll get the kidney.

301
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,446
Okay.

302
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,913
The wires on the
pacemaker's stuck.

303
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,114
DeLuca, laser.

304
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:10,583
Can't you just pull them out?

305
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,847
No. It's scarred
into her tissue.

306
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,877
Why are we not better at
taking care of the homeless?

307
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,395
Gotcha!

308
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,460
So, now what? We hand
her over to Social Services?

309
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,146
How will they find
out who she is?

310
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,914
Fingerprints, I imagine.

311
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,348
- She doesn't have a record.
- I don't know.

312
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,505
Maybe dental records?

313
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,902
She doesn't have a home,
you think she has a dentist?

314
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,387
I don't know.
They'll figure it out.

315
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,555
Okay, but what if they don't?

316
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,706
She didn't just
come from nowhere.

317
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,908
Someone's probably
looking for her, right?

318
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,132
Is she just gonna
go back to the street?

319
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,586
Nope.

320
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,055
'Cause I just found
out who she is.

321
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:48,003
Call the company, get them
to trace the serial number.

322
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,812
That will tell us who
you are, Ms. Doe.

323
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,845
Warren and Cross did fine
work with the renal vein graft.

324
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,746
It should be an
easy anastomosis.

325
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,050
Got it, sir.

326
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:01,817
All right. Well, what's next?

327
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,153
- Irrigating here...
- Good hemostasis...

328
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,177
Should we close?

329
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,856
Her systolic BP's 200.

330
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,041
Was it malignant hypertension?

331
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,375
No history of high
blood pressure.

332
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,661
Okay, well, you know
what, stop. Nobody move.

333
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,865
Bolus of diltiazem, fast, and
let's pull up an image now.

334
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,409
Did we do something wrong?

335
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,551
Uh, I-I can't see.

336
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,204
Enlarge the image and
show me the right kidney.

337
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,290
There. Behind
the bowel. Damn it!

338
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,493
The vessel's prepped
for anastomosis.

339
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,195
Pocket for
implantation is ready.

340
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:33,337
Go time.

341
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:35,758
Stop!

342
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,736
- Did you attach it?
- Geez.

343
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,454
- Webber, what the hell?
- Did you attach the kidney?

344
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,989
No, no. I'm... I'm
holding it, I'm holding it.

345
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,091
Put it back on ice.

346
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,093
The mom's remaining
kidney thrombosed.

347
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,117
It's dead.

348
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,068
We now have only one
good kidney between them.

349
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,178
Call UNOS. Tell them you need
Chris moved to the top of the list.

350
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,547
We already told them he
lost his last dialysis port.

351
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,115
Tell him he's on the table
now with two residents

352
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,016
pouring saline down
his open abdomen.

353
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,385
What kind of timeframe
are we talking about?

354
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,619
Not long. She's
in renal failure.

355
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,988
- What happened?
- The donor's remaining kidney

356
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,423
had a major stenosis.

357
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,492
And when we tried to
open it up, the entire vessel

358
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,094
dissected and clotted off.

359
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,396
So, where does this kidney go,
back to the mom or into the kid?

360
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,831
- Well, it was already
in the kid's O.R.
- What's the legal on that?

361
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,666
The mom signed the
paperwork. It's past the red line.

362
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,185
- It belongs to the kid.
- No, it doesn't.

363
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,720
Not until it's put into him.

364
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,222
- It was about to go in.
- So, there's no formal protocol?

365
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,624
Not that I know of. I mean...

366
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:33,359
this is not a thing
that happens.

367
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:34,893
- This is...
- This is a first.

368
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,762
- So, no rule book.
- Where's Bailey?

369
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,997
She left. She said she
was going to Camp David.

370
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,633
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

371
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,567
She said she had
a summit meeting.

372
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,774
She said I'm in charge.

373
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,934
Invite me inside for coffee.

374
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,469
For coffee?

375
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,816
We are going to sit
down over a cup of coffee,

376
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,574
and we are going to figure
this out like smart women.

377
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:01,753
- Over coffee?
- Over coffee.

378
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,057
Do you have coffee?

379
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,960
I'm not leaving until
you invite me in.

380
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,084
- Well, I don't have milk.
- I don't take milk.

381
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,686
We give the boy the kidney,

382
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,854
and then his mother's
on dialysis, maybe for life.

383
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,940
Well, people are surviving for far
longer. They both have a chance.

384
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,607
We just close up
the kid, he's screwed.

385
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,260
- He has no access...
- And then we just close up

386
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,528
the mom, and then we've
given her a debilitating condition.

387
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,713
- We have to give it back to her.
- The kid's at a dead end.

388
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,814
The mom is healthy.

389
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,584
She can go on dialysis
until we find a donor.

390
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:32,734
But is that what
she signed on for?

391
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,470
She signed up to
save her son's life.

392
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,538
At the expense of her own?

393
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,089
She came in here
perfectly healthy.

394
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,692
If you found the stenosis a minute later,
we wouldn't even be talking about this.

395
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,793
- The kidney
would already be in him.
- Yeah, but it isn't,

396
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:45,014
and if we don't put it in someone
soon, it's gonna die and no one gets it,

397
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,965
so who's it going to?

398
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,802
- Why are you asking me? I'm not deciding.
- Just answer the question.

399
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:51,153
Where do you think
the kidney should go?

400
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,388
Out of my jurisdiction.

401
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,523
But in 5 years, in
10 years, it won't be.

402
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,613
So what would you do?

403
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,361
Look, if we can wake up the
mom and ask what she wanted...

404
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,528
We can't. She would
need to be awake

405
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,595
long enough to be competent.

406
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,931
The kidney would
not last until then.

407
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,733
I know, but if we could,
she'd say give it to her son.

408
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,757
Right?

409
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,521
No doubt. Give it to the kid.

410
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,723
Any parent would
say the same thing.

411
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,458
Sure, any parent
with two good kidneys.

412
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,593
She's only got one. She
might want to hang on to it.

413
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,283
Yeah, if she's a monster.

414
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,404
- I'd want to hang on to it.
- And that makes you a monster.

415
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,273
You're the monster.

416
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,223
So, we give Chris the kidney,
and then the 16-year-old

417
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,092
has to take care of
his mom or she dies,

418
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,500
and we've saved his
life, but left him an orphan.

419
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,465
- He wouldn't be an orphan.
- Yeah, he has a father.

420
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,183
A father who used to beat
the crap out of his mom

421
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:39,634
and probably him.

422
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,520
That's who we'd
be sending Chris to.

423
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,989
You were right. The company
had her records right there.

424
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,491
She was a minor
at the time, so...

425
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:46,625
Tell me her name again.

426
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,160
The patient's name
is Claire Nolan.

427
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:50,562
- This is her mother.
- Okay. Good work, DeLuca.

428
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,097
See? Problem solved.

429
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,721
- You're very impressed
with yourself.
- A little bit.

430
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,459
- Ms. Nolan.
- Yes? Gwen.

431
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,156
The police said someone
found my daughter.

432
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,258
Yes. We just have
a few questions

433
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,760
before we take you to her.

434
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,463
Did you call Tim? My
ex-husband... Is he coming?

435
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,370
He's on his way. Please.

436
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:14,241
Did your daughter have
a history of mental illness?

437
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,411
No. That's...

438
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,914
- Why does that matter?
- Just prepare yourself...

439
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,523
It'll be a bit of a shock
when you see her.

440
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,015
Well, it's already a
shock. It's been 12 years.

441
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,051
I never thought
anyone would find her.

442
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,241
Well, you may have a
hard time understanding her.

443
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,409
- Wait, what?
- Well, her speech is...

444
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,044
very disorganized.

445
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,501
- She's possibly delusional.
- She's alive?

446
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,171
Claire's alive?

447
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,275
Are you telling me
my daughter's alive?

448
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,842
Did I say he's 16?

449
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,361
I know it doesn't change
anything, but he's 16,

450
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,096
and he is open on a table.

451
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,265
- Anything?
- Nothing.

452
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,683
I'll try Seattle Pres again.

453
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,602
This kid doesn't have another
option. We just lost his donor kidney.

454
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,243
- We need another one right now.
- What do you mean?

455
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,913
- You talking about my son?
- Hold on.

456
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,144
- You're talking about Chris.
- You were told to leave.

457
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,646
What happened?

458
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,432
What happened to
Cynthia? What is it?

459
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,133
I can't discuss their
conditions with you.

460
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,719
Don't you tell me that.
That is my son up there,

461
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,693
and you have to tell
me what is going on.

462
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,181
Answer me.

463
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,636
- Kepner, we need an answer.
- I know!

464
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,101
Dr. Webber, prep
the mother for dialysis.

465
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,853
I will call UNOS myself.

466
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,605
Karev, start the
anastomosis on the boy.

467
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,695
Wait! Stop.

468
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,231
We might have
another option, but...

469
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,518
But?

470
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,204
- Wilson.
- Jo, what is it?

471
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,151
The husband.

472
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,953
The son of a bitch
wants to give his kidney,

473
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,960
but we can't do that, right?

474
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,065
Right?

475
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,187
So, people are really embracing
this new method of teaching.

476
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,788
Some say it's actually fun.

477
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,908
Today you would
have been performing

478
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,309
a mother-to-son
kidney transplant.

479
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,612
You don't have to sell
me on the method, Bailey.

480
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,548
- People like it. I get it.
- Good. Then we can stop

481
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:26,785
all of this stubbornness
and the insubordination.

482
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,322
- It's not insubordination.
- Well, it's not cooperation.

483
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:33,225
Look, I made you
my Chief of General

484
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,260
because I wanted you
to be my right hand.

485
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,880
- So, you want a Yes Man?
- No.

486
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,939
I want someone who will lead
with me but follow when I lead.

487
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,220
Even if I think you're
leading the wrong way?

488
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,672
I shouldn't speak up when I
think you're making a misstep?

489
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,474
You don't want
that in a right hand?

490
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,715
- I'm not making a misstep.
- I disagree,

491
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,845
but you don't want to
hear a dissenting opinion.

492
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,814
Well, you never
offered me your opinion.

493
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,781
You just shut Minnick out.

494
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:59,151
I didn't have time to
offer you an opinion.

495
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,069
You just showed
Richard the door.

496
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,271
How could you do that?

497
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,628
I didn't want to do that. I...

498
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,475
I wanted him to stay
right where he was.

499
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,533
I wanted Minnick to add value,

500
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,414
but she wouldn't work with him.

501
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,117
So, you sided with Minnick
and tossed Richard aside?

502
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,468
No.

503
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,436
Look, I had a
choice to make, Grey,

504
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,005
and I didn't want
to make it because,

505
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,191
yes, Dr. Webber
built this place.

506
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,860
But I have to keep building it.

507
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,147
So I do that by asking
myself 100 times a day,

508
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,198
"What would Richard Webber do?"

509
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,057
But how did Eliza Minnick
win you over so quickly?

510
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:40,097
When I saw this program,
this better way of teaching,

511
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,883
I asked myself again, "What
would Richard Webber do?"

512
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:47,515
And he would have embraced
this, Grey, you know it.

513
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,125
The answer was so clear. I
couldn't ignore that choice.

514
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,372
But you made the wrong choice.

515
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,797
Look, you can serve under
Chief Webber if you want to,

516
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,878
but that doesn't change the
fact that he is not your chief.

517
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,002
I am. And as your chief...

518
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,917
I am ready to...

519
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:07,808
lift the suspension if you
feel you can come back.

520
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,277
- I want to.
- Good.

521
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,189
But I can't.

522
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:16,934
Not until he does.

523
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,415
Okay, there's a
difference between loyalty

524
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,100
and stubbornness, Grey.

525
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,202
I do not want to be reinstated

526
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:27,439
unless Richard Webber
is as Residency Director.

527
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,663
Minnick goes.

528
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,033
Thanks for the coffee.

529
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:44,389
We can't do this. We can't
put his kidney inside her son.

530
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,091
If his tests show he's a
match, we're absolutely doing it.

531
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,327
But it's wrong. His wife
would never agree to this.

532
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,046
- She would never accept this.
- To save herself and her son?

533
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,749
She wouldn't say
no out of spite.

534
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,333
She might like any
other option, though.

535
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:58,137
- Well, I don't see
any other option.
- He's right here.

536
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,470
And our obligation
is to our patients.

537
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,273
- But what about her?
- No one should get to make

538
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,462
this decision for her.

539
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,044
- Our patients are still stable.
- What about the residents?

540
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,463
Fairly stable. Is he a go?

541
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,963
- Yeah, it looks like...
- No!

542
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,198
We can't! We can't do this.

543
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,917
Wilson, we have no other choice.

544
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,202
Don't say that. You
don't get how she will feel

545
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,571
to wake up and find out
that he controlled this,

546
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,273
that he made a decision
while she was asleep.

547
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,208
He decided to get into her life.

548
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,078
She had no say, no
control, no choice, nothing.

549
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,451
He can't do that. He can't.

550
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,149
We have to try something new.

551
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,985
- We have to find...
- There's no time.

552
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,108
I'm sorry.

553
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,477
If his tests come back and
he's a match, we're doing this.

554
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,648
Do you want to go in?

555
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,224
She was in college at U-Dub.

556
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,257
It'd had been a couple weeks,
and we hadn't heard from her.

557
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,348
They found the door to
her apartment wide open.

558
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,733
It looked like an abduction.

559
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,152
There were press conferences.

560
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,655
We walked through the
forest with flashlights.

561
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,660
It was all we thought
about for years.

562
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,848
It ended our marriage.

563
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,883
It ended our lives.

564
00:24:20,076 --> 00:24:22,888
Well, it's early for me to
make a definitive diagnosis,

565
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:24,278
but I suspect you're right.

566
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,178
Claire suffers
from schizophrenia.

567
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,544
Gwen, how old did you say
she was when she disappeared?

568
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,879
Twenty.

569
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,235
That fits, I'm afraid.

570
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,884
Late teens, early 20s is
when it starts manifesting.

571
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,135
It's possible it got so bad

572
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,093
that she just left
everything behind.

573
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,881
Do you want to go in, let
her know that you're here?

574
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,789
- Why don't you sit for a minute?
- Okay.

575
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,346
We had a funeral.

576
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,449
Everyone came to the funeral.

577
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,870
She has a grave stone.

578
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,120
Kepner told me what's going on.

579
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,097
You were supposed
to get him to leave.

580
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,977
I thought I did.

581
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,697
But now I'm glad I didn't.

582
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,517
His son's gonna die
unless he gets a kidney.

583
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,165
I'm not excusing
what he did, I'm not.

584
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:44,035
But maybe... maybe this is
his way of coming out of it,

585
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,726
of being a better person.

586
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,814
Maybe he's sorry.
Maybe he's changed.

587
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,642
The dad's a match.

588
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,943
You don't need to be involved.

589
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,860
You can sit this one out.

590
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,933
No. I'm not gonna sit it out.

591
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:35,575
You just got to
let it go, okay, Jo?

592
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:38,413
I know.

593
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,742
Don't... Jo!

594
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,432
Wait. Hold on.

595
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,141
You're not the hero here.

596
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,923
You don't get to
take this as a win.

597
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,565
This is the least that
you can do, the very least.

598
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:03,603
- I'm doing the right thing.
- I don't think so.

599
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,040
I think you want an excuse to
worm your way back into their lives.

600
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,394
I'm not.

601
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,350
I swear.

602
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,115
I can't take back the
stuff that I've done.

603
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,819
But I can do this.

604
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:24,084
I just want to do
something good.

605
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,390
If you really want to do good,
never tell them about this.

606
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,493
You do it anonymously
and walk away.

607
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,962
They never have to
know it was your kidney,

608
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,085
and they never have
to see you again.

609
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,304
Oh, my God, he's
an abusive husband?

610
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,239
Yes. So now, he's
their only hope.

611
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,542
The kid is getting his
dad's sleaze-ball kidney.

612
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:06,027
- Well, you're doing
the right thing.
- It feels gross.

613
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,912
Yeah, but the choice
that keeps everyone alive

614
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,985
is the right one.

615
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,755
- That is wise.
- I am wise.

616
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,937
And you're pretty
rude, actually...

617
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,401
rude and obstructive,
and I am fed up with it.

618
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,164
This is so fun.

619
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,283
- That woman is a menace.
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,573
And what I hate is her smugness.

621
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,393
She doesn't have the
experience to be that smug.

622
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:38,409
And she hides her total
disrespect under this bunch of perky.

623
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,001
- Yeah, she's confident.
- She's overconfident.

624
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,984
- She's a menace.
- God, yes.

625
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:00,520
- Gwen, your ex-husband is here.
- They found her.

626
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:04,018
- Gwen, they said she's alive?
- She is, but, Tim...

627
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,538
I can't believe it. I
can't believe she's alive!

628
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:09,579
Tim... she might not
know who we are.

629
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,827
We're not sure.

630
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,995
It's unclear as to what she's
responding to in the real world

631
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,297
and what's just
happening inside her.

632
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,448
She might.

633
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:18,938
We're her parents. She might.

634
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:23,244
You ready?

635
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:32,085
Claire? Claire, it's Dr. Pierce.

636
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:35,467
Pierce? Pierce. Pierce.

637
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:38,570
Needles pierce.
There's blood in my arms.

638
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:41,673
And snakes... I can see them.

639
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,425
You can't... You had it.

640
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,533
- Claire?
- There's snakes in my...

641
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,053
Hi, honey.

642
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,519
No. No, no, no!

643
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,088
- No!
- I need five of Haldol!

644
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:58,406
It's Mom.

645
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,624
It's Mom and Dad.

646
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:01,009
You can't have the
blood in my arms!

647
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,161
You can't have it!

648
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,063
Okay, let's... let's just
give her some space.

649
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:07,954
- You can't have it.
- You're safe.

650
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:10,835
Okay, Claire. Okay.

651
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,093
It's okay. She's
gonna be all right.

652
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,217
Ready for anastomosis.

653
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,347
Dr. Karev?

654
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,323
Nice jobs, Edwards.
I'm here if you need me.

655
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,275
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.
Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.</i>

656
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,723
Well, this looks like

657
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,948
the residents pulled
it off without a hitch.

658
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,883
You missed a few hitches.

659
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,085
I went and talked to Grey.

660
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:57,587
Yeah? She coming back?

661
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,355
No, she is not.

662
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,655
Bailey, you...
you are ridiculous.

663
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,556
You're not just costing
Meredith time and money,

664
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,492
you're costing yourself
and the hospital.

665
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,233
Oh, no, not me. You are.

666
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,651
She chose you.

667
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:21,378
<i>Dr. Guyer to Radiology.
Dr. Guyer to Radiology.</i>

668
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:28,897
So, I'm gonna start
her with a gradually

669
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,032
increasing dose of haloperidol.

670
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,433
After she stabilizes,

671
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,136
there's newer
medications we can try.

672
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,439
Hopefully that'll stop
the disorganized thoughts

673
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,830
- and help her communicate...
- Well, will she know us?

674
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,678
What if she doesn't?
What do we do?

675
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,752
After she's released and
stable, it'll be up to her.

676
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,334
Sometimes people don't
like the way the meds feel,

677
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:52,504
so they go off and end
up back where they were.

678
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:54,222
We just don't know.

679
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,258
I'll make sure your
family is given information

680
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,245
about services and permanent
supportive housing programs.

681
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:01,579
You can go back in and...

682
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,963
and sit with her
until she wakes up.

683
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,290
We'll wait, if that's all right.

684
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
Okay.

685
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,381
We'll come back and check in.

686
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I just...

687
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:22,066
Schizophrenia's a
difficult disease, but...

688
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,990
with treatment,
it can be helped.

689
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:25,773
What do you mean?

690
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,527
Well, I just don't get it.

691
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,896
I would just be
happy she's alive.

692
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,616
How is this not a happy ending?

693
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,268
You're right. You don't get it.

694
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,989
I want to.

695
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:42,225
They gave up on her.

696
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,090
They just buried an empty
box in the ground and moved on,

697
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,026
had lattes, saw movies.

698
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,910
They just lived their
lives, and all the while,

699
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,046
their daughter was out there
walking around in the rain,

700
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,102
in pain and alone.

701
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,373
And they will never
forgive themselves for that.

702
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,195
And they shouldn't.

703
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,685
- Hey!
- Hey. You busy?

704
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,710
Yes, I was just about to
paint a wall and watch it dry.

705
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:21,659
Well, Karev and I talked
the "surgeons of tomorrow"

706
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:24,301
through a kidney
transplant today.

707
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:26,681
And?

708
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,739
And you being here
instead of there is a waste.

709
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,075
I mean, also, it's your choice.

710
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,193
It's also stubborn.

711
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,597
- Bailey spoke to you?
- She did.

712
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,199
Meredith, go back.

713
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,497
Don't waste another
day, not for me.

714
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,389
I want to, but every
time I try, I keep hearing

715
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:48,425
my mother's voice saying
"Meredith, it's Richard."

716
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,674
Well, that's very nice,

717
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,043
but we both know

718
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,462
that your mother would
never put me before her career.

719
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,782
True.

720
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,126
But I'm supposed
to do better than her.

721
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,111
Isn't that the point, be
better? I can't be like her.

722
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:13,833
Go get your job.

723
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,837
Good night.

724
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,646
Dr. Bailey, please.

725
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,541
My transplant was a success.

726
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,716
- Thanks for asking.
- You mean Minnick's transplant?

727
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,102
Yeah, Minnick's transplant.

728
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,855
Never seen residents learn
the way that they did today.

729
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,558
It was inspiring.

730
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:46,626
Oh, hey. I was just texting you.

731
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:49,306
It's not fun. You
know, this is...

732
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,275
- It's not fun.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

733
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:52,610
I don't like pretending
not to like you,

734
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,178
and I don't like listening
to the awful things

735
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:55,346
that people have
to say about you...

736
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,714
What do they say?

737
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,349
Because I know
that you're not awful.

738
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,617
And they should know.
They should know that.

739
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,286
- Arizona...
- Because you're nice,

740
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,120
and you're smart, and
you're funny, and you care.

741
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:05,873
You care about the students
maybe even more than I do.

742
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,308
And you have this brilliant way

743
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,410
of making your
victories their victories,

744
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,412
and you're good for this
place, and you're good for them,

745
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,347
- and they should know that.
- Arizona, stop.

746
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,491
- I just think it's not...
- I need you to stop...

747
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,607
so I can kiss you.

748
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:19,609
- Oh.
- Stop.

749
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,393
Claire...

750
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:41,182
how are you feeling?

751
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,294
I'm just gonna check
your bandage, okay?

752
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:44,818
I... I wasn't...

753
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:48,571
I wasn't gonna put
in... in the order.

754
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,019
They switch you on,
and they switch you off,

755
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,143
and they've got...

756
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:58,681
diagrams... and
conditions, and...

757
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,786
Claire, we're monitoring
your pacemaker...

758
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,054
and it's working beautifully.

759
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,435
And we've put you
on some medication

760
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,892
to calm you down. It might
make you feel a little groggy.

761
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,262
Okay.

762
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,774
I... you can't...
you can't feel...

763
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,527
You can't feel the
snakes in the hat.

764
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,785
Nobody can feel the snakes.

765
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:24,909
Hi, Mom.

766
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,331
Hi.

767
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,433
Hi, sweetie.

768
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,702
Hi, Claire-Bear.

769
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,239
Can we sit with you?

770
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,243
You can... you can sit.

771
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,705
You can sit, but
you can't tell...

772
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:57,808
I can tell.

773
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,193
They crisscross, the...

774
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,199
The snakes are in the cart.

775
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:08,568
They told me...

776
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,029
So, I...

777
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,198
I still have a kidney?

778
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:26,085
And Chris... He also h...

779
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:28,699
has a kidney?

780
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,502
Yes. Chris received
a different kidney.

781
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,393
A perfect, healthy
living-donor kidney.

782
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,147
But... how?

783
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,133
From... from who?

784
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,619
It was an anonymous
directed donation.

785
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:51,377
It's a perfect match, and
Chris is responding really well.

786
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:54,547
I can't believe it...

787
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,063
That people are...
are that good...

788
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,482
That they can be so good.

789
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,089
Thank you.

790
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,628
Well, it looks like she's
responding to meds.

791
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,564
That's good.

792
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,565
The family has you to thank...

793
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,435
for that pacemaker idea.

794
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,537
Oh, you would
have thought of that.

795
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:22,041
Yep, looks like they're
getting their little girl back.

796
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,130
Are you...

797
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,417
Do you want to talk?

798
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,384
Hmm?

799
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,939
Oh, no. I'm...
I'm great, just...

800
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,026
Happy ending, right?

801
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,574
Night.

802
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,469
Hey, Wilson.

803
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:52,572
How you doing?

804
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:54,708
You okay?

805
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,233
Do you need me
to do anything, or...

806
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,237
Hey, hey, hey...

807
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:17,914
<i>I don't do reunions, but
I can see why people do.</i>

808
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,099
Thank you.

809
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:32,378
<i>They can make you feel like
you haven't felt in a long time.</i>

810
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,908
<i>It's comfy, it's familiar, it's
kind of like coming home.</i>

811
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,334
What?

812
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:02,208
Nathan was so sad today.

813
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,122
We had this patient
who turned up

814
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:06,912
after being missing for years.

815
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,249
And we called her family.

816
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,832
I think it brought up a lot of
feelings about his fiancée.

817
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:15,856
Megan.

818
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,543
I've never seen him like that.

819
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:26,349
When Derek died,
there was one day,

820
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,419
just one day, where I
didn't know where he was.

821
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,135
I pretended everything
was going to be okay,

822
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,359
but inside, I was going crazy.

823
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,077
I guess it's like that
for Nathan every day.

824
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,678
<i>You see how people turned out</i>

825
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,186
<i>if they realized their
hopes and dreams</i>

826
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,901
<i>or if they have lost
their hopes and dreams.</i>

827
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:50,925
Yeah.

828
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:52,726
You get him.

829
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:54,772
Well, I don't know about that.

830
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:58,464
<i>Or maybe you see that they
have found what we all should find...</i>

831
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,934
<i>brand new hopes and dreams.</i>
