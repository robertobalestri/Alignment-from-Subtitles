1
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,379
<i>Our skulls cushion our brains.</i>

2
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,334
What's happening?

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,187
Hey, it's me. Do you
want a giant tumor?

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,200
Why would I want that?

5
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,752
It's the one from my
wall that Derek drew.

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,172
I thought you might
like it. It's here in the hall.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,129
<i>Our rib cage guards our hearts.</i>

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,904
<i>The body is built to protect
our most vulnerable parts.</i>

9
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,523
- Is she cleaning?
- At 3:30?

10
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:43,503
<i>At least,</i>

11
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,244
<i>that's how it's
supposed to work.</i>

12
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,729
Josephine Wilson. Strong in
ortho, plastics, and not a bad head

13
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,986
for neuro, actually. Her
outcomes are excellent.

14
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,933
Yeah, she really rallied.

15
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,489
She had a tough
year, personally.

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,921
Never would have
known. Stephanie Edwards.

17
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,990
She's expressed a clear
interest and talent for neuro.

18
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:05,391
She could write
whatever ticket she wants.

19
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,360
- She's a superstar.
- And very driven.

20
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,017
Yes, she will make us proud.

21
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,964
Well, this is fun.

22
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,837
- Like the Sorting Hat.
- Yep.

23
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,141
Benjamin Warren.

24
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,196
Well, say what you want to say.

25
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:24,744
Warren's a utility player,
good anywhere you put him.

26
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:25,817
That's true.

27
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,004
He tends to play it safe.

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,203
He goes for the easy
cases, easy diagnosis.

29
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,804
He lays back. No risks.

30
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,261
Ben Warren?

31
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,943
- Have you seen his file?
- He's made very risky moves.

32
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,728
I've had to
reprimand him myself.

33
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:42,918
Of course, I read his file.

34
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,132
After a mistake like Warren makes,
a resident goes one of two ways.

35
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,556
He either plays it
smarter or he plays it safer.

36
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,219
Warren went safer.

37
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,471
He may not even be
aware it's happening.

38
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,963
Moving on. Martin Carver.

39
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,300
- You talk to Wilson a lot.
- Daily. Why?

40
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,504
She and Karev. You
think they're back together?

41
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,636
I don't know.

42
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,472
- Oh, uh, never mind. Forget I asked.
- Oh! You like her.

43
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,358
- Nope. I'm not doing this.
- No. Hey. Hang on,
hang on. Stop.

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,849
You're a good guy.
You want to let that go,

45
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:17,013
okay? You made a grand gesture,

46
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,420
but she still hasn't said
anything to you, has she?

47
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:23,220
So, just do yourself a favor.

48
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,721
That's all I'm saying.

49
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,256
Here you go. Friend to friend.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,857
Okay. Let's go fix people.

51
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,592
<i>Doctor Wentz to
Labor and Delivery.</i>

52
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,679
- Hey. Someone paged me.
- That was me. I need your help.

53
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,697
- Very urgent.
- Great. Where we headed?

54
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,617
My place or yours. Tonight.
The minute we are off of work.

55
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,721
I don't care if you have
other plans. They're canceled.

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,507
- I have plans of my own.
- So you paged me
for a dinner date.

57
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,177
I mean, sure. We can eat, too.

58
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,911
My plans are more...

59
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,597
naked plans.

60
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,298
Oh. Okay.

61
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,633
To be clear, I mean sex.

62
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,473
Yeah, no, no, I... I got that.

63
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,888
But you're hesitating.
I came on too strong?

64
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,857
You're not ready?
You're weirded out.

65
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,411
Hey.

66
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,715
Are you with someone?

67
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,533
- What's your name?
- Liam.

68
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,973
Liam, hey. Are you hurt?

69
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,610
Are you sick? Do you feel bad?

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,775
Okay. Where are your parents?

71
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,982
I don't have any.

72
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,682
- Who do we have, DeLuca?
- This is Holly Harner.

73
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,918
Complaining of generalized chest
and abdominal pain after a fall.

74
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,588
She's also got a pretty,
obvious forearm fracture.

75
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,972
Just waiting for her
X-rays to come up.

76
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,841
- Hi, Holly. I'm Dr. Kepner.
- Hi.

77
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:36,142
Can you tell me how you fell?

78
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,650
I was having the
best sex of my life.

79
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,514
No, third best.

80
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:45,669
- I'd hate to see the best.
- No, no. So, then I had to pee.

81
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,471
And it was dark, and I'm
trying to find the bathroom.

82
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,640
I found the front door instead,
walked right out in the stairwell and...

83
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,376
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, two flights.

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,112
He slept right through
it. His neighbor found me.

85
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,656
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

86
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,834
- And the guy you were with?
- Ah, well, it was one of those

87
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,938
one night things, so he'll just think I
ducked out in the middle of the night.

88
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,611
Which is fine.
It's good, actually.

89
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,709
Oh, my God.

90
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,860
What? What is it?

91
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,795
My pants, they're on his floor.

92
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,881
He's gonna have
to figure that one out.

93
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,366
Um, I'm sorry, Holly,

94
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,268
but it looks like you've
broken your arm in two places.

95
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,220
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah. And there's free fluid

96
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:23,990
in the left upper quadrant.
We're gonna need to get her up

97
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,374
- for a pan scan
and page general.
- Okay.

98
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:29,634
Is he single?

99
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,659
Hey, Maggie.

100
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,688
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,452
- Are you gonna be home tonight?
- Should be. What are we doing?

102
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,467
I was thinking about
having Nathan over,

103
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,487
but, I don't want it to be
weird or uncomfortable, so...

104
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,756
Well, It's your house. You should
have over whomever you want.

105
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,109
- But, It's your house, too.
- Are you saying

106
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,643
you don't want to have
him over if I'm there?

107
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,011
No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

108
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,315
It's totally fine.

109
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,437
- Are Holly's scans up yet?
- Uh, not yet.

110
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,884
It's a little weird,
but it's fine.

111
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,703
Okay, forget it.
Forget I said anything.

112
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,188
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

113
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,732
- Okay.
- Okay.

114
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:15,814
<i>Hello?</i>

115
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,837
<i>Hey, Holly. How's
it going in there?</i>

116
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,564
Yeah, um, you know,
it just occurred to me,

117
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,334
uh, when you do the scan,
you might see something weird.

118
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,835
And I don't want
you to freak out.

119
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,404
Uh, don't worry about it.

120
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,238
We've seen everything,
Holly. Trust me.

121
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,425
Uh, well, I've got a giant,
inoperable heart tumor...

122
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,711
- Holy...
<i>- And the... you know,</i>

123
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,169
you should just ignore that.
It's just something I have.

124
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,096
Is it sharp, like
someone stabbing you

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,399
really hard, or throbbing

126
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,802
like a, a ball bouncing
against your head?

127
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,225
It just hurts.

128
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,728
- Sometimes I feel
like I've been spinning.
- Like you're dizzy?

129
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,710
Okay. Constant pain. Intermittent
dizziness. It could be vestibular.

130
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,614
Can you tell us who
takes care of you?

131
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,964
- Charlotte.
- And where do you
and Charlotte live?

132
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,071
On a farm.

133
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,318
Wow. That's pretty cool.

134
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,652
You got any animals?

135
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,955
A rat and a goose, a sheep.

136
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,747
Ah, I bet there's a pig, too.

137
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,532
You stay right here
for a minute, okay?

138
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,815
All right, something's
going on neurologically.

139
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,999
We need to get him a head CT.

140
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,617
No, we can't. Not
without consent.

141
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,452
And how do we find
Wilbur's parents?

142
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,888
We've already placed a call out
to police regarding missing kids.

143
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,173
It shouldn't take too long.

144
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,008
Kid's got clean clothes,
seems well nourished.

145
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,226
He reads books.

146
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,845
Or someone reads them to him.

147
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,134
He's... he's seizing.

148
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,833
Liam. Liam. Someone
get something for his head!

149
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,118
Two of lorazepam! And draw
up a loading dose of Keppra!

150
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,174
On it.

151
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,864
So, you have some bleeding
from a spleen laceration.

152
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,645
We'd like to try and do something
called a splenic embolization

153
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,648
- so that we can repair it
without doing surgery.
- All right. I'm in.

154
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,802
- Surgery would only
slow me down.
- Well, as for your heart tumor.

155
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,704
Oh, yeah. Left atrial
sarcoma. It's inoperable.

156
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,107
I've got less than
a year left. It's okay.

157
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,592
Inoperable means different
things to different surgeons.

158
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,595
I've... I've seen six surgeons.
So I know the stages.

159
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,465
You guys are in Stage one.
You see it, your eyes light up,

160
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,167
you're the only
ones who can tame it.

161
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,068
Stage two you make a plan,

162
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,220
a plan unlike any who
have come before you.

163
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,556
You get my consent.

164
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,924
Stage three you
realize it doesn't work

165
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,243
and you feel weird

166
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,346
and you get all sad, and then
you feel you disappointed me

167
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,547
and then make it my job to
convince you that I'm okay,

168
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,451
so, that you feel better.
Can we just skip it?

169
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,353
I know it's complicated,
but I really think...

170
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,988
Yeah, how long am I laid
up till my spleen heals?

171
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,258
How long till I can, you
know, get back in the saddle?

172
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,060
Uh, depends on
the kind of saddle.

173
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:50,363
Uh, well, I'd like to have sex
with as many men as I care to,

174
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,770
until my tumor tells me I can't.

175
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,566
Goals.

176
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,934
- Impressive.
- That's nice.

177
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,059
This fall really put a
kink in my plans and um,

178
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,307
- not in a good way.
- Well, provided

179
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,910
that your spleen heals
without complications,

180
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:07,035
you should be back to
your normal... lifestyle

181
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,698
in a few days, maybe a week.

182
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,135
Okay. Any chance we
can shave that down?

183
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,129
Partial deglovement, broken bones,
extreme tissue and nerve damage.

184
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,232
- And what do we have here? Ouch.
- Yup.

185
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,880
A 27 year old got his hand
jammed in a revolving door.

186
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,766
Ah, that'll do it.
What's the game plan?

187
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,703
Well, since his MESS score's a
seven, we're sitting right in the gray area

188
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,838
between salvage and
amputation, so obv...

189
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,375
Actually, I'd like to hear
what Warren's thinking.

190
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,679
Good idea.

191
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,568
Well uh, reconstructive
surgery is out.

192
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,182
If we go that route,
we just, you know,

193
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,951
there's a high likelihood of
failure and we're just back here

194
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,120
in six months, amputating
a nonfunctioning hand.

195
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,394
- Hm, that is true.
- Amputation is simpler.

196
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,464
But some patients,
mentally, can't process that.

197
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,200
Choose wisely, then.

198
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,789
Well, since the mess score is borderline,
we have to look for other indicators.

199
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,919
The LSI, the PSI could give us
a clearer picture of the ischemia,

200
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,471
the bone muscle damage, and
the extent of the vascular injury.

201
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,306
Warren, you're not
writing a research paper.

202
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,141
You're treating a patient
on a morphine drip.

203
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,275
Make a call.

204
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,365
Uh...

205
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,614
according to these numbers,
I say we amputate, then.

206
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,248
Here's a number
for you, Warren, 27.

207
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,188
A 27 year old wants
to keep his hand.

208
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,764
We're gonna do a rotational flap with antibiotic
beads and try to save this guy's hand.

209
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,827
Right. Of course.

210
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,996
Book an O.R., and uh,
give me some images

211
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,260
of his left and right
thighs, also, for the grafts.

212
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,671
All right.

213
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,641
It was a gray area.

214
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,760
Hey. So, Meredith was talking
about bringing Nathan over tonight.

215
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,916
Bringing him home?

216
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,014
- To our house?
- Yeah.

217
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,815
And then it got weird,
and now she's not.

218
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,585
I'm still wrapping my head around
the fact that she's dating him.

219
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,393
Oh, my God. The tumor.

220
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,208
- What?
- That's why she took the tumor
out of her room.

221
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,632
She doesn't want to have sex
with him in a shrine to Derek.

222
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,413
She did not do that
with the last guy.

223
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,882
And look what happened.
Screaming and crying

224
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,774
and us kicking a half naked
man out into the street.

225
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,654
She's clearing a path.

226
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,455
- She's moving on.
- She's moving on.

227
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,312
This is serious, her and Riggs.

228
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,049
We have to support this.

229
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,407
Now we are in the celiac artery,

230
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,021
and that looks like
the splenic artery.

231
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,312
- Got it.
- Meredith, heads up,

232
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,265
I'm gonna be home late tonight.

233
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,328
Okay. Deploying gelfoam.

234
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,314
More than late, I'm gonna
take another look at Holly's case.

235
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,650
I've got some old records and
studies that I want to... look over.

236
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,052
I thought she
didn't want you to.

237
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,504
Between the scans
and the paperwork

238
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:47,256
it's gonna take some
time. A lot of time, actually.

239
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,358
You should probably count
on me camping out here

240
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,302
for the duration and
not coming home.

241
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,680
Okay. Just wanted
to let you know.

242
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,104
- Thanks.
- All right.

243
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,841
- Should I ask? Okay.
- No.

244
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,557
Thank you so
much for finding us.

245
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,764
We, uh, we called the school.

246
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,499
We called his friend
Sabrina. We called the police.

247
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:17,169
He said he took the
train here? Goodness.

248
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,804
We live an hour away.

249
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,708
Liam had a seizure while
we were talking to him.

250
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,610
We took him to CT
to see what's going on.

251
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,214
Uh, David, Marie, Liam
has a very large tumor.

252
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:31,405
It's called a pituitary adenoma,
and he's gonna need brain surgery.

253
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:35,693
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,784
Is that why he's been getting these
headaches and why he's been so tired?

255
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:47,788
When can we take him home?

256
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:53,339
Well, that depends on how quickly the
brain swelling goes down after surgery.

257
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:55,441
Most patients can
be released within...

258
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,960
No, Liam won't have the surgery.

259
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,730
Or anything else. No
more needles, no scans.

260
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,932
We don't believe in
that sort of intervention.

261
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,001
I'm not sure you understand
what we're saying here.

262
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,853
If you take Liam home
without treatment, it gets worse.

263
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,717
- He could die.
- No, doctor, he won't.

264
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,763
Not if it's God's will.

265
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,699
So, thank you for
respecting our beliefs.

266
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,101
How soon can you
discharge my son?

267
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,474
And this states you are
aware you're taking Liam home

268
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,964
against medical advice.

269
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,317
I know this probably
seems a little...

270
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,986
unusual.

271
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,633
I appreciate your understanding.

272
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,403
Do you understand that
"against medical advice"

273
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,288
in this case means
if you take Liam now,

274
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,432
there's a very, real
chance Liam will die?

275
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,547
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

276
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,323
Who taught you it was okay
to speak to patients that way?

277
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,692
She's not my patient.

278
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,111
The embolization went well.

279
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,301
I was able to stop the
bleeding on your spleen.

280
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,838
We'll just have to monitor
you for the next 24 hours, and...

281
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,307
- you should be okay.
- All right.

282
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,144
I should've just
turned on the light.

283
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,173
I didn't want to
wake him, you know?

284
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,341
Well, that was polite.

285
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,094
No, it was because I
didn't want to talk to him.

286
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:25,097
He's the kind of guy who always
says, "I'll tell you something,"

287
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,999
before he tells you something.

288
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,400
Like it's good enough
to be announced.

289
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:31,603
- So he's not a keeper. Uh,
well, I'm not really looking

290
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,823
for a keeper. I'm
gonna be gone soon.

291
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,008
So, I can't hold onto anything.

292
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:39,412
I'm just looking for what
looks good to me right now.

293
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:40,779
Hey, Holly.

294
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,082
Uh, your boyfriend's here.
He's asking if he can come up.

295
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,505
Oh, my God.

296
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,692
Okay, his neighbor must've
blabbed. Did he say, boyfriend?

297
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,478
Can you just tell
him that I died?

298
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:56,178
- Um, we can, tell him that you're
asleep. Then he won't go away.

299
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,679
If he hangs on,

300
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,217
somebody's gonna eventually
have to tell him that I died for real.

301
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,418
So,

302
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,774
let's just spare him that.

303
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,423
- We can talk to him.
- Okay.

304
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,292
Well, he's dumb, but he's cute.

305
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,565
Oh, and he's um...

306
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:13,784
Mmm.

307
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,622
Hey, feel free to take a
spin. I'm not going back.

308
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,195
Oh, Dr. Minnick?

309
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:27,526
I think you're right
about Ben Warren.

310
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,761
Oh?

311
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,585
Yeah, I saw something that
may confirm your suspicions.

312
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:35,967
- I owe you an apology.
- I'm fresh eyes. It helps.

313
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,042
You've known these
kids for years. I haven't.

314
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,244
Well, that's very true.

315
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,732
I was reading Stephanie
Edwards' file, and I noticed...

316
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,546
when her boyfriend
died on Shepherd's table,

317
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,665
Edwards went back to
work almost immediately.

318
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,367
Didn't see any records
of counseling or therapy.

319
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,587
She was fine.
She's very focused.

320
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:57,189
- So that's a no.
- Why are you interested
in her file?

321
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,724
I noticed some red
flags. Today, for instance,

322
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,643
she was inappropriate with
a patient's family member.

323
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,029
She can be arrogant,
and she can get snarky.

324
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:07,199
- She's a surgeon.
- Who gets triggered by patients.

325
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:10,157
Look. Trust me, Edwards knows
more about patients than most of us.

326
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,593
Good night.

327
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,782
You can't tell him she's dead.

328
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,619
But that's what she wanted. I
mean, he needs to know, and,

329
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,401
- it's... it's kind.
- It's illegal,
to say the very least.

330
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,292
- Is this him? Hi.
- Yes. Hi.

331
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,605
- Hi. Yes. Yes, that's me.
- Corey?

332
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,308
- Hi. Did you tell Holly
I'm here?
- Yes.

333
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,565
- Listen, Corey.
- We did, we did. She knows.

334
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,918
Does she think it's weird?

335
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:39,331
I mean, we just...
we don't really know...

336
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,023
We just met. But,
we got really close.

337
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,369
Is she okay?

338
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,822
Corey...

339
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,147
we have some, very bad news.

340
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,882
- Holly...
- Has had a hell of a day

341
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:57,238
- and is just not really up
for visitors right now, so... Oh.

342
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:59,073
Oh, okay, well.

343
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,192
That's... that's great.

344
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,774
I mean, that she's okay.
I was so worried that...

345
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,030
Yes, so you can go home now.

346
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,999
Good night.

347
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,268
Uh, good night.

348
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,231
I mean, she's not
wrong. He is cute.

349
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,733
Maybe you should hit that.

350
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,924
You are a dark, dark person.

351
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,884
I can't get together tonight.

352
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,700
Okay. No big deal.

353
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,170
I just have a patient who's
in labor with a baby with CDH,

354
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,194
and I'm gonna be here
all night. I'm so sorry.

355
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,497
Of course. I understand. Just...

356
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,368
I was looking
forward to it, is all.

357
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,924
I look for you.

358
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,140
All day.

359
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,055
When I um...

360
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,030
when I turn a corner, or I
pass by one of the scan rooms.

361
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,653
Uh, getting on an elevator.

362
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,656
I hope that maybe I'll just...

363
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,926
catch a glimpse of
you. And when I...

364
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,737
see you...

365
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,401
every time, it makes
me catch my breath...

366
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,843
just a little.

367
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,474
And my heart speeds
up. My palms sweat.

368
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:26,945
Seeing you...

369
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,515
talking to you, and...

370
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,018
touching you.

371
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,454
It's all I can think about.

372
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,490
It is?

373
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:43,026
I can't wait for
our naked plans.

374
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,175
But one more
night of anticipation,

375
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,679
doesn't have to
be the worst thing.

376
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,103
Hey.

377
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,422
Hi. Nathan.

378
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,725
No, I'm sorry. I have to cancel.

379
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,630
Urgh, I've had a tough day and
I'm just not up for any visitors.

380
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,015
Yes, let's try for tomorrow.

381
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,785
Okay. Good night.

382
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,207
Liam's gone?

383
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,493
You let his parents take him
home? He was my patient!

384
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,862
We can't keep a minor for
treatment against his parents' will,

385
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,365
especially when that treatment
goes against their religious beliefs.

386
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,534
They have a right to those
beliefs, and we have to respect that.

387
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,024
Of course! But maybe... wha...

388
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,038
what if his tumor starts to
bleed? What if he strokes out?

389
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,908
They signed an AMA
as soon as he woke up.

390
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,194
Look, the kid took a train all
by himself to ask us for help.

391
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,431
Actual help. Not prayers
and olive oil on his head.

392
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:35,885
No neurosurgeon will cut into a
kid's skull without parental consent.

393
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,119
Because it's illegal.

394
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,437
Can we get a court order?

395
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,588
State law protects
families from prosecution

396
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,052
if their faith prohibits them
from seeking medical care.

397
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,311
And I would think that you,
with your history, of all people,

398
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,495
would want to follow the
letter of the law right now.

399
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,976
- How'd it go?
- He didn't come over.

400
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,824
- Uh, why?
- I don't know,

401
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,525
but I heard her
call him and cancel,

402
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,916
and then she didn't come
out of her room the whole night.

403
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:06,003
- Were you eavesdropping?
- No.

404
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,472
Maybe.

405
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,474
I was curious.

406
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,921
Also, I was in the hall.

407
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,946
I figured I should move the big,
giant, scary tumor or something.

408
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,578
- I have a giant, scary tumor.
- What? I stayed up all night

409
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,568
studying it, and
I think I solved it.

410
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,866
Now you're telling me I could
have solved it from the comfort

411
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,952
of my own home, my
own bedroom, my own bed.

412
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,921
- I want a giant, scary tumor.
- Get your own.

413
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,361
I got to go see my patient.

414
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:31,895
All night?

415
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,565
I know.

416
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:39,230
Holly, I know other
doctors have failed you,

417
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:41,783
but they were not
thinking outside the box.

418
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,051
Now, I have studied your heart,

419
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,688
I've studied your tumor, and
I can get this. I know I can.

420
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,162
- Nope.
- Look...

421
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:51,426
You know, there's only six doctors
in the world that can do this surgery

422
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,929
and I am one of them?
Look, we have a shot.

423
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,737
No. No, you guys
look, I told you.

424
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,140
No revisiting. No
hatching new plans.

425
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,120
I told you, just
fix up my spleen,

426
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,022
and then send me
on my way, that's it.

427
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,145
Holly.

428
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,492
This could give
you your life back.

429
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,117
Yeah, but this is my
life. I don't need it back.

430
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,098
I don't need the white picket
fence and the bunch of kids

431
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:16,819
and dogs crawling all over
me or whatever kind of future

432
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,854
you think you could
give me because...

433
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,022
you can't.

434
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:23,413
I don't need a future. I have
exactly what I want right now.

435
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,494
Is this really what you want?

436
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,963
What I want is to, uh, is
to is to screw a blind man

437
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,389
after he's given me a
spectacular massage.

438
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,821
I want to have really
inappropriately loud sex

439
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:37,272
in one of those
sound bath domes.

440
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,642
And having surgery's gonna
get in the way with that, so...

441
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,232
thank you, but no.

442
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,589
Can you feel that?

443
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,361
Hold on one second.

444
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:57,999
Hey, there.

445
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,512
You okay?

446
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,197
I'm looking for Dr. Karev.

447
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,501
Well, I know Dr. Karev.

448
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:06,268
Liam? What are you doing...

449
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,841
Uh, I got this one. It's okay.

450
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,110
You okay? It's okay.

451
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,463
You're okay, um...

452
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:17,879
You must really like taking trains,
huh? Let's find you a place to sit.

453
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,186
Just follow me, okay?

454
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,817
Hey! Liam, I thought
you were right behind me.

455
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,825
You all right, buddy? You okay?

456
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,020
Hey, Liam, can you...
can you see me?

457
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,901
Hey, you're doing great.

458
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,207
Touch my finger.

459
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,495
Everything went dark so fast.

460
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,198
And I couldn't see.

461
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,600
Well, you're here
now. It's okay.

462
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,585
Apoplexy.

463
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:54,234
The tumor's bleeding, could be
pushing against the optic nerve.

464
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,367
- I'm so sorry.
- Honey.

465
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,026
- Why are you sorry?
- I promise, I tried.

466
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:02,796
I did what they said,
and I prayed and I prayed,

467
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:04,476
but it didn't work.

468
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,799
God didn't help me.

469
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,085
Can you help me, Dr. Karev?

470
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,970
Can you fix my eyes?

471
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,230
Take a deep breath.
Can you do that?

472
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,838
I promise, Liam, I'm gonna
do everything I can to help you.

473
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,640
But I need to talk to
Dr. Edwards first, okay?

474
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,063
Just wait right here.

475
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,415
Be right back.

476
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:27,265
What can we do without the
parents? We still need consent.

477
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,468
Not if it's emergent.
We need to page neuro

478
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,920
- and prep him for surgery.
- Shouldn't we page Dr. Minnick?

479
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,262
No. Because Liam
is, having a seizure.

480
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,450
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

481
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,931
We can't... that's wrong.

482
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,200
Watching a kid die and
not helping is wrong.

483
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,469
Look, if he was having a seizure
right now, would you just watch?

484
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,920
He's having a seizure.

485
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:50,488
So we control it.

486
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,179
Book an O.R. and page Shepherd.

487
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,388
All right, then, I should be the
one to enter it. I'm the resident.

488
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,479
No, no, no.

489
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,481
We're using the
Minnick method today.

490
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,256
I write up the orders,
so I take the heat.

491
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,722
Remember to push,
uh... Lorazepam first.

492
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,892
And... and... and
turn him on his side.

493
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,476
- Right?
- Right.

494
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,699
And give him some Mannitol.

495
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,333
Holly, your hematocrits
have been stable.

496
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,937
- Looks like
the embolization worked.
- Good, 'cause this hospital

497
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,239
has a lot of attractive
men that I'd just as soon

498
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,507
as not proposition,

499
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,776
any of them until I get rid
of these tubes and wires.

500
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,134
She knows I can see her
hovering over there, right?

501
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,053
Hey, Holly, look.

502
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,533
I know you said you don't
want the tumor surgery,

503
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,587
- and I know that you're scared.
- No, but that's
the thing I'm not.

504
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,689
When I was first
diagnosed, sure.

505
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,413
But then I thought, what
would make me feel better?

506
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,449
Find a hot guy, have
a ridiculous night,

507
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,798
and then all would be well. So
I did that, and I kept doing that

508
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,383
until I realized, why
do anything else?

509
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,052
Sex and death.

510
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,286
That's want I want.

511
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,487
Well, you can say you're ready

512
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,257
for death a lot of people do but
as someone who's been around

513
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,827
a lot of death and
been left behind by it,

514
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:02,928
I can tell you,

515
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,668
trust me, you don't want that.

516
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,582
Especially when you have
someone like Dr. Pierce

517
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,103
telling you she can fix you, offering
you the impossible. Don't ignore that.

518
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:14,922
The scary thing isn't dying.
The scary thing is surviving

519
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,648
and accepting that you
actually have a life to live.

520
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,867
Don't you want to
stick around and live it?

521
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,245
You really think you
can get the tumor?

522
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,592
I told you I could get it.

523
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,766
I meant it.

524
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,068
Yeah, but other
doctors have meant it.

525
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,348
I'll put you on bypass.

526
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,922
And I'll remove your heart
so I can get all the tumor.

527
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,226
Dr. Grey, Dr. Kepner
will be there to assist.

528
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,973
Holly,

529
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:49,363
I can get the tumor out.

530
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,754
Go for it.

531
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,139
You sure?

532
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,926
- Yeah, do it.
- Okay.

533
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,244
Dr. Shepherd, I've got
Social Work paging you.

534
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,051
Almost done here. Basin.

535
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,133
Hey, is this Liam? Little Liam
with the religious parents?

536
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,835
- It is.
- I saw his name on the board,

537
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,037
and I couldn't believe it.
How did you get consent?

538
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,823
I didn't need it. He showed up
again and became emergent.

539
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,126
Did what we needed
to do to save his life.

540
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,994
- Karev!
- Is there something
I should know?

541
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,313
You opened this child's skull
without his parents knowing,

542
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,098
after what happened last time?

543
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,182
He seized in the E.R.

544
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:33,118
Dr. Shepherd, it's
Social Work again.

545
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:35,253
Nine-one-one. The
patient's parents are here.

546
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,272
- What happened last time?
- Nothing happened.

547
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,681
One of you, better
start talking, right now.

548
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,216
- So, you're holding him hostage?
- I understand
your anger, Mr. Fisher,

549
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,852
but your son just
had brain surgery.

550
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,721
This hospital cannot
release him yet.

551
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:56,057
It would put him at severe
risk for infection, even death.

552
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,459
She's right. He's
not even awake yet...

553
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,628
Don't you talk to me. You knew
where my wife and I stood on this.

554
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,445
- His intracranial pressure...
- You had no right to touch him!

555
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,798
Okay, if Dr. Karev hadn't
intervened when he had,

556
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,201
this would be an entirely,
different conversation.

557
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,137
Now, according to
Dr. Shepherd, Liam's tumor

558
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,906
was severely
affecting his vision.

559
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,274
It was only a matter of time...

560
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,798
- But he's okay now? He can see?
- Marie!

561
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,833
Dr. Shepherd was able to remove
the entire tumor from the optic nerve.

562
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,577
We'll have to wait till he's awake
to confirm his sight was restored.

563
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,161
Oh, baby.

564
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,280
I hope you enjoyed
practicing medicine,

565
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:38,171
'cause after I'm done suing
this place, you're all done.

566
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,554
- I know you did something.
- He had a seizure.

567
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,123
- Check his records.
- You could go to jail, Karev.

568
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:47,614
- Again.
- I'd go to jail for this one.

569
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,376
And, how many
fingers do you see?

570
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,044
Three?

571
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,126
That's right. You
got them all right.

572
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,549
You're doing great, Liam.

573
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,486
- Thank you.
- Aw.

574
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,821
You're very welcome.

575
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,639
- Dr. Edwards.
- Hm.

576
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,863
I will be back.

577
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:31,536
- It's time to start talking.
- I'm sorry?

578
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,593
Why did Dr. Karev
enter these orders?

579
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,491
He was following your
method. He let me run point.

580
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,477
So, he didn't give you orders to operate
on Liam without his parents' consent?

581
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,195
Like I said, I was
running point.

582
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,464
What did Karev do, Edwards?

583
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,674
- I need you to tell me exactly
what he did...
- Why? It's all in the chart.

584
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,792
We saved his life.

585
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,814
Liam is alive. He can
see, his tumor is out,

586
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,650
and he's alive.

587
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,187
That's the job, right?

588
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:11,231
Dividing the dome
of the left atrium.

589
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,168
What left atrium?
It's all tumor.

590
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,283
How does she even have
the stamina for all that sex

591
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,718
with this thing sitting on her
chest? When I get home from work,

592
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,920
I barely have the energy
to put on fuzzy socks.

593
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,224
Basin with ice.

594
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,560
Holly's just out there.
Doing anything she wants.

595
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,464
Anyone she wants. Any time.

596
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:36,089
- I'm kind of jealous.
- Of this? You're jealous of this?

597
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,818
Damn it.

598
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,822
It's invaded all the way to
her posterior pericardium.

599
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,224
Plan B.

600
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:58,845
Let's see if we can debulk this
tumor off the pulmonary veins.

601
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,942
Warren. Come with me.

602
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:19,199
<i>Dr. Cohen to Oncology.
Dr. Cohen to Oncology.</i>

603
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,236
What do you see here?

604
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:26,584
Um, I see surgeries.

605
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,387
No, you see residents
doing surgeries.

606
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,756
- Where's your name?
- I'm covering the pit.

607
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,881
Exactly. You're
a senior resident.

608
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,646
You shouldn't be sewing up toes,
you should be repairing aortas.

609
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,349
Sir, I don't mind covering the
pit. I like going where I'm needed.

610
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,151
You're a surgeon. You're
needed in the operating room.

611
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,321
What you think Wilson and
Edwards stood back and waited

612
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,475
for a chance to
shine? No. They took it.

613
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,944
- Dr. Webber...
- Listen. I know what you can do.

614
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:56,064
But I'm not the only one making your
fellowship recommendation anymore.

615
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,167
There's a sense
you're playing it safe.

616
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,457
Laying back.

617
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,737
This is coming from Minnick?

618
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,589
You told her she's wrong?

619
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,613
Is she wrong?

620
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,282
You tell me.

621
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,484
Okay, we've freed it from
the pulmonary arteries.

622
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,310
Got to keep going down, gotta
keep following this tumor down.

623
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,526
What are you doing in
here? I've got tumor fever.

624
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,795
I had a brain surgery on a
young boy. Then I heard you had

625
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,219
a big, beautiful tumor
in here. Let me see.

626
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,374
That is massive. That
is a thing of beauty.

627
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,310
The Sistine Chapel of tumors.

628
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,847
It's invaded deep into
her posterior mediastinum.

629
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,162
These tumors aren't beautiful.
They're horrifying and smart

630
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:47,031
and designed to choke the life
out of someone before they have

631
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,015
- a chance to live.
- Exquisite.

632
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:52,909
What is it?

633
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:56,095
It's extended all the
way into her esophagus.

634
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,063
We can't reconstruct
her entire chest cavity.

635
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,531
If it's in her esophagus,

636
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,905
the chances are, it's
also invaded her spine.

637
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,798
You'd risk paralysis if
you tried to take it out.

638
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,623
Look, we can, at
least, remove the tumor

639
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,592
from the heart itself, relieve
some of the symptoms.

640
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:18,752
I mean, it'll grow back, but it'll be
slow growing, buy her some time.

641
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:22,589
Maggie...

642
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,785
I'll resect the esophagus

643
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,488
and create a spit fistula,
and then I'll come back

644
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,763
- and reconstruct and...
- But that's impossible.

645
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,560
Well, that's what
we told her we'd do.

646
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,518
We told her we would
do the impossible.

647
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:38,750
Right, but we'll be taking
away any quality of life she has.

648
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:42,203
I mean, it sounds awful to
say, but she's adapted to this.

649
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,526
She's learned to live with it.

650
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,130
You're saying I have
to tell her I can't do it?

651
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,998
Can we speed this up a
little? I want to get out of here.

652
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,667
This is getting
you out of here, sir.

653
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,819
I don't want you making any
more decisions for my child.

654
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,287
We didn't. Liam made decisions.

655
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,429
- We supported them.
- Liam is a kid. My kid.

656
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:05,927
- And that's not your job.
- No, that's yours. We did your job.

657
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,096
Your job is to protect your
child. You job is to keep him safe

658
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,765
and healthy, to tell him
everything will be all right, and then

659
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,901
to move Heaven and
Earth to make sure that it is.

660
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,487
That's your job, and
you couldn't do that.

661
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:17,489
That is not my job.
That is up to God.

662
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:19,290
If God did anything for Liam,

663
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:22,749
God delivered him safely
to us because He saw,

664
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:26,914
that He made you
so weak and so stupid

665
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,756
that you were going
to kill your child.

666
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,325
You're gonna burn in hell.

667
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,181
Based on what I saw today,
she needs to be suspended.

668
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,383
- Well, hold on now...
- Well, did she injure the man?

669
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,186
- It doesn't matter. Does it matter?
- I just can't believe this

670
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,555
- from Edwards?
- You can't? You yourself said,

671
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,557
her boyfriend died a
former patient of hers.

672
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,926
No counseling, no
support, no time off.

673
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,144
I told you, we watched
her. She showed no signs...

674
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,814
Students like her won't show you
what they need, until it's too late.

675
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,883
She works to the
exclusion of everything else.

676
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:20,952
She connects with
patients in the extreme

677
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,420
either overly
attached or stone cold.

678
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:27,408
And now this? These are
indications of resident burn out.

679
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:37,669
I just wanted to say, I
was not aiming for his head.

680
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:40,421
I was aiming for the
wall. I'm not stupid.

681
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,706
I was just mad.

682
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,570
- You don't wanna
be funny right now.
- I'm not being funny.

683
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,199
I'm not. I shouldn't
have done it. I was angry.

684
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:50,036
The patient was a child.

685
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,408
- A sick child.
- He was a little kid who didn't
have any help, at all.

686
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,694
I lost control.

687
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,548
And I'm sorry.

688
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,981
It's startling is what it is.

689
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,183
Edwards has been given
too long a rope, for too long,

690
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,975
and, I don't blame her. She's
a product of her environment.

691
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,356
Poor supervision or none
at all from Webber or Bailey.

692
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,209
And, Karev was
her attending today.

693
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,912
He's hardly a shining
example of restraint.

694
00:35:20,936 --> 00:35:23,147
This is exactly why I
teach the way I teach...

695
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,016
Okay. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to stop you right there.

696
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,774
- I'm sorry. I know he's your friend...
- Hey! Stop.

697
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:32,339
I'm wearing very sexy underwear
right now and I've been thinking

698
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,243
about tonight since last night.
All I want to do is take you home

699
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,678
and take off all of your clothes,
and the more that you talk

700
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,381
about Webber and Karev, the
less that I want to do any of that.

701
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:43,140
So, respectfully, shut up.

702
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:46,804
Just get in the car and
come home with me.

703
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:53,244
Jo? Uh, listen, do
you want to get a beer?

704
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:58,182
I have a teratoma excision at seven.
I have to read up on but... tomorrow?

705
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,806
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, tomorrow.

706
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,022
- Hey, Jo?
- Yeah.

707
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:09,049
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am. I'm good, actually.

708
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,216
Talking to you is probably
one of the only good things

709
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,106
- to come out of this year.
- Andrew...

710
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,271
Hang on. This past year's
been rough for both of us.

711
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:23,496
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You know what? I'm not.

712
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,663
I'm not sorry. 'Cause I feel
like we went through it together.

713
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,167
- I feel like...
- Stop.

714
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,588
Please.

715
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,640
I know what you're about to say.

716
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,196
I... I don't...

717
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,417
- I don't think you...
- And the second
that you say it...

718
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,822
Okay.

719
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,046
Uh...

720
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,082
I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

721
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,889
His visual field
exam looks good.

722
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,337
We're expecting him
to make a full recovery.

723
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,493
Oh!

724
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,171
Liam made it all the way
to the hospital on his own.

725
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,318
Blind.

726
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:21,688
It was a miracle.

727
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,658
Or... someone helped him.

728
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,775
Someone drove him here.

729
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,632
The Lord helps those
who help themselves.

730
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,059
So, um...

731
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,144
my tumor's still in there.

732
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,681
I'm so sorry, Holly.

733
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,269
Oh, God, what
did I tell you guys?

734
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,634
Oh, you doctors,
you crazy people.

735
00:37:56,658 --> 00:38:00,610
You just have to try, you
just have to cut people open.

736
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,023
Resecting the tumor
load out of your heart

737
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,881
will help your symptoms
and buy you time.

738
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:11,053
Yeah, this tumor, it's
just uh... it's part of me.

739
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,886
It's like my hair or my boobs,

740
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,560
or my weird looking toes.

741
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,679
I made room for it.

742
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:26,372
We just made you
do it, didn't we?

743
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,741
We just made you make us
feel better about ourselves.

744
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,726
It happens every time.

745
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:41,868
You're in trouble.

746
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,098
Consider yourself warned.

747
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,299
I'm raising my game.

748
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,301
From here on, I'm
gunning for you.

749
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,771
I'm stealing your surgeries,
taking the best services.

750
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,639
You can run, when
you turn around,

751
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,547
- I'm gonna be right
on your heels.
- I won't be there, so...

752
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:58,528
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

753
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,371
My privileges got revoked.

754
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,586
I have to go to counseling.

755
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,709
For real?

756
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,645
- For how long?
- Have fun raising your game.

757
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,182
You'll actually have a
shot at beating mine now.

758
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,903
Hey, I'm glad I caught you
in the office. It's Dr. Karev,

759
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,993
Alex Karev.

760
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,375
No, I'm not in
any trouble, uh...

761
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,198
No, I... I don't need a lawyer.

762
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,780
Um, I... I need a referral.

763
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,070
I need to find a guy.

764
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,273
Uh, can you help me out?

765
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,959
Okay, yeah, one second.

766
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:42,429
Yeah?

767
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:57,955
<i>The body adapts.</i>

768
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,523
<i>It protects itself.</i>

769
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,430
<i>But it can't close
off completely.</i>

770
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
<i>Or, we're not
really living, right?</i>

771
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,548
I reject fuzzy socks tonight.

772
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,216
I need booze. Anyone
want to get a drink?

773
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,018
Yes, please. And
also, like, a man.

774
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,053
Like a nice, new,
attractive man.

775
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,822
- I don't want to fall in love.
- No, I don't want a boyfriend.

776
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,358
I just don't want to wait until
I'm dying before I let myself

777
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,093
- have some fun.
- You guys in?

778
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,161
- Not tonight.
- I don't know.

779
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,595
No doctors.

780
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,304
Strangers. Where would
Holly go? I'm gonna Yelp.

781
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,375
You guys have fun.

782
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,290
Oh, hey. How's Holly? Is
she awake? Can I see her?

783
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,380
Corey,

784
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,411
- the news is not good.
- Okay.

785
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,397
- Okay.
- It's time to let her go.

786
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:41,249
Oh, my God. She died?

787
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,384
No, I didn't say that.

788
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,441
But you're not going
to see her again.

789
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,824
Corey, hold the time you two
spent together close to your heart.

790
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,242
But don't let it hold you back.

791
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,610
No more sitting
here and waiting.

792
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:57,298
Grab your new life by the
hand and go out there and live it.

793
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,171
- Okay...
- Change is good.

794
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:02,542
<i>So we leave the door
open, just a little...</i>

795
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,356
Hi. Haven't see you all day.

796
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,007
Oh. You headed out?

797
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,748
- I am.
- Me too.

798
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,918
<i>Hoping like hell
it's worth the risk.</i>
