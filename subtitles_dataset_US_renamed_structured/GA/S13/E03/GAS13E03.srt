1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Every patient who gets bad
news wants to be the exception.</i>

2
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,470
<i>The one in a
million. The miracle.</i>

3
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,762
<i>But surgeons don't
believe in miracles.</i>

4
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,848
<i>We have to make them happen.</i>

5
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:19,367
- Are you okay?
- He has all the power now.

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,748
It's wrong. I'm his boss.

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,101
But I asked him out, and his
"No" is always going to be there

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,524
like a bloated corpse.

9
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,712
I've ruined work.
I've ruined it.

10
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,465
No. No, I'm not okay.

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,235
- I was asking Alex.
- Alex?

12
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,099
Alex is fine. He's
lucky he still has a job.

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,185
Well, this is not his
job. He's a surgeon.

14
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,320
He's still a doctor.
In the clinic,

15
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,756
where he doesn't have to look all
of his stupid mistakes in the face.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,980
- Maybe let him answer.
- I'm fine.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,884
- See?
- I mean, it sucks, but I'm fine.

18
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:57,049
If you get any
cardio consults today,

19
00:00:57,073 --> 00:00:59,969
I mean, even the slightest
palpitation, you page Riggs.

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,205
I'm his boss. I give
you my blessing.

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,695
I'm not doing that.

22
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:08,295
Maggie, this isn't a real
problem. You're making it one.

23
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,134
- There she is.
- Hey!

24
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,736
- Hey, how was New York?
- Oh, my gosh. It was amazing!

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,588
Callie's got this great
place near the park,

26
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,723
and Sofia's got this
huge room all to herself.

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,699
- She loves her new school. It's good.
- Very good.

28
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,673
- Hey,
when did you get in?
- This... morning.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,810
Welcome back, Robbin.

30
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,058
Cool. Well, the gas bill
came while you were away,

31
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,244
so I went ahead and
paid that. Thank you.

32
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,164
And the bathroom sink, it
just needed a new washer,

33
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,520
so don't call your guy.

34
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,725
It's better than it looks.

35
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,560
And at least my
eyesight's all the way back.

36
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,849
Good. That's good. I'm glad.

37
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,569
- I got to go.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,789
Marriage is like a bed and
breakfast in Vermont, with sex.

39
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:10,940
Until you have kids.

40
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,775
When I want sex, I don't
have to get out of bed

41
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,212
and drive to the sex.
I just roll right over.

42
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,063
- Can you stop it?
- Why would I stop it?

43
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:20,000
Married sex is dirtier
than I expected.

44
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:22,391
Not the sex, the bragging.

45
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,455
You're flashing your money
after going to the ATM. We get it.

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,342
You're sex-rich. It
is not polite to brag

47
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,161
in front of people
who are sex-poor.

48
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,746
Some of us are barely
making ends meet.

49
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,849
Multiple MVCs
coming into the ER.

50
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:40,025
Hey, Pierce, I got a valve
replacement. You good in the ER?

51
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,861
- Yep, I can cover the pit.
- Got it.

52
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,797
Shepherd. Grey.

53
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,436
- Was that normal?
- Why wouldn't it be normal?

54
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,996
No reason.

55
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,435
I mean, you were
a tad deferential...

56
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,510
- Amelia, don't.
- Damn it.

57
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:02,274
Come on, I move out, and I'm
dead to you now? You just cut me off?

58
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,998
I asked Riggs out. He said no.

59
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,646
- Wait, Riggs?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,598
I'm trying not to be
weird about it at work,

61
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:12,451
and you said I wasn't
weird, so there. Not weird.

62
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:15,227
Except for the part where
you keep talking about it.

63
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,681
Nathan Riggs?

64
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,181
Uh, you're not busy, right?

65
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,283
Nah, I'm just carrying
19 pounds of lac trays,

66
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,852
so I have something
to do with my hands.

67
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,853
Uh, can you get
Tuck from school?

68
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,939
- What, is he sick?
- No, he's not sick.

69
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,425
- Well, then,
why am I picking him up?
- There was an incident.

70
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,576
- What? Is he okay?
- No, he's fine. Are you busy?

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,645
Yes, there's a seven-car
pile-up in the pit.

72
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,364
I know! That's why I
need you to pick him up.

73
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,015
Coming through!

74
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:51,374
Oh, come on. This
is too good to miss.

75
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,010
Look, someone ran
into a funeral procession

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,096
just before it reached the
cemetery. A funeral procession!

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,215
Limos hitting
limos hitting limos.

78
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,100
And then all limos
smashed into the hearse.

79
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:05,138
Doors cracked open, casket
went airborne. A flying corpse!

80
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,540
All right, this, this
is all one family.

81
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:12,696
All right, it's, it's... It's art,
Miranda. It's a hot mess of art.

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,114
And, if you really need
me, I will go pick up Tuck.

83
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,816
But if you don't,
come on, this is...

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,491
this is too good
to miss. This is...

85
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,522
Someone hit a funeral,
and you want popcorn

86
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:25,591
and a front row
seat. Shame on you.

87
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,360
Just for that, you have
to go pick up Tuck.

88
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,384
- I had to pick up Tuck anyway.
- Just go.

89
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,652
I can't... I can't get air.

90
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,636
I know, but you have to
put the oxygen mask on

91
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,959
so it will actually help.

92
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,257
Where's my... Where's
my brother? Where's Julian?

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,008
Um, I don't know, but
I can find out for you.

94
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,262
I'm right here, Morgan, just
like I was two minutes ago.

95
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,598
Follow the light. Again.

96
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,082
Can you give her
something to calm her down?

97
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,484
Sir, I really need
you to look this way.

98
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,921
My sister gets panic attacks.
It's not even her first one today.

99
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,390
I'd like to rule out any
injury to her heart and lungs,

100
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:00,093
- but thank you for the heads-up.
- It was just out of nowhere.

101
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,327
We were to the cemetery

102
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,462
when this jerk just came
speeding out of nowhere.

103
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,003
The car just plowed into us!

104
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,017
And there was, like, a
chain reaction like dominoes.

105
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,552
Was it a drunk driver, or...

106
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,772
I don't know. When I figure
it out, I will sue his ass.

107
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,340
It's what dad would want.

108
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:16,175
Julian, that's the last
thing dad would want!

109
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,196
This funeral wasn't cheap. I
ordered orchids for the grave site.

110
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,598
Okay, tell me if this
feels dull or sharp.

111
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,567
Films are back, Dr. Shepherd.

112
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,519
- And your scans are up.
- Thanks.

113
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,053
Is my arm broken?
It's broken, isn't it?

114
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,861
In two places.

115
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,559
I'm making a list of everyone
in the family's injuries.

116
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,143
We're not paying
for any of this!

117
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,435
<i>Dr. Keller, extension 2219.</i>

118
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:46,256
Excuse me. I need to find out where
Barb is. Do you know if she's okay?

119
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
- Well, if you...
- Barb is my sister.

120
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,443
She's dressed in
black. Oh, that's no help.

121
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:54,802
She's a little shorter than I
am. Blond hair. Barbara Davis.

122
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,554
Okay, um...

123
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,072
She is in a procedure room.
She is getting a few stitches

124
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,341
on her forearm.
Looks fine otherwise.

125
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,560
Thank goodness. Thank you.

126
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:11,047
And those two over there,
they're my children. Are they okay?

127
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,515
Morgan and Julian Fisher.

128
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,534
Morgan, they are making sure
that her heart and lungs are okay.

129
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,537
Julian has a broken arm
and a cut on his forehead,

130
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,906
but I made sure he's okay, so...

131
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,292
And Carl ruptured his
spleen. Gene broke some ribs.

132
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,211
Michelle mostly has
broken glass in her hair.

133
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,865
Lynne has whiplash. Only
Pete came through unscathed.

134
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,988
- Pete is...
- Pete is my husband.

135
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,292
He's dead. This
was Pete's funeral.

136
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,907
- Oh, God, ma'am.
- Georgia.

137
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,215
Georgia, I'm so
sorry. You shouldn't...

138
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,279
Someone should be taking care
of you. We have a waiting area...

139
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,783
You know, right now, I really feel
like I need to be doing something.

140
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,485
But if you could find
out where they took him?

141
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,125
You got it. Yeah.

142
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,542
Edwards!

143
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,964
- Sir, I know...
- The patient in this bed
is deceased.

144
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,884
- I know.
- Not just deceased, embalmed.

145
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:08,270
The deceased, Peter,
it was his funeral.

146
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,139
The hearse and
the coffin got totaled,

147
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,757
the EMTs couldn't
leave him in the streets.

148
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,326
- Call the morgue.
- I did,

149
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,344
but they're taking
their sweet time.

150
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,963
There's not a lot of
urgency in that job, I think.

151
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:20,366
Then call them again. And
find someplace else for Mr...

152
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,052
- Peter.
- This is a room
for healing the sick.

153
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,622
- Yes, sir.
- Corpse in the emergency
department.

154
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,947
It's just creepy is what it is.

155
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,846
Kara, I need you to try and
slow your breathing, okay?

156
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,115
Oh, God, is he alive? I
can't even feel his little kicks.

157
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,734
He may be less active from the
pain meds we gave you, okay?

158
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,688
- Please, just tell me, is
he... Oh, Kara, you hear that?

159
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,574
That's a strong, stable
heartbeat. He's okay.

160
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,059
- Films are back.
- Yeah. good.

161
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,567
Hey, do we know where
the deceased guy was put?

162
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,920
What? Who else is hurt?

163
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,639
Is everyone hurt?
Did I kill anyone?

164
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,092
You were the driver?

165
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,224
I was late for the funeral.

166
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,592
I came around the corner,
and there they were,

167
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:08,031
the whole procession. I ran
right into them. It was me.

168
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,699
Kara, it was an accident.
I'm sure they'll understand.

169
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,254
Not my family. They've
never understood me.

170
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:17,878
I haven't even seen any of
them for almost ten years.

171
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,833
Dad maybe, but mom...

172
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,019
Julian, and Morgan.

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,252
God, I never should
have come back.

174
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,538
I just wanted to tell
my dad that I love him.

175
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,307
It's okay, it's
okay. It's all right.

176
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,275
Kara, your pelvis is fractured,
and there may be bleeding.

177
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,694
- We need to do a CT scan...
- What?

178
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,278
To check for bleeding
and other injuries, all right?

179
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,780
- CT? Is that safe for him?
- It's minimal risk for the baby,

180
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,822
but we need to know how
badly you're bleeding, okay?

181
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,443
Yeah, just... Just page
me when she's in CT.

182
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,219
The clinic is supplied for crap.

183
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,743
You didn't pick up my
calls or answer my texts.

184
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,858
- Arizona...
- I was worried about you.

185
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,261
- No, you were mad at me.
- Damn right I was mad. I'm still mad.

186
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,947
- You beat up my roommate.
- So, that's why you're mad?

187
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,750
Some guy you barely know
who pays you rent got beat up?

188
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:21,570
- What the hell
is wrong with you?
- Look, let's not do this.

189
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,773
I've had enough lectures. I'm
not in the mood for another one.

190
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,443
Your job is to take
care of children.

191
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:32,754
- Look, Arizona...
- Your job... is to take care
of children.

192
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,868
You want to throw your
life away? Or your career?

193
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,020
The career that I helped
you build? I trained you.

194
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,722
I had your back, and I
always pushed for you,

195
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,840
- no matter what anybody said.
- I know!

196
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,826
- Alex!
- I know all of this.

197
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,728
You can't tell me
anything I haven't heard

198
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,832
from Bailey or Mer or Jo... or
frankly, the State of Washington.

199
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,267
And hearing it one more
time isn't gonna help anything

200
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,637
or change anything or
fix me or turn back time,

201
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,762
so just shut up and
back off, please.

202
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:01,299
Excuse me.

203
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,284
What do you got?

204
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,626
Possible mesenteric tear.

205
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,062
Hmm. Hemothorax here.

206
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,177
- Is Pierce okay?
- She's in the pit, I think.

207
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,979
No, I mean with me.

208
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,631
Oh, don't flatter
yourself. She'll live.

209
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,915
All right, all right.

210
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,784
For what it's worth,
I feel bad about it.

211
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,503
She's my sister. You
think I like telling her

212
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,803
she can't have the good thing?

213
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,872
Then let's just come
clean, tell her why.

214
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,774
We'll feel better.
It'll feel really good.

215
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,449
Why don't you just focus on
your patient's Hemothorax?

216
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,634
All right.

217
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,040
"The good thing."

218
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,955
- Excuse me.
- You called me a good thing.

219
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,974
- Forget I said it.
- You ain't the boss of me.

220
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,476
Actually, I own a big
chunk of this hospital,

221
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,833
so technically, I am.

222
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,821
- Well, then, after you.
- Damn right.

223
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:19,805
<i>Dr. Kadano to dialysis.
Dr. Kadano to dialysis.</i>

224
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,880
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

225
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,030
So, I've been prescribed
movement, since my incision's healed.

226
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,334
I'm supposed to get up,
get out. I can walk now.

227
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,019
I should walk, actually, you
know, to get better. So, walking.

228
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,038
You can walk around
the block, you know?

229
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,057
In the neighborhood. It's
nice, you should check it out.

230
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,726
Yeah, I know, it's totally...
It's super nice. So is the house.

231
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,829
But I figured... I, I figured
you'd want to see the baby.

232
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,648
You know what? That's
really sweet of you.

233
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,866
I did just see her,
like, an hour ago.

234
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,818
I know, but look at this one.

235
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,438
You can't get enough
of this little nugget.

236
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,923
No, I guess you can't.

237
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,259
Okay, we are gonna go
down to the ER for a minute,

238
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,711
check out what's going on
there. I hear there's a big MVC.

239
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,129
- Really?
- So...

240
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,731
- What?
- You're gonna take her down
to ER

241
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,734
a newborn with all the blood,
germs, and dying people?

242
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,269
Right. Not a good idea.

243
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,093
No. I'll walk you out.

244
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,142
- Who wants to see Daddy?
- No, that...

245
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,077
- Hey, sweetheart. Yeah.
- Oh, there you go.

246
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,079
- Daddy's so good. Okay.
- Okay.

247
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,223
Bring her back
when she's hungry.

248
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:21,757
Hey...

249
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,586
I picked up Tuck,
and you know what?

250
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,090
- Tuck's teacher said
he got in a fight.
- Oh!

251
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,392
They said that he
pushed another child

252
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,433
- and that he started it.
- Who said that?

253
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,767
They also said they told you
all of this already over the phone.

254
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,391
- How's that, now?
- Miranda.

255
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,325
I must have... misheard.

256
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,906
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

257
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,570
Aren't you gonna go in there and
bring down the hammer on him?

258
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,533
I'm gonna let him sweat it out.
But he knows what's coming.

259
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,014
The hammer will fall.

260
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,369
Your husband has been
moved to a private room,

261
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,272
and the funeral home
has been notified.

262
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,256
Okay. Okay, thank you.

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,592
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

264
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,962
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter was injured.

265
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,413
She is okay, and
the baby is okay.

266
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:11,133
- Thirty-five weeks, almost time.
- What?

267
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,820
But I'm afraid your daughter was
the one who caused the accident.

268
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,188
No, I think you're confused.

269
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,007
Morgan was in the car
with me when we got hit.

270
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,333
I'm so sorry. Your
other daughter, Kara.

271
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,030
Kara?

272
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,982
Like I said, she and
the baby are both stable.

273
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,119
Kara's here? Kara's
having a baby?

274
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,436
- Kara?
- What?

275
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,330
She is. She
fractured her pelvis.

276
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:41,597
- Kara's here?
- Wait. Kara was driving the car?

277
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,134
- She's pregnant?
- You have got to be kidding me!

278
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,003
- She had the nerve to show up!
- Kara did this to us?

279
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,339
- She said it was an accident.
- Of course, she did.

280
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,740
- Classic.
- Julian.

281
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,342
Drugs again, right? Has to be.

282
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,394
I hope not. They
said she's knocked up.

283
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,129
Good Lord, what's next?

284
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:00,182
What Pete and Georgia did
to be saddled with that mess!

285
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,574
You said my husband was
here. Can I see him, please?

286
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,887
I'm sorry. This was the best
place we could find for him.

287
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,770
The morgue guys were
supposed to come and get him,

288
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,389
they said he was
dead when he got here,

289
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,691
so he's not their problem.
He's the funeral home's problem.

290
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,710
And it's just become
this big thing...

291
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:28,833
Edwards.

292
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:32,202
Take all the time you need.

293
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,422
Always thought I'd go first.

294
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:56,005
Actually, no.

295
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,662
If I pictured it, I thought
we'd go together.

296
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,549
Holding each other's hands.

297
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,560
Honey... Kara's back.

298
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,395
It's a miracle.

299
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,366
Kara came home.

300
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,218
Our baby came home.

301
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,168
<i>Dr. Phelps, 2277.
Dr. Phelps, 2277.</i>

302
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,803
- A felony?
- I know.

303
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,705
I mean, he did beat
him up really bad.

304
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,140
- Yeah, he did.
- You could punch

305
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,826
a cardio surgeon in a hospital
hallway, and nobody says a word.

306
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,227
Wait, apples and oranges.

307
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:37,262
And yet, Alex is charged
with a felony assault.

308
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,116
Apples and oranges.
Riggs and I, it was personal.

309
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,584
No, just apples.

310
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,420
It was about Wilson. It was about
a girl. How is that not personal?

311
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,129
- Shepherd just paged. The mom's okay.
- Oh, good.

312
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,994
Kara, we just got word that
your mom is fine. She wasn't hurt.

313
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,414
<i>Okay, thanks. Does
she know I'm here?</i>

314
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,834
- Yeah,
I think that they told her.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

315
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:04,289
<i>Then she knows. She
knows that it was me.</i>

316
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,058
Maybe that wasn't a great idea.

317
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,676
But, I mean, I thought
she should know.

318
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,967
They haven't seen each
other in, like, ten years.

319
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,917
Kara, I am, I'm so sorry,

320
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,725
but the machine cannot get a clear
read, unless you're very, very still.

321
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,812
<i>Okay. Okay, sorry.</i>

322
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,543
It's okay. It's okay.
Take your time.

323
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,269
It's so sad.

324
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,220
I mean, can you imagine
saying goodbye to somebody

325
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,729
you've woken up next
to every day for 40 years?

326
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,446
So, Riggs, huh?

327
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:46,365
It's nothing. I mean...
It's nothing now.

328
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,451
It's stilted conversations
and avoiding eye contact.

329
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,427
- And he said no?
- Oh, yeah.

330
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,797
- To you?
- Right? Thank you.

331
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,466
- Yeah.
- We don't have to talk about it.

332
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:04,022
I've been trying to talk
about it, but Mer won't listen.

333
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,274
She thinks I should just forget
the whole thing happened.

334
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,910
They're here for Mr. Fisher.

335
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,248
Mrs. Fisher?

336
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:19,520
Georgia, the men from
the funeral home are here.

337
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,773
Oh... okay.

338
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,713
Why is someone with him?

339
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,682
She has had a rough day.

340
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:37,337
Georgia, I'm sorry,
but it... it really is time.

341
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,661
No, no, no! Dr. Pierce! Georgia!

342
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,229
Out of the way! Move!

343
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,838
- She's in V-fib.
- Continuing CPR.

344
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,156
Edwards, ready?

345
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,593
Charge to 120.

346
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,514
- Set up an intubation tray.
- Clear.

347
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,819
Charge to 150. Clear.

348
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,750
It's your husband's day,
Georgia. Don't steal the show.

349
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,107
Push one of epi.

350
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,409
What... Whatcha doin'?

351
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:38,665
I, uh, I asked you a question.

352
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,168
Sorry. I'm leveling up.

353
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,367
- Well, what did your mom say?
- About what?

354
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,858
- What do you mean "About what"?
- I haven't seen her.

355
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,860
- What are we waiting for?
- Sorry?

356
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,480
Tuck is just hanging in your
office, playing on his phone.

357
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,984
No hammer has fallen.
What are we waiting for?

358
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,292
- "We."
- What?

359
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,329
We are not waiting for anything.
He is my child. I will handle it.

360
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,631
Well, right now, you're
not doing anything.

361
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,416
You think I don't know that?

362
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,114
Look, I have to bring down
the hammer at work every day

363
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:20,251
it seems like lately, so excuse me if
I'm not jumping to do it at home, too.

364
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:24,005
Now, I have to explain to my
son why not to pick on other kids?

365
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,765
It's exhausting! I'm exhausted.
And right now, you're exhausting.

366
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,218
Edwards, ready?

367
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,277
- What's going on in there?
- They're running a code.

368
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,007
Clear!

369
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,542
- I just froze off a wart.
- Continuing CPR.

370
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,284
- I just wiped a butt.
- I did that, too.

371
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,683
Well, my body is making
food for another human.

372
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:52,918
That's something, I guess.

373
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,537
- Charge to 270.
- Well, you got me beat there.

374
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,561
Clear.

375
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,475
Charge again.

376
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,066
Clear.

377
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,670
The force of your fracture
tore some vessels in your pelvis,

378
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:14,723
but your scan showed that
there's no active bleeding.

379
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,292
And since the baby's
stable and you're stable,

380
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,651
- we'd like to avoid surgery.
- I'll be monitoring you
very closely.

381
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,604
You know, I thought coming
home was the right thing to do.

382
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:30,327
You leave and so much time
goes by, you just get used to it.

383
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,377
And then one day, you get a
phone call that your dad died,

384
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,863
and you just see how
much you've missed.

385
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,431
And I didn't... I didn't want that
to happen with anybody else.

386
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,518
I didn't want that for my baby.

387
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,904
Kara, we can get someone from
your family, your mom, maybe?

388
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:50,214
What, no! No. I can't
face her. Not right now.

389
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,636
Thank you, though.

390
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,027
Kara, she'll forgive you.

391
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,481
Your mom will always forgive
you no matter how bad it gets.

392
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,501
You should try.

393
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,421
- Hey.
- Hey.

394
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,624
I need to find Georgia Fisher,
the mom of all those funeral people.

395
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,482
Look, do... Do I need to move?

396
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:28,480
- Do you what?
- I just... I understand.

397
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:31,316
All right? Karev is your friend.
He's your... He's your guy.

398
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,607
Things are gonna be
awkward enough at work.

399
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,704
Can we just say three weeks?

400
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,323
It's just that my medical bills have
been eating up a lot of my savings.

401
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,559
- I just need some time...
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

402
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,345
I don't... That's not...
No, I don't want that.

403
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,602
- You don't?
- No. Why?

404
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:50,090
Everyone's just so pissed at me.
They don't say it, but I can feel it.

405
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,210
You just seem pissed, too.

406
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:02,502
- I got to find this lady.
- All right.

407
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:16,428
- Hey, is this Georgia?
- Yeah, yeah,
sudden cardiac arrest.

408
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:19,531
- No.
- We're getting her back. We have to.

409
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,850
- Well, how long has it been?
- Forty-two minutes.

410
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,042
- What are you doing?
- We have to call it.

411
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,261
No, she's not... They
can't have another funeral.

412
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,730
Amelia, she's gone.

413
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,261
- Damn it.
- Time of death, 14:02.

414
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,684
- You need something?
- No.

415
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,694
What the hell? Georgia was fine.

416
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,563
Your mother went
into cardiac arrest.

417
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,031
We tried to revive
her for almost an hour.

418
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,418
But despite our
best efforts, she died.

419
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,588
Why? Was it the crash?

420
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:19,991
We won't know exactly what
happened until we do an autopsy.

421
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,944
Of course it was the crash.

422
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,567
Has anyone told Kara?

423
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,532
I can't even look
at her right now.

424
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:30,173
Where is she? Where's my sister?

425
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,579
- Kara, I have some bad news.
- What? What is it?

426
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,413
- Why did you come back?
- No.

427
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,199
- Julian?
- Mom's dead.

428
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,550
- No...
- Dead?

429
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,269
No, no, they said she was fine.

430
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,536
- No.
- You told me she was...

431
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,822
- She, she had a heart attack...
- From all the stress you caused.

432
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,874
Sir, I understand you're
upset, but I need your sister

433
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,726
to keep calm right now, okay?

434
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,429
- Mom's dead? Oh, my...
- What the hell, Kara?

435
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,531
- Wilson.
- Why did you even come here?

436
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,534
- Okay! All right! Leave.
- You need to go.

437
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,388
- I am so sorry.
- She can't be. She can't...

438
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,980
Oh, God. I killed her.

439
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,143
Baby's heartbeat is down.

440
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,929
He's been having
decels, never this long.

441
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,146
What's wrong? What's going on?

442
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,232
I'm sorry, Kara, but we're gonna
take your baby out right now.

443
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,217
- Book an OR, let's page Hunt.
- No. No, no, no.

444
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,340
Let's move.

445
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,913
<i>Dr. Alberts to the ICU.
Dr. Alberts to the ICU.</i>

446
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,550
- It's possible to hate you,
you know?
- What?

447
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,537
You're easy to hate. I
hated you when we met.

448
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,322
- And now?
- Well, now you're just...

449
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,422
A bloated corpse.

450
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:44,676
That's it. Maybe you
should go out with Maggie.

451
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,684
- Excuse me?
- Go back.

452
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,887
Tell her you changed your
mind and just be terrible.

453
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,019
You know, be rude to
waiters, no eye contact,

454
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,276
bad breath, close
her foot in the door.

455
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,195
Just turn off all that.

456
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,082
I'm not... I'm not sure
what all that means.

457
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,963
Just go out with her
and be someone else.

458
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:07,215
- Don't be you.
- Be a jerk?

459
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,434
- Yes.
- With bad breath?

460
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,052
Exactly.

461
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:15,345
- Because being myself
would be too...
- Ugh, forget it.

462
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,031
- Hold one moment. Of course.
- Thank you.

463
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,335
Oh.

464
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,556
You're not a single parent.

465
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,839
Oh, you think Tucker
Jones is gonna punish him.

466
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,490
'Cause he's Mr. Fun Dad.

467
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:36,127
Mr. Ice Cream and camping
trips and video games.

468
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:38,363
I'm the one who has to
dole out all the punishment.

469
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,833
No, look, I mean that
Tuck has three parents.

470
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,469
I love him. And I'm
pissed at him, too.

471
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,537
I know you feel like
you have to do it all.

472
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:47,973
No, I'm going to do it.

473
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:51,459
But you don't have to.
I'm right here. Let me!

474
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,820
Look, put me in, Chief. You
need a bad cop. Deputize me.

475
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:03,038
What does Mer say exactly
when you talk about Riggs?

476
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,272
She just...

477
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,391
So, the morgue
is on its way, uh,

478
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,076
They said, since she
died in the hospital,

479
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,233
they are happy to come.

480
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,829
Tell them to wait, and keep your
voice down. Show some respect.

481
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,853
Respect?

482
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,695
Uh, we're having a funeral?

483
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,847
That's allowed?

484
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,634
- It's fine.
- Okay. I'll let the morgue know.

485
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,372
You were saying?

486
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,170
- No.
- What?

487
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,155
It's like she doesn't
want to hear it.

488
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,746
At all. Like I'm annoying her.

489
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,396
Which, maybe I am,
but be a sister, sister.

490
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,220
I mean, if it was
her and she was...

491
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,624
craving something
that she couldn't have,

492
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,554
I would commiserate.
I would at least listen.

493
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,113
I'll listen to you. Any time.

494
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,366
I don't think that
now is the best time.

495
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,217
I'm not listening.

496
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,407
Then how would you know to
say that if you weren't listening?

497
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,030
If Dr. Webber finds out,
I'm gonna be in trouble.

498
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,321
I told you it's fine.
Nobody needs the room.

499
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,569
This family was
primed for a funeral.

500
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:25,873
Not hers.

501
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,912
I wish I was as good as
Mer at forgetting things.

502
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,581
My life would be
a lot easier if I was.

503
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,213
Okay, she does
not forget things.

504
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,849
She buries them. She
thinks they're gone,

505
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,401
but trust me, they are not gone.

506
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,652
They're gonna come back.
They always come back.

507
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:43,054
See, this is the problem
with me moving out.

508
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,729
With three, there was
balance. Now, it's chaos.

509
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,154
She squeezed my hand.
She squeezed my hand!

510
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,301
- She what?
- No, she squeezed it!

511
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:58,987
I was holding her hand,
and she squeezed it!

512
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,906
- I'm telling you!
- Morgan, I am sure that you...

513
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,924
- did feel something.
- No, I don't think
she's dead.

514
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,626
The body can experience
residual reflexes.

515
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,761
Yes, muscles can spasm,
and then they stiffen.

516
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,629
There are a lot of reasons
for slight movements.

517
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,032
This wasn't slight!

518
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:13,351
Okay, I promise you it does
not mean that she is actually...

519
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,294
No, that woman is alive!

520
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,314
I love my job.

521
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,349
- She was dead?
- Yes.

522
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,036
- And now she's no longer dead.
- Also, yes.

523
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,373
We saw her flatline,
and she's not dead.

524
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,774
Lazarus Syndrome.

525
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,493
Spontaneous
return of circulation

526
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,361
after failed attempts
at resuscitation.

527
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,985
Or a miracle.

528
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,833
You can't rule it out.

529
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,751
Well, when we tell a
family a patient is dead,

530
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,092
I prefer we be correct!

531
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,660
It's a low, low bar
for a physician.

532
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,341
How is she, besides undead?

533
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,678
We won't know about neuro
deficits until after the cardiac workup.

534
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,080
I did detect a slight murmur.

535
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:01,165
I'm going to run a TEE to make
sure there aren't any abnormalities.

536
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,873
- Edwards,
will you check on that?
- Hell, yeah.

537
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,344
Yeah. Yeah, yes.
Yes, Dr. Pierce.

538
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:13,200
We got her back. Don't blow it. Do
not lose this woman a second time.

539
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,068
- Understood.
- Got it.

540
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:17,604
Jesus wept.

541
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,834
Let's continue with
chest compressions.

542
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,138
What's going on in there?

543
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:24,639
A guy came in, fell three stories
off his building into the alley.

544
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,207
Oh, dumpster dive.

545
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,826
Guys, don't mess around
with intubation. Just crike him.

546
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,370
What are you waiting for?
There's too much swelling.

547
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:34,170
- Just cut him already.
- Come on, you guys!

548
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,885
- There it is.
- Okay, they got it.

549
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,287
God, I miss this. I
miss the pace of it.

550
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,990
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to get back here.

551
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,576
I cannot wait. Can't you?

552
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,983
Well, you know
you're coming back.

553
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,069
- I'm sorry.
- I should get going.

554
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,275
- Go ahead with it.
- Guys, just push more epi.

555
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,013
Sorry. You're doing great.
Good... Good work, everyone.

556
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,777
See, now, this is
where his eye should be,

557
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,246
but instead it's trapped
in the broken bone.

558
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,897
- Jeez.
- Yeah,

559
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,667
- that's what can happen
when you punch people, Tuck.
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,253
- Who is that?
- Doesn't matter.

561
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,356
I'll tell you who it used
to be. He was a surgeon.

562
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,657
- That's right.
- But now he may never be one.

563
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,833
- 'Cause he's blind in one eye.
- What?

564
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,549
And the guy who
hit him? He's in jail.

565
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,118
Probably for a long time.

566
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,137
- Want to go to jail, young man?
- No, sir.

567
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,929
Well, that's where fighting
gets you. Prison or... Dr. Avery.

568
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,965
Yeah, yeah, and
that's his collarbone.

569
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,754
God!

570
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:49,858
Lazarus Syndrome has only
been reported 38 times since 1982.

571
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,098
Advance the probe, please.

572
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,645
She could have had
impaired venous return

573
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,647
due to dynamic
hyperinflation of the lungs,

574
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:59,216
which caused delayed action of
the drugs we gave her during CPR.

575
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,554
Or a transient myocardial
stunning or electrolyte imbalance.

576
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,528
No one knows for
sure why this happens.

577
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,842
Or she missed her
daughter. Wasn't ready.

578
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,366
I'm just glad we were there.

579
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,929
Oh God, because what if
she'd woken up in the morgue?

580
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,513
She could still be there
for all we know, just...

581
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,657
crying out for
somebody, no one's there.

582
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:20,221
Banging on the wall
of her metal drawer.

583
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,190
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

584
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,525
I have to concentrate on this.

585
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,789
Oh, yeah, sorry.

586
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:31,683
'Cause if we lost her a
second time, that poor family.

587
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:34,018
- Could you ever count
on anything again?
- No.

588
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,621
I mean, it'd be like we were
throwing away a second chance.

589
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,106
And not just
Georgia's, but ours,

590
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,623
'cause we'll never
see this again.

591
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,397
- Statistically speaking...
- Edwards.

592
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,048
All this woman wanted to do was
die, holding her husband's hand,

593
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,934
and she did that. She
got to die holding his hand.

594
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,425
And then she came back to life.

595
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,228
Sorry if I'm too amazed.

596
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:03,247
Wait. Georgia's not
dead? Curved mayos.

597
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:04,766
Not according to Shepherd.

598
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,830
Incredible.

599
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,692
So this little guy's gonna get
to meet his grandma after all.

600
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,574
Take him to the
NICU and page Karev.

601
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,381
Uh, Karev's in the clinic.

602
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,397
Oh, right. Just take
him to the NICU.

603
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:21,416
- Yeah.
- You don't know that.

604
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,618
- Know what?
- If Kara's mom'd ever
forgive her.

605
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,720
- You've no idea.
- Of course, she will. It's her mom.

606
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,422
Well, not every
family is like that.

607
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,373
It's really dangerous to
get someone's hopes up.

608
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:31,409
That's not the kind of
thing that you can promise.

609
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,399
Jeez, Wilson,
have a little faith.

610
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,099
- BP's dropping. We're losing her.
- There's major hemorrhaging.

611
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,690
- Let's get some laps. Start packing.
- Yes, doctor.

612
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,367
You hear about the
miracle lady in the ER?

613
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:57,907
M.I. coded her for 40 minutes,
dead for 20 more, then she sat up.

614
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,722
- Shut up.
- Yeah. Awake and alive.

615
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,391
She's got to be gorked.

616
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,493
You can't be down for
that long without deficits.

617
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,995
Well, we'll see. Pierce is doing
a cardiac assessment now.

618
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,969
- Could be a miracle.
- She's gorked.

619
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,639
You ever have that dream?

620
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,110
- What dream?
- The miracle dream.

621
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:24,033
I'd roll over in bed, and there she
was, asking me to go make coffee.

622
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:27,137
So real.

623
00:33:28,724 --> 00:33:29,724
Then I'd wake up.

624
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,892
No, never had that dream.

625
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,627
- A knock at the door.
- Sorry?

626
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,458
He knocks at the door,
says he forgot his keys,

627
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,466
and he's sorry for
being gone so long.

628
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,623
She's gorked.

629
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,836
Pupils reactive, reflexes intact.
I'm seeing no neurological deficits.

630
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,924
We're gonna keep an eye on her
heart, but for now, she looks good.

631
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,411
- Do you hear that, mom? You're okay.
- How are you feeling?

632
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,763
Tired.

633
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,400
How about Kara? Is she okay?

634
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,685
I'm sure she's fine.

635
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,405
Yeah, she always walks
away from the wreck.

636
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,836
Oh, please. She is your sister.

637
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,205
And maybe you have had
your problems in the past,

638
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,495
maybe she is a train wreck.

639
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,243
Maybe, she is a walking demolition
crew, but she came back to you.

640
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:49,330
- She came back to her family.
- Yeah, and she killed
our mother!

641
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,383
And your mother came back,
too! Do you know how rare that is?

642
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:55,759
Since 1982, that
has been recorded...

643
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,589
- Edwards?
- Thirty-eight times.

644
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:02,126
Which might as well be
never. And now mom is fine,

645
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,546
and you're both fine, and
you should all be celebrating.

646
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,432
And instead, you're
just whining and fighting

647
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:12,504
when your sister came back!
And your mom came back!

648
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,438
Do you really want
to throw that away?

649
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,780
Is that what your father
would have wanted?

650
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,625
You two deserved that.

651
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,651
I would have thought you would
have... both been gone by now.

652
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,071
You know how it is with a
baby. Everybody wants a turn.

653
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,693
Uh, pretty bad Le Fort
fracture in OR Three.

654
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,110
I saw that.

655
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,096
Should have seen the
intake. It was gnarly.

656
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,280
How gnarly?

657
00:35:57,873 --> 00:36:00,635
- About eight, nine.
- Nice.

658
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,386
You are bored out
of your freaking mind.

659
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,004
Oh, my God, I'm so bored.

660
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,343
And I can't move as much as I
want to, so we just sit and stare

661
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,812
and stare and stare.
And I love Harriet.

662
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,865
I do, obviously. I
mean, she's a miracle.

663
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,251
She'll make a little face
or a little sound at me,

664
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,053
and I'm just like dumbstruck
with gratitude and joy.

665
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:22,674
Just, like, delighted
and amazed.

666
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:23,763
Yeah.

667
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,645
But then the delight and
amazement fades a little

668
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,569
when she goes back to sleep.

669
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:31,604
And I stare.

670
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,753
I did not know a miracle
could be so boring.

671
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,405
Why don't you go check
out the Le Fort for yourself?

672
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,397
Really?

673
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:45,651
Has everyone had their turn?
'Cause Daddy would like one.

674
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:50,323
- Thank you. Hey, sweetheart.
- So sweet.

675
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,311
Kara, he's right here.

676
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,976
- Hi. He's okay?
- Yeah.

677
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,434
- I didn't screw him up?
- He's great.

678
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:05,450
You're here. Hi, you.

679
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,140
You both did great.

680
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,294
I hear we have a nephew.

681
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:14,998
They... they said it was
okay if... if we're family.

682
00:37:15,784 --> 00:37:18,495
We just wanted to
see if you were all right.

683
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,815
- If you needed anything or...
- I'm so sorry.

684
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,968
- Hey. Hey.
- It was an accident.

685
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:29,090
- Everyone's okay. It's okay.
- No, not mom. Mom's not okay.

686
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,675
- Mom's fine.
- What?

687
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,617
Yeah, mom's good.

688
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:37,670
I mean, you killed her,
but she's really good now.

689
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:45,912
- See? They forgave her.
- Yeah. You got really lucky.

690
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,203
And how long do
I hold onto this?

691
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,836
One...

692
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,008
Two weeks.

693
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:20,479
- What else?
- And I'm gonna talk to Marcus.

694
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,412
To the kid. I'm gonna apologize.

695
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,515
- And?
- And I'll never do this again.

696
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,205
I don't want to go to jail.

697
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,338
- I'm sorry, mom.
- How's that?

698
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,513
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

699
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,616
You can wait in the car.

700
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,574
- What is wrong with us?
- Wrong?

701
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,493
That we waited so
long to deputize you.

702
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,015
She's awake.

703
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:01,337
The dead lady. No
deficits, fully ungorked.

704
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,724
- That's great.
- A miracle.

705
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:09,245
Just sayin'. Anything
can happen, Dr. Grey.

706
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,004
- She needs her good sister.
- Amelia, what are you doing?

707
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:21,435
Not having dirty married sex
because I'm worried about you two.

708
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,204
So here is how it's gonna go.

709
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,190
Maggie, you are gonna talk to
Mer about whatever you want,

710
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:27,897
whenever you want, period.

711
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,028
And, Mer, you are gonna
listen, whether you want to or not!

712
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,819
Because that is what
a sister does! Period!

713
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,008
I'm gonna walk away now.
Don't make me move back in.

714
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,985
I'm listening. What do
you want to talk about?

715
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:52,972
Riggs? Work?

716
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:00,057
You know, all I've been doing
today is listening to siblings

717
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,392
talk and complain
and talk and complain,

718
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:06,368
and all I really want to do
is to get something to eat.

719
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,404
I'm good with that.

720
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,536
What about you? I can't
be the only one talking.

721
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,810
Sisterhood is a two-way street.

722
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:18,831
Is there anything you
want to get off your chest?

723
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,080
- Any guy you're into?
- No!

724
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,049
<i>Miracles aren't always huge.</i>

725
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:28,352
<i>The fever breaks. The
stitch holds. The bone heals.</i>

726
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,787
<i>That's why they
can be hard to spot.</i>

727
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:32,990
<i>And why they can be
such a pain in the ass.</i>

728
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,694
You're not supposed to be here.

729
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,579
I heard you did an
emergency C-section.

730
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,870
Yeah. I almost lost
the mom and the baby.

731
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,056
- You're pissed.
- Yeah!

732
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,253
Yeah, I'm pissed.

733
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,489
That baby deserved the
best peds surgeon we have,

734
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,892
and we didn't have him
because you screwed up.

735
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,081
Yeah.

736
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:57,131
Today I froze a wart,
diagnosed three sinus infections,

737
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,822
gave someone a laxative
and waited until they pooped.

738
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:02,708
I wanted to quit every
five minutes today.

739
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,039
I wanted to walk out the
damn door and never look back.

740
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,960
- Yeah, so now
you're gonna complain?
- That's the point. I'm not.

741
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,869
I'm gonna do my time, work
in the clinic, and help people.

742
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:15,532
I want to come back, and
I'm gonna do whatever it takes,

743
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,589
and I'm not quitting.

744
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,155
And that's the guy
you trained and raised

745
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,898
and whatever, so... Okay?

746
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:28,868
I missed you today.

747
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,685
But I'm still really,
really mad at you.

748
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,926
I know. Me too.

749
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:42,159
<i>Don't get me wrong.
Tiny miracles are great.</i>

750
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:44,067
<i>A little miracle is a miracle.</i>

751
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,820
<i>It just may not be
enough to save us.</i>
