1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,613
<i>Previously, on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,632
<i>The person that beat up
DeLuca is someone I thought</i>

3
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:08,451
you left behind years
ago. You're a good doctor!

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,771
You're exactly what we
need right now in the clinic.

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,235
- The Denny Duquette Clinic?
- Unless you want me to fire you.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,559
I took a pregnancy
test last night.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,845
And, as I sat there
waiting for the result,

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,030
<i>I just watched him get
more and more excited.</i>

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,894
<i>And when that
stick was negative...</i>

10
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,017
<i>Owen's heart broke.</i>

11
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,375
And... I was so relieved.

12
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:31,280
Now look me in the eye and
tell me that he won't hate me.

13
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:35,545
Have you met the new
resident? She is great.

14
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,247
- This is...
- Murphy!

15
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,215
Dr. Robbins.

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,800
- You guys know each other?
- Um...

17
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:40,824
Yes.

18
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:44,971
Why would a Leah Murphy fail
here, only to thrive somewhere else?

19
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:49,142
There is a fundamental flaw in
how we are teaching our residents.

20
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,799
And we have got to fix this.

21
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,212
- You and me.
- And Dr. Webber.

22
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,099
The residency program is
your husband's department.

23
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,256
I know it is.

24
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,659
<i>"If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."</i>

25
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:08,178
- She's coming today?
- Mm-hmm. She is.

26
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,247
<i>The saying's as true
of the human body</i>

27
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,348
<i>as it is of a washing
machine or a blender.</i>

28
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,039
What did you tell the staff?

29
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,920
I sent them an
e-mail, let them know

30
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,728
that she'll be at the
hospital for a couple of days.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,615
That she would be
here to observe. Assess.

32
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,963
At this point, that's all
she'd be doing anyway.

33
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:31,201
Good. Smart. No need to give
anyone a scare. Not until we know more.

34
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,736
<i>A good surgeon knows that
if you go screwing around</i>

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,455
<i>with something that
doesn't need screwing...</i>

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,759
This is the right call?

37
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,031
This is the right call.

38
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:43,096
<i>You're the one who is
liable to end up screwed.</i>

39
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,733
I'm saying you wouldn't be
late if we didn't stop for gas.

40
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,169
We wouldn't have had to stop
if you ever put gas in the car.

41
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,603
The light wasn't
even blinking yet.

42
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,638
When the light is blinking,
it's already too late.

43
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:54,340
Who stops for gas
before the light blinks?

44
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,644
And I'm late.

45
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,243
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

46
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:00,914
I know. I have to
talk to him, and I will.

47
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,882
But I haven't yet, so you don't
have to look at me like that.

48
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,186
I was just looking at my phone.

49
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,569
- Everything's fine with me
and Owen.
- Oh, yeah, it sounds great.

50
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,853
It's absolutely fine.

51
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,523
We're gonna be married for a
long time, so the baby conversation

52
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,292
can sit on the back
burner for a while,

53
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,277
and it'll be fine
because it... It's fine.

54
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,313
You just said, "It's
fine," a lot of times.

55
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,553
Hey. Did you guys
see this e-mail?

56
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,453
What e-mail?

57
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,937
"An education
consultant is making a visit

58
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,361
"to observe and
assess our program"?

59
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,428
Who is Dr. Eliza Minnick?

60
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,928
Wouldn't know. I
didn't get the e-mail.

61
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,831
Education consultant,
double board-certified,

62
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,001
sports medicine specialist.

63
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,292
Published 52 papers in the
Journal of Surgical Education. 52?

64
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,895
This is because of me, isn't it?

65
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,626
They're gonna overhaul the
program because I beat up DeLuca.

66
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,078
Everything isn't about you.
That doesn't even make sense.

67
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,614
A teacher beat up a student.

68
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,914
Oh.

69
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,218
That makes sense.

70
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:56,586
The e-mail makes it sound like she's just
gonna wander around and wander away.

71
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,121
Well, yeah, Bailey's
not gonna BCC

72
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,757
a mass-firing announcement
to the entire staff. People panic.

73
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,341
- Why would you say that?
- You serious?

74
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:03,576
Minnick's kind of a legend.

75
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,612
I know a guy at Foster who
dated a girl at Innsmouth

76
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:08,097
when she was doing their
program's makeover. Heads rolled.

77
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,099
Warren, you seriously
know nothing about this?

78
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,469
Mm. I've told you, Miranda
and I keep it real separated.

79
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,871
I don't want to hear that.
Your marriage can be adorable

80
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,306
on a different day, okay?
You need to get answers.

81
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,709
This is probably happening
'cause of you, anyway.

82
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,049
What's that supposed to mean?

83
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,863
You really think a
resident does a C-section

84
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,367
in the middle of the hallway
and everyone forgets about it?

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,280
Dr. Webber.

86
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,161
Dr. Webber, is this because of
me? Because of my trouble last year?

87
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,163
Look, it's none of
my business, but...

88
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,799
I just hate to think that people
might get fired because of me.

89
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,300
Warren, no one's getting fired,

90
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,102
I don't know where you got
that, but don't worry, okay?

91
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,359
- This is not about you.
- Good, 'cause I just...

92
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,641
Well, the aortic stenosis
doesn't look too severe.

93
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,210
- A valvuloplasty might...
- Did you get anything
out of you mom?

94
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,380
I got called a "Nosey Rosie"
and then she changed the subject.

95
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,482
Oh, did you see Minnick's
TED Med talk, though?

96
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,218
- I think she's fascinating.
- We'll see how fascinating
she is

97
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,553
when she starts
handing out pink slips.

98
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,755
I'm safe, because there's only a
handful of people in this country

99
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,596
who can do what I do,
unlike cardio surgeons.

100
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,463
Well, you know what they
say. "Last one in, first one out."

101
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,565
Well, that's not how
it happened on D-Day.

102
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,069
Ain't nobody safe
on the battlefield.

103
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,600
That's not ominous at all.

104
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,015
I just don't know why you
wouldn't discuss it with me.

105
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,617
I'm sorry. Look, she had
an opening in her schedule,

106
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,402
and I jumped at it. It
happened very fast.

107
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,644
Yeah, too fast to tell
the Residency Director.

108
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,974
You got these people worried.
I don't know what to tell them

109
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,609
because you didn't
keep me in the loop.

110
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,667
Oh, no one should worry.
Dr. Minnick is here to...

111
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:50,755
look around,
observe. That's... all.

112
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,708
Just to see if there's
anything we could do better.

113
00:04:58,782 --> 00:04:59,782
All right.

114
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,585
When she arrives, I probably
should be the first to meet her.

115
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,067
She and I could chat,
I can show her around,

116
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,708
- introduce her to people.
- That's gonna be a problem.

117
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,569
She's already here.

118
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,243
Well, if she is in there
with my residents,

119
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,478
I'm not missing any more
of this meeting than I have to.

120
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,847
- You will be missing all of it!
- Look, Bailey...

121
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:24,284
No, she asked to speak
to the residents alone.

122
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,574
Whatever she needs, she
gets. You will leave them be.

123
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,127
Please.

124
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,273
So... I work with
attending surgeons.

125
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,372
I train attendings to train
you, and the best way

126
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:49,630
I know how to do that is to
hear from you about them.

127
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,770
I would love to get just a
clearer picture of the hours.

128
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,690
The instructors. Who
you love, who you hate.

129
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,372
I want to hear it.

130
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,227
- Shoot.
- Sorry, but you're here
for two days.

131
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:11,430
- We have to work with them.
- I get that. You have to ask

132
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,750
if that's the best path to
take to get to what you want,

133
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,720
which, I assume, is to
be able to stand in an OR

134
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,474
and confidently, seamlessly
perform a flawless solo surgery

135
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:24,510
not tomorrow, not next
year, not two years from now,

136
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,047
but today, right now,
without hesitation,

137
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,639
because that's what I'm
offering. A chance to do that.

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,370
And don't worry.
This room is a vault.

139
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,028
Nothing leaves these walls.

140
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:14,449
Look at them all lined up for
her, like little ducks quacking.

141
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,396
Yeah, you ever see
that movie<i> The Birds?</i>

142
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,631
Is that Minnick? What
are they telling her?

143
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,567
I don't know, but
she's taking notes.

144
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:23,869
April, you're on Tinder?

145
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,121
- What? No. No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

146
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,030
That's the Tinder bing.
The "I've got a match" bing.

147
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,023
I love that bing.

148
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,529
- Really?
- Yes, okay?

149
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,449
It was, an impulse decision,
and now it keeps making noise.

150
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:39,285
I would kill to know what
they're talking about in there.

151
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,686
Well, I think they're
talking about us.

152
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,760
- Why?
- 'Cause they're looking at us.

153
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,064
Scatter!

154
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:55,167
Well, Doc, how soon can
Enid be back on the lanes?

155
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,551
She's missed league
night three weeks running.

156
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:02,191
We're in a bowling league,
some of us ladies from the home.

157
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,060
- The Gutter Girlz... with a "Z."
- I see.

158
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,845
And regionals are next month,

159
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:09,115
and we've just got to
get her back in the lineup

160
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,779
if we're gonna take
down those Ball Bellz.

161
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,510
Dr. DeLuca, glad
you could join us.

162
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,048
- Meeting run long?
- Yeah. Sorry.

163
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,948
Well, Enid, it looks
like your gallbladder

164
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,968
is definitely inflamed. I'd
opt for surgery if I were you.

165
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:32,571
- Surgery? Really?
- Well, it's pretty non-invasive.

166
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,824
We'll have you back in your
bowling shoes in a couple weeks.

167
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,761
- If you think that's right.
- Are you kidding? That's perfect.

168
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,081
Well, those Ball Bell hags
won't know what hit them.

169
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,452
Given your age, Enid, though, we'd
need to do a cardiac assessment,

170
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,204
and after that,
you'll be ready to roll.

171
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,744
You know best, Doc.

172
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,442
- So, how was your meeting?
- Yeah, just, uh, interesting.

173
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,028
Okay. Interesting...?

174
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,576
Kind of...
confidential, I guess.

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,534
Yes, of course, but I've been
known to keep a secret or two.

176
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,698
Well...

177
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,873
Nobody would know it
came from you, is my point.

178
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,750
- Get outta here.
- Thank you, sir.

179
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,206
Hold still, Mr. Lawson.
That's great.

180
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,888
There's free fluid in Morison's
pouch and around the spleen.

181
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,590
I told him not to
try to do it himself.

182
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,358
You want to install insulation,

183
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,966
you pay someone who is
professionally not a moron.

184
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,334
Those guys are a racket.

185
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,530
- Owen, I need to get in here.
- Well, I'm in here right now.

186
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,716
And why do we need
insulation in the first place?

187
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,185
It saves 30 cents on the dollar.

188
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,204
He complained of severe
back pain, Dr. Hunt.

189
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,805
I need spine films now.

190
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,143
Now we're in the ER. Factor that
into your figures, Uncle Scrooge.

191
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,084
Spine films won't help if I
miss a liver lac, Dr. Shepherd.

192
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,648
Emmett, any idea
how far you fell?

193
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,249
You mean when he
crashed through the ceiling

194
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,218
or when he rolled down
the stairs afterwards?

195
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,020
Don't you dare hire
someone to fix that ceiling.

196
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,539
- I'll do it.
- You? Emmett, you are broken.

197
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,029
Yeah, he very well might be.

198
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,020
Mrs. Lawson, maybe
you should wait outside.

199
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,905
- Right this way.
- You brought this on yourself.

200
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,177
Endocutter.

201
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,652
- Hi.
- Hey, Dr. Grey.

202
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,750
Dr. Bailey said I could
observe some surgeries today.

203
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,419
My surgery? You won't
even know I'm here.

204
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,789
Okay, Warren, I'm
gonna use the stay suture

205
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,924
to approximate the two
ends of the small bowel

206
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,165
and then insert the
Endo GIA and fire it.

207
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,667
Hmm.

208
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,748
"Hmm"? Do you
have a better idea?

209
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:58,100
I just wonder if Dr. Warren
could do the anastomosis.

210
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,837
I assume you've used
the GIA before, Dr. Warren.

211
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:01,993
Many times.

212
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,607
Never on a portion of the bowel
this close to the cecal valve,

213
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,475
- which is why you'll
watch me do it. Ah.

214
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,928
See one, do one, teach
one. The old standard.

215
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:10,435
Oh, It's still pretty current.

216
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,900
Seventy-two hour shifts were
pretty current, too, until they weren't.

217
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,818
But the mandatory
80-hour work week

218
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,853
has ultimately saved
more lives than it's harmed.

219
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,805
- Wouldn't you say, Dr. Grey?
- Sure.

220
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,508
Most people
resisted it, too, at first.

221
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:26,245
I know it sounds crazy,
letting the resident dive in,

222
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,380
but wouldn't you rather
know that your surgical assist

223
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,515
can actually assist?

224
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,985
If a patient goes south, who's
more likely to save them?

225
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,388
A resident with less
hands-on experience, or more?

226
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,907
Closing the enterotomies.
Ligaclip, please.

227
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,076
Or you could hand the
instrument to Dr. Warren.

228
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,234
Give him a shot. Ever
used it before, Warren?

229
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,989
Next time you decide to
send a watchdog into my OR

230
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,275
with opinions about
how I do my surgeries,

231
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,727
- do me a favor. Don't.
- I beg your pardon?

232
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,280
Minnick barged into my
bowel resection, uninvited,

233
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,865
then she wouldn't stop talking.

234
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,934
Listen, Bailey brought
her in, I'm trying to talk...

235
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,969
- You got to get her out of here.
- Okay, my understanding?

236
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,437
She's not gonna
be here that long.

237
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,872
I don't really care.

238
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,840
You are the director of
the residency program,

239
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,697
so direct her. To the door.

240
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:34,246
- Okay, why are we in the clinic?
- The hospital has eyes.

241
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,115
Whatever it is,
just make it quick.

242
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,417
No residents this morning
screwed up my schedule.

243
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,719
Look, I found this.
It's Minnick's notebook.

244
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,555
It's not so much her notebook

245
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,641
as it is a notebook that
she wrote in and left behind.

246
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,927
- Stealer.
- You can't be in here.

247
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,494
I get in trouble
when you're in here.

248
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,363
- Shut the door.
- No, get out!

249
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,617
- All right, no problem.
- No. Just hold on. Look. It's a list.

250
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,424
The attendings' names,
ranked. The residents sold us out.

251
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,621
What? Where am I on it?

252
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,540
I don't know, but I'm
at the bottom of the list.

253
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:03,642
I have never been at the
bottom of any teacher's list.

254
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,712
- I am a top-of-the-list person.
- Turns out, so am I. Look at that.

255
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,064
- I'm not even on there.
- So what? Neither am I.

256
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,368
Well, of course you're not.

257
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,418
Because you're not...

258
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,220
You work in the clinic
now, and you're not...

259
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,588
- Nope. No more. Get out.
- Maggie, you paged?

260
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,891
Yeah, Minnick ranked
the attendings in order.

261
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,835
- There's a list.
- Guess where I am.

262
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,230
That's it? I have a patient
with a possible spinal fracture.

263
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,764
You paged me
"911" to look at a list?

264
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,068
At least you're on it.

265
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,486
Who the heck is Emilio Shepherd?

266
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,759
- Hey, Edwards, do you do Tinder?
- I have.

267
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,623
-Do you know how
to turn the sound off?

268
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,497
- You got a lot of matches.
- I know.

269
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,332
Hey, when you swipe them
away, they don't see that, right?

270
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,667
It's not like they get the
message, "No. Rejected."

271
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,787
They get the message
'cause they get no message.

272
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:50,122
- And you are silent.
- Thank you.

273
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,507
Except this guy
wants to go for a drink.

274
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,342
God. What do I say?

275
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,500
If it were me, I'd
say yes. He's cute.

276
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,404
- Hey.
- Whoa! Hello.

277
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,748
- What's up?
- Hi.

278
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,881
There's early impingement
of the spinal cord, Owen.

279
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,666
- I need to do a spinal fusion.
- You see this?

280
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,302
There is air under the diaphragm.
I need to take him for an ex-lap.

281
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,659
Why? He's
hemodynamically stable.

282
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,323
Because I stabilized him, and I
need to make sure he stays that way.

283
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,093
- Is that Dr. Shepherd?
- Yeah, that's her.

284
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,928
- He needs
his fracture stabilized.
- Oh, that's why I'm here.

285
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,164
Hey, guys. Eliza
Minnick, from the e-mail.

286
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,600
I was actually hoping to
observe that spinal fusion.

287
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,235
Tough luck, it's
gonna be an ex-lap.

288
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,337
- You don't have
to be rude.
- I'm not being rude!

289
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,339
I just want to make sure
that my patient stays alive.

290
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,408
You made it worse. I didn't
think it could get worse.

291
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:43,676
- I'll come back.
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,220
The ex-lap is not
the priority. It is.

293
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,598
We'll slowly increase the speed
and see how your heart does, okay?

294
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,400
How long do I do this?

295
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,552
Just a few minutes. Make
sure you hold on to the rail.

296
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,905
Lulu, you don't
have to do this at all!

297
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,558
You think I'm gonna let her get
in 10,000 steps today before me?

298
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,995
- Not a chance.
- It's just like at the mall.

299
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,533
You can't stop for a pretzel
till we hit all our steps.

300
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:11,142
But it's a little less fun
without the promise of a pretzel.

301
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:15,574
What do you mean, she's made a
list? She's only been here half a minute.

302
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,659
Riggs is ranked higher
than I am, and I'm his boss.

303
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,295
You need to get
that out of your head.

304
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,546
She hasn't even met you.

305
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,649
Where you might fall on
some crackpot's nonsense list

306
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,989
doesn't matter one iota.

307
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,925
Was I on that list?

308
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,105
Hey, Enid, are you okay?

309
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,724
Honey, you don't look right.

310
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,675
I don't know.

311
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,944
- Dr. Webber?
- Enid?

312
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,745
Enid, honey, you okay?

313
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,714
Murphy, gurney,
crash cart right now.

314
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,019
- Oxygen!
- All right, Enid, we've got you.

315
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,404
Hey, you ready
to get out of here?

316
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,593
I'm actually gonna stay here
tonight. He has a spinal surgery.

317
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,711
In the morning.

318
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,780
Yeah, I need to make
sure he doesn't develop

319
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,482
progressive neuro deficits
in the middle of the night

320
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:59,251
since you had to
do your surgery first.

321
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,536
Oh. So it's my fault.

322
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,739
Well, I'm saying if I had gone
first, I would be going home.

323
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,226
Yes, there'd be nothing left
to do because he'd be dead.

324
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,384
- Unlikely.
- Amelia, Edwards can keep
an eye on him.

325
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,493
If something happens, he would
be paralyzed before I got here.

326
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,270
All right, then.

327
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,926
Have a good night.

328
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,578
Enid, you're stable right now.

329
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,848
We've got you on a nitro drip,
beta-blockers, anticoagulants.

330
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,968
Yeah, we're concerned you
might've had a small heart attack.

331
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,992
Oh...

332
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,328
- What... What do we do, now?
- Well, you have a couple
of options.

333
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,842
We can put you on a
regimen of medication,

334
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,078
or we can operate. An
angiography with possible stenting.

335
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,715
The benefit of that being that
you'd be back on your feet sooner...

336
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,451
Oh, if that's in time for
regionals, well, that sounds great.

337
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,968
But her age being what it is,

338
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,921
- surgery comes with more risks.
- Her age?

339
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,112
But her age shouldn't factor
into it. She's a plow horse.

340
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,626
She's the Gutter
Girlz' secret weapon.

341
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,250
No, I'm not!

342
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,987
The team's average has
gone up since I've been out.

343
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,872
Paula told me.

344
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,320
You're better off without me.

345
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,062
Stop it right now.
I won't hear it.

346
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:15,015
Choose surgery. We
need you, you hear me?

347
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,843
Oh...

348
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,872
Okay.

349
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,642
- Yes.
- Oh, attagirl.

350
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,332
Dr. Webber, will you
excuse me for one moment?

351
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Dr. Minnick.

352
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:40,785
Hi. I just wanted to say hi and
welcome. I'm Maggie Pierce.

353
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,123
- Oh. You're Maggie Pierce.
- I am. That is me. I am... me.

354
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,158
Now I can finally put
a face with the name.

355
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,012
Maggie Pierce,
prodigy cardio chief.

356
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,999
Please. Prodigy? It's...
It's not all that great.

357
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,303
Oh, I know.

358
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,504
- Hmm?
- It's great if I'm your
patient 'cause I'm asleep

359
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,172
and you don't
have to talk to me,

360
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:02,508
but if I'm your student,
God help me, right?

361
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,535
- Right.
- It was nice to meet you.

362
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,608
- Everyone's complaining
about her.
- Who? I want names.

363
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,011
Everyone. And I
don't blame them.

364
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,413
Look, Minnick is doing
more than observing.

365
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,048
She was interfering
with our surgeons.

366
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,366
Their process,
their techniques...

367
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,518
Okay, first off,
they're my surgeons.

368
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,853
Okay, very well. Then I
will deal with Minnick myself.

369
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,322
I will let her know her role is
observing and nothing more.

370
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,626
No, you will not.

371
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,377
- And why not?
- Because that's not the deal.

372
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,747
Look, I gave
Dr. Minnick permission

373
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:44,304
to interact with the
staff how she sees fit.

374
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:47,870
She needs to know how
open we are to new ideas

375
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,134
before she can make
her own decision.

376
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,797
Decision?

377
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:58,202
- Are you giving her my job?
- No... No. Of course not.

378
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,816
I want her to work with you.

379
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,790
Why? Is there something
wrong with this program?

380
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,510
I...

381
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,923
just think...

382
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,347
What... What the
hell is it, Bailey?

383
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,161
Because it looks like
you're trying to hire someone

384
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,512
to dismantle a system
that I spent years...

385
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:17,800
That we spent
years trying to build.

386
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,635
And for the life of me,
I can't understand why.

387
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,471
Because medicine is
changing constantly.

388
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,189
You're the person
who taught me that.

389
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,775
And we... Everyone
here needs to be able

390
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,467
to change along with
it or get left behind.

391
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,653
It's my decision to
make. I am the chief.

392
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,677
I know.

393
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,178
It's a job I fought very
hard for you to get.

394
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,738
I just want to know
what it means.

395
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,941
Am I a bad teacher? Am
I the only bad teacher?

396
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,108
Am I gonna get fired?

397
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,710
- Why don't you ask her?
- If I do that,

398
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,478
then she'll know I'm
an accessory to theft.

399
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,547
It's kind of nice, not being
the only criminal for once.

400
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,716
Maybe I'm the only good
teacher. Maybe they're all fired.

401
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,351
- She made a mistake. That's all.
- You don't know that.

402
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,919
I do, because the only person

403
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,871
who should've been
left off that list is me.

404
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:15,557
Look, my trial starts in a couple
weeks, and I don't even exist.

405
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,826
- I'm not even here anymore.
- Alex, I didn't...

406
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,290
Look, if she left you off, it
was a mistake. That's all.

407
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:21,683
Look, I got to lock up.

408
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,636
Okay. She's down.

409
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,590
There's breast milk in the fridge,
but I'll be home in a couple hours.

410
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,659
So, you're going
on... a date, like a...

411
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:35,911
Like a date, date.

412
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,201
Yeah. Date-date.

413
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,304
Huh.

414
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,089
"Huh"? What's "huh"?

415
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,788
Is it so hard to believe that a
handsome, accomplished man

416
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:46,944
would find me date-worthy?

417
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,758
No, it's not. I'm
super date-worthy.

418
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,443
Where'd you meet
this guy? At work, or...

419
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,467
We met on Tinder.

420
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,319
- You're on Tinder?
- So what? So are you.

421
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,067
That's... Not... Not...
Not lately, I'm not...

422
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,811
- How did you know that?
- Because you
came up on mine once.

423
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,620
- Really?
- Well, why wouldn't you?

424
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,596
I mean, we're...
You're really close by.

425
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,333
- Yeah.
- I swiped left, so...

426
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,764
No. Yeah. No, no, I
would... I would, too.

427
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:12,803
Yeah, thank you.

428
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,707
I got to go.

429
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,831
In the OR, I got to do so
much more of the surgery,

430
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,499
but man, was she rubbing
Grey the wrong way!

431
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,109
And, uh...

432
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,785
Seems like the attendings
don't really like her,

433
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,089
but the residents...

434
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,849
Aren't you gonna do the thing?

435
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,547
You know, the thing where
you try to get me to tell you more

436
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,048
about what the
residents are thinking,

437
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,035
and then I can say that maybe I
shouldn't, 'cause you're the chief,

438
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,437
and then you can say,
"But you're my husband."

439
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:53,972
and I can say, "I know, baby,

440
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,647
"but I'm gonna have to
invoke Church and State."

441
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,234
You okay?

442
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:07,642
I don't know.

443
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,017
What do you need?

444
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,680
Tell me I'm doing
the right thing.

445
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:27,595
You're doing the right thing.

446
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,906
- Morning.
- Can you pour me one of those?

447
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,341
I just spent the last hour
getting trailed by Dr. Minnick.

448
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,959
She is... opinionated.

449
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:51,230
How'd it go last night? You
seemed to come home a little early.

450
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,715
Everything go all right?

451
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,234
You kidding? It was great. It
was, like, just so fun. So fun.

452
00:22:56,258 --> 00:23:00,072
I mean, he's actually...
Yeah, he's pretty amazing.

453
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,656
- Amazing?
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,850
How so?

455
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,495
Like, so amazing
that we're gonna...

456
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,363
We're actually gonna
go out again tonight.

457
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,722
- That's how "so amazing" it was.
- That's great. That's great.

458
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,709
- This coffee is, like...
- Is it amazing?

459
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,147
Yeah.

460
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,647
I don't know what
you're so upset about.

461
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,166
Laying the patient on his belly?

462
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,334
He's open with only a
negative pressure dressing

463
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,870
holding in his edematous bowl.
It can't take that kind of pressure.

464
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,455
Hi. Thanks for letting me watch.

465
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,790
- I told you, I have a solution.
- I'd love to hear it.

466
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,609
- This is still happening?
- Oh, yes.

467
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,311
An anterior approach would
save him from a second one.

468
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,313
You know I can't chance having
the hardware contaminated.

469
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,082
You want to fill his
spinal cord with crap?

470
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,017
- I'm gonna find another surgery.
- Take me with you.

471
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,137
We figured out how to
assemble an OR table,

472
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,371
leaving a hole in the middle.

473
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,939
We're using a binder
to support his belly

474
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,041
so that we don't place pressure
on the abdominal incision.

475
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,310
- That's...
- Crazy! He'll eviscerate.

476
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,212
No, he won't, not
with the binder...

477
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,597
His guts could still end
up on the floor, Amelia.

478
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,967
They won't. Edwards will check
the dressing every five minutes,

479
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:04,752
if he starts to eviscerate, she
will hold pressure until we're done.

480
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,688
- She'll go under the table?
- Yes.

481
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,856
And check that
the guts are still in?

482
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

483
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,583
- That's...
- Genius.

484
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,866
- Yeah, that... That'll work.
- Can I add one little wrinkle?

485
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,635
Dr. Edwards has the potential
to learn from this procedure,

486
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,737
which I bet you've seen a
few times, right, Dr. Hunt?

487
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,001
Yeah.

488
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,582
Then why are you assisting, and
why is she the one on the floor?

489
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,268
Now, that's genius.

490
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,369
Murphy, you came here
to learn from me, right?

491
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,433
That's what you said?

492
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,693
Yes, absolutely.

493
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,463
How's it going?

494
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,051
Don't be shy. I wouldn't
ask if I didn't want to know.

495
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:53,340
If there's anything I can do to
help, I'd really love to hear it.

496
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:56,710
- Really?
- Yes, please.

497
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,352
You're a great surgeon.
A really great surgeon.

498
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,301
But... sometimes I have a
hard time keeping up with you.

499
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,503
You're so fast. I mean, fast.

500
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,905
And I'm good. I worked
really hard to get good,

501
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,791
But I'm studying so
hard to keep up with you.

502
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:19,883
Then sometimes I think I know what you're
talking about, but then... my brain is melting.

503
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,475
Dr. Murphy, I think I'm
gonna need you to go.

504
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,770
I'm... I'm so sorry. I thought
that you wanted me to...

505
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,507
I need you to go book an OR.
This is way worse than we thought.

506
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,626
Look. Right there. The left main
coronary artery is almost occluded.

507
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,234
- She needs a coronary bypass?
- That's right. Go. Now. Hurry.

508
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,240
Dr. Murphy? Where's the fire?

509
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,163
Oh, Dr. Webber.
Glad you're here.

510
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,665
What is this? What
are you doing here?

511
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,400
This is a teaching opportunity.

512
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,518
An emergent CABG has
just fallen into our laps,

513
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,136
Dr. Pierce has
agreed to let me use it

514
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,673
to demonstrate my teaching method
for anyone who wants to observe.

515
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,409
- No. Absolutely not. I am
interested to see how it works.

516
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,193
This is a high-risk procedure.

517
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,630
Enid's age makes
her a high-risk patient.

518
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,665
We're not gonna turn her
surgery into a skills lab.

519
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,600
Come on, now. This
is a teaching hospital.

520
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:17,001
Every surgery is a skills lab.

521
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:18,587
Well, I'm gonna talk
to Bailey about this.

522
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,188
Yes, good, you
should talk to the chief.

523
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,407
- Oh, believe me, I will.
- She already approved it.

524
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,775
She thinks it's happening, and so
do all those people in the gallery.

525
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,417
Now, this patient's emergent.
We shouldn't waste any more time.

526
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,795
I'm going to retract the
nerve roots now, Penfield,

527
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,742
carefully, to avoid
nerve damage.

528
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,801
Remember, the most important
thing is to take your time.

529
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,749
Dr. Hunt, everything
okay down there?

530
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,135
- Yep. No leaks.
- Great.

531
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,372
Actually, Dr. Hunt,
if you could...

532
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:54,678
move your foot.

533
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:56,964
Thank you.

534
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,564
Dr. Pierce, why don't you
trade places with Dr. Murphy?

535
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,818
Because Dr. Pierce is standing
where the lead surgeon needs to stand.

536
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,388
Traditionally, yes, we're
trying something different, right?

537
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:10,905
When this method is working,

538
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,475
the resident and the attending
function as one surgeon.

539
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,877
The resident's the hands,
the attending's the brain.

540
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,901
You follow?

541
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,185
Let's give it a try. Murphy?

542
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,852
Murphy's taking the
lead. Look at that.

543
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:27,989
I date men, but I might seriously
ask Dr. Minnick to marry me.

544
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,358
- Dr. Karev?
- You supposed to be up here?

545
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,643
- You gonna narc on me?
- I'm thinking about it.

546
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,479
Think of it this way.
In a couple weeks,

547
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:35,947
you might never
have to see me again.

548
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:38,100
This might be the closest
I get to an OR again.

549
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,604
Well, fine, if you're gonna
be all pathetic about it.

550
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,539
If you feel like you can continue...
Dr. Pierce, you talk her through.

551
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,003
Go ahead and
place the stabilizer.

552
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,527
And if you get stuck,
you... You stop.

553
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:51,591
- Ask for help.
- You stop.

554
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,020
And then ask for help.

555
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:56,134
Don't get me wrong. I love
see one, do one, teach one.

556
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:58,186
It's how I learned.
It's how we all learned.

557
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,471
So, why put it out to pasture?

558
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:01,906
We're putting it on
steroids. With this technique,

559
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,174
the resident gets to see one,

560
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:06,333
do one, teach one all in the
same surgery, every surgery.

561
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,171
Seriously, marriage!
Expect a save-the-date.

562
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,818
<i>Okay, yes. Got it.</i>

563
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,425
- Hey.
- Hey.

564
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,648
Um...

565
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,096
So, I was thinking that maybe we
don't need to discuss the dating thing.

566
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,415
We could just kind of keep
that to ourselves, you know?

567
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,751
You have a problem
with me going out?

568
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,636
No. No, no, no. It's not that.

569
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,020
You should do what you
want. I want you to be happy.

570
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,580
This is not a
"you" thing. It's me.

571
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,378
This whole thing
is all pretty...

572
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:45,055
- Very weird.
- Right? God, it's so weird.

573
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,568
You said...

574
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,669
Last night was not
amazing. It was awful.

575
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,672
I sat down for all
of five minutes,

576
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,762
and when he got up
to get drinks at the bar,

577
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,526
I faked a page.

578
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,078
- You faked a page?
- Yeah.

579
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,714
I told him there was an
MVC, and I'm pretty sure

580
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,483
at that exact moment, someone
crashed their car, 'cause I lied.

581
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,042
- That's not how it works.
- And then I ran like the wind.

582
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:11,042
I don't know how people
do this. I've never done this.

583
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,144
I've never, like, sat
across from someone

584
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,847
and said, "Hi. This
is me. Who are you?"

585
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,915
I had, like, friends that
turned into boyfriends.

586
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,219
I met Matthew at work.

587
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:20,858
Then you.

588
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,260
Here we are.

589
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,547
How do you do this?

590
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:31,218
Well, you're kind of doing it.

591
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,164
I mean, you dip your toe.

592
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,683
You start by dipping
your toe into the water,

593
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,391
and then, eventually,
you learn to swim.

594
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,472
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

595
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,274
You probably dipped
your toe all over town.

596
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:47,066
Look, you faked a page out there.
Okay? You got good instincts, kid.

597
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:55,003
It'll be a while before
he's up and about,

598
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,493
- but Emmett's gonna be fine.
- Oh, wow.

599
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,480
Thank you. Do you mind...

600
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,350
Is it possible for me
to stay here tonight?

601
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,814
- Oh, I don't know...
- Please.

602
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,838
Last night...

603
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:11,892
Would you believe we have been married
for 20 years and never spent a night apart?

604
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,474
I mean, you spend that
much time with someone,

605
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,097
it gets so they drive you crazy.

606
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,169
But last night,

607
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:24,837
he wasn't there...

608
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,574
and I couldn't sleep.

609
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:30,644
There's an Emmett-shaped
hole in our house.

610
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:35,165
Literally, there's a hole in the
ceiling where he fell through.

611
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,204
Big moron.

612
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,741
Don't squeeze the
heart too much, Murphy.

613
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,208
- Got it.
- Okay.

614
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,494
- Got it.
- There. Way to go, Murphy.

615
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,429
You just placed a
heart-stabilization device

616
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,981
- all on your own.
- Now let me...

617
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,489
Don't touch. Just
use your words.

618
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,538
- Use my words?
- Mm-hmm. Explain it to her.

619
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,392
Incision. Shunt. Anastomosis.

620
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,361
That is not what I'm asking.

621
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:13,581
Break it down. Go step by
step. You're trying to skip ahead.

622
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,183
Dr. Pierce thinks ahead.

623
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,168
Her mind is fast.
Faster than anyone's.

624
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,704
So she shouldn't be asked
to dumb things down, okay?

625
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,878
Murphy, can you
do the next step?

626
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,910
I can try, but if Dr. Pierce is
more comfortable stepping in...

627
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:27,279
I guarantee you she is,

628
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,864
but you will be more
comfortable after you do it.

629
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,617
Okay. Now that we've
stabilized the heart,

630
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,942
we will administer esmolol to
slow the heart rate for better control.

631
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,602
Right, now go ahead and
incise the diseased artery.

632
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:54,405
I don't... I don't
want to do this.

633
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,876
I don't... I don't feel ready to
do this. Will you? Is that all right?

634
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,894
It's more than all
right, Murphy. Exactly.

635
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,681
No shame. When you've
reached the limit, you tag out.

636
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,884
And when she does, you'll be able
to see exactly how much she knows

637
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:07,307
and how much
she has left to learn.

638
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,639
All right. First, I'm going
to measure the shunt.

639
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,696
Okay.

640
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,564
Let me back up.

641
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,663
First, I will incise
the target artery,

642
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,598
and then I will
insert the shunt.

643
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,523
And after that, then I'll
prep for anastomosis.

644
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,088
Dr. Webber, will you check
the internal mammary for flow?

645
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,774
- Already started.
- I noticed. Maybe Dr. DeLuca...

646
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,776
- No.
- I'm sorry?

647
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,479
This artery that will allow
this woman to survive.

648
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:37,048
I'm not putting it in the
hands of a first-year intern

649
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,521
who hasn't taken out a tonsil.

650
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,670
DeLuca, you've anastomosed
a vessel before, right?

651
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,056
Yes, ma'am. I've assisted
on a femoral-artery repair.

652
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,574
That is not the
same thing. Not at all.

653
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,893
So, right there, I'm assuming
you know what that is.

654
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,228
Uh... Yes, it's... It's the IMA.

655
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,264
Exactly. See how it
branches off to the right?

656
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,233
Hey, just because he knows...

657
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,252
You hit a branch of
the mammary! Ah, hell!

658
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,987
DeLuca, move and
start some suction.

659
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,321
DeLuca, you are right there.

660
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,912
- I can't see anything.
- I got it. Got it.

661
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,214
I did it. It's done.

662
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,468
I had a clip for
Dr. Webber. I just... fixed it.

663
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:11,638
Right?

664
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,972
You're upset, clearly.

665
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,525
Oh, is it clear? Good.

666
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,361
I was afraid you might not catch
my drift, because you're insane.

667
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,396
Have you never
accidentally nicked a vessel?

668
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,632
Of course I have. You
did this on purpose.

669
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,067
You were about to
clip the artery anyway.

670
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,507
I want you out of this hospital.

671
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:32,987
When I was two,

672
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,773
my dad was looking through the
phone book for swimming lessons.

673
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,993
My mom said, "Here's one",
and tossed me in the pool.

674
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,312
- Did I drown?
- That's your innovation?

675
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,715
Throw a bloody patient at a
novice to see what happens?

676
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:46,500
They did that 100 years
ago. On the battlefield!

677
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,254
Dr. Webber, there were four
surgeons around that table

678
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,278
we knew could've
stopped her bleeding.

679
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:55,465
And when DeLuca made that save,
we learned there were actually five.

680
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,113
If he were allowed to perform in
every surgery like he did today,

681
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,572
he would learn more and faster
with less pressure and less risk.

682
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,078
The patient was never in danger
because we were standing right there.

683
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,717
You know I'm right.

684
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,785
Cardiac enzymes are trending
down. She's gonna be okay.

685
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:36,389
That was humiliating.

686
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,570
It was inexcusable. And
she's not gonna do it again.

687
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,105
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

688
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:43,892
She's right. I'm
not a great teacher.

689
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,846
- Oh, come on.
- No, the thing is I am a genius.

690
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,048
As a student, I learned
better and faster than anyone.

691
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:53,639
I was a rock star. But as
a teacher... Minnick's right.

692
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:55,742
I'm not that great.

693
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,496
Her system works.

694
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,998
She's right.

695
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,300
She's an ass, but she's right.

696
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,055
Dr. Webber? She's
gonna be okay, right?

697
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,319
Yes, ma'am.

698
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,859
I think you'll have your secret
weapon locked and loaded

699
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:19,994
before the regionals.

700
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,030
Dr. Webber, do you think I
would push her to get surgery

701
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,471
for some silly tournament?

702
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:28,720
She's tried to drop out
of the team six times,

703
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,354
and that team is the only thing

704
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,690
that keeps the lot of
us from sitting around,

705
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,359
watching TV in the common room,

706
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:37,483
and moldering away like all
the other old, wet sponges.

707
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,903
She needs to stay in
the game. We all do.

708
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,507
Sometimes we just...
need a little push.

709
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:57,968
Owen, wait up.

710
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,657
I thought I might
ask for a ride home.

711
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,028
Yeah. Yeah, I can manage that.

712
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,231
Thank you for earlier.

713
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,281
Edwards really did get a lot
from watching that spinal fusion.

714
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,804
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

715
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,319
You're not still mad about
having to sit on the floor.

716
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,157
Amelia, I have operated in sinkholes.
I don't mind sitting on the floor.

717
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,026
Can we just let it go? It's not
important enough to argue about.

718
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,396
- I have let it go.
- No, you haven't.

719
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,130
You don't... All
day, it's been...

720
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,366
Can we just set a reset
button and move forward?

721
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,302
I am moving forward.
By myself, apparently,

722
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,487
because you can't be
bothered to sleep at home.

723
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:39,362
- I've had patients.
- Every night
for the past two weeks?

724
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,710
- You didn't have to stay here.
- Yes, I did.

725
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,194
- Because of me? Come on.
- I don't wanna do this.

726
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:46,064
- Did I tell you not
to come home?
- I cannot keep doing this.

727
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:48,648
- Doing what?
- I don't
wanna have a baby!

728
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,029
Hey. You lost?

729
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,599
I forgot. Chief Bailey's
office... fourth floor?

730
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,856
- Yeah, right off the catwalk.
- Great. Thanks.

731
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,755
Um... You made a mistake.

732
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,907
- I'm sorry?
- I am great,

733
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,942
and your little list, or
whatever the hell that is,

734
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,243
should have my name on it

735
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,597
'cause I raise great
surgeons, and I will raise more.

736
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,433
Fetal surgery is... a
very exclusive practice,

737
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:26,404
and there are hardly any of
us. I am like a rare, exotic bird,

738
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:30,029
and if you stop me from teaching,
I may be the last of my kind.

739
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:32,903
What list?

740
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,580
From the room. The
residents. You left it there.

741
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,849
I was just trying to
learn everyone's name.

742
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,936
- Writing it down
helps me remember.
- Oh, great.

743
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,604
So, you don't... need
to remember my name?

744
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,608
Arizona Robbins? That
name attached to that face?

745
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,027
No, that's not one you forget.

746
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,742
Night.

747
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:03,274
- You're interested
in the game, now?
- I'm interested in these nachos.

748
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:04,738
- Watch it.
- Oh.

749
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,232
Oh, shoot.

750
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,452
I forgot.

751
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,132
The guy I blew off last night?

752
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,551
I made a rain check for
tonight and I forgot to cancel.

753
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:15,108
Mm. Is this the dude?

754
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,891
Let's get a look here. That's
an odd choice for a photo.

755
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:23,633
He looks respectable. You
should go. Go dip your toe.

756
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,682
I want to dip my
toe in those nachos.

757
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,038
No, no, no. Gross. Go.

758
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,752
Give the guy more than five
minutes. Have a drink. Have a laugh.

759
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,621
If it gets weird,
then just text me.

760
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,765
We'll get you out of
there in two minutes.

761
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,149
- Do it.
- Okay. Fine.

762
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,662
No, I don't... I just...
I look like I'm just...

763
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,364
You look terrific.
Would you just go?

764
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,155
- Dip it. Get to dipping.
- Fine. Okay, geez.

765
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,981
- Hey. It's late.
- Can I stay here tonight?

766
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,182
Yeah. What's wrong?

767
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,233
I don't want to talk about it.
I just need a place to crash.

768
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,020
Nope. She can't stay here.

769
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,521
- You can't stay here.
- Alex.

770
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,506
- Mer just said...
- I don't care what Mer said.

771
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,975
You can't crash here. Go home.

772
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,727
- It was my room
before it was yours.
- Go home and fix your crap.

773
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,196
- I can't.
- You're freaking out,

774
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,398
because you got some
sword hanging over your head?

775
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,384
Me, too, and I can't do a
damn thing about it except wait.

776
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,002
You can fix your stupid sword.

777
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,010
Go home and get the
freaking execution over with.

778
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:27,280
I did. I told him.

779
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,615
The sword fell.

780
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:34,812
Take my room.

781
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,442
- She talks to me now.
- Mmm.

782
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,011
Thank you.

783
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,535
Everyone's talking about
what you did in that OR.

784
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:54,891
I have a tendency to shake things
up. And if I come here, I certainly will.

785
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,037
Will you? Come here?

786
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,006
I still have a few
other offers to field,

787
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,598
but... I'm definitely
interested.

788
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,999
That's great to hear.

789
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:09,338
You should know,
they'll hate you. The staff?

790
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,310
It happens everywhere I go.
Everyone hates the agent of change.

791
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,290
I'm used to it, I'm good at it,

792
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,376
but you should be prepared that
they'll hate you, too, for bringing me on.

793
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,468
Also, if I take the
job, I work alone.

794
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:25,650
I like Dr. Webber,
respect the hell out of him,

795
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:28,035
but if I come on, I
don't share authority.

796
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,542
I am the authority.

797
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:38,667
- Oh, I'm sorry. I can come back.
- Oh, no need. We are all set, here.

798
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,234
It's been a pleasure.

799
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:52,042
- She makes me feel old.
- She is a puppy.

800
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:56,302
Yeah, you know, when I was chief, I
was the one pushing through things,

801
00:40:56,938 --> 00:41:00,590
selling the board on robotic
surgery and bringing in new ideas.

802
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,287
I mean, that's all you're trying to
do, is to bring in something new

803
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:07,424
and trying to bring me along
with it, whether I like it or not.

804
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:10,033
I was resistant. I'm sorry.

805
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,146
Oh, you don't have to...

806
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,304
No, we all have to be
pushed, and she pushes me.

807
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,566
<i>It's hard to admit
when we're wrong,</i>

808
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,425
<i>that even though everything
looks fine, there is a problem.</i>

809
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,640
You know, I'll be happy to work with
her. I think we'll make a good team.

810
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:25,025
<i>Something is broken,</i>

811
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,695
<i>and you have to see where
it's going and set about fixing it...</i>

812
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,218
So, is she gonna stick around?

813
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,154
She's thinking about it.

814
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,591
Well, let's keep
our fingers crossed.

815
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,469
<i>Or it's all gonna come apart.</i>
