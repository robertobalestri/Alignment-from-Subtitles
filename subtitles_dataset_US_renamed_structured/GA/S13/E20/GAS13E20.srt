1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,815
No, I don't like Goldfish. No!

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,317
<i>Turbulence.</i>

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,853
<i>It means anything
from a few little bumps</i>

4
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,521
<i>to a catastrophic weather system</i>

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,323
<i>that could knock
your flying tin can</i>

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,924
<i>right out of the air.</i>

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,693
What I don't like is
how they treat you.

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,695
The comments and
backhanded compliments.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,063
Okay, I'm gonna stop
you before you say

10
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,764
- something you shouldn't.
- It's my family
we're talking about.

11
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,788
No!

12
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,734
<i>In surgery, we call
it a "complication."</i>

13
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,536
- Oh.
<i>- We've hit a snag,</i>

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,821
<i>a bump in the road, turbulence.</i>

15
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:30,423
Sir, I can gate-check
that for you.

16
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,127
- It'll fit.
- No, sir, it won't.

17
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,795
I'm telling you, it's gonna fit.
I got it up here fine last flight.

18
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,230
I'll rephrase. I'm going to
gate-check your bag for you now, sir.

19
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:38,432
- Please find your seat.
- No!

20
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,921
<i>So, you know...</i>

21
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,874
<i>you better buckle up.</i>

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,987
The seat belt!

23
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,525
- No! No! No!
- Oh, goody.

24
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,110
<i>At this time, please
make sure your seat backs</i>

25
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,944
<i>and tray tables are
in their fully upright</i>

26
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,212
<i>and locked positions.</i>

27
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,515
<i>As we taxi, please direct
your attention to the screens</i>

28
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,005
<i>for a safety demonstration.</i>

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,607
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

30
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,828
Diego, calm down. Come on. Papa.

31
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,090
<i>- Sientate bien.</i>
- No!

32
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:08,427
-I'm so sorry. He's not
usually like this, -DIEGO: No!

33
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,346
But he didn't get a nap today.

34
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,148
That's fine. I have
three of my own at home.

35
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,434
No! I don't like Goldfish.

36
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,487
Uh, excuse me? Hi. Can I
switch seats or something?

37
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,956
It's just, I have a deadline,
and I need this flight to work

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,409
- and you don't even have
to move this puny kid. I'll go.
- I don't like Goldfish.

39
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,161
Move me to the back,
anywhere. I don't care.

40
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,429
- No!
- Aisle seat would be best!

41
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,898
Also not like the "back" back
where the seat doesn't recline...

42
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,573
- It's a full flight, sir.
- Worst flight ever.

43
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,594
Do you have a problem
with a crying child?

44
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,108
- I mean...
- As if his mother

45
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,259
isn't under enough stress,

46
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:40,960
you want to add
to it, make it worse?

47
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,796
I just want to focus
on my briefing.

48
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,248
There are complimentary
earplugs in the seat pocket.

49
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,549
- Use those.
- No!

50
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,551
Come on, let's put your
seat belt on. Please.

51
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,511
You might be my new hero.

52
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:56,142
This is our first
family trip together.

53
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,610
Bryan planned it last minute.

54
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,045
- No!
- Of course.

55
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,314
He said it was gonna
be relaxing and blissful,

56
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,383
but so far, not much bliss.

57
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,070
Excuse me, sorry.
Marisela, are you okay?

58
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,905
I can hear him all
the way from my seat.

59
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,089
You want me to take him?

60
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,880
- Papa.
- It's okay, go sit back down.

61
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,628
But I reserve the right
to switch out mid-flight,

62
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,772
because Mama's gonna
need a glass of wine.

63
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:19,065
Or three.

64
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,867
You guys weren't
able to sit together?

65
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,502
Like I said, last minute.

66
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,446
Oh. Well, do you want to?

67
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,806
Thank you.

68
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,474
I make so many efforts.

69
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,943
Did you or did you
not call my mom back

70
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,410
when she left a
message two weeks ago?

71
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,046
- Maybe if you made...
- Ma'am.

72
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,797
We're taxiing. You
must take your seat.

73
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,273
Right, I was... I just switched
seats, and my seat is right there.

74
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,309
Did you or did you
not fail to call her back?

75
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,573
Here.

76
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,497
- Oh, God.
- Right now, ma'am.

77
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,549
Yes. I'm sitting.

78
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,974
- Hello.
- Hi.

79
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,976
- Where'd you come from?
- 4C.

80
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,130
I was being a Good Samaritan and
reuniting a family. Serves me right.

81
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:06,545
- What are you doing here?
- I'm going to a conference.

82
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,087
- What are you doing here?
- I'm going to a conference.

83
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,367
National Conference on...

84
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,511
Operative Advances.

85
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,155
- Yeah, me too.
- You didn't mention
you were going.

86
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,278
Neither did you.

87
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,158
You sure you're
not following me?

88
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,427
What? You just found a
way to move into my row.

89
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,996
I should be asking you
if you're following me.

90
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,465
- Don't flatter yourself.
- It is a little suspicious.

91
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,933
One minute, some guy
with a beard's sitting there,

92
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,397
and next thing I
know, there you are.

93
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,755
<i>Flight crew, please
start readying the cabin.</i>

94
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,779
Of course.

95
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,073
Might not be the
worst thing in the world.

96
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,428
- What's not?
- Three whole days

97
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,297
far from home, no one
around to bother us.

98
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,883
I told you, we're done.
I'm not messing around.

99
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,768
- Not even a little
messing around?
- We agreed.

100
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,871
You two wanna switch seats so
you're sitting next to each other, or...

101
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,895
- Sure.
- No.

102
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,084
<i>Cabin crew, please
be seated for takeoff.</i>

103
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,901
I never travel without children.

104
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,916
I was so looking forward
to being on this flight alone.

105
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,420
This is my me time.
Please don't ruin it.

106
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,749
I'm just saying, sometimes
the universe gives you signs,

107
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,740
and this could be
one of those signs.

108
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,340
I know you're not asleep.

109
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,041
- What's that?
- Oh, sorry.

110
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,985
No, Ingrid, you're fine.
I wasn't talking to you.

111
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,113
I would be asleep if you
would leave me alone.

112
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,897
Why isn't she talking to you?

113
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,917
-Well, we got together, -Mm.

114
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,201
- In her car.
- Mm.

115
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,871
And then we stayed apart,
and then we were colleagues,

116
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,390
which turned into friends,
which got us back together...

117
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,408
sort of. Or at least, it
was going to, and then...

118
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,792
And then nothing.
For very good reasons.

119
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,580
- She has a sister.
- You cheated with her sister?

120
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:51,339
- No. No. God, no.
- No, there was no cheating
because there was no us.

121
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,603
She's oversimplifying it.

122
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,146
I'm going to stretch my legs.

123
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,891
What are you...
What are you doing?

124
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:11,938
You said to come in here.

125
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,072
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

126
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,206
You did that thing
with your eyes.

127
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,925
- My eyes?
- Yeah, where you look
at me all...

128
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,360
You know. Then you
came in here, so I figured

129
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,495
- you wanted me
to come in here, too.
- I did nothing with my eyes.

130
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,698
I swear it looked like...

131
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,116
- There's no room in here.
- Well, I do need to talk to you.

132
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,685
- That's all you've been doing.
- Yeah, without someone
sitting in between us

133
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,109
and you closing your eyes.

134
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,541
Well, make it quick,
because I have to pee.

135
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,476
Well, you've had a lot
to say lately about us,

136
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,513
- about how you don't think
we should be together.
- Yes. I've been very clear.

137
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,115
Yes, you were and I think
I need to be clear, too.

138
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,884
You and I, this is something.

139
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,118
And I can't keep ignoring that.

140
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,420
- Well, you have to.
- I can't.

141
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,587
- Not my problem.
- Can you?

142
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,938
- What? Yes.
- Ignore it.

143
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,256
- I don't believe you.
- Well, believe

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,342
whatever you have to
believe to get out of here.

145
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,860
Oh!

146
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:56,048
Why? Why do we
have to ignore it, okay?

147
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,007
In Seattle, sure, but
Pierce isn't here. No one is.

148
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,090
That doesn't matter.

149
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,393
Why?

150
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,263
You know why.

151
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,718
Okay. Then I'll go.

152
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,841
You might wanna move
so I can get out the door.

153
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,710
I know.

154
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,975
- So why aren't you moving?
- I don't know.

155
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:30,871
Whatever happens, this
never happened. Got it?

156
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,316
- Oh!
- Hey.

157
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,141
- Sorry, that's, uh,
still occupied.
- Oh.

158
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,077
Glad someone's
enjoying this flight.

159
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,775
Oh. Hang on, you're,
uh, a little inside out.

160
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,799
- Oh. Thank you.
- Sorry. I'm jealous.

161
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,563
All my fiancé and I have done
today is fight about everything.

162
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:03,366
- I'm Max.
- Meredith.

163
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,169
Oh. This is perfect timing.
Gonna yell at me again?

164
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,420
- Do I need to?
- Flying is very stressful
for me.

165
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,056
I forgot to take my
water pill this morning,

166
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,842
and I have a condition where, at this
altitude, it can be very hard to breathe.

167
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,248
Pulmonary hypertension.

168
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,896
Ye... Yes. So?

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,271
So is that an excuse to shame
mothers and their children?

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,581
- Which one is yours?
- Halfway back, green shirt
by the window.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,116
- He's handsome.
- I know.

172
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,589
- Also handsome.
- I know.

173
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,241
<i>Please make sure that your
seat belts are securely fastened.</i>

174
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,211
I guess she got tired of us
talking over the top of her, huh?

175
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,475
What happened back
there changes nothing.

176
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,385
- Okay.
- I mean it.

177
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,573
I said "okay."

178
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,322
You don't like flying?

179
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,130
- It's not my favorite.
- Me neither.

180
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,015
Plane crash.

181
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,651
Wait.

182
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,179
- You were in a...?
- Yeah.

183
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,480
- Yeah.
- Was it bad?

184
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:09,916
I mean it was...

185
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,403
we crashed and got lost.
People died. It wasn't great.

186
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,670
What about your plane crash?

187
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,272
Did anyone die or lose a limb?

188
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,207
You know that's how
Arizona lost her leg?

189
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,209
Okay, I'm definitely not
telling you about mine now.

190
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,261
- It can't compare.
- It's not a contest.

191
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,455
- Come on.
- No.

192
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,369
I told you mine.

193
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:32,472
All right, I was a
teenager, total idiot.

194
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,780
My mate's dad had one of those
crop dusters. We snuck it out.

195
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,961
We got it off the
ground pretty high

196
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,763
for about four whole minutes
before we crashed into a shed.

197
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,621
But that feeling of
falling straight down...

198
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,903
Yeah, mine was way worse.

199
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,422
Well, I told you mine
couldn't compare to yours.

200
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,301
<i>Meredith. Meredith.</i>

201
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,371
<i>Mer, just breathe. Just breathe.</i>

202
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,615
<i>Where is Derek?</i>

203
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,076
<i>Derek!</i>

204
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,058
- Oh, God.
- Just breathe! Just breathe.

205
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:26,259
<i>Meredith!</i>

206
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,243
<i>- How you doing?
- Meredith. Meredith. Get up!</i>

207
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,581
- I'm fine.
- Max, Max, get up.

208
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,816
- Max. Max is on the ground.
- Max?

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,473
Max? Are you okay?

210
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,893
Oh, God. He's not
moving. Max! Max! Max.

211
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,661
Stay buckled, all right?

212
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,824
We're not gonna be able to help
anybody else if we get hurt, too.

213
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,551
Okay.

214
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,735
Is he all right?

215
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,021
Okay. Listen to me.

216
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,672
I'm a doctor. You gotta reach
down, and feel his wrist or his neck.

217
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,989
- Feel for a pulse.
- I don't know how.

218
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,447
Just lean down
and feel his wrist.

219
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,246
- What's your name?
- Jay.

220
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,264
You're doing good,
Jay. Take a deep breath.

221
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:08,506
Just reach down, and
tell me if you feel anything.

222
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,388
There's two more down. There's
an older man in the back of the plane.

223
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,241
I think he's okay. He's
getting back into his seat.

224
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,409
There's a flight attendant
on the floor up there.

225
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,995
Which one? Candice?
Is she moving?

226
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,864
I think she hurt her arm or something.
Hey, Candice. Are you okay?

227
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,922
Yes. I mean no, but...

228
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,035
- Yes.
- I feel something!

229
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,604
- I feel a pulse.
- Okay, good.

230
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,888
His eyes are opening.
He's waking up.

231
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,278
Max, do you know what happened?

232
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,580
Do you know where you are?

233
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,812
He lost consciousness.
There could be a brain bleed.

234
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,146
Or he could just be groggy.

235
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,915
He just got slammed
against the ceiling.

236
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,721
Turbulence is dying down.

237
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,861
Sort of.

238
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:48,777
Okay, let's go.

239
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,127
Where are you
going? You can't go.

240
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,034
Just... it's okay.
Just... it'll be okay.

241
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,737
Just breathe into
your mask. Okay?

242
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:00,942
Oh God.

243
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,006
You may have broken your wrist. I
think we're gonna have to brace it, okay?

244
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,975
Yeah, the main
medical kit's in the galley.

245
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,410
- I can go unlock it.
- No, I'll go,
just tell me the code.

246
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,095
I'm not allowed
to give that out.

247
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,359
I'm a doctor.

248
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,237
Doesn't matter. Just...

249
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,373
help me up. I'll
get the kit myself.

250
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,622
It's only my wrist. It's not the end
of the world, okay? Just help me up.

251
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,309
Here you go.

252
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,616
- Okay?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,433
Okay, Max, I'm gonna need
you to follow my finger, okay?

254
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,436
<i>On behalf of the captain, we ask
everyone to please remain calm and seated.</i>

255
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,122
<i>If you need immediate
medical assistance,</i>

256
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,506
please press your call buttons.

257
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,198
Okay, all right. Max, I need
to examine you some more.

258
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,167
Can you sit up for me?

259
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,083
All right. No, no. No standing.

260
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,751
Let's just lean him
against the seat here.

261
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,269
- Okay.
- All right?

262
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,022
- He's following instructions. That's good, right?
- It is. It is good.

263
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,286
- You'll be okay, honey. You'll be okay.
- Okay.

264
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,049
All right. All right.

265
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,635
Can I get some tissues
please? Do you have napkins?

266
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,088
Okay. Great, great, great.

267
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,904
You're gonna be all right,
honey. You're all right.

268
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,137
Doing great.

269
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,229
Okay, I can feel the step-off
where he hit his head.

270
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,609
That's great. Thanks.

271
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,828
Sure thing. Uh, can I
help? I'm a doctor too.

272
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,664
Absolutely. You can,
um, go around and see

273
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,782
if there's any other passengers
that need immediate assistance.

274
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,750
Thank you. You want
to hold that for me?

275
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:39,968
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

276
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,154
A bunch of Band
Aids and a defibrillator

277
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,646
and no splint, so I can shock
you, but I can't splint your wrist.

278
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,748
So probably gonna have to
reset it, and then wrap it tight.

279
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,571
There's no good pain
meds in here, so this will hurt.

280
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,456
Okay? But I'll go
fast. Quick and dirty.

281
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,460
Quick and dirty,
I can handle that.

282
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,491
Here we go.

283
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,386
Hey, everything okay here?

284
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,954
Deep forehead lac.
It's bleeding pretty bad.

285
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,991
- We should try close it
if we can.
- I got no suture here,

286
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:22,361
but I got some antiseptic
gauze, some butterfly strips.

287
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,796
The luggage just came
flying out, right to us.

288
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,016
- We tried to block it,
but we couldn't.
- No, don't worry.

289
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,373
You guys did great. We're
gonna get him fixed up.

290
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,244
Uh, Harrison Peters.

291
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,958
- The other doctor
sent me over here to help.
- Oh, right on. Nathan Riggs.

292
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,666
- You a surgeon, too?
- I'm a pediatric dentist.

293
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,821
Uh, maybe I should
help with that.

294
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,503
All right, look. There's a
plane full of freaked out people.

295
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,360
I went through
residency. I can help.

296
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,011
Let me help.

297
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,035
- Head really hurts.
- Okay. Okay.

298
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,904
Is he on any meds? Do
you know his medical history?

299
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,501
No, God, I... I don't know.

300
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,270
But, I mean, yes, he
takes pills every day.

301
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,357
Um, I always joke that he has his
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday boxes

302
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,293
- like my grandma used to have.
- Okay, do you know
where that is?

303
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,149
- Yeah.
- Mer, I got the kit.

304
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,637
Okay, I don't like this. I
mean, he hit his head hard.

305
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,951
And I don't have the tools here

306
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,937
to tell if he has a brain
bleed or how bad it is.

307
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,771
- How's his mental status?
- I mean, it's spotty.

308
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,391
He's awake, but he's
not making much sense.

309
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,076
But his pupils are equal,
round, and reactive.

310
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,762
Found it. Here.

311
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,419
- He takes these every day?
- Yeah.

312
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:36,890
Oh. Hey, these are...
These are blood thinners.

313
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,005
So if it's a brain bleed,
it's not going to stop.

314
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,712
This plane needs to land.

315
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,412
No passengers are allowed inside
the cockpit while we're in the air.

316
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:49,598
Okay, but get the captain out here
or get her on the phone or something.

317
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,735
I've already given Captain LeVantine
a full report of the various injuries,

318
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,353
- and she was clear...
- You're not a doctor,

319
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:57,055
- so you can't understand...
- Clear that she has no intention

320
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,607
of landing this plane
right now because...

321
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,059
We have passengers who are
bleeding. They need to be evaluated.

322
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,062
Because we are currently flying between
two very dangerous storm systems,

323
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,948
- one above and one below.
- I really need to speak to her.

324
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,432
There's no way to descend
without putting the lives

325
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,775
- of every single person
on this plane at risk.
- Call her.

326
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,794
Hi, captain. Hi,
yeah, it's Candice.

327
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,396
- Yes, I have Dr...
- Dr. Grey.

328
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,321
Dr. Grey here. She's asking to
speak to you about landing the plane.

329
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,359
- Yes, I understand. Of course. Thank you, captain.
- No, no, I need to speak to her.

330
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,140
Okay, she's busy navigating the
plane through dangerous weather.

331
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,325
- She can't talk right now.
- What about the landing?

332
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,983
She won't be doing that either,
Dr. Grey, not until it's safe.

333
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,603
Can I help you
with anything else?

334
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,001
- Well?
- We're stuck up here
for a while.

335
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,354
Okay, that's fine. For now.

336
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,268
Everyone seems to be stable.

337
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,975
- Max has regained consciousness.
- Yep. For now.

338
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,936
- I'm going to recline you back.
- Everything I said,

339
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,216
the stuff we were
fighting about earlier,

340
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,840
I take it back, all of it.

341
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,888
I thought I'd lost you, Max. I mean,
for a minute there, I thought you died.

342
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,790
I thought all of us
were going to die.

343
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,925
We didn't.

344
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,166
I'm so glad.

345
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,364
Okay, so I need to go check
on some other passengers.

346
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,033
I need you to rest. And,
Jay, I need you to let him.

347
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,002
If there are any
changes, anything at all,

348
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,459
any pain, any
slurring of speech,

349
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,440
- call me.
- I do feel better.

350
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,897
Don't worry. I'm here.

351
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,833
Good.

352
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,782
How's your hand?

353
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,826
Hit it on something. It's fine.

354
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,296
It hurts. How's yours?

355
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,732
Fine. Hurts.

356
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,037
You left.

357
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:05,684
And you didn't come back,
and I've been back there alone.

358
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,603
Um... I'm... I'm bleeding.

359
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,622
Probably just nicked it
when the plane fell, okay?

360
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,490
So we'll just get that
cleaned up for you, okay?

361
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:12,514
Mm.

362
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,599
One minute, that's all it takes.

363
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,780
We hit one bad air pocket
or cloud or whatever,

364
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,655
and we're all just one big
plane crash waiting to happen.

365
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,463
You get used to it.

366
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,042
Not me. I'm... I hate this.

367
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,891
- I'm not flying ever again.
- No, you're just scared.

368
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,035
Give it time.

369
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,999
The fear goes away, trust me.

370
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,475
You might be
willing to risk it again.

371
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,238
Hi. Can I take a
look at your head?

372
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,344
Okay. This might
sting a little, okay?

373
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,144
There we go.

374
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,619
Okay, Diego, look
at this boo boo.

375
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:55,484
You may need a few stitches
when we land. But that's okay.

376
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:59,610
You know what? My little girl, when she
was your age, she busted her knee open.

377
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,725
Do you know how
many stitches she got?

378
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,749
Three.

379
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,444
And you know what else she got?

380
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:08,346
She got a lollipop
for every stitch.

381
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,649
You're so good
with him. Thank you.

382
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,301
- Of course.
- Are you done?

383
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,703
Excuse me, miss?
Are we landing on time?

384
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,672
I really don't want to
miss my connection.

385
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,275
- It was already tight.
- How's your breathing? Are you having any trouble?

386
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,911
Weren't you talking to
the pilot on the phone?

387
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,880
- You have to know...
- We're still in the air,
so obviously we're not landing.

388
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,648
I don't think you
understand the level of stress

389
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,472
- that I'm feeling.
- Okay, so...

390
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,386
Here. Breathe into
that and sit down.

391
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:33,939
Could you grab
me a cup of water?

392
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,998
Or juice? Juice would be
great right now. Apple, no ice.

393
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,361
You do realize I'm a doctor.

394
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,703
His mother did
not raise him right.

395
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,807
We've gone through
most of the gauze.

396
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,251
Thanks for helping out.

397
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,532
Oh, it's kind of fun
treating adults for a change.

398
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,434
They can actually
tell me where it hurts.

399
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,938
They don't expect any
stickers when I'm done.

400
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,323
That was not cool.
This is not fun.

401
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,115
- This is terrible.
- No, no, no. I know exactly what you mean.

402
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:14,685
I'm gonna go sit a minute while I
can, until the next call button rings.

403
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,367
Yeah, of course.

404
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,272
Uh, is there anything
else you need?

405
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,241
Company maybe, or...?

406
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,528
- You could go check on Max.
- Copy that. Will do.

407
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,067
Hey, sorry. Can you... Do you
have any antacids or anything?

408
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,915
- I'm sure someone does. Ask around.
- Sorry. Can you touch my head?

409
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,273
Do I have a fever, you
think? Does it feel hot?

410
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,968
You too, huh?

411
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,061
Excuse me?

412
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,501
You're looking for a place to
hide so you get five minutes alone

413
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,636
without someone new
asking for a consult.

414
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,105
I just had a lady in row
27 ask for a mole check.

415
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,467
How's it going with
your dentist friend?

416
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,770
You guys seem pretty chummy.

417
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,736
You're one to talk.

418
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:11,587
How long were you wrapping
your flight attendant's arm?

419
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,643
- Oh, her name's Candice.
- Um...

420
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,209
It's what I do when I board a plane.
I always ask the crews their name.

421
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,432
It's a respect thing.

422
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,495
Also, it usually
gets me free drinks.

423
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,552
Aha.

424
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,573
What was your plane crash like?

425
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,060
I told you. It was bad.

426
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,466
- I know, but what was it like?
- Uh, it was cold.

427
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,282
So cold.

428
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,305
Even being numb was
cold. I could not warm up.

429
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,324
You know they call us
the Seattle Grace Five?

430
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,548
There were six
of us that went up,

431
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,954
and only five of us came back.

432
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:57,391
And now there are
only three of us alive.

433
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,678
My sister died out there.

434
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,446
You...

435
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,460
- You have another sister?
- Uh-huh.

436
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,429
My kid sister Lexie.

437
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:11,533
I loved her.

438
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,267
Anyway, it's weird.

439
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,560
Sometimes I feel like I'm cursed.
A lot of people die around me.

440
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:24,744
Sometimes I feel like
I'm just waiting for my turn.

441
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,101
I'm sorry about your sister.

442
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,240
It makes sense now.

443
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,079
What does?

444
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,695
The way you feel about Maggie.

445
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,164
How you want to protect
her. I mean, I get it better.

446
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,998
Well, there's nothing to get.

447
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:48,600
I mean, it makes sense,
you know, all the self-sacrifice.

448
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,064
You don't want to
lose this one, too.

449
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:55,212
Is it so crazy that I would put
someone else's happiness before mine?

450
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,726
No, but I mean, it's
not completely practical

451
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,128
in the long run. I
mean, at some point,

452
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,015
you have to think about the things
that are gonna make you happy, too.

453
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,468
- And you think you're it?
- Well, you haven't exactly
been backing away from me.

454
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,620
I told you what happened
in the bathroom...

455
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,756
I'm not just talking
about the damn bathroom.

456
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,030
- Then what?
- For months now... Look,

457
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,483
you try to stay away. Maybe
you even want to stay away.

458
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,336
But you don't.

459
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,083
You never do. A week
ago, you called it quits.

460
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,851
An hour ago, we're
having sex in the bathroom.

461
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,976
- Will you stop it, please?
- I will respect
whatever you decide.

462
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,224
Okay? But don't sit here and
pretend that you don't want this thing

463
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,166
- between you and me
as much as I do.
- I am married.

464
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,741
Uh, hey. Sorry, uh...

465
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,723
We need you.

466
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,812
You're okay. It's okay.

467
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,392
Wow. Okay, Max, we're
gonna get you cleaned up.

468
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,094
- I need some towels.
- Yeah. I'll find some.

469
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,718
- Excuse me.
- My head.

470
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,232
- Yeah, let me have a look.
- He was fine. We were talking, and he...

471
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:56,017
He got tired, so he was resting,
and then he just doubled over.

472
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,337
If he got better and he
suddenly deteriorated...

473
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:00,601
Okay, well, he has a brain
bleed, and it's getting worse.

474
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,570
Oh, God!

475
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,609
Get him on the floor.
Definitely getting worse.

476
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,778
- Here. Towels.
- He's having a seizure!

477
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,630
- Oh, my God!
- What else do you need?

478
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,494
I need the captain right now!

479
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:16,622
Do you think I'm
being arbitrary,

480
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,173
that I'm just trying to
get in the way here?

481
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,975
My patient's condition
has escalated.

482
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,694
I need to get him on the
ground and to a hospital now.

483
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,796
If I tell you I can't
land this plane yet,

484
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,347
it's because I can't.

485
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,967
He has classic symptoms
of a severe epidural bleed.

486
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,470
Every minute, the pressure
is building up in his brain.

487
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,590
I need to relieve that pressure,
and I can't do that up here.

488
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,374
I don't have
clearance to land here.

489
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,327
- You think I haven't tried?
- Well, you have to try harder!

490
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:42,464
And endanger the lives of 257
people so you can save one?

491
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,488
Absolutely not.

492
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,091
I will land this plane the
minute it's safe to do so.

493
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,277
No sooner. End of discussion.

494
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:01,756
Well?

495
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,911
She can't land
the plane right now.

496
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:05,425
So we wait?

497
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:07,661
Max isn't just postictal,

498
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,775
okay? The B.P. was elevated.

499
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,110
The pressure on his brain
is reaching critical levels.

500
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,301
- How much longer did she say?
- She didn't say.

501
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:17,382
Maybe an hour, maybe
two. There's no way to know.

502
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:18,901
He doesn't have
that kind of time.

503
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,368
I know. Listen, if we
were on the ground,

504
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,327
I'd be rushing him to the
O.R. or drilling burr holes.

505
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,941
Yeah, and if we were in
the field, we'd be looking

506
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,049
for a way to puncture his skull
to relieve the pressure, but...

507
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,384
Meredith, we're
on a moving plane.

508
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,301
- Meredith?
- I know there won't be much
that's sharp,

509
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,536
but there's got to be something.

510
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,405
To puncture his skull? Did I
mention the moving plane?

511
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,879
Where's Candice?

512
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,144
I'm sorry. Maintenance tool
kits aren't allowed on board,

513
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,629
not unless they're
checked underneath.

514
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,981
And there's no way
to get down below?

515
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,637
Definitely not. What's going on?

516
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,235
A drill. I need something
I can use as a drill.

517
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,036
Meredith, can we just
pause for a minute?

518
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,856
- Hey, should we move Max, or...
- Hey, you're a dentist.

519
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,680
Do you have any drills on you?

520
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,393
Sure, yeah. I always
have them in my carry on.

521
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,736
- I have them in a special case,
you know, like chef's knives.
- Wait. Really?

522
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,268
No. My key chain
has nail clippers on it,

523
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,975
- but that's about it.
- I've got one syringe. Ah.

524
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,344
I'm sorry. What?

525
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,112
We believe he has a brain bleed,

526
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,693
and we don't know when
we're gonna be able to land.

527
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,728
But we feel that the bleed
needs to be addressed now.

528
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,630
But he's fine. He's sleeping.

529
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,099
Why can't he just keep sleeping?

530
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,001
No, Jay. He looks
like he's just sleeping,

531
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,602
but the pressure is
building in his head,

532
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,044
- and if we just do nothing...
- He might not wake up?

533
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,710
Then why are you wasting
your time talking to me?

534
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,463
Do what you have to
do. Just help him, please.

535
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,666
We need your seats
for a medical emergency.

536
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,570
Thank you for your
patience. Right this way.

537
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,322
Let's recline him
and strap him in.

538
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,658
Yeah, we've got
seat belt extenders.

539
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,526
- Yes. Get them.
- Where do you want the blankets?

540
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,816
Here and here.

541
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,047
Ingrid, I can't guarantee you're
not about to see a lot more blood.

542
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,231
Yeah. No. I know. I'm okay.

543
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,401
- Here you go.
- Candice, did the kit
have an Ambu bag?

544
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,768
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

545
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,992
And get some more towels.

546
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,375
I felt skull movement
along the fracture line earlier.

547
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,945
I need to go in through there and
decompress the hematoma with the needle.

548
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,797
- You can do that?
- Isn't that bad, to stick
a needle in the brain?

549
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,183
Depends. If she goes in too
deep, then she could hit the dura.

550
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,535
- I won't go in too deep. Puts
her less than a millimeter away

551
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,537
from puncturing brain
matter with a syringe

552
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,273
in an uncontrolled,
unsterile environment.

553
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:24,075
Are you done? I'm aware of the
risks. If you don't think I can do this...

554
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,911
Oh, I'm sure you can do
this once, maybe twice,

555
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,364
but evacuating a bleed
with just a syringe?

556
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,382
You're gonna have to insert
that needle time and time again.

557
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,084
What are the odds you don't
hit brain matter eventually?

558
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,769
- Then don't help.
- I have to help.

559
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,455
- You need the assist.
- I have other people here.

560
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,473
Oh, other surgeons?
Look, Meredith, I'm here.

561
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,143
- We're gonna do this together,
all right?
- Got the Ambu bag, more towels,

562
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,087
and all the saline
solution I could round up.

563
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,664
Found it. I'm gonna
need you to bag him

564
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,571
- and hold his head steady.
- Got it.

565
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,720
Ingrid, I need you to go tell Jay not to
worry, and don't let him come up here.

566
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,243
- Yes.
- And close the curtains.

567
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:57,530
Candice, you go tell that captain she
better keep this plane very freakin' steady.

568
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,495
Okay, his pulse is slowing down.

569
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,318
Okay. We got to
move fast. Let's go.

570
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:05,939
Needle.

571
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,835
Now, there's usually
a lull after a bomb hits

572
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,770
before the next one
explodes. That's your window.

573
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:28,161
You just wait for
that boom, then go.

574
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,225
Boom.

575
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,678
Okay. I think it's...

576
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:46,514
good.

577
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,823
Saline.

578
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,936
Okay. Going in for round two.

579
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,894
Nice and steady.

580
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,487
Round five.

581
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,206
What's wrong?

582
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,474
It's just...

583
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,658
It's just, re-inserting
this over and over. It's...

584
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,801
I'm undoing the syringe.

585
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,665
You're what? You want to
hold the needle in your hand?

586
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,985
It's gonna save me from having to
re-insert the needle over and over again.

587
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,938
We've got to drain this fluid off
his brain, or we're gonna lose him.

588
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,824
If you move that
needle even a little,

589
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,315
- he's as good as dead anyway.
- Well aware. Thank you.

590
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,759
Okay, you put it in. I need both
hands to keep this needle steady.

591
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:50,929
Okay.

592
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,317
- It's not going in right.
- Okay. It will. Just untwist
it and try again.

593
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,901
You have that needle
inserted into his brain...

594
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,304
- I told you. I've got the needle.
- What if you don't?

595
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,873
What if I slip and it
goes right into his...

596
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:10,337
Okay, just stop
talking and do it.

597
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,920
- It's on.
- Okay. Good. Great.

598
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,005
Okay. Evacuating again.

599
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,486
Great.

600
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,910
Only about 50 more times to go.

601
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,478
Help! Help!

602
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:28,110
I've got this. You should go.

603
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,745
This is a two-person
job. You need the assist.

604
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,647
- Help! Help!
- We need some help.

605
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:33,982
You want me to
go? I can see if...

606
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,601
No. You're bagging him and
holding his head. You can't move.

607
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,758
Just go.

608
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,347
- I'll help.
- Help! Help him!

609
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:48,235
Sir, sir, is your
chest hurting you?

610
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,532
- Can't breathe.
- Yeah. Okay. Let's get him
into some space.

611
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,001
That's the guy with
pulmonary hypertension.

612
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,185
Okay. All right.

613
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,793
Lay him. Slow, slow, slow.

614
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,162
What's that mean?

615
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,042
It means the vessels around
his lungs are constricted.

616
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,994
He's basically
suffocating from the inside.

617
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,947
Yeah, I know, man. I
know. Just hang on there.

618
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,766
Okay, I need you
to, uh, get me the O2

619
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,569
and get on the speaker and ask if anybody
has some erectile dysfunction pills.

620
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,804
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'll open up his vessels.

621
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:15,111
- It could save his life. Go! Go!
- Okay!

622
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,828
Excuse me. Excuse me. Did
you say erectile dysfunction drugs?

623
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,198
Yes, ma'am. Hopefully
somebody on board has some.

624
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,420
Well...

625
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,640
Actually, we do.

626
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,577
Okay. Saline.

627
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,104
Hey, Dr. Riggs said you
might need some help.

628
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,839
Yeah. Grab some gloves.

629
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,332
Sit up and take this pill, okay?

630
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,023
Okay. I need you to
empty this into the bag.

631
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,605
Now I need you to
put the barrel back on

632
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,748
while I hold the needle steady,
okay? Work fast, but go slow.

633
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,350
Okay.

634
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,747
No, no, no.

635
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:13,971
It's okay.

636
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,066
Okay, no pulse. I need you to
get the defibrillator right now.

637
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,610
- You have to stop shaking.
- I know. I know. I'm trying.

638
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,961
I got it. Hold on.

639
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,086
- Deep breath, Ingrid.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

640
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,854
I can't make it stop.

641
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,701
- Stop it, hands.
- We are fine. Concentrate.

642
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,774
You got this.

643
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,832
Here.

644
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,667
Hook it up.

645
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,238
I'm on.

646
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,253
- V fib. Charging.
- Okay. Shock him.

647
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,375
Clear!

648
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,125
Still in V fib. Charging
again. Shock him.

649
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,382
Clear!

650
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:03,870
Breathe. You got it.

651
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,355
There you go.

652
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,460
Oh, thank God.

653
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,413
<i>Good news. I've confirmed
a safe location for us</i>

654
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,871
<i>to make an emergency landing. Please
be seated as we begin our descent.</i>

655
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,386
Now she's gonna
land the freakin' plane.

656
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,237
<i>Your seat belts are fastened.</i>

657
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,354
It's still in there?

658
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,536
- Did it move?
- Looks okay. It's okay.

659
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,811
<i>Flight attendants,
please prepare for landing.</i>

660
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,895
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't
tell you all to be seated right now.

661
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,154
I wouldn't be doing my job if I
listened, but you should do what's safe.

662
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,391
I'll take my chances.

663
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,546
Okay.

664
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,881
Come on! Come on!

665
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,787
I'm moving too much. I
need some extra hands.

666
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,600
- Nathan?
- What?

667
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,035
I could use your help.

668
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,059
Little busy.

669
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,922
Has he had a rhythm
since he arrested?

670
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,758
- Doesn't matter!
- It's irreversible brain damage

671
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,609
after six minutes. It
matters to this guy.

672
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,561
If I come up there,
I lose my guy!

673
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,463
If you stay there,
we lose two people!

674
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:28,838
No, we won't, all right? We're not
losing anybody. We're doing that, okay?

675
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,385
Okay.

676
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:33,309
This is... It's moving
too slowly. I... I need...

677
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,793
- You still have your keys
on you?
- Yeah.

678
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,150
I need them.

679
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,963
I need better blood flow
to relief this pressure faster.

680
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,198
If I can snip this needle
with your nail clippers

681
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,634
and put this straw
over the needle...

682
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:53,963
I'm doing this.

683
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:59,770
Keep him still,
completely... still.

684
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,125
Come on!

685
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,276
Sanitizer.

686
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:18,421
Okay.

687
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,379
Clip the hub of
the needle. Good.

688
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,599
Now clip the straw.

689
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,301
Phew.

690
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,924
Over the needle, into the skull.

691
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,443
Please fit. Please fit.

692
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,960
Please fit.

693
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:44,931
Okay, okay, I need
a cup. Give me a cup.

694
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,038
Okay, that was amazing.

695
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,953
The coolest stuff I see are
kindergartners with teeth growing

696
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:56,257
in behind their teeth.

697
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,333
Come on.

698
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,681
Pulse. Does that
mean he has a pulse?

699
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,072
I've got a pulse.

700
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,281
Welcome back, buddy.

701
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,407
<i>Blood. It's just blood.</i>

702
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,248
The ground, Mer!

703
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,392
We've landed.

704
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,863
We're on the ground.

705
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,035
Nice and easy, ready? Let's go.

706
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,783
Remember, he seized
from an epidural hematoma.

707
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,853
I wrote it all down and
taped it to his chest, okay?

708
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,677
Thank you for keeping him alive.

709
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Of course.

710
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,272
Doctor.

711
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,081
Captain.

712
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,525
Nice flying with you.

713
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:09,877
Thank you.

714
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,967
Thank you for fixing my wrist.

715
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,356
You know, should I call
you for a follow-up maybe?

716
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,260
Your regular doctor should be
able to take care of that pretty good.

717
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,010
You sure? 'Cause I fly in
and out of Seattle all the time.

718
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:35,594
It would be absolutely no trouble
to stop by and have you take a look.

719
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,737
It's not necessary.

720
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:41,809
Take care.

721
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,733
- We did it.
- We did.

722
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,018
- Still going to the conference?
- I think I've learned enough.

723
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,037
Mm.

724
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,077
Thanks.

725
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,292
I don't even know
what town we're in.

726
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,798
Sioux Falls, apparently.

727
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,152
Right.

728
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,169
Well, they got to
have a nice hotel.

729
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,085
Well, if it's not nice, it's
got to be halfway decent.

730
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,875
Look, we're stuck
here. We got to sleep.

731
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,323
But not together.

732
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,142
Oh, co... You just...

733
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,133
You just treated a bloke's
brain bleed with a cocktail straw.

734
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,663
You're so fearless
about so many things.

735
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,421
How the hell are
you still scared?

736
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,423
I'm not scared.

737
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,837
<i>One of the most unpredictable
things about encountering turbulence</i>

738
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,223
<i>is its aftermath.</i>

739
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:39,276
I'm making a choice. I'm
prioritizing my family, my sister.

740
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,961
Look, don't. Don't, please.

741
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,419
Don't pretend this is
still about Pierce. It's not.

742
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:46,589
- You're scared.
- Of what?

743
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:47,958
Of him.

744
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,126
Of letting him go.

745
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,157
<i>Where is Derek? Derek!</i>

746
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,761
<i>Everything's been
shaken up, undone,</i>

747
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,062
<i>turned on its head.</i>

748
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,636
At some point, you gotta let go.

749
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,599
I don't really wanna
talk about this.

750
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,769
Good. I don't want to talk.
I don't want to talk about it.

751
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:06,704
I don't want to talk at
all, okay? I just want to...

752
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,077
I want to move forward.

753
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,624
I want to live my life
'cause I'm still here.

754
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,615
I've still got one,
and so do you.

755
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,832
Don't look at me like that,

756
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,336
like I don't know what I'm talking
about, 'cause you know I do.

757
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,754
That could have been you
in that seat with no seat belt.

758
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,011
Yeah, but it wasn't.

759
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,480
Okay? I'm just fine.

760
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:30,900
And so are you.

761
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:37,534
<i>So, if you have the choice
to avoid the plane crash,</i>

762
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,826
<i>do you take it?
Do you play it safe?</i>

763
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,680
It better be a nice hotel.

764
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,242
<i>Or do you get on board</i>

765
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,478
<i>and take your chances?</i>

766
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,595
So, four star hotel? Five star? I
mean, how nice are we talking?

767
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,259
I'm not holding your hand.
