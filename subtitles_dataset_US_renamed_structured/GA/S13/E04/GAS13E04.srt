1
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,091
<i>The harder the hit,
the more it'll sting.</i>

2
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,059
<i>That's usually the case.</i>

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,928
<i>So we prescribe.</i>

4
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,921
<i>Meds, ice,
compression, elevation.</i>

5
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:26,225
<i>Things you do to stop
the immediate pain.</i>

6
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,322
You left early this morning.

7
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,357
Yeah, 'cause I love
it here so much.

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,259
I had to open,
plus it looks good.

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,078
- Is that what the lawyer said?
- Supposed to establish that

10
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,896
I'm a valuable member
of the community.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,566
You know, to counteract the
fact that I ruined DeLuca's face.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,751
I meet with them
today. Strategy session.

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,203
They say it's make or
break, whatever that means.

14
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,356
<i>But you can only dull
the pain for so long,</i>

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,547
<i>and when the drugs
start to wear off...</i>

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,661
<i>it really hurts.</i>

17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,296
Thank you for offering to help.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,381
I love you, and I feel for you.

19
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,990
Solidarity and all of
that, but this is scut.

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,405
Don't think for one
second you're getting points

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,840
for arriving before me.

22
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,275
Things you didn't
do yesterday...

23
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,893
refill the glove dispenser,

24
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,678
check the auxiliary
thermometer batteries,

25
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,519
- stock oral swabs.
- I'm out.

26
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,432
And what, you think
this is a place to...

27
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,167
to hang out with your friends?

28
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,969
You do realize we open in
20, so you gonna sit there

29
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,555
and admire me, or do
you want to get to work?

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,181
It's a big thing for
me not to know.

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,130
What is? Which one?

32
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,666
The church one...
that you go to church.

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,956
You go to AA.
That's a lot of praying.

34
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,120
What are we gonna
tell the children

35
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,172
about God and
the afterlife or...

36
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,596
Wait, the children?

37
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,259
- What children?
- Our children.

38
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:41,728
So we're having children now?

39
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:44,619
No! How can we have
children? I barely know you.

40
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,341
You know, I had a thought.

41
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,547
You and I should...

42
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,178
hang out together.

43
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,562
You know, somewhere
that isn't here.

44
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,085
Like, uh...

45
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,050
- A movie?
- No.

46
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,091
Maybe I could
just show up there,

47
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,804
and then you show up,

48
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,990
and hey, look,
we're hanging out.

49
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,246
I don't hang out.

50
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,865
You could.

51
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,096
Come on. We're in the clear.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,486
Pierce asked me out.
I let her down gently.

53
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,267
We could try.

54
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,468
There's no trying.

55
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,293
We are not that type of friends.

56
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,597
All right, well, what
type of friends are we?

57
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,199
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,257
It's progress.

59
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,562
Sorry I'm late. What do we have?

60
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,345
Jackson...

61
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,641
- Dr. Avery!
- Yeah, I'll get her.

62
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,351
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,287
Just, um, catching up.

64
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,505
Tough night with Harriet?

65
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,490
She got up like six times.

66
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,841
- Or maybe seven.
- Ohh.

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,011
Does it count if she wakes just
as we're putting her back down?

68
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,548
"We"? What, you and April?

69
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,667
No, you guys... You have
to switch off, take turns.

70
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,034
Yeah, I know. We are, totally.

71
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,653
I mean, kind of.

72
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,372
It's just, you know, she's
recovering from surgery,

73
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,707
so every time it's
her turn, I still get up

74
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,160
and see how she's doing,
which makes her feel guilty,

75
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,712
so then she tries to come
and help when it's my turn,

76
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,631
and I spend that entire
time trying to convince her

77
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:28,167
that she needs to get
rested up for... for her turn.

78
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,586
Which you then get up for, too.

79
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,437
It's not a perfect system.

80
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,623
But, I'm ready to
work, you know?

81
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,341
I'm just... I'm cranking
away right here.

82
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,611
Yeah, well, um, tell you
what. I'll take point on rounds

83
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,996
by way of the
coffee cart, and...

84
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,668
Or not. Got a trauma
on the helipad.

85
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,874
- You're on your own.
- Yeah, a couple minutes.

86
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,723
Hold that elevator.

87
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:52,430
Yep. Hey.

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,117
You look tired.

89
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,764
Well, I've been up a while
with Amelia talking and talking.

90
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,267
She's yours now. I'm
not taking her back.

91
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,553
I'm good. She's great.
We're... We're great.

92
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,140
You have the rest of
this elevator ride. Go.

93
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,192
You know, she gets
an idea into her head

94
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,343
and she just won't let it go.

95
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,162
She's relentless,
like a... like a shark.

96
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,014
- She just won't put it down.
- Two more floors.

97
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,614
And she asks me a
question and I answer it,

98
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,166
and my answer just
causes more questions,

99
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,320
and suddenly I've forgotten
what we're talking about

100
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,424
and I'm late for work.

101
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,239
And I love her,
and it's exhausting.

102
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,943
- Do you feel better?
- Yeah, a little bit.

103
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,378
Glider plane crashed
near Snoqualmie Falls.

104
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,330
Two passengers, both
conscious at the scene.

105
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,431
Is Polly behind
me? She's my wife.

106
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,384
Is she okay? I need
to see her. Please.

107
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,819
Polly Campbell, 33,
B.P.'s 90 over 40.

108
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,704
Blunt trauma to the
chest and abdomen.

109
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,040
Where's Daniel? Is he okay?

110
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,344
We've got him.

111
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,931
Timir, uh, I wanted
to ask a favor.

112
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,017
Look, I need to leave for
about an hour this afternoon,

113
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,568
but I can be back before close.

114
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,921
I know you consider
this grunt work, Dr. Karev.

115
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,307
It's a far cry from the hallowed
halls of the surgical floor.

116
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,641
I didn't say that.

117
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,810
And I'm sure you're not used
to taking orders from a nurse.

118
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,513
- No, it's fine. I just...
- Oh, is it fine?

119
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,564
Thank you.

120
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,899
This is second Thursday.
Vaccination day.

121
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,567
We're about to get flooded
by hundreds of patients

122
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,919
needing shots on
top of everyone else.

123
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,570
I wouldn't ask if it
wasn't important.

124
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,706
What's important
is our patients.

125
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,197
They can't be rescheduled
like elective surgeries.

126
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,195
They need you here and
so do I. The answer's no.

127
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,896
You figure out your life
on your own schedule.

128
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,299
Clinic's open.

129
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,323
Get the doors.

130
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,239
Pierce, you see this page?
Cardio consult in the pit.

131
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,441
Oh, well, if you're going...

132
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,708
You want to go?
I don't have to go.

133
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,326
No, you... you're already going.

134
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,012
- Why would I go?
- 'Cause you were going.

135
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,714
Well, I'm not,
though, if you are.

136
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,065
- So I'll go.
- And I will not go.

137
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,569
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

138
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,308
Okay...

139
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,705
- I - want to see my husband.

140
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,040
Try and hold still for me.

141
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,692
Is Daniel hurt? Can
you at least tell me that?

142
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,310
He's in the other room
getting checked out.

143
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,344
There's some fluid in the belly.

144
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:53,896
We're gonna need a
CT. To take a better look.

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,281
Was your husband
flying the glider?

146
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,133
It was his first time up
there without an instructor,

147
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,401
and he wanted me to go.

148
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,287
He worked so hard for this.

149
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:03,423
- SATs are dropping.
- She's gonna need a chest tube.

150
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,860
Please, please tell
me he'll be okay.

151
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:07,884
I got him, Polly,

152
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,112
but I need to make sure
you can breathe first, okay?

153
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,247
- Okay, how can I help?
- Lido.

154
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,882
Twenty-eight French,
and set up a pleurovac.

155
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,618
Still dropping.
SATs are down to 88.

156
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,053
I've got it. Will you move?

157
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,406
Polly, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,043
There you go.

159
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,497
- How is he? Superficial
facial lacerations.

160
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,249
But right leg, though.

161
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,752
I'm fine. Please,
go help my wife.

162
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,286
She's asking for you, too.

163
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,687
She's being treated
in the next room.

164
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,144
I'm telling you I'm fine.

165
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,867
I'm gonna need sandbags
and a spinal x-ray.

166
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,935
Okay.

167
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,086
I just want to see Polly.

168
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,188
Daniel, I'm gonna need
to get a spinal x-ray.

169
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,991
- I can't feel my legs.
- Okay, I don't want you
to be alarmed.

170
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,544
No, I mean I haven't
felt them for three years.

171
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,062
I'm paraplegic.

172
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,236
Oh. Well, okay.

173
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,650
Where's Daniel?
I want to see him!

174
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,701
Daniel!

175
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,053
- Owen, stop.
- Sweetie, you there?

176
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,121
Daniel?

177
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,706
I'm here! Are you okay?

178
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,407
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

179
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,992
- I'm all right.
- I'm okay, I think.

180
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,467
Polly, I wish I could see you.

181
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,436
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

182
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,706
Polly, I'm so sorry!

183
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,836
Polly?

184
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,494
I noticed it a couple weeks ago.

185
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,107
Now it smells kind of funny.

186
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,809
That is one infected abscess.

187
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,993
We're gonna have
to open that up.

188
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,664
What are you doing?

189
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,783
My patient needs an
I&D for his abscess.

190
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,751
Yeah, not by you. Page surgery.

191
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,219
I am surgery.

192
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,871
Not in here you're
not. You do not lance,

193
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,856
you do not drain,
you do not cut.

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,024
It'll take five minutes.

195
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,360
You are not authorized to
use a scalpel on anyone.

196
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,700
Page surgery.

197
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,787
I thought you said
you were a surgeon.

198
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,165
I wanted to let you know

199
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,385
that the internal reports
have been completed and filed.

200
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,903
Copies will be mailed to you,

201
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,272
and all your records
have gone to the D.A.

202
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,474
Okay. Thanks.

203
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,325
Uh, one more thing.

204
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,511
While the legal
proceedings are still ongoing,

205
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,531
you are not to
discuss this matter

206
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,166
within the walls
of this hospital.

207
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,218
Don't talk about it to anyone.

208
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,009
- Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.

209
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,507
You know, it won't be
hard not to talk about it

210
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,015
'cause no one talks to me
much now anyways, so...

211
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,334
You know, Dr. Avery's being
called in as an expert, I think.

212
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,753
DeLuca, what'd I just say?

213
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,277
Right. Don't talk to anyone.

214
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,046
Got it.

215
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,134
Pan scan with contrast, please.

216
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,767
How old was I when my dad died?

217
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,784
Sorry?

218
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,375
How old was I when my dad died?

219
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,138
- Five.
- I was five.

220
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,689
See, you knew that.

221
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:28,232
But your dad died, too, and
I have no idea when or how.

222
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,535
It hasn't come up.

223
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,082
Well, don't you
think it should have?

224
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,134
Or maybe we didn't
give it enough time to.

225
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,075
We gave ourselves a
two-week engagement.

226
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,171
I think we're okay.

227
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,374
I think I should know how old
you were when your father died.

228
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:42,908
- It's...
- Almost 10.

229
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,261
He knows?

230
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,338
Hey, sorry.

231
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,869
- What? It's not
a secret, is it?
- No.

232
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,203
- Was that a secret?
- No, no.

233
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,272
It's just she's
worried about stuff

234
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,941
she doesn't need
to be worried about.

235
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,694
Makes it a little more difficult
than it needs to be, right?

236
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,195
Yeah, it's worth it, though.

237
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,253
Definitely.

238
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,403
Scans up?

239
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:11,893
Nope. Just started.

240
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,327
You're back. I didn't
know you were here.

241
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,496
No, I'm not back.

242
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,889
I'm here early for my
appointment with Dr. Robbins.

243
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,619
Six hours early.

244
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:29,722
Baby's in the nursery,
so I'm here to finally sleep.

245
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,323
Dibs on the bottom bunk.

246
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:34,376
Don't you have a bed
of your own at home?

247
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,800
Not my home.

248
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,665
I can't day-nap there
'cause it's cleaning day,

249
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,852
and people are
vacuuming and polishing.

250
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,292
It would feel rude.

251
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,161
You're making very little sense.

252
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,742
You know that
thing they say about

253
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:52,350
how you're supposed to
sleep when the baby sleeps?

254
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,281
That's a lie!
Babies don't sleep.

255
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,983
- I'd like to sleep.
- At least my baby doesn't.

256
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,886
Except when she does
sleep, then I don't sleep.

257
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,537
- You know why?
- 'Cause you keep
talking to her.

258
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,924
Because I am a guest
in Jackson's house.

259
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:07,093
And Kepners are perfect guests,

260
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,515
and being a perfect guest...

261
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,235
is a hard job.

262
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,833
Listen, Dr. Kepner, I
empathize, I really do,

263
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:17,603
but I just spent 16 hours
straight removing a meningioma

264
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:21,807
and clipping something like a
million back-to-back aneurysms.

265
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:24,177
And I'm back on Dr. Shepherd's
service in a couple of hours,

266
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,545
so I need my sleep, too,

267
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,781
so I could go cut into
actual human brains, so...

268
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,284
You got to be kidding me.

269
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,076
Well, am I dying?

270
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,461
- No.
- Do I got the cancer?

271
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:45,081
Good news, Earl. Looks like
you just had beets for dinner.

272
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,232
You're having a natural
reaction called beeturia.

273
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,168
It's where the red pigment
of the beet passes through...

274
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,219
Which means you're fine.

275
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,355
Give this to the
desk on your way out.

276
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,273
This is a clinic, not a hotel.

277
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,497
Bed six... binge drinker.
Her name's Emma.

278
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,629
Frequent flier... in here
once a month. Good luck.

279
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,797
What's the protocol
for underage alcoholics?

280
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,482
Uh, like an adult.
You hydrate her,

281
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,167
give her the pamphlet,
then get her out.

282
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,358
We need the bed.

283
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:12,630
Finally.

284
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,677
Emma, right? How
you feeling today?

285
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,547
Oh, I'm feeling amazing.
I'm feeling perfect.

286
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,464
Got it all together.

287
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,349
I'm Kendall and Khloé and Kylie

288
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,834
and whatever other
"K" names you got.

289
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,203
Just give me an I.V.
bag, and I'll be on my way.

290
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,288
Headache, nausea,
chills, the spins...

291
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,324
- I.V. bag.
- All right, vitals first

292
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,892
then I decide what
to give you, okay?

293
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,128
Oh, ew... You're new.

294
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,364
Put the I.V. in the left arm.
It's where the good veins are.

295
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,249
Start with a liter of
saline and push it hard.

296
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,468
I'm dehydrated.
And do me a favor.

297
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,937
If you're an intern
or, like, dumb,

298
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,556
get help, because last time,
I was poked about 100 times

299
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,275
and my arm was purple for weeks.

300
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,060
That's good to know.

301
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:49,178
How are the scans?

302
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,163
Well, it looks like a
grade-3 splenic injury.

303
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,965
- How's the husband?
- He's worried about her.

304
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,250
I'm gonna take
her up for an ex lap.

305
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,069
For that? There's no reason.
There's no active bleeding.

306
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,270
Well, I thought
that, too, but look.

307
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,422
There's stranding and
fullness around the aorta.

308
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,573
If we go in for the spleen,

309
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,325
then we get to have a
better look when we're there.

310
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,711
Right, but there's no
clinical reason for surgery.

311
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,902
Well, there is if we find out
that her aorta is in trouble.

312
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,535
If. That's my point. We
should wait and see.

313
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,104
I can see what you mean,
Hunt, but Grey's right.

314
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,672
I mean, the patient is stable.

315
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,724
Observation just makes
more sense right now.

316
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,743
We do a repeat C.T.
angio in a few hours...

317
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,411
Waiting is definitely
the safer choice.

318
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,318
Well, I disagree.

319
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,391
Oh, so that's it, then?

320
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,943
Two against one? Fine.

321
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,924
She gets checks
every 30 minutes,

322
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,280
and I hope you're both right.

323
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,966
We make quite the team.

324
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,385
I don't need a team.
It's the right call.

325
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,369
This is the wrong call.

326
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,322
You got outvoted by
two smart surgeons.

327
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,763
It happens.

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,828
So, why did you join the army?

329
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:56,996
Okay, why are we doing this?

330
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,464
I feel like I'm in
a job interview.

331
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,183
There's just stuff I don't
know. I mean, it's scary.

332
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,135
We have our whole lives to...

333
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,438
And there's stuff that
you don't know about me.

334
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:07,045
And what if you don't like it?

335
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,107
What if it's too scary?

336
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,815
How bad could it be?

337
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,736
Hey, hey, really. How bad?

338
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,801
You know what?

339
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,825
Never mind.

340
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,126
It's fine.

341
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:33,182
When the trocar's
in the amniotic cavity,

342
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,501
that's when we use a
fetoscope. Hey, DeLuca.

343
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,805
Come here.

344
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,279
Freeze.

345
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,706
Tilt your head up.

346
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,380
Chin up. Turn.

347
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,777
Damn. It's beautiful.

348
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,561
You look nice today, too.

349
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,415
Avery did a really great job.
Nice symmetrical eye sockets.

350
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,183
Not even a hint of
residual bruising.

351
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,419
No scars. How are you feeling?

352
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,171
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

353
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,606
I keep missing you at home.

354
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,806
Avery give you a
clean bill of health?

355
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,074
Yeah, no, I'm good.

356
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,709
And the trial? Any
news of a court date?

357
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,863
- I can't really talk about it.
- You can't talk about it?

358
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,798
- We share a bathroom.
- With anyone.

359
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,072
Okay, it's the Chief's
orders. I'm sorry.

360
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,671
Bed six, Karev.

361
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,412
I have to check on this guy.

362
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,512
Okay, so I have two
more patients' parents

363
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,531
saying they'll be
character witnesses.

364
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,654
Yeah.

365
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,702
I'm trying to get
there. I'll be there.

366
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,059
I'll... I'll try.

367
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,621
Was that your lawyer?

368
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,506
Meeting's supposed to
be at 4:00 if I can get past

369
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,225
Timir the gatekeeper.

370
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,716
- You bring ketchup?
- Ugh, did you wash your hands?

371
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,867
- Why are we here?
- Oh, because Alex is here,

372
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:44,236
and we want to see
what Alex is up to.

373
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,789
Does Alex have something
he'd like to share with the group?

374
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,873
AA pamphlets?

375
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,658
They're for this
patient, this college kid.

376
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,260
- She's a mess.
- Literature is not
gonna do it.

377
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,562
When you're
addicted to something

378
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,965
and you want it so
badly, a piece of paper is...

379
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,049
It's not gonna
make her stay away.

380
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,534
What would make you stay away?

381
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,703
Say, if you were a
bartender and an alcoholic

382
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,605
and there's alcohol
in front of you

383
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,869
right under your
nose all the time.

384
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,909
Doing cardio surgeries.

385
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,228
Uh, count to five.

386
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:10,896
If that doesn't work,
get out of there,

387
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,282
remove yourself
from the situation.

388
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,257
So, on a scale
of lots to nothing,

389
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,287
how much would you say
you knew about my brother

390
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,938
when you guys got married?

391
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,173
I'm not getting in
the middle of that.

392
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,946
Why? Did Owen...

393
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,494
I knew Owen would
say something to you.

394
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,329
See? There's something
you know about him.

395
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,054
- Back to my patient.
- Your kid might need an ally.

396
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,568
Someone who's been there,
who can speak the language.

397
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,737
A pamphlet's not gonna
do it. Not that I am offering.

398
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,528
I have my own stuff going on.

399
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,878
Really? This is not
a cafeteria, Karev.

400
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,863
We've got two cases
of strep, your alcoholic.

401
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,232
Your foot guy still
needs his foot done.

402
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,273
- I paged surgery!
- You're in a room
full of surgeons.

403
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,938
One of you guys want to lance
a patient's foot abscess for me?

404
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,573
- Resident's job.
- I'm eating.

405
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,317
I would, but I don't want to.

406
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,851
Yeah. I'm gonna pay for that.

407
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,401
How much longer?

408
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,953
The I.V.'s still almost full,

409
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,497
and I don't have
time to sit here all day.

410
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,358
Hello? I have work.

411
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,075
- Call in sick.
- I can't call in.

412
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,234
Just tell me if I'm looking
at 20 minutes or an hour or...

413
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,033
Oh, my God, I'm
not an alcoholic!

414
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,719
They say you're in here
all the time asking for fluids.

415
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,055
Because I've figured out what
makes my body feel better.

416
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,840
Isn't that what
doctors should want?

417
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,613
I'm making your life easier.

418
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,982
Fine, forget it.

419
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,664
You know what?
You're full of crap.

420
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,599
- Excuse me?
- Look, I may be a doctor,

421
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,234
but that doesn't mean
I never partied before.

422
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,653
- I had one beer.
- Oh, come on.

423
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,854
You're a kid who routinely
comes in here for an I.V.

424
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:43,923
after a night of partying.

425
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,423
And you're an adult
who routinely uses

426
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:46,492
"party" as a verb.

427
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,444
- Emma, listen to me.
- You're not listening to me.

428
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,413
- Emma, you keep doing this and
an I.V. isn't your fix anymore.
- Oh, my God.

429
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,499
Because first it's drinking,
then someone gives you a pill.

430
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:54,850
Next, it's needles.

431
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,268
Before you know it,
you're out on the street

432
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,403
with all the other junkies.

433
00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:59,154
- Is that how
you want it to go?
- No!

434
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,889
On the side of the road
covered in your own puke?

435
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,262
Dr. Karev.

436
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,011
Now, that's enough.

437
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,746
- Okay, listen,
this girl's a drunk.
- No, I'm not!

438
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,487
Step away from that
young woman, right now.

439
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:23,361
That was good. It was
very good. Very convincing.

440
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,530
Yeah? I think I
was a little harsh.

441
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,099
It was just right.

442
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:30,819
You were a jerk. She and
I have a common enemy.

443
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,888
- How much time do I have?
- About half an hour.

444
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,224
- I slowed down her I.V. drip.
- Smart.

445
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,814
I'm going in.

446
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,535
Good luck.

447
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,058
Oh, sorry. I didn't
realize... um...

448
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,005
I'll just go to another room.

449
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,757
You don't have
to. I'm almost done.

450
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,263
Okay, great.

451
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,204
Four, five.

452
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,891
Five what?

453
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,910
More minutes.

454
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,023
Yeah. I'll...

455
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,959
You know what? I'll come back.

456
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,265
You don't have to.

457
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,180
So, Polly doesn't need surgery?

458
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,471
Right now, no.
It's a waiting game.

459
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,852
We would like to wait
and see if it resolves itself,

460
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,288
but she's stable and awake.

461
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:24,578
She'll hate this.

462
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,430
Waiting and seeing.

463
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,463
When I got hurt, we were
engaged, and I gave her an out.

464
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,537
I mean, it only seemed fair.

465
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,657
Her answer was to haul
the chaplain into my room.

466
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,271
We basically
eloped in a hospital.

467
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,628
Nothing gets to her.

468
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,441
I like her.

469
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,910
Except glider planes.
Those are my thing.

470
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,977
She thinks she hides it,

471
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,313
but I know she's not
wild about heights.

472
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,916
Oh, God. I hope she's okay.

473
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm gonna let her
know you're here, okay?

474
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,140
Hey, Polly. Someone's
here to see you.

475
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,697
I need some help in here!

476
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,482
What's happening to
her? Abdomen's rigid.

477
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,251
Belly's full of blood.
Hang two units.

478
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,670
I need a 7-0 E.T. tube
and an intubation tray.

479
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,389
Blood's on the
infuser. Coags sent.

480
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,040
Page Hunt and Riggs
and book an O.R. right now.

481
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,344
You said she was stable.

482
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,644
What the hell's going on?

483
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,896
Her spleen ruptured, and
now her aorta's dissecting.

484
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,331
Gown us. We
could've avoided this.

485
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:40,549
Yeah, well, this
shouldn't have happened.

486
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,067
It wouldn't if you two hadn't
teamed up against me,

487
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,068
if we hadn't waited!

488
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,636
Okay, listen, can we
do this another time,

489
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,154
because if we don't
get to this dissection,

490
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,289
it's gonna take
out her coronaries.

491
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,279
Let's get in here. I
need some hands.

492
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:56,848
I told that other doctor this
is just what my body does.

493
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,968
I have a beer or
I get dehydrated,

494
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,353
and I get sick.

495
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,889
I know how to fix
it. This is how I fix it.

496
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:05,079
I totally understand.

497
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,142
You know your own
body better than anyone.

498
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,460
Exactly! And I don't
need some idiot

499
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,595
telling me I have a
problem when I don't.

500
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,748
Okay, you know how to handle
it. You know your own limits.

501
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,366
It's doctors like him
that are the problem.

502
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,535
He thinks I'm some
crazy party girl.

503
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,154
I'm not an alcoholic.

504
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,772
You know, I used
to tell myself that.

505
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,496
Well, actually quite a bit.

506
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,944
We talked a lot
about that in AA.

507
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,318
AA?

508
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,531
Really? What is this?

509
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,384
Are you trying to play good cop,
bad cop with me or something?

510
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,802
Emma, no. All I'm trying to...

511
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,771
- I am not stupid and I won't
stick around for this. Emma,

512
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,055
what are you doing?

513
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,690
Emma, wait a minute.

514
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,442
What did you do?

515
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,110
I just barely touched her.

516
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,678
Emma... Emma, just calm down.

517
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,080
Don't touch me!

518
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,421
Just... Just let me fix it.

519
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:54,773
Oh, my God.

520
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:57,442
Oh, what on earth?

521
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,433
So... can I get out of here now?

522
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,367
Who is responsible for this?

523
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,602
Not the clinic.
It's Karev's fault.

524
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,870
He should've discharged her.

525
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,521
Dr. Karev works for the clinic.

526
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:12,674
Dr. Webber, did you injure
her? Because now it's a liability.

527
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,861
She appears fine. She needs
x-rays to rule out a fracture.

528
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,580
Well, she's back in bed
and not happy about it.

529
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,844
- I'll check on those x-rays.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:23,958
Actually, Chief, I
could use a little help.

531
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,238
I have a meeting with
my lawyer this afternoon,

532
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,689
and Timir won't let me out.

533
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,876
I have helped you. I got
you this job. I didn't have to.

534
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,844
What, you need me to
help you do that, too?

535
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:34,148
Figure it out.

536
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,806
Rush on these, please. Thanks.

537
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:45,629
So, Bailey told me, too, not
to say anything to anybody.

538
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,710
But, uh...

539
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,862
I don't have anyone else
who understands except you,

540
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:53,665
and I know that Bailey
said not to say anything,

541
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,384
- but it's like...
- Heads up.

542
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,502
- I...
- I'm gonna go...

543
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,542
Okay.

544
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,876
April grinds the coffee?

545
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,111
And brews it.

546
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,245
Every morning.

547
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,248
Yeah, I don't see the problem.

548
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:10,999
No matter how late
we are up with Harriet,

549
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,068
she wakes up before
me and makes the coffee.

550
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,537
No matter how badly I need
to leave and go to work or...

551
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,355
But you can't walk away
from a fresh pot of coffee.

552
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:18,974
And not feel like an ass, no.

553
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,027
So, I drink the coffee
and make the small talk

554
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,745
because that's what
people do, apparently,

555
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,097
but sometimes I don't
want to make the small talk.

556
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:26,365
What are you laughing at?

557
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,600
Nothing, man. I
just... I remember.

558
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,886
From when you stayed
with me and Miranda.

559
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,370
Yeah, but I wasn't that bad.

560
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,434
Dude.

561
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,462
I was?

562
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,527
No. You... You
should've said something.

563
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,562
Yes, and so should you.

564
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,863
Just talk to April.

565
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,004
Yeah, I... Okay,
you're right. I will.

566
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,518
It wasn't really that bad
with me, though, right?

567
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:47,869
It might've been
better if you'd have

568
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,813
brewed a brother a cup of
coffee every now and again, but...

569
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,025
I'm so tired.

570
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,811
But I go out of my way to make
coffee every morning to be nice.

571
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,446
So, sleep in. Don't make coffee.

572
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,065
Well, I have to do something.

573
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,950
I was taught to be
a courteous guest.

574
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,434
But you're not a guest.

575
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,487
You're a... You're
a co-habitant.

576
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,562
You're a roommate. He's
your... He's your Andrew.

577
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,359
He's not my Andrew, no.

578
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,764
He's my ex, and we live
together 'cause he's being nice,

579
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,983
so I need to be a good
houseguest even if it kills me,

580
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,236
which it might, unless I
die of lack of sleep first.

581
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,806
I can't handle dying, right now.

582
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,862
So, move out.

583
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,926
- What?
- Your incision is healed.

584
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,879
You can lift as much as you
want, so come back to work,

585
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,098
move out of the house, and
then do whatever you want.

586
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,138
Doctor's orders.

587
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,137
Not only do you get
dumped on me in my clinic,

588
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,089
but then you make
me look incompetent

589
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,291
in front of the Chief?

590
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,458
I didn't do anything.

591
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,427
You pulled a girl's
arm out of her socket.

592
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,896
Yeah, and I put it
back like I always do,

593
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,715
- so when can I go?
- You still need to get x-rays.

594
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,217
- And I didn't even touch her.
- You upset her.

595
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,385
You're the reason
she tried to leave.

596
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,136
Look, my shift
starts really soon.

597
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,006
You have no idea, but
my boss is the biggest jerk.

598
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,845
I have some idea.

599
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,943
All it takes is her
filing one complaint.

600
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,211
I know you don't care 'cause
you have a cushy job to go back to,

601
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,013
but this is my cushy job.

602
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,247
I don't need you
causing trouble.

603
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,738
You paged me?

604
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,076
Can you hear me, Karev?
Are you even paying attention?

605
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,541
I paged surgery. I need a
consult over an abscess.

606
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:17,647
Okay.

607
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,750
Bed two. Can you do it?

608
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,364
You paged me
here to do your scut?

609
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,499
No, no, that's not...

610
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,923
Then why else do you
need me to lance a boil?

611
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,804
Because I'm not allowed to.

612
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,355
Damn right, you
are not allowed to,

613
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:32,690
and... and you're not allowed
to go near that girl again either.

614
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,242
Okay, I don't want
you anywhere near her.

615
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,394
Screw it. Screw all this!
There are your patients.

616
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:38,699
There's your surgical consult.
I have someplace to be.

617
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,065
Hold on! Stop the bus!

618
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,298
I got your message.
What's so urgent?

619
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,382
Check it out.

620
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,867
So, you know how Emma
presented with a hangover

621
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:17,002
but insisted that wasn't it?

622
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,787
Yeah, even though
she was in the clinic

623
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,471
every couple weeks
for I.V. hydration?

624
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,457
And she said that thing with her
arms has happened to her before.

625
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,009
Well, what's this
have to do with me?

626
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,128
Well, just read the chart.
Look at her list of symptoms.

627
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,312
I mean, there's
something wrong with her,

628
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,013
but she's not an alcoholic.

629
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:32,935
Dehydration, bruises
easy, joint hyper mobility...

630
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,239
that's for sure.

631
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,909
Fainting spe...

632
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,841
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?

633
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,209
You're not as
strong as you think.

634
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,634
I only encountered a
couple cases in my career.

635
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:46,253
I mean, we'll have to
run tests to confirm it.

636
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:49,606
But if you're right
and she has this...

637
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,110
Karev, you may have
just saved this girl's life.

638
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,892
- Did you tell her?
- No, that's why I paged you.

639
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,960
You have to tell her, not me.

640
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,611
Look, if I give her
some big diagnosis,

641
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,846
I'm undermining
Timir's authority,

642
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,897
but if you tell her...

643
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,499
No, it doesn't seem right. No.

644
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,224
Look, she needs this way
more than I need a credit.

645
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:18,630
If we can't catheterize through
the inferior petrosal sinus,

646
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:20,798
will we go straight to the
superior ophthalmic vein

647
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,906
- or what? What?
- You...

648
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,737
had sickle cell anemia.

649
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,122
Oh, good. This.

650
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,908
Have? Had? Have had?

651
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:32,009
- Had.
- You had that.

652
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,712
I know that about you.

653
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,080
Nobody knows that
about you, but you told me,

654
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:38,083
trusted me with the information.

655
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:40,318
You let me know you.
I know that about you.

656
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,203
I know we are about to go treat

657
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,972
a dural carotid
cavernous fistula.

658
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,674
Owen could've had
it, too. I have no idea.

659
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,508
Unlikely for a
number of reasons.

660
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,827
But I know it about you,

661
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,863
just like I know that
you do not like dogs.

662
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,116
You don't ever go to church.
You do like mushrooms.

663
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,741
And I knew all of those
things before today.

664
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,105
I should've married you.

665
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,724
I'm not sure that would've
worked out for either of us.

666
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,628
That church one is just a guess.

667
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,482
Okay, wait. You're gonna
have to say that all again.

668
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:12,234
Ellie what-is-it syndrome?

669
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,051
Ehlers-Danlos.

670
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,810
It's extremely hard to diagnose,
but all your symptoms add up.

671
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,440
You did a great job

672
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,631
paying attention to
what your body needs.

673
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,313
This diagnosis is a
good thing, Emma.

674
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,365
We now know better
how to actually help you.

675
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:29,072
All this time...

676
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,971
So, this means it's real.

677
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,106
I'm not overreacting.
I'm not crazy.

678
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,463
Definitely not.

679
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:39,700
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

680
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:42,464
There's no way that
other asshat doctor

681
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,987
would've figured this out.

682
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,785
That's why the
clinic's here, Emma.

683
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,802
We're just happy to help.

684
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,254
Thank you.

685
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,020
While we were in there,

686
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,401
you had a sudden
dissection in your aorta,

687
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,985
which, well, I'm glad
we caught it in time.

688
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,789
- How you feeling?
- I don't know.

689
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,391
I... I guess, like...

690
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,645
like I fell out of the sky in a
plane I never wanted to be in.

691
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,497
- Don't tell Danny
I said that.
- No.

692
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,321
He'll feel so bad. I know him.

693
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,706
He's eating himself
alive over this.

694
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,709
- Can I see him?
- Yeah. I'll find him for you.

695
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,373
Oh, one more thing
that's kind of strange.

696
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,957
I can't feel my legs yet.

697
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:28,882
When is this anesthesia
gonna wear off?

698
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,067
What?

699
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,098
So, when the aorta dissected,

700
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:35,150
it compromised
the feeder vessels

701
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,841
to the spinal cord
right around L-4.

702
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,260
And it damaged the cord there.

703
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:43,958
So, she's paralyzed
from the waist down?

704
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,293
And it's irreversible.

705
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,557
If we'd been in there sooner...

706
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,463
- It wouldn't have made
a difference.
- Yes, if we had gone in...

707
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,597
Owen, it wouldn't
have made a difference!

708
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,182
It dissected right
in front of us!

709
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,034
I couldn't have foreseen
that and neither could you.

710
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,341
This happens.

711
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,159
It's happened to me before.

712
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,806
Okay? It's
unfortunate, but it does.

713
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,263
You couldn't have saved this.

714
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,085
I'll go tell her.

715
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,792
That's the truth, right?

716
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,337
What?

717
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,056
That we couldn't
have seen this coming.

718
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,192
- That's true?
- Why would you ask me that?

719
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,394
Because I need to make
sure that our decision to wait

720
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,417
didn't put this woman
in a wheelchair.

721
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,764
No, it didn't.

722
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,939
You didn't... side
with me because of...

723
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,370
you and I?

724
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,394
Excuse me?

725
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,641
Because we decided
to wait, this falls on us.

726
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,728
If you think I would play
around with a patient's well-being

727
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,246
in order to get into your pants?

728
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,464
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm asking a question.

729
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:41,966
It's a damned
offensive question!

730
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,753
Did we make the right
decision for the right reason?

731
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,772
I agreed with you
because you were right,

732
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:49,374
not because you were you.

733
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,058
Now, what happened to
Polly is not to your fault.

734
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,516
And it's certainly not
mine. I'm not that stupid!

735
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,218
You heading home?

736
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,553
I'm not sure I'm at liberty

737
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,677
to disclose that
information at this time.

738
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,274
Right.

739
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,492
Wouldn't be prudent
at this juncture.

740
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,494
Your whereabouts should
remain need-to-know.

741
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,584
Mmm.

742
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,981
Look, if you can't
talk to anyone

743
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,850
and I can't talk to anyone,

744
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,575
no one's gonna know if
we talk to each other, right?

745
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,010
True, yeah.

746
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,092
You hungry?

747
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,817
I better not say.

748
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,671
So, Dr. Hunt says
that she's still groggy

749
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:55,206
and trying to
process everything,

750
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,991
but she wants to see you.

751
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,532
I can't go in there.

752
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:01,162
I can't. I'm the one
who did this to her.

753
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,002
She's in the bed because of me.

754
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,316
I can't face her. I can't go in.

755
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,451
You have to.

756
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:08,520
You're the only one
she needs right now.

757
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:10,371
She was on the
plane because of me.

758
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,041
And now she's
off and she's alive.

759
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,431
Your wife is alive.

760
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:18,679
And if there's anyone who
could tell her this isn't the end,

761
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,798
that this isn't the worst
thing that could've happened,

762
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,100
it's you.

763
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,124
Because this isn't
the worst thing.

764
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,926
She's still breathing.

765
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,857
She needs you right now.

766
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:32,065
She needs you to be strong
and pull it together for her.

767
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,091
Daniel, she's ready for you.

768
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,388
But what... what do I say?

769
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,842
You guys love each other.
You can say anything.

770
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,259
- Shh, she's finally sleeping.
- Okay.

771
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,062
Shouldn't she be in
a crib or something?

772
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:23,044
You should be happy
she's sleeping at all.

773
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,585
Well, I mean, I was
hoping we could talk.

774
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,132
I just feel like if
I stop doing this,

775
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:29,351
she's, like, gonna wake up.

776
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,075
Okay. Totally fine.
It can wait. I'll just...

777
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,672
I'll go watch the
game in my room.

778
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,424
Did you want to
watch it in here,

779
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,075
'cause I can try to
move her into her crib.

780
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,661
No. It's totally
fine. Don't be silly.

781
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,329
There's plenty
of TVs. It's fine.

782
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,414
I mean, I'm aware, but
this one's the biggest.

783
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,401
- I said no. Thank you.
- Are you sure? 'Cause If you
want to watch the game, I can...

784
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:49,242
- April, I said no.
- Okay.

785
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,307
I can't keep doing
this, all right?

786
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,842
I can't keep walking
on egg shells

787
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,042
in my own house, all right?

788
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,795
We have to figure out a
way to freakin' exist together.

789
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,582
I'm sorry. You're
walking on egg shells?

790
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,116
What do you think
it's been like for me?

791
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,601
I don't know. I don't know.

792
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,570
I know this whole
thing is weird.

793
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,756
Yeah, it's weird, and... hard.

794
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,824
Agreed. It's
hard. I don't like it.

795
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,408
- I don't either.
- Well, what do you want to do?

796
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,792
I don't know. Move out, I guess.

797
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,755
What?

798
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:23,093
Well, Arizona says that I can.
I mean, I'm... I'm healed, so...

799
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,145
I will, like, I guess.

800
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,427
I mean, does that mean, like,
right away, or what do you...

801
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,083
As soon as makes sense.

802
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:33,681
Right.

803
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,705
Well, uh...

804
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,577
She just slept
right through that.

805
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,616
Yeah, she can be, um...

806
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,421
pretty quiet when
she wants to be.

807
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,316
I don't want you to move out.

808
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,003
I don't want to
move out, either.

809
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,658
I'm scared I may
never sleep again.

810
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,590
She's stronger than I
am. She could defeat me.

811
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,225
There's two of us. We
got her outnumbered.

812
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,052
You two are staying.

813
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:28,391
- Okay.
- Okay.

814
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:31,622
She's sleeping. Why
the hell aren't we?

815
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:32,690
I don't know.

816
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,692
I'm just gonna go set
up the coffee thing...

817
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,100
Please don't. Okay? It's
enough with the coffee.

818
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,813
- No?
- No.

819
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:39,837
Okay.

820
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:51,618
- Night.
- Night.

821
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,127
You know you can
tell me anything.

822
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:08,447
I know.

823
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:10,583
Okay.

824
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,203
Night.

825
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,149
There was this man I loved...

826
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,001
very much.

827
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,483
And we loved
taking drugs together,

828
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:35,141
and one night we took a lot.

829
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:41,209
And... the next
morning I woke up,

830
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,776
and he had O.D.'d

831
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,120
and aspirated
on his vomit and...

832
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,037
died.

833
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,947
I told you it's bad.

834
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,367
I once...

835
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,172
I once choked Cristina.

836
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,539
I didn't mean to,
but, I was asleep.

837
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,499
I had this ceiling fan.

838
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,319
And in my head,
the blades, it was...

839
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:40,473
In my head, it was a helicopter.

840
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,828
And I thought I was back there.

841
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,401
And I woke up, and
I was choking her.

842
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:10,636
We're okay, right?

843
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,277
We're okay.

844
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,465
And our kids will be okay?

845
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,670
Our kids will be amazing.

846
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,478
They will.

847
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,065
I can't wait.

848
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:47,056
So, let's not, then.

849
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,359
Let's not wait.

850
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,255
I can't do what
we did today again.

851
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,137
Okay.

852
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,844
I can't have another case

853
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,035
where I question my
medical decisions or yours.

854
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:35,866
I can't do my job

855
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,641
if I'm thinking about what
you're thinking about me.

856
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,770
So, you're thinking about me?

857
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,117
I don't want to be.

858
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,272
Let's just be colleagues.

859
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,470
Nothing more.

860
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,760
Colleagues?

861
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,229
Sounds stuffy.

862
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:01,814
It's not.

863
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,566
It's...

864
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,031
Colleagues are people who hang
out at work and talk about work.

865
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:08,132
Still sounds stuffy.

866
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,872
Well, it's what I'm offering.

867
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:14,040
I don't see why
we can't be friends.

868
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,995
Who can't be friends?

869
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,316
You and me.

870
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:25,421
I just feel like things
have been a bit strange.

871
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,918
Like I've made you feel
a little uncomfortable.

872
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,703
God, no. No, you didn't.

873
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,007
You di... It's fine.

874
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,758
Of course we can be
friends. We are friends.

875
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:36,302
All of us, right?
We're all friends.

876
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,884
Great, then.

877
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,318
- I should get going.
- Bye.

878
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,374
Night.

879
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,692
Thank you for talking to him.

880
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,061
- Yeah.
- It's awful, but it's...

881
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,153
It's good to have
it out on the table.

882
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,389
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

883
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>There's a reason these
fixes are called temporary.</i>

884
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,297
<i>They were never
meant to last forever.</i>

885
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,799
<i>So, what happens when
you're faced with a fix</i>

886
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,607
<i>that's more permanent?</i>

887
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,126
Hey.

888
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:21,405
You ready to go?

889
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,512
- Give me a minute.
- How was your meeting?

890
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,210
How do the lawyers
feel about your case?

891
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,595
<i>Do you fight it?
Do you try to resist?</i>

892
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,680
I'm going to jail.

893
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,499
God, Alex, don't say that.

894
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:32,755
Why not?

895
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,887
You're in an awfully good mood

896
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,231
for a guy who thinks
he's going to the slammer.

897
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,115
I caught a one-in-a-million
case today, Mer.

898
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:44,650
It wasn't so terrible.

899
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,898
<i>Or do you step back and decide</i>

900
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,767
<i>that maybe acceptance...</i>

901
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,201
I'm good.

902
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,505
Okay, let's go.

903
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:54,713
<i>Is the best fix of all?</i>
