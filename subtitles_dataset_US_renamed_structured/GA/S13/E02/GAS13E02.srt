1
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,460
<i>As surgeons, we are
our brother's keepers.</i>

2
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,747
<i>Ride or die. Womb to tomb.</i>

3
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,511
<i>We see each other's fears. We see
the white-knuckled panic of failure.</i>

4
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,134
<i>We see ourselves.</i>

5
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,769
<i>And who the hell
likes looking at that?</i>

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,707
Alex, we should... get
going. That's the wrong tie.

7
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,608
Well, it's not gonna matter
what tie I'm wearing when...

8
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,427
Did I tell you I have
a thymectomy today?

9
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,162
Patient has myasthenia
without a thymoma.

10
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,782
So, I'm thinking I can get
away with a partial sternotomy.

11
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,151
So, we're avoiding what's
actually gonna happen today.

12
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,909
We're discussing medicine.
We're doing our rounds.

13
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,113
Surgery and work. That's what's
going to get us through today.

14
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,215
I don't spy on my co-workers.

15
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,584
I'm not asking you
to spy on co-workers!

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,586
No, you're asking
me to be your mole.

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,772
I'm asking you to
keep this hospital safe.

18
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,975
This Karev-DeLuca
thing is a mess.

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,177
I have an attending who
posted bail for another attending,

20
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,214
an intern pressing charges,
people are taking sides.

21
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:31,117
I'm trying to hold this down, but I
need someone to be my eyes and ears.

22
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,103
Baby, baby, I am just starting
to get my reputation back.

23
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,294
- Just my eyes and ears.
- No!

24
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,291
When Webber was chief,
I was his eyes and ears.

25
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:43,113
Okay, but Chief, Chief. You
can have my whole body.

26
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,365
- Don't be nasty.
- But not my eyes and ears.

27
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,455
I'm not your mole.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,338
You're right.

29
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,929
I know. What am I
right about this time?

30
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,143
You need eyes and
ears. I can be your mole.

31
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,513
Won't work. People shut
up when you're around.

32
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,049
If they know I'm around, okay.

33
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:05,652
Have you heard of
Hercules Mulligan?

34
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:08,504
He was a great Revolutionary
War spy, helped defeat the British.

35
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,107
No one saw him coming or going.

36
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:14,666
I know who Hercules Mulligan
was, and you're no Hercul...

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,919
Well, damn.

38
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,399
<i>Dr. Neil...</i>

39
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,874
he's fine. I just
want to make sure...

40
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,159
Hey! I thought you had
Alex's thing this morning.

41
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,078
Ahh, we do. We are keeping
our heads up. We are working.

42
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:34,147
- It happened again last night.
- Again?

43
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,117
Riggs walked me to my
car and we said good night,

44
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,575
and then he took
me in the parking lot...

45
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,944
over and over again.

46
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,692
That's the third time this week.

47
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,183
Mer, these dreams
are really hot.

48
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,597
In the parking lot? No.

49
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:53,032
- I should ask him out.
Here you go, Doctor.

50
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,400
- Thanks.
- I know. I'm his boss.

51
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,768
What if I ask him
and he says no,

52
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,770
or comes off like some
gross sexual harassment?

53
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,440
Which is the only kind
of sexual harassment.

54
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,258
But what if I don't ask him?

55
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,977
Am I just gonna wait
around for my life to happen?

56
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,981
Just wait for my big
love? You've had yours.

57
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,533
Amelia has hers. I want mine.

58
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,660
So I am acting like a grown-ass
woman and I am asking him out?

59
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,764
- Was that a question mark?
- No.

60
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,067
Unless you think that it
should be a question mark.

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,272
This is happening. I'm doing
this. This is definitely happening.

62
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,409
Good talk.

63
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,440
And the wedding photographer
wants us to pick our favorites.

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,376
From five hundred
proofs? We have jobs.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,030
- We are very, very busy.
- So busy, all the time.

66
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,632
Oh.

67
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,267
Hey. Morning. Morning, Riggs.

68
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,143
Hey, guys. I almost forgot. You
want me to bring anything tonight?

69
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,829
I make a whitebait fritter
that's out of this world.

70
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,864
- You invited Riggs to our house?
- Well, we have a new home!

71
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:01,751
We're supposed to have friends
and family over to warm it up. Right?

72
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,003
Hey, this is a housewarming?
Who else did you invite?

73
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:07,607
You two were so happy at the
wedding and you were so close once.

74
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,009
That was a long time ago. You
should have checked with me first.

75
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,699
Sorry. You're right. I meant to.

76
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,515
You were never gonna
check with me, were you?

77
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,259
- Probably not.
- Hmm.

78
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,620
- Dr. Shepherd. How's it going?
- I suck at marriage.

79
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:24,830
I'm sorry. I need a favor. Can you
take Wilson on your service today?

80
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,611
No, I have Warren. And he's
already familiar with my Wilma case.

81
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,000
You know how
gnarly she's gonna be.

82
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,814
But if you put Wilson on your service,
she doesn't have to work with Karev.

83
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,816
I see you've picked a side.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,270
I'm on the side of we all want
to punch interns, but we resist.

85
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,189
So Wilson gets neuro. What do
you get out of it? A surgery? What?

86
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,865
Nothing. Just trying to be a
good friend. That's all. Please.

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,747
- I'll take Wilson.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:53,403
Oh, and can you take pictures
of Wilma? I want neuro porn.

89
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:58,174
<i>Dr. Horowitz...</i>

90
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,310
Dr. Karev, this is
Zach Thompson.

91
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,179
Six months post-renal transplant,
complaining of abdominal pain.

92
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,880
I know the history.

93
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,833
- Dr. Alex.
- Hey, buddy.

94
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,686
Hey, Reena. Didn't want
to see you guys here again.

95
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,108
Yeah.

96
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,874
- When did the pain start?
- This morning.

97
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,894
It came on kind of
gradually. I got scared.

98
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,997
His kidney is so
new, and I worry.

99
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,514
- Ow!
- Sorry, bud.

100
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,288
No, I'm fine.

101
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,669
Don't make me
give my kidney back.

102
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,622
Look, I'm gonna
have to run a few tests,

103
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,162
and I need you to be brave.

104
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,576
But remember what we say?

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,295
No matter how bad it
gets, no matter how scary...

106
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,237
- Nothing's as bad as broccoli.
- Nothing's as bad as broccoli.

107
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,787
Here's our girl!

108
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,255
Hi, sweetie! Gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme.

109
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,725
Harriet is gaining
weight right on schedule.

110
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,066
- She's healthy and fat.
- Fat baby.

111
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,679
Fat baby. And healthy
enough to go home today.

112
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:54,719
Yeah?

113
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,649
Are you sure she's ready?

114
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,034
What about her
respirations? I thought I saw...

115
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,941
Kepner, you can
take your kid home.

116
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,144
Yeah, I know.

117
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,866
- Look, I gotta go.
- Oh, that's today.

118
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,603
- Congrats on the fat baby.
- Okay. Yeah, thanks.

119
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:17,170
- Why the face? This is a good thing.
- Not for me.

120
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:19,305
- Babe...
- My incision opened back up.

121
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,247
They want to do wound therapy.

122
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,751
Harriet's going
home. But I'm not.

123
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,371
So... they're just
charging you today. I know.

124
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,889
It'll probably be a
misdemeanor with probation.

125
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,508
I know, Mer.

126
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,126
Is the State ready to charge?

127
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,718
We are, Your Honor. We're seeking
felony assault in the second degree.

128
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,950
- Felony? This must be a mistake.
- It's not, Your Honor.

129
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,169
- What the hell? I thought...
- The State is pulling this

130
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,571
- at the last minute.
- It's prosecutorial discretion.

131
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,891
- It's overreaching.
- It's not, Your Honor.

132
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,026
- This is
a misdemeanor case.
- Tell that to the victim,

133
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,745
seated here in the courtroom.
A first-year surgical intern

134
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,915
who almost lost his
career when the defendant,

135
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,974
his professional superior, his
teacher, was unable to mask his rage.

136
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,977
This act was a felony.

137
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:13,626
The State and Dr. DeLuca
want appropriate justice here.

138
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,962
You want to argue
this now? Fine.

139
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,698
The defendant is a pediatric
surgeon with no priors. He...

140
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,851
We're not at trial. We're here
to enter a plea to the charge

141
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,987
and the charge is felony
assault in the second degree.

142
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,728
How do you plead, Dr. Karev?

143
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,843
How do you plead, Dr. Karev?

144
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,747
You have to answer.

145
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,900
Not guilty.

146
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,527
- It's just a charge.
- Yeah, a felony charge.

147
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,174
But you haven't been
convicted of anything. Alex...

148
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,824
Every single one.

149
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,294
Every guy I grew up with
Is either where I left them,

150
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,984
dead or in prison.

151
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,350
I thought I was special
'cause I went to med school.

152
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,302
Guess you can't
wash the stink off trash.

153
00:07:56,326 --> 00:08:00,572
You're not trash. You're a surgeon.
And you are not going to prison.

154
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,798
- You don't know that.
- You are not going to prison.

155
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,970
Do you know the charge?

156
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,099
Yes.

157
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,505
The DA subpoenaed DeLuca's
medical records and your personnel file.

158
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,228
- What now?
- What now?

159
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,709
What now?

160
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,472
People come to this hospital
so that we can help them.

161
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,809
Do you know how many problems
I have to deal with already?

162
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,640
Who gets the expensive,
experimental drug,

163
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,761
whose body deserves
the organ transplant,

164
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,180
which parent is
ready to hear that,

165
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:18,067
yes, your toddler is
dead, but here is a bill

166
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,652
for a quarter million
dollars anyway.

167
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,605
Problems! Real problems, Karev!

168
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,464
Yet, somehow, you are
now problem number one.

169
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:32,615
A pediatric surgeon walking around
this hospital with an assault charge.

170
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,923
Do you realize what happens
if you're convicted of a felony?

171
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,844
Yes, Dr. Bailey. I realize.

172
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:46,829
Do you have a decent
lawyer? Do you need help or...

173
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,169
Are we done?

174
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,402
DeLuca's starting back today.
Is there gonna be a problem?

175
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,592
Not from me.

176
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,609
Then we're done.

177
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,182
When you get home

178
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,069
just put her in the little yellow
onesie with the frogs on it.

179
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:13,322
That was her... "going home
from the hospital onesie".

180
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,229
I know. I'll take pictures.

181
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,836
- Hey.
- She's going home without me.

182
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,189
Yeah. And what did
we just say about that?

183
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,521
The important thing is that
she's healthy and I'm healthy.

184
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,577
Exactly.

185
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:33,592
Is crap! She's
supposed to be with me.

186
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,328
Bonding and
attaching or whatever.

187
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,947
Smelling me like birds and dogs.

188
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,284
- Birds and dogs?
- Shut up. It's nature.

189
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,177
How is she gonna attach to me
when she's there and I'm here?

190
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,302
- You're gonna be
discharged soon.
- And then what?

191
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,043
I'm still gonna be in recovery.

192
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,246
You know the ins and
outs of post-op incisions.

193
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,331
I'm not even gonna
be able to pick her up...

194
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:01,087
Without help. I'm gonna have to hire
someone to come and take care of her.

195
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:05,057
Some... mama bird
who smells good

196
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,300
and bonds with my baby
while I just lie there and watch.

197
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,880
You know what? You should go.

198
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,898
I'm not going anywhere
when you're this upset.

199
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,484
You have to because
I'm not gonna stop.

200
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,002
I'm just gonna
die of dehydration.

201
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,204
- It's gonna be all right, you know.
- - Get out!

202
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:20,562
Okay.

203
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,452
Dr. Karev, I've got Zach's labs.

204
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,943
His CRP is a little
elevated, but...

205
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,324
- Dr. Karev?
- What?

206
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,392
Just didn't know
if you heard me.

207
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,578
Just tell me what the CT showed.

208
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,796
Well, his kidney looks good.

209
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,731
But he's showing
signs of appendicitis.

210
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,483
What?

211
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,368
Appendicitis? So he
needs another surgery?

212
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,836
I want to avoid that.

213
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,172
The immunosuppressants he's
on because of the transplant,

214
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,356
put him at greater risk
for post-op infections.

215
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,460
I want to start him on
broad spectrum antibiotics,

216
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,733
- see if it clears up on its own.
- Okay.

217
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,553
I'll be by to check
on him every hour.

218
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,049
- Thank you.
- Which means you and I
are gonna be

219
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:05,568
here hanging out all day.

220
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,021
I bet I can score a video
game for your room. Deal?

221
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,125
Deal.

222
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,435
So, how's Alex holding up?

223
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,800
He's working. I'm working.
We're focused on medicine.

224
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:25,626
Right. Yes. Good. We should
all... focus on medicine. Lap pads.

225
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,858
Just... How should I ask
Riggs out? Is there a way to do it

226
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,944
so that the boss
thing isn't a thing?

227
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,036
Oh, you actually meant that.
You're gonna ask Riggs out?

228
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,617
Grey, what are
you doing tonight?

229
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:40,570
- Nothing.
- Amelia invited Riggs to dinner

230
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,089
at our house. She's trying to
make us, I don't know, friends again.

231
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,842
I need you to come over and
talk to him so I don't have to.

232
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,049
I'm busy.

233
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,997
Come on. You guys
got along at the wedding.

234
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,100
- It was a wedding. I had tequila.
- You need a buffer?

235
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:55,384
I can. I'm a great buffer.

236
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,309
- You're free?
- Tonight's perfect. What time?

237
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,245
- Eight-ish?
- Awesome, I'll be there.

238
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:05,110
- We'll see you at eight.
- Yeah.

239
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:08,369
- Hey, you changed your mind.
- If you're going, I'll go.

240
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,669
Dr. Shepherd. I just want to say

241
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,488
thank you for letting
me work on service.

242
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:17,707
- I know that you...
- Stop thanking. We got work to do.

243
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,008
- Wilma is waiting.
- Wilma?

244
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,479
- Nasty, annoying Wilma.
- It says
here Patricia.

245
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,471
- Hello. So, how we doing?
- I'm fine.

246
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:30,102
- It's not Wilma.
- So, you know the drill.

247
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:33,089
We are going to draw a few
more labs, do a pre-op CT,

248
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,492
- and tomorrow,
it is all about Wilma.
- Patricia. Patricia.

249
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,994
Oh, she's talking
about the tumor, dear.

250
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,719
I'm Patricia. The
tumor is Wilma.

251
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,734
She named her tumor after
her ex-husband's mistress.

252
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,988
Wilma, because they're both
parasitic mounds of unwanted flesh.

253
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,391
And tomorrow, we
are kicking Wilma's ass.

254
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,114
Yeah, that bitch is going down.

255
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,016
Wilson, meet Wilma.

256
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,001
Tomorrow, we beat
the crap out of this bitch.

257
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,523
Come on. Show some enthusiasm.

258
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,493
I'm enthusiastic. It's just that the
tumor is a woman named Wilma.

259
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,997
- So?
- And you're excited to kick

260
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,283
Wilma's ass and beat
the crap out of Wilma.

261
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:19,435
And it's cute when it's
the name of a tumor.

262
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,437
It's that when it's the
name of a woman, if...

263
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,576
It's what?

264
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,947
It's nothing. It's nothing.

265
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,861
The Karev thing. I'm an idiot.

266
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,964
Here I am, saying
all these violent things

267
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,521
- after what you've been through.
- What I've been through?

268
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,802
Witnessing Karev attack DeLuca.

269
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:38,688
I'm sorry. I'm bringing
up bad memories.

270
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,173
You must think I
am the worst person.

271
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,392
It's... It's okay. I'm fine.

272
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,576
Are you?

273
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,736
I... don't have
any place to live.

274
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,901
And the entire hospital
won't stop whispering

275
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,386
about the scarlet
letter on my chest.

276
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,923
So it just feels like I'm
trapped in a glass box

277
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:01,176
and everyone's on the outside
watching while I run out of air.

278
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,502
But, yeah, it's... I'm great.

279
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,790
Okay... I'm having a housewarming
party, and you are coming.

280
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,859
You need a break from your life.

281
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:17,031
Alex will not be there. I just
picked a side, and I'm on yours.

282
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,869
- It's been quite a day.
- Dr. Webber!

283
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:31,290
There have been rumblings
about some sort of turf war

284
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:34,832
over who gets control of Dr. Torres'
ortho lab now that she's gone.

285
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,219
Oh, and, the doctors at the
Duquette Clinic, they feel overworked.

286
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,657
At the clinic? That's not news.

287
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,641
You know what's news?
Karev was charged with a felony.

288
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,048
Hm... I did not hear that.

289
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,595
First day back?

290
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:11,702
Mm-hmm.

291
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,822
- How is it?
- It's fine.

292
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,088
DeLuca, I know I don't
know you very well,

293
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,762
but you know I was attacked.

294
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,365
I remember.

295
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,723
I didn't want to forgive
the guy who attacked me.

296
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,537
But I did because I needed to.

297
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,289
The guy who attacked
you was in a fugue state.

298
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,657
Dr. Karev knew
what he was doing.

299
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:41,393
Have you ever made a horrible
mistake because you overreacted

300
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,068
or you just... had the
wrong information?

301
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:49,101
Dr. Karev is genuinely sorry
and would like to tell you himself.

302
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,142
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm not ready for that.

303
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,954
Okay.

304
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,710
Just, you are an intern, and...

305
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,246
you shouldn't be spending
your time in a courtroom.

306
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,348
You should be
scrubbing in on surgeries.

307
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:06,502
This job is hard enough. You just
don't need to make it any harder.

308
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,736
Look, we shouldn't
talk about the case.

309
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,343
Okay, okay. I'm...

310
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,594
Look, I know you can
keep me out of the OR,

311
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,163
you can end my career, you
can ruin my life if you want to.

312
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,849
- I'm not trying
to ruin your life.
- You don't get to.

313
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,202
You think because you're an
attending and Dr. Karev's an attending,

314
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,691
you can threaten me?

315
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,661
I don't care. It's
not gonna work.

316
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,841
Okay, so, this is bad.

317
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,065
Well, save it,
'cause I don't need it.

318
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,880
I think I might have
just threatened DeLuca.

319
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,069
What? What?

320
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,217
- I was trying to help.
- What?

321
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,887
- I didn't mean it.
- What did you... Why would you...

322
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,872
- What exactly did you say?
- He twisted my words.

323
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:04,059
I just got charged with a
felony today. This is my life, Mer.

324
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,763
Dr. Karev. I was just looking at
Zach's latest absolute neutrophil count...

325
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,481
I saw it. It's fine.

326
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,267
- His heart rate's inching up...
- I've had him for three years.

327
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,854
His heart rate rises every time
he comes here. He's a nervous kid.

328
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:17,005
- But this looks...
- I looked at it! I saw the labs!

329
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,477
- I did my job, now do yours.
- I'll keep you posted.

330
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,016
Crap. You think DeLuca's
gonna say anything?

331
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,733
- I don't know.
- Yeah, he will.

332
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:32,171
Or he won't. We
can't control it.

333
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,823
All we can do is just
go on, live our lives,

334
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,711
be there for our patients and our
friends, and go to dinner parties.

335
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:42,731
- I'm not going to a party.
- You have to go
because I have to go.

336
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,168
If I can go to court for you, you
can go to a dinner party for me.

337
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,458
Eight 'o clock.

338
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,669
Sorry! I had an aortic
valvuloplasty and I...

339
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,573
Wilson! I mean... Hi, Wilson.

340
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,355
I should have warned
you this is casual.

341
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,173
What? I'm casual.

342
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,025
I'm casual. You look hot.

343
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,582
- No. I look hot?
- Your butt looks like an apple.

344
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,730
Hey! Pierce,
when'd you get here?

345
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,467
Okay, I'm tagging you in.
Riggs is right over there.

346
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,452
She's your buffer? No,
Maggie, you are not tagged in.

347
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:21,786
I am tagging her in.

348
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,338
That defeats the
point of all this.

349
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,908
- I didn't agree to all of this!
- No, tag me in. It's fine.

350
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,928
- You're starting a thing here.
- No, it's okay. All good.

351
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,729
You're not even
giving it a chance!

352
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,383
Guys, I'll tag myself in. You
obviously need to talk about this.

353
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,717
And I am right behind you.

354
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,925
- No, you don't have to...
- I don't mind.

355
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,307
<i>You're still crying?</i>

356
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,859
Of course I'm still crying.

357
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,577
<i>April, come on, okay?</i>

358
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,880
<i>I'm gonna bring her by every
single day at the hospital.</i>

359
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,398
We already talked about it.

360
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,834
Soon as you get home,
we'll fly your mom back out,

361
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,451
get her to stay for
a couple months.

362
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,721
My mom already came for
as long as she could, okay?

363
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:58,963
I can't ask her to come
back. She's... She's got work.

364
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,344
I'll get a baby nurse who can
stay, who can live with you then.

365
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,386
- I can't afford that.
<i>- I'm loaded. I can.</i>

366
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,635
Well, I'm not. And
we're not married.

367
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,058
Yes, I know.

368
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,855
<i>You can't fix this, okay?</i>

369
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,709
I have to figure this
out. I am a single mom...

370
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:20,112
April, I'm her
father. I'm right here.

371
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:24,633
As long as Harriet is fed
and sleeping and happy,

372
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,408
you're doing your job. You don't
need to, like, check in on me, okay?

373
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,389
<i>Or call unless Harriet
needs me, okay?</i>

374
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,908
So I'm just supposed
to let you cry, then?

375
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,333
Yes! Good night, Jackson.

376
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,537
You're here. Good.

377
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:48,028
For a while, He's been with
Maggie but you're up next.

378
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:50,008
I have not put my bag down yet.

379
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,727
If you don't get in there, Amelia's
gonna make me talk to him,

380
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,912
and we're gonna fight.

381
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,698
You've been married
for, like, two minutes.

382
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,955
- Right, so just get in there!
- Fine, fine!

383
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,360
Hey, hey!

384
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,778
- Hey.
- Hey!

385
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:08,143
Have you had the tour
yet? Owen gives a great tour.

386
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,511
Yeah, I helped him move in.

387
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,313
We painted the
bedroom since then, so...

388
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,948
Okay. Nathan, you want to...

389
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:17,691
I need to talk to Dr. Riggs about
Mrs. Peterkin. She relapsed.

390
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:22,613
Great. So it's just us, then.
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

391
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,964
- Who's Mrs... Peterkin?
- There is no Mrs. Peterkin.

392
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,388
- You just...
- Maggie is going
to ask you out.

393
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,158
- On a date.
- Oh, so...

394
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:38,223
- Maggie wants me?
- She wants to date you.

395
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:41,043
And you are going
to be nice and say no.

396
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,628
Oh, so she doesn't know that
you're madly in love with me.

397
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:46,197
- I am not madly in love
with you.
- You're close. You will be.

398
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,516
I am close to hating you.

399
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,901
Really? Then we should
just end this, right now.

400
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,353
Let's just make
out on the couch.

401
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,944
Sends a clear message,
then everyone knows.

402
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,275
Oh, hmm, you're considering it.

403
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:59,066
- You're disgusting.
- And yet you're falling for me.

404
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,736
Shut up. You are
going to say no.

405
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,083
You are going to be very nice...

406
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,007
but you are going to say no.

407
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,726
Got it?

408
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,727
Okay.

409
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,554
- Hey, you're here.
- Yeah. I don't know why I came.

410
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,468
He was charged with a
felony. I don't know if you know.

411
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,626
I know. I was there.

412
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:32,194
I don't know what's going
on with you guys, but he's...

413
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,080
Alex is in a really bad place.
Maybe you could talk to him.

414
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,398
Why are you telling me this?

415
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:39,834
I'm telling you this because
you said you showed up in court.

416
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,775
- I thought you care.
- I do care.

417
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,489
Okay, so, then talk to him.

418
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:47,175
I care about what
Alex did to Andrew.

419
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,432
That's what I care about.

420
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:57,108
Owen says they get
great morning light.

421
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,522
- Light is good.
- Yeah,

422
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,824
- I was thinking, do you wanna...
- No, we shouldn't.

423
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,742
Double team on that
transplant tomorrow?

424
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,645
- It should be fun.
- Oh, yeah, okay!

425
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,114
- We should do that.
- Okay, definitely.

426
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,122
And then maybe
after that, we could...

427
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,153
finish up my resident
competency reports.

428
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,806
- I'm... I'm way behind.
- Yeah! Okay.

429
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,075
Excellent, definitely.
I can do that, too.

430
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,082
- Great, sounds good.
- No problem.

431
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,653
I'm gonna go help
Amelia. She can't cook.

432
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,327
- Hey.
- Hey.

433
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,706
- Mommy, I'm scared.
- I know, baby.

434
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,040
What's going on?

435
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,859
His pressure's dropped.
Getting central access.

436
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,812
All right, get
me an art line kit.

437
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,347
- Honey...
- Mrs. Thompson,
please step back.

438
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,867
I'm sorry. He doesn't know
you guys. He needs Dr. Karev.

439
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:03,619
Where's Dr. Karev?

440
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,960
Yes, can we find out
where Dr. Karev is, please?

441
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,624
- Hey.
- Hey.

442
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:24,228
Uh...

443
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:28,199
You're... I didn't
know you'd be here.

444
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:32,569
How are you?

445
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,855
I don't know how to answer that.

446
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,594
I'm leaving, so you can go in.

447
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:46,100
Jo... I don't want
to go in there.

448
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,214
I want to be home with you. I
messed that up, and I know that,

449
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,699
- and I'm sorry.
- You can't just say that.

450
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,451
I mean it, and I'm
gonna keep saying it.

451
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:56,087
It doesn't fix anything.
Sorry doesn't fix...

452
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:59,641
- What do you want me to say?
- You lash out and hurt people,

453
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,177
and then you think you can
just walk it back with "I'm sorry."

454
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:05,052
I'm not walking anything
back. I might be going to prison.

455
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:09,184
- But you and me...
- You and me? What you and me?

456
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,353
You walked out. You left.

457
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,194
- And I came back.
- And then you called me trash.

458
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:18,048
And you just...
You said it so easily.

459
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,784
You were trying to hurt me.

460
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,254
It worked.

461
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:28,920
Jo!

462
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,153
- I got your page.
- Took you long enough.

463
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,938
- What happened?
- His appendix ruptured. He's septic.

464
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,809
All right, gown and gloves.

465
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,511
No need. Dr. Karev
will not be scrubbing in.

466
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:56,147
You're not touching
this boy. Babcock.

467
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,483
- Bailey, this is my patient.
- Not anymore.

468
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:01,174
You're off this case. Stapler.

469
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:20,138
This is just painful to
watch. Owen, can I see you?

470
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,311
Sure.

471
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,311
- You're off the hook.
- I told you.

472
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,645
I don't know why
you feel you need to...

473
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,798
I'm a fixer! I fix things.

474
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,384
I see something sad and broken,

475
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,652
maybe just a little
pathetic, and I want to fix it!

476
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,009
It's a compulsion!

477
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,624
But we're done here. Party's
over. No more meddling.

478
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,165
- You promise?
- Yeah.

479
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,485
Kind of. Yes.

480
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,088
- Good, thank you.
- Okay.

481
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,055
<i>Yeah, she just won't
go back to sleep.</i>

482
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,823
Well, let, let me try.

483
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,893
Can she... Can she hear
me? Is the sound okay?

484
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,266
<i>Yeah, yeah, she can hear you.</i>

485
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:26,247
I'm so glad they
reached you. How's Zach?

486
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,504
He's still in surgery.

487
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:30,456
Why aren't you
in there with him?

488
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,009
- Reena...
- No, I want you in there.

489
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:36,964
I'm not on Zach's case anymore.

490
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:42,502
I made a mistake. I missed a
sign that there was an infection.

491
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,632
He's in there because of you?

492
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,585
I checked his
labs before I left.

493
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:49,220
You promised me
you'd check him hourly.

494
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,339
Not his labs, him!

495
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,513
I know.

496
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,666
And what about his kidney?

497
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:00,487
If the infection spreads, it
could affect his transplant.

498
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,468
They're doing
everything they can.

499
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,087
So the next few hours
are crucial. I'm sorry.

500
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,661
So, he could lose his kidney.

501
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,158
Yes.

502
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,849
- Reena...
- Would you please go?

503
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,449
- Where's Alex? This is his patient.
- Not anymore.

504
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,635
What is this I hear about
you threatening DeLuca?

505
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,306
I didn't threaten DeLuca.
I was trying to advise him.

506
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,791
You were talking
to him about Karev,

507
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,281
and you know it isn't your
place to discuss that with him.

508
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,579
- Bailey, it's Alex.
- Yeah, I'm well aware.

509
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,747
I've just spent six hours
in the OR because of him.

510
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:52,217
You are not Karev's
guardian angel.

511
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,857
You are blinded by this thing.

512
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:56,804
Look, I know you want to help.

513
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,806
But there's no need
to go down with him.

514
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,393
I'm his family. Who
else is going to help him?

515
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,079
Did Karev tell you what
happened with this patient tonight?

516
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,685
You should ask him.

517
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,944
I thought this little
one got to go home.

518
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:23,286
Yeah, she did. We're
just back visiting mommy.

519
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,235
- May I?
- Sure. There we go.

520
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:31,189
Yeah, how's April?

521
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,030
Well, she was
up all night crying.

522
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:38,046
Yeah, I took Harriet
home, so she misses her.

523
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,339
She's sad and angry and doesn't
really want any help from me.

524
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,927
Maybe she doesn't
want to ask for help.

525
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,657
I've been there, needing to prove
I could do something on my own.

526
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,298
Determined not to ask for help.

527
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,862
Yeah, well, I can't make her lean
on me. We're not married anymore.

528
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,965
I thought you were
your mother's son.

529
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,072
You two have a beautiful
baby girl together.

530
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,293
Kepner's family. Be persistent.

531
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,130
It's what you do for family.

532
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,643
Which lights up the borders of
the tumor so that we can get it all.

533
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,784
I know what to
expect. I'm ready.

534
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,066
- I can see that.
- I can't wait. Cut open my head.

535
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,987
I get it. The headaches
must be terrible.

536
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,888
No, I know terrible.

537
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:40,375
I was married to the same
man for over thirty years.

538
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,899
Wasn't the best choice.

539
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,446
He was a preacher.

540
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,805
Thought he could cheat on me
because he had a hot-line to heaven.

541
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,724
And I just let it happen.

542
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:55,390
- I was a church mouse.
- Literally.

543
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,176
I thought of leaving,
but I kept thinking

544
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,801
about how the church would
react. That he'd lose them.

545
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,038
So... I made myself small.

546
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,736
And then I met Wilma. The tumor.

547
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,972
I knew I had to start
looking out for myself,

548
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,959
so... I walked right out
that door with a tumor

549
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,283
the size of a
cantaloupe in my head.

550
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,986
Stronger because I had to be.

551
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,459
- Wilma made you brave.
- No, she made me pissed.

552
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,313
Being pissed made me brave.

553
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,048
Hmm.

554
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,934
She shouldn't have
taken that case from you.

555
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,637
I messed up, big time, Mer.

556
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:40,435
We all mess up. I mean,
why is everyone around here

557
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,453
acting like they never
made a mistake before?

558
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:45,890
Stop. I torched a kid's
kidney and he could lose it,

559
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:48,394
because I screwed up.
And I keep screwing up.

560
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,185
Just... open your eyes.

561
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,083
You're backing the
wrong damn horse.

562
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:58,725
Dr. Grey, the chief wants
you to scrub in on a surgery.

563
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,406
Well, I have a lap
chole scheduled, so...

564
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,460
She asked for you. The patient
has a renal artery thrombosis post...

565
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:10,832
Who's the patient,
Warren? Zach Thompson?

566
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,400
There's no blood
flowing to his kidney.

567
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,669
It failed. We've to remove
it. Dr. Grey, we should go.

568
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,543
Okay, okay, I got it.

569
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,593
You asked for me, Dr. Grey?

570
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:43,286
Yes, have you ever scrubbed in
on a kidney transplant removal?

571
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:47,902
- It's a yes or no, DeLuca.
- No. No, I haven't.

572
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,246
Well, bootie up
fast. We're going in.

573
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,433
Where's Dr. Alex?
I want Dr. Alex.

574
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,970
Zach, I'm Dr. Grey.
Dr. Alex can't be here.

575
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:08,589
But I know he'd want me to
tell you how brave you've been.

576
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,846
But why isn't he here?

577
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,565
- Karev, you're still off
this case.
- Does he know about his kidney?

578
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,018
His mother wanted
us to wait until after.

579
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,474
Can I see him for a minute?

580
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,528
Just for one minute, please.

581
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:29,627
Dr. Alex, are you
coming with me?

582
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,562
Dude, I gotta stay out here.

583
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,454
Are you gonna sit with
my mom? She's scared.

584
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,542
- Are you scared?
- Yeah.

585
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,244
It's a piece of cake.

586
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:44,492
- What do we always say?
- Nothing's as bad as broccoli.

587
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,249
Nothing's as bad as broccoli.

588
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,549
I'll be here when
you get out, okay?

589
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:53,857
Hey, okay, let's go.

590
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,207
Zach wanted me to check on you.

591
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:03,909
I guess it's time
for you to get going.

592
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,650
- Hey, buddy.
- Bye.

593
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,535
What?

594
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,436
I think you and Harriet
should come live with me

595
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,994
when you get out of here.

596
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:24,664
- Just until you've recovered.
- No.

597
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,962
- April, come on, you need help.
- I know that.

598
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,964
Good, so then why won't
you accept it from me?

599
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,900
- Because it's from you.
- Come on.

600
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:37,154
I need boundaries. And
I can take care of her.

601
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:40,412
Of course you can, and you will.
I know that we need boundaries.

602
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,576
I know that I'm
not your husband.

603
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,712
I also know that I
am Harriet's father.

604
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,837
She needs her mother
and her mother needs help.

605
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,926
Just think about it. Okay?

606
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,829
- Okay.
- She said okay.

607
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:07,801
Nathan! Long, long day, huh?

608
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,144
Yeah, it was. The short
ones are boring as hell.

609
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,142
Hey. Do you want to
grab dinner sometime?

610
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,997
Like, after work, like, away
from work? Like a date?

611
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,319
Like an actual date?

612
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,174
You're an amazing woman.

613
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:31,648
Oh. Okay.

614
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,564
It's just I'm not... I'm
not ready to date...

615
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,073
- No, right. I...
- anyone right now.

616
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,226
I, I totally understand.

617
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,641
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, no. No, it's...

618
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,032
Don't. It's not a big deal.

619
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,953
Have a great night.

620
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,707
You too.

621
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,306
Zach is stable.

622
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,873
We removed a large
blood clot from the artery

623
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,413
and the kidney pinked up again.

624
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,085
Thank you.

625
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:33,677
You were the big surprise.
You were "Most improved."

626
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:35,990
The person that beat
up DeLuca is someone

627
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,992
I thought you left
behind years ago.

628
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,181
Me too.

629
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,046
I can't in good conscience
let you perform surgery

630
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,886
in this hospital right now.

631
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:48,202
You're a good doctor.

632
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:51,694
You're compassionate.
And you're good with people.

633
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,750
It's exactly what we
need right now in the clinic.

634
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:02,299
A little mole told me
they're short-staffed.

635
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,123
The Denny Duquette Clinic?

636
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:07,567
Unless you want me to fire you.

637
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,883
All right, then.
You start tomorrow.

638
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,551
Thanks.

639
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:27,758
- Hey.
- This is you and Riggs

640
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,993
at the wedding. You invited him.

641
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:32,480
Okay, what happened
to no more meddling?

642
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,483
You married a
twelve-stepper, get used to it.

643
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,240
Why is this so important to you?

644
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,795
You guys were, like, best
friends! You're brothers.

645
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:46,215
You don't get a lot
of those in your life.

646
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,949
So you have to try.
You're required to try.

647
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,956
I am happy. Okay?

648
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,911
You could be happier.

649
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,302
So do you want me to stay or go?

650
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,841
'Cause, you know,
I mean, either way...

651
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,746
No, I'm fine. You can go.

652
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,534
<i>We walk through
these doors as interns.</i>

653
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:46,609
<i>Chips on our shoulders. Loners.</i>

654
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,495
<i>Lesser rock stars on
the verge of greatness.</i>

655
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:53,160
I still can't believe
you saved that kidney.

656
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,664
You would have done the
same thing if you were in there.

657
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,132
Bailey was right, my
head's not in the game.

658
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,218
<i>We're thrown into
the deep end together,</i>

659
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:05,923
<i>told to save lives together, to
save each other. We become family.</i>

660
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:07,357
So get it in the game.

661
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,560
I'm gonna be working
in the clinic for a while.

662
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:12,163
- That is just...
- It's fine. It's right.

663
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:14,086
It's not like I didn't
do it to myself.

664
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,787
- I slept with Riggs.
- Okay.

665
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,873
In the parking lot. In my car.

666
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,641
In the car you drove me home in?

667
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:26,577
- It's bad.
- It was bad?

668
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,746
No. It's bad because...

669
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,905
Hey! What are we drinking?

670
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,560
Slow down.

671
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,831
My God, that was humiliating. It was
worse than being dumped by DeLuca.

672
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:47,214
And now he knows how much
I like him. Why am I crying?

673
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,505
Some guy said no?

674
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,652
Who said what?

675
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,338
You live here now, so
you're gonna hear things.

676
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:56,362
It's Riggs. I asked him out.

677
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,826
He said no. So fast.

678
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,918
You know what? Forget him.

679
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,314
It's really time to move on.

680
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:06,467
- Okay.
- Look on the bright side.

681
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:10,470
Yeah. He did say he
wasn't dating... Right now.

682
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,990
<i>And even when
you really screw up...</i>

683
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:14,207
I'll give it some time.

684
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,628
<i>Family is always
there. Always on call.</i>

685
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,736
<i>Womb to tomb. Ride or die.</i>
