1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:03,330
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,354 --> 00:00:05,231
<i>There is a fundamental flaw</i>

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,316
<i>in how we are
teaching our residents.</i>

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,852
And we have got to fix this.

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,389
- Who is Dr. Eliza Minnick?
<i>- Minnick's kind of a legend.</i>

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,423
You'll just be observing
the first few days anyway,

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,558
getting a sense of how it works.

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,277
I thought you two
were working together.

9
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,896
<i>Bailey, who's running this
program, me or Eliza Minnick?</i>

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,397
<i>She thinks she's the
new Residency Director,</i>

11
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,849
like she is Richard
Webber's boss.

12
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,168
<i>You don't want to hear my
opinions about a program that I built,</i>

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,620
<i>- that I trained you in.</i>
- I made a decision

14
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:30,674
about what is best for the
hospital moving forward.

15
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,742
Look at that hand.
This is assault.

16
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,595
A pediatric surgeon
walking around this hospital.

17
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,148
<i>Do you realize what happens
if you're convicted of a felony?</i>

18
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:39,382
Mer, the trial's tomorrow.

19
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,334
<i>It could be our last chance
for, like, eight, ten years.</i>

20
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:44,387
Jo Wilson isn't my real name.
That's why I couldn't marry you.

21
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,440
<i>It might all come out
at the court tomorrow.</i>

22
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:47,924
<i>Karev, what are you about to do?</i>

23
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,342
<i>I'm going to the district
attorney's tonight,</i>

24
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,660
<i>and I'm gonna take the plea.</i>

25
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,295
- He's going to prison.
- When?

26
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,215
It's just us now. There were
five of us, and it can't be just me.

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,106
Mr. Karev? He'll see you now.

28
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,018
<i>We all have heroes...</i>

29
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,836
So, this website's saying that
we need a case record number.

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,005
The other one said that I
needed his arrest-record number.

31
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,690
- Are those the same thing?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,494
<i>People we look up to, people we
aspire to be, who teach us how to be</i>

33
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,213
<i>greater than we are because
they're greater than we are.</i>

34
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:28,731
- Did you find it?
- I'm looking.

35
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,983
<i>They're great if we
don't look too closely.</i>

36
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,903
I can't get any information about
his case without that number.

37
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,838
Alex sent me an e-mail one time

38
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,874
with an arraignment
number on it or something...

39
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,778
- Try the "search" box.
- I'm searching.

40
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,881
Oh, maybe this. Okay, "Locate
current defendant using his..."

41
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,722
Yeah, no. Still need the number.

42
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,153
- Okay, I found it. You ready?
- Yes.

43
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:55,163
"RDH4467A239."

44
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>'Cause if we get too close...</i>

45
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,311
There it is, there's his case.

46
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,986
<i>We realize, heroes
are just regular people.</i>

47
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:07,420
Thirty years to life.

48
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,105
He's gonna die in prison.

49
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,924
Wait, that's not even his case!

50
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,594
- I said "A" not "8".
- Thank God.

51
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,578
- Do you need me to take over?
- No, no, I got it.

52
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,517
Criminal case, blah, blah, blah.

53
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,902
- "Disposition."
- Deposition.

54
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,703
That's good. That means
he's giving testimony.

55
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,288
So that means
that he's in court,

56
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,974
and he didn't take the
plea, and he's not in prison.

57
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:29,530
At least, not yet.

58
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:31,416
"Disposition".

59
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,364
Oh. Okay. On it.

60
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,133
<i>And regular people can fail us.</i>

61
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,969
Looks like criminal proceedings
have been concluded,

62
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,412
and indefinitely postponed.

63
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,277
So that means the
trial's been cancelled.

64
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,568
Which means that Alex took a plea,
which means that Alex is in prison.

65
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,491
This doesn't make any sense to
me. Does this make sense to you?

66
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,777
No. You declared
war on Eliza Minnick.

67
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,967
We're ready to throw down,

68
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,364
and now you're just calling
a truce before we even start?

69
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,348
Okay...

70
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:10,550
- Occupied!
- Come back later!

71
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,851
It's me!

72
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,906
- Richard doesn't want to fight.
- What? Why?

73
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,091
- That is not what I said at all.
- You know what?

74
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,427
I'm just gonna call a board
meeting, or I'll loop in the Foundation.

75
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,013
We'll just go over her
head. I'll get her fired.

76
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,015
That doesn't sound
like nepotism to you

77
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,100
since Catherine's my
wife and your mother?

78
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,268
Wrongful termination.

79
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,204
Look, I'm not suggesting
we back down.

80
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,339
I'm saying that we
need to be smart.

81
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:36,826
Strategic, organized. You
just don't rush into battle.

82
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,718
That's what gets people killed.
I mean, think about Yorktown.

83
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,055
Look, we need to make her
want to leave because she's failing.

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,005
Robbins? You with
us? What, rough night?

85
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,107
Yeah. Have you heard from Alex?

86
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,442
No. Nothing.

87
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,546
We tried, but we can't
figure out where they put him.

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,751
Go away!

89
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,398
It's Murphy. I need Dr. Robbins.

90
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,133
There's a laboring
mom on her way.

91
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,974
Tell me if you hear
anything, okay?

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,597
- Uh, what?
- You guys haven't heard
about Karev?

93
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,911
Hey, Wilson.

94
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,830
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
What?

96
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,180
About Karev. You
know, I just thought...

97
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,899
Why are you sorry?

98
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,490
You didn't put
him in prison. I did.

99
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,682
Morning, Dr. Minnick.
First day. Exciting.

100
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,362
I love first days.
Such a feeling of...

101
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,453
Yeah, this isn't gonna work.

102
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,199
No, no. No, don't...

103
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,769
The valve replacement and
the neuroblastoma debulking

104
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,970
are happening
around the same time,

105
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,172
but I need to see both,
so I'm moving one.

106
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,858
- Okay.
- And this amputation's got
to go...

107
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,193
No, you don't want to do that.

108
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,044
- What is wrong with you?
- Okay.

109
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,597
No one touches the
board except Chief Bailey.

110
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,066
If Chief Bailey even
sees you lay a finger on it,

111
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,691
she will take that finger,
and she will kill you.

112
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,811
And you can't take my career
to the next level if you're dead.

113
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,847
- Ma'am.
- Dr. Minnick.

114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,384
- You rearranged.
- I hope you don't mind.

115
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:24,189
One less thing for me
to do. Make it happen.

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,726
- She touched the...
- Edwards, excuse us.

117
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,508
I thought we should
gather the attendings,

118
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,344
let them know you're
officially starting.

119
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,862
No, no. I'm good. I
do this real slowly.

120
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:41,134
I win their hearts and minds,
OR by OR, attending by attending.

121
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:43,085
I teach the technique, they
start spreading the word,

122
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,771
and then, suddenly,
they realize,

123
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,789
I'm the best thing that
ever happened to them.

124
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,593
Uh, some may need more
convincing than others.

125
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,295
Chief, there is a
Dr. Webber everywhere I go.

126
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,703
I know how to deal
with a Dr. Webber.

127
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,941
Good morning, doctors! Chief.

128
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,272
And welcome to you, Dr. Minnick.

129
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,957
Thank you, really,
but I don't do caffeine.

130
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,314
I don't need it.

131
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,782
Noted.

132
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:12,003
Okay, well, let's make it a
good morning, everyone.

133
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,379
She's on her way
here now, in a taxi.

134
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,199
Contractions are less
than three minutes apart.

135
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,667
Her doctor's out of
town. I've set up a whole...

136
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,368
Page, Portman, 'cause
I've been up all night.

137
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,804
- Portman's on call.
- Portman is in a delivery,

138
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,140
and the driver thinks this
woman is having a baby right now.

139
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,008
So how are you
talking to the driver?

140
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,749
Oh, he's VideoChatting...

141
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,863
<i>You're okay. Hello?</i>

142
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,832
- Hi. It's Dr. Robbins.
<i>- Hey, yeah,</i>

143
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,034
<i>we're about eight blocks
away from you guys.</i>

144
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,753
About how far apart are
your contractions now?

145
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,038
Okay, I don't know
that. All I know is,

146
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,707
this lady is super
having a baby right now...

147
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,665
<i>and we're coming in hot, okay?</i>

148
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,929
- I only have a few minutes.
- Okay.

149
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,247
The battle has begun.

150
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:03,416
All right, guys, I've been
working on this petition

151
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,584
from all of the attendings.
We can read it if you want...

152
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,019
No, no, we're past that, okay?

153
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,804
- I did some recon.
- And?

154
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,307
I think Minnick's plan
is to go into the ORs

155
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,176
and turn each
attending, one by one.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,744
- Okay.
- We never let her in the OR.

157
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,932
We isolate the enemy, cut off
her supply lines, starve her out.

158
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,516
- Great.
- Genius.

159
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
What?

160
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,575
It's Dr. Bailey, who
I respect and like.

161
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,544
Look, she is the first
black woman chief

162
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,262
we've had at this hospital.

163
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,681
I'm not exactly excited
to undermine her like this.

164
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,906
Jackson, no one
wants this less than I do.

165
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:40,153
This isn't about Bailey.

166
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:43,606
This is about correcting a
mistake that threatens our hospital.

167
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,730
This is not a Bailey problem.

168
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,099
This is an Eliza
Minnick problem.

169
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,204
- So we lock her out.
- Okay.

170
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,286
- Hi.
- Is she here?

171
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,038
- Who?
- Amelia. She left last night.

172
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,123
She left a note. She's not here?

173
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,441
- No.
- Meredith...

174
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,665
No, I don't know.

175
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,345
- Where do you think she'd...
- I can't find her.

176
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,732
You have to find her. Alex
is in jail. I have to find him.

177
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,672
You have Amelia,
I have Alex. Okay?

178
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,058
Let me know when you know.

179
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,658
<i>It was already bad
when I first picked her up.</i>

180
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:20,559
<i>I tried to talk her through
the breathing and everything,</i>

181
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,911
<i>but she just yells.</i>

182
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,331
- That's okay. Are you guys close?
<i>- Like, two blocks.</i>

183
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,939
<i>- See, that was her.</i>
- Yeah, we got that.

184
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:31,688
Steve... It's Steve, right?
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

185
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,022
I'm gonna talk to
Mindy for a second.

186
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,046
Okay.

187
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,409
<i>Mindy, it's Dr. Robbins.</i>

188
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,462
- Has your water broken?
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>I trashed this poor guy's car.</i>

189
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,920
<i>Hey, it's fine.</i>

190
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,217
<i>I am gonna divorce my husband.</i>

191
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,987
<i>No, I'm gonna
kill that son of a...</i>

192
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,244
<i>Big inhale.</i>

193
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,010
That jerk is out shopping right
now. Shopping! Can you believe it?

194
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,646
I'm about to give
birth in a freaking taxi!

195
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,231
No, no, no, no, no!
We're almost there!

196
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>Mindy, hang on.</i>

197
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,718
I feel like I'm
crushing the baby.

198
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,319
<i>I think I'm sitting on her head.</i>

199
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,656
You're feeling the baby
descend into the canal,

200
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,792
so just lay back, scoot
your butt up, put your feet up,

201
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,544
and we'll be waiting for
you in the parking lot, okay?

202
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,480
- Yeah.
- You're almost here, right?

203
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,504
<i>Yeah. Fire up an epidural.</i>

204
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,085
<i>- Where do I go? Here?
- Straight! Straight!</i>

205
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,694
Mindy?

206
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,096
Excuse me!

207
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,514
All right, so you just need
to look straight ahead.

208
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,066
We're gonna put this
collar on, stabilize your neck.

209
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,850
Just look right
here, lean forward.

210
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,537
No, I'm fine, really.

211
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,423
It's more my head
than anything else.

212
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,929
But is she okay?

213
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,983
I told her I was gonna get
her here before her baby came.

214
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:47,853
Mindy?

215
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,267
- Mindy? Mindy?
- Tell me what you need.

216
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,503
Mindy Wallace, at term,
in labor at time of impact.

217
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,555
Her ABCs intact, but
she's unresponsive.

218
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,207
Responsive to pain.

219
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,709
All right, come on, Mindy,
wake up for me, okay?

220
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,111
Possible head injuries,
bilateral hip dislocations.

221
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,113
She must have had her
legs up on the dashboard.

222
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,247
What? Why?

223
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,233
The way her legs are
shattered. Airbag deployed...

224
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,501
And the force shoved her legs
into her chest and abdomen.

225
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,075
Moving to the E.R.

226
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:14,557
- Hey, how's your pregnant lady?
- She's bad.

227
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,559
Yeah. Guy who hit them
barely has a scratch on him.

228
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,527
- Oh, God. Let me up!
- Hey, sir!

229
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,662
- Please!
- Lay him down.

230
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,963
- Mindy!
- Please lay back.

231
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,432
- You know her?
- That's my wife!

232
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,084
She's having our baby!
Oh, God, I hit my wife!

233
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,268
- Mindy!
- Just get him inside.

234
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,937
As soon as I'm done with
this, hang two more units.

235
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,406
- Murphy, where's my art line?
- I'm in.

236
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,340
All right, bandage,
and get me a blood gas.

237
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:50,776
Mindy? Mindy, it's
Dr. Robbins. Can you talk to me?

238
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,513
Ow. Ow. What's happening?

239
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,214
You were in a car accident
and you were pretty badly injured,

240
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,499
- but we're checking you out now.
- My baby. Is my baby...

241
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,918
Okay, all right.
There's the heartbeat.

242
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,752
It sounds really, really good.

243
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:03,806
Is my husband here?

244
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,208
Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.

245
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,326
The baby's coming, but
you're not fully dilated.

246
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,566
Films coming up.

247
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,416
Pelvic fracture along with
bilateral hip dislocations.

248
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,536
Is that the femoral
head inside the pelvis?

249
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,804
The pelvis is broken,
trapping the baby's head.

250
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:19,955
Oh, my God.

251
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,974
Mindy, we're gonna take
you for some CT scans.

252
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:23,860
I want to check for other
internal injuries, okay?

253
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,728
I'll meet you there. If she
starts to decompensate...

254
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,552
I will head right to the OR.

255
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,185
- What do we got?
- Bryan Wallace, 36,

256
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,605
conscious status, post T-bone
MVC, G.C.S. 15, minor lacs.

257
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,042
- C-spine clear.
- Did you see my wife?

258
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,494
We're having a baby
right now, literally right now,

259
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,580
- and I need to know
if she's okay.
- Bryan, I'm Dr. Robbins.

260
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,365
- Is Mindy okay?
- Mindy's still in labor.

261
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,752
Her injuries are pretty severe,
so we're taking her up for scans,

262
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,604
but I'm taking care
of her, both of them.

263
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,245
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Thank you.

264
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,560
Okay, I'll get a lac kit, and
you order a head CT, please?

265
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,479
- All right. Bryan,
can you feel this?
- Yeah.

266
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:03,398
- Edwards, you're on neuro today?
- Yes.

267
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,834
Is Shepherd here?

268
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,835
No. She said she was
taking a few days' leave.

269
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,920
- But you spoke to her.
- No, I got an e-mail.

270
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,456
I'll need an ultrasound.

271
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,009
Let me know if you
hear from her, okay?

272
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,673
- Anything.
- All right.

273
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,812
Hey, Dr. Riggs.

274
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,316
I am here and stoked to scrub
in on your valve replacement.

275
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,552
Oh, that's unfortunate. That
was my valve replacement.

276
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,455
- What?
- Yeah. It went great.

277
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,168
I don't understand.

278
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,554
It was scheduled for
right now, the next surgery.

279
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,556
- Oh, maybe you
misread the board.
- I wrote it on the board.

280
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,297
Well, maybe you mis-wrote it.

281
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,478
Look, I would open
him up again for you,

282
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,254
but, you know, that kind of
thing could get me arrested, so...

283
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,573
Cheers!

284
00:12:58,794 --> 00:12:59,960
He's not there?

285
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,132
Nobody? Somebody
has to know something.

286
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,868
Okay. Good luck.

287
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,950
Was that Meredith?
She can't find Alex?

288
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,353
He's not in King County
lockup or Tri-County.

289
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,339
I was there last night, and I
wouldn't wish that on anybody.

290
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:21,110
There. Looks like a
grade-2 splenic lac,

291
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,095
and she's bleeding from
her common iliac artery.

292
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,665
- How is that baby okay?
- Okay, so we need
to do a C-section

293
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,833
- and then repair
all those bleeders.
- Yeah, absolutely.

294
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,385
Okay, Murphy, can you let
the OR know we're coming?

295
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,525
Yes.

296
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,557
Any pain when I press down here?

297
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,558
No. But my head
still hurts, though.

298
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,994
Yeah, we're gonna
take a look at that, too.

299
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,147
Man, it was crazy. I was
driving like a bat out of hell.

300
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,283
How is that lady? Is she
gonna be able to have her baby?

301
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:47,186
- Is the baby okay?
- That's hard to say.

302
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,387
Right, yeah.

303
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,256
You probably can't tell
me anything, anyway.

304
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,490
I mean, who am I?

305
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,793
I'm not her family,
just a taxi driver.

306
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,762
That's cool. I get it.
Just kind of got invested.

307
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:59,415
We almost made it. Almost.

308
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,784
Listen, I'm gonna
order a head CT for you.

309
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,226
And I'll see what
I can find out.

310
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,296
Gonna order a head CT.

311
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,299
Is Minnick starting today? I
think I saw her on the OR floor.

312
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,000
I know what you
know. Less, actually.

313
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,502
I didn't even know
she was here today.

314
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,121
You're the Chief's husband,
and you don't know anything?

315
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,123
- No.
- What does that get you?

316
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:27,226
Hey, can we get some help
over here? Dude needs some help.

317
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,527
Started a fight in
the third period.

318
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,178
'Cause you high-sticked
me in the throat, you jag!

319
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,431
'Cause you got in the way of me
scoring, asswipe. I had a clean shot.

320
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,800
Look, let me take
a look at it, all right?

321
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,419
Oh, oh!

322
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,270
That's from a hit to the throat?

323
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,424
He went down, and I stepped
on his face with my skate.

324
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,674
Accidentally!

325
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,350
- Idiots.
- I think we'll page plastics.

326
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,132
Okay, we're gonna do
a C-section right away.

327
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,936
- Oh, God. Wait. Is the baby...
- No,
but you're bleeding internally,

328
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,538
and that's not good
for either of you.

329
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,872
So we'll need to
repair the bleeding,

330
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,374
and then you'll need surgery
to repair the hip fractures.

331
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,211
Okay. And I'll be
unconscious the whole time?

332
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,730
- Yes, of course.
- No, but can Bryan be there?

333
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,787
For the baby? When she's born?

334
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:11,108
- Mindy, your injuries are
too severe.
- Please. Please?

335
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,956
He was supposed to
be here to cut the cord,

336
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,198
and her mom will be out
cold. She'll just be alone.

337
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,317
- I'm afraid...
- Of course he can.

338
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,170
Thank you.

339
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:30,422
- He cannot be in that room.
- He'll just be there for the C,

340
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,391
and then he'll go,
before we do repairs,

341
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:33,992
just like a regular delivery.

342
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,994
- It's not a regular delivery.
- It's the only one
that they get,

343
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,163
- and I made this happen.
- What?

344
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,865
I told her to put her
feet on the dashboard,

345
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,100
and I made this so
much worse for them.

346
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,458
Look, please let me
make this one thing better.

347
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,160
Just for the birth.

348
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,732
Your labs look good. Just
waiting on your head-CT results.

349
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,035
Any word on the
lady and her baby?

350
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,825
Jury's still out. Sorry.

351
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,758
You know, today
started out so good.

352
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:08,427
I pulled up, she was
huffing and puffing.

353
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,062
I told her, "Sit in
front, sit in front."

354
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:11,614
you know, so she could recline?

355
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,200
And I said, "Imma get
you there. I got you."

356
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,935
I figured, either I get
her to the hospital,

357
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,361
or she's having
this baby in my car.

358
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,542
Either way, I was gonna
go home and tell my kids,

359
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,583
"Your daddy was a hero today."

360
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,072
How'd it get from that to,
like, everybody's dying?

361
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,224
Yeah. It happens.

362
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,573
Yeah. Sucks, is what it does.

363
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,157
That's not the point, genius.

364
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,660
Your little testosterone
game could've cost him his life!

365
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,647
Is that what you wanted? To
kill someone over a stupid game?

366
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,003
Excuse me.

367
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,939
- Is there a problem here?
- No problem.

368
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,342
Wait here for your studies.

369
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,213
You think I could
get her number?

370
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,149
Shut up.

371
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,272
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm awesome.

372
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,402
Have you heard anything else?

373
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,287
About Karev? About
how long he's gonna be...

374
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,806
- Why would I know that?
- I don't... I just...

375
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,193
Listen, if you need anything,
if there's anything I can do...

376
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,268
I need to finish
working up my patient.

377
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,838
Right.

378
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,976
You should go on the website.

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,846
I have been on the website.
I've been all over the website.

380
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,147
That's why I came here to
talk to someone in person.

381
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,733
Can you please help me?

382
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,357
- Please?
- Give me the info.

383
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,656
It's Karev.

384
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:45,241
- Where's the Social?
- I'm sorry?

385
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,264
The Social Security
Number. It's not on here.

386
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,865
I don't have that.

387
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,830
Next in line.

388
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,749
- Wait. Is there any other...
- Yeah. Go on the website.

389
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,222
Next in line.

390
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,270
We need to get
that baby out, ASAP.

391
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,606
No problem. I've
actually assisted on

392
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,140
- several emergency C-sections.
- You'll take my lead.

393
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,309
Sounds like the perfect
reason to let Murphy jump in.

394
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,511
Dr. Minnick, hi.

395
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,045
I heard about your trauma.
I'm gonna pop in there, okay?

396
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,279
- That would be amazing.
- No, thanks.

397
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,616
And, apparently, we need to
hire a new Peds Surgery Chief.

398
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,306
Seems ours went up the river.

399
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:20,014
Murphy, can you go make sure
that Mindy is set up in the scanner?

400
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,512
You're not welcome on my case.

401
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,698
I'm not actually
asking. It's my job.

402
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,250
I'm actually telling
you. It's my patient.

403
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,569
And your patient is
my student's classroom.

404
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,303
That seems like a
very distasteful way

405
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,457
of referring to a woman who
just suffered a medical trauma

406
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,793
giving birth to a baby. Whose
name is Mindy, by the way.

407
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,661
And Richard Webber,
he's a friend of mine,

408
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,635
so you can stay the
hell away from my OR.

409
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,641
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

410
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,344
Aren't those Bryan
Wallace's head CTs?

411
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,563
Yeah. Yeah. I
can't tell if this is

412
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,598
a subtle intraventricular
hemorrhage or artifact,

413
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,900
so thought I'd run it
up to the third floor,

414
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,787
see if I can get a
neuro consult on the fly.

415
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,610
- Right.
- Shouldn't take long.

416
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,414
So, if you can't find
me, that's where I am.

417
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,033
Barely missed his eye.

418
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,068
Could've even
severed his parotid duct.

419
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,373
We'll see more
once we get in there.

420
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,378
Dr. Avery, how are you?

421
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,625
Dr. Minnick. First day?

422
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,528
Officially. I'm just going to
tour the ORs to get my feet wet.

423
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,685
This the hockey kid
that got the worst of it?

424
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,135
Yeah, yeah. He took
a stick to the neck

425
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,738
and a skate to the face.
Full facial deglovement.

426
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,445
Wow. Dr. Warren, right?

427
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:43,859
Have you ever had
one of those before?

428
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,766
- No.
- But I bet you've done a hand.

429
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,380
The method we're using now,

430
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,366
we can teach Warren
how to build on the skills

431
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,383
that he has already
learned, and he'll go faster...

432
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,186
- It's not a hand.
- I know.

433
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,688
- I think she means...
- It's a face. It's his face.

434
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,440
This is this young man's
future we're talking about,

435
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,975
his entrance into the
room, his hello to this world.

436
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,811
It's his first impression
on employers,

437
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,664
his glance across a crowded
bar at his future spouse.

438
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,683
I am saving the thing
his mother loves the most.

439
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,653
- Wow. You're fancy.
- And you just want to waltz
in here

440
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,189
and have our young
surgeons practice on all of that?

441
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,841
Because what?
'Cause he did a hand?

442
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,443
- Are you kidding?
- Then when will he learn?

443
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,183
On another surgery,
or two, or three maybe.

444
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,000
Not on this one.

445
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,236
You know what, Warren?
Why don't you just cover the pit?

446
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,892
I'll have Mitchell assist.

447
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,165
Does anyone ever
get taught around here?

448
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,732
We'll say hi, and then you'll
go out before they intubate her.

449
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,206
How do I tell her?

450
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,009
How do I tell her
this is all my fault?

451
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,657
You don't. Not now. You
wait till you get your baby

452
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,699
and Mindy's safely out of surgery,
and then we take it from there.

453
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,018
- Okay?
- Yeah.

454
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,355
Yeah. Thank you.

455
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,435
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

456
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,255
- This is not how we
pictured, huh? No.

457
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,570
- Nope.
- There's gonna be blood.

458
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:21,172
- I know.
- Okay. Don't faint.

459
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,177
He's squeamish, in a big way.

460
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,883
I'm... I'll be fine.

461
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:33,590
Say hi to her for me,
okay? Oh, honey, your face.

462
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,459
What happened?

463
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,876
I'm so sorry.

464
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:45,770
- What? Why?
- It was me.

465
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,355
In the other car. I hit you.

466
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,153
- What?
- It's all my fault.

467
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:56,675
- Okay, Bryan,
we need to get started.
- No, wait, wait...

468
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,577
Mindy, you're gonna
feel a little drowsy...

469
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,218
Mindy, I'm so sorry.
I love you so much.

470
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,853
It was you?

471
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,428
Okay. Let's have a baby.

472
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,519
- Dr. Webber, how are you?
- Ah, there she is.

473
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,054
How's that first day?

474
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,090
I'm actually having trouble,
finding my way into ORs.

475
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,659
Everyone seems
to have full tables

476
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,851
or patients so dire, they
can't afford extra people.

477
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,648
Dr. Robbins,
Dr. Riggs, Dr. Inaba...

478
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,205
Tough breaks.

479
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:39,935
Was there a problem

480
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,504
with the way I arranged
the board this morning?

481
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,039
You used lower-case letters.

482
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,863
So? It's still legible.

483
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,311
It's a little passive-aggressive,
don't you think?

484
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,835
We prefer caps.

485
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:55,216
Chief Bailey told me to handle
the OR board as I see fit today.

486
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,123
- Is that right?
- It is.

487
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,372
Then, I'll leave you to it.

488
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

489
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09,887
He took the pen.

490
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,658
Oh, man.

491
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:18,023
It's all right, Bryan.

492
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,843
Get ready to meet your girl,
because here she comes.

493
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,883
- No. No, no.
- I got to get in there. Robbins?

494
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,169
- Pack her uterus. Metz?
- Bryan, you need to go.

495
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,671
Baby looks a little
cyanotic. Can you put her

496
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:33,956
under the warmer and
see if she perks up?

497
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,180
Why isn't she crying?

498
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,225
Get him out of here! Right angle.
Robbins, pass me the vessel loop.

499
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,527
- What is it?
- Bryan, your baby's

500
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,412
having a little trouble
breathing, but it's okay.

501
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,881
And we need to control your
wife's bleeding from the trauma.

502
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,967
If you can't ventilate, then
you need to get her intubated,

503
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,701
get her up to the NICU,
and get a full work-up.

504
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,169
Mosquito. Hang two more units.

505
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,311
- Oh, God. Oh, God!
- Somebody get him out of here!

506
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,037
Hey! I'm here for
about two minutes.

507
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,795
Here are the scans
that you asked for.

508
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:10,664
You know...

509
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,134
You said you were taking a
leave. You can actually take a leave.

510
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,647
- These are the dad's?
- Yeah. Closed-head trauma.

511
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,083
CT looked clear,
but then I saw this.

512
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:21,267
Yeah, I see what you mean. How
is his family? Is the baby okay?

513
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,562
God! They just wanted a happy
ending, and boom, ran into each other.

514
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,544
No, this is just
artifact. CT's clear.

515
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,285
Good. And this is the driver's.

516
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:36,624
- You had the yogurt?
- Yeah, I was hungry.

517
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,506
He's good, too.

518
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,406
I think Dr. Hunt knows.

519
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,392
I had to lie to him,
and that feels...

520
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,527
I'm sorry. I will go to a hotel.

521
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,929
This is unfair. I know.
It's a terrible imposition.

522
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,120
No, it's fine. You... Hmm.

523
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,416
It's not a big deal. You
are welcome. It's just...

524
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,777
That was my last yogurt.

525
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,215
- I will go to a hotel.
- Just go to a store.

526
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,929
He looks miserable and
he's scared to death for you,

527
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,065
and I don't want to lie to
your husband anymore,

528
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,800
so can I just tell him
something, please?

529
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,264
- No.
- What?

530
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:13,694
Because he will try to
fix it. And it can't be fixed.

531
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,682
Okay. Okay.

532
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,168
Thank you.

533
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:30,455
Give me the PTFE
graft and 5-0 prolene.

534
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,323
That is exactly what
I was talking about.

535
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:33,708
- Mayos.
- I could've told you

536
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,976
exactly how that would play out.

537
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
I know, I was here.

538
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,745
I didn't think you could make
it any worse for that poor guy...

539
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,570
Just stop it, Pierce, please!

540
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,236
DeBakey pickups.

541
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,120
Dr. Robbins, chest X-rays show

542
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,822
their baby has a
diaphragmatic hernia.

543
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:47,922
All right, is she intubated?

544
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,257
Yeah, but still de-satting.

545
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,201
All right, let's put her on
ECMO. Have a 5-0 ready.

546
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:57,449
Go, Murphy.

547
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,766
- You're not coming?
- No.

548
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,335
I have to make sure
that this baby's mother

549
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,287
- doesn't bleed to death.
- I've never put a baby on ECMO.

550
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,340
Call the peds surgeon that's
on call and get help, figure it out.

551
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,381
You can do this, okay? Go!

552
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,369
Scissors?

553
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,308
Hey. Hey, buddy.

554
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,123
I haven't heard anything
about your pregnant lady yet.

555
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,093
Cool, yeah, thanks, but, this
dude, is this guy breathing funny?

556
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,187
Damn it.

557
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:34,986
Damn it!

558
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,744
He dropped a lung. Can
I get a nurse over here?

559
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,947
I need an X-ray
and chest-tube tray!

560
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,967
And set up for intubation!
Has anybody seen Wilson?

561
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:50,635
Is the baby on ECMO?
Did you get help?

562
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,854
I found someone to help
me, but she's still unstable.

563
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,572
<i>There's too much pressure
on the mediastinum.</i>

564
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:56,141
She's not oxygenating
or perfusing well

565
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,575
despite the heart-lung bypass.

566
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,677
And she's still... Hang on.

567
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,381
- Another clamp.
- Hang more FFP. Right angle.

568
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:03,848
<i>Dr. Robbins, this
baby's tanking.</i>

569
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,517
<i>I think we need to
get her into the OR.</i>

570
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,857
Who's with you?

571
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,637
Barton.

572
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,773
Barton's no good for this.

573
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,458
- You should go.
- I need to be here.

574
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,042
No, you don't.

575
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,284
Hey, you didn't do this.

576
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,066
A car did this.

577
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,983
I need to be two
people. I need Alex.

578
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,209
Alex isn't here.
Go. I've got this.

579
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,829
- I'm ready to go.
- Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, stop!

580
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,330
We thought we'd
get her ready to go.

581
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,271
We've tried everything.
She's just too sick.

582
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:39,868
Yeah, you're right
about that one.

583
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,586
- All right, should we move?
- No, we don't have time.

584
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,321
Betadine and drape her. All
right, start prepping the room!

585
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,840
Let's get some gowns
and gloves in here!

586
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,308
- What are you doing?
- You're right.

587
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:50,092
She's too sick to move. I need a
surgical tray right here, right now!

588
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,807
It's Karev, K-A-R-E-V.

589
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,756
Nope. He's not in the
computer. I don't have him.

590
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,176
Okay, so, can we call
around to some other jails?

591
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,884
Sure. Because this
is Saks Fifth Avenue.

592
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,710
Okay. Right.

593
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,524
Okay, thanks.

594
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,459
<i>Sterilization team
to OR Recovery.</i>

595
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:22,749
Hey.

596
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:27,248
Hey, Bryan Wallace's head
CT is clear. I just discharged him.

597
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,052
- Who'd you find
to take a look at it?
- Dr. Morton.

598
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,236
Oh.

599
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,321
Bryan asked me for an
update on his wife and baby,

600
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,612
- so I'm heading up there now.
- Okay.

601
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,382
- Hey, how about the cab driver?
- Yeah, she cleared him, too.

602
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,897
She? I thought you
said it was Morton.

603
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,103
He, I mean.

604
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,367
Anyway, cab driver's
clear. I told Warren.

605
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,038
Find me when you get the update.
We'll go talk to Bryan together.

606
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,982
- Yep.
- Yeah.

607
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,431
What happened?

608
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,667
Rib fractures must've
punctured a lung.

609
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:03,968
Anything more
from the chest tube?

610
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,254
Bleeding slowed down.
Only 400 cc's in the pleurovac.

611
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,672
Yeah, we'll need
to stabilize his ribs.

612
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:10,058
In the OR I'll join you.
And before you tell me no,

613
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,493
I spent all day rearranging
my schedule, thanks to you.

614
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,445
I was hired here to do a
job, and I think it's time...

615
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,197
I would love to have you.

616
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,672
- What?
- Warren, book an OR.

617
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:29,110
Okay, you see here, Warren?
This rib punctured the lung.

618
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,812
Why doesn't hockey
just ban the fighting?

619
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,398
Are you kidding? It's part
of the game, the good part.

620
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:36,818
You got to shake up the other
team or get your own team going.

621
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,353
Garth is the enforcer.

622
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,355
Now, his job is to go in,
take out the skills player,

623
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,813
upset the other team.

624
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,495
- Seems he's pretty good at it.
- Fights can be strategic, too.

625
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,364
A fight can change momentum,
clear the air, break a stalemate.

626
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,222
It also rallies the team
against a common enemy.

627
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,119
Well, this is fascinating.

628
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,855
And I thought, I was just
gonna learn about surgery.

629
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,957
No, Dr. Warren, it's me
who's being schooled tonight.

630
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,110
Isn't that why you
allowed me into an OR?

631
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,629
I just wanted to see how
you "deal with a Dr. Webber."

632
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:06,431
You don't want to
have this fight, sir.

633
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:07,732
Someone always tries to,

634
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:10,001
and they always get on
board or get left behind.

635
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,892
You said fighting is
the good part, right?

636
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,660
Well, I hope you meant it.

637
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,418
Hey, how goes the battle
for hearts and minds?

638
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:29,525
Well, change doesn't
happen overnight.

639
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:33,325
Well, that sounds like someone
who's won no hearts or minds.

640
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,160
It's always hard at
first. They push back.

641
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,396
Eventually, everyone
gets on the same page.

642
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,216
That's not how it works in
my hospital. I'll call a meeting.

643
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,167
Dr. Bailey, you're only
going to make this harder...

644
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:45,303
This is not a fight you
should be having, Dr. Minnick.

645
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:46,760
I'll call a meeting.

646
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:52,760
You do this a lot? Get a
10 French chest tube ready.

647
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,595
Major surgery on a
newborn, right here?

648
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,579
The baby would die on the elevator.
And the mom might already be...

649
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:00,974
So we need to go, all right?
Let's just... Let's do this.

650
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:03,793
Scalpel.

651
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,146
Murphy, you gonna
assist or what?

652
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:20,372
Dr. Pierce was able to stop
Mindy's internal bleeding.

653
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:21,839
She's closing her right now.

654
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,564
What does that mean?
When can I see her? Is she...

655
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,401
When will she wake up?

656
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,840
- Will she wake up?
- We don't know.

657
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,645
- We have to see
how she responds.
- Oh, God!

658
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:43,911
And the baby?

659
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,185
Dr. Robbins has
asked me to tell you...

660
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,673
- your baby is in surgery.
- Surgery?

661
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,495
- Is she okay?
- As soon as we know anything...

662
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,833
I was in a baby store
when I got the call.

663
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,420
Isn't that weird?

664
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:07,207
I just bought her
this tiny little hat.

665
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,126
It was the first thing I
ever picked out for her.

666
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,191
It's like, this morning, I knew
what my future was, you know?

667
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,082
And, now...

668
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,253
I might not have
a baby. Or a wife.

669
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,385
Or what if she wakes up
and doesn't forgive me?

670
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,476
What if she never
wants to see me again?

671
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,872
Is she okay? Is she
sober? Just tell me that.

672
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,260
She's safe.

673
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,513
You don't have to worry.

674
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,086
Tell her to come home.

675
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:55,895
Tell her it'll be
fine, and we'll be...

676
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,860
Just tell her to come home.

677
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,840
She's onto us.

678
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,242
- Already?
- Yeah.

679
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,626
Damn it! We have
to escalate the plan.

680
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,063
Hey, you guys get this
e-mail from the Chief?

681
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,615
What?

682
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,407
- "Emergency meeting"?
- Yeah, it's to all the
attendings.

683
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,273
Except me.

684
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,011
What's our next step?

685
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,607
I have an idea.

686
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,548
- Okay.
- Yeah.

687
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,100
She's gonna be okay? Really?

688
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,259
Yeah. It was a good
repair, and I do a lot of them.

689
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,162
Thank God!

690
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,298
Thank God, she's okay.

691
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,316
Bryan...

692
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,100
Mindy's injuries were much
worse than they could have been

693
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,135
because her feet were
up on the dashboard, and...

694
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,760
Yeah, they said, the airbag...

695
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,980
I told her to put them up there.

696
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,378
The baby was coming,
and she was in a lot of pain,

697
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,848
and... And I asked her to put
her feet up on the dashboard

698
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,999
to relieve the
pressure. But I didn't...

699
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,969
I didn't mean to make it
worse. I did not mean to hurt her.

700
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,161
You didn't. You were
just trying to help.

701
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,250
You didn't hurt her. I did.

702
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,438
You were trying to get to her, to
get to them both. You were just...

703
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,773
You were trying to get here.

704
00:34:39,427 --> 00:34:40,460
Okay?

705
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,063
Okay.

706
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,786
They're just...
ten minutes late.

707
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,042
But all of them?

708
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,213
- Where are they?
- I have no idea.

709
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,955
Operating, teaching, molding
the surgeons of tomorrow.

710
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,569
Or maybe just sending a message.

711
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:13,660
Oh, they've been sending
their message all day.

712
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,007
Dr. Minnick, will you excuse us?

713
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,064
No, please. I'll
see you tomorrow.

714
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,533
Okay.

715
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:26,084
- So, this is mutiny.
- Call it what you want.

716
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:27,385
Why are you doing this?

717
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:29,520
You yourself said you
like Minnick's approach.

718
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,984
It's not what you're doing.
It's how you've done it.

719
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,975
It's too abrupt. The
program suffers.

720
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,264
Butt-hurt.

721
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,861
- I beg your pardon?
- You're butt-hurt.

722
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,430
That's what Tuck
calls it when you get

723
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:41,915
all bent out of shape and mopey
over something you shouldn't

724
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,301
because you're embarrassed.

725
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,986
You're forcing a change
nobody asked for.

726
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,437
This is not about my butt.

727
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,222
- You really want to do this?
- I haven't done anything...

728
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,596
You really want
to do this to me?

729
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:53,845
- Look, Bailey, it's not just me.
- It's not just you.

730
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:56,731
People are angry about
your treatment of me,

731
00:35:56,755 --> 00:36:00,434
about your direction of this
program. It was a bad call.

732
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,058
And you can walk it back.

733
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:07,308
People also felt the need
for change and adaptation.

734
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,278
People recognized that,
the way we've always done it,

735
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,945
isn't always the best way,

736
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,572
and that a fresh perspective
doesn't have to be a threat!

737
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,541
So, I'm gonna walk on!

738
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,062
"People", huh? Who?

739
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,832
It's not just me.

740
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,586
Sir, I signed your
discharge papers.

741
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,938
- You're good to go.
- Oh, yeah. No, I...

742
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,424
I just kind of wanted to know
how that family made out.

743
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,032
'Cause I can't just go home
and wonder, you know?

744
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:47,871
- It's still a question mark. Sorry.
- Oh. Damn.

745
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,257
- Okay. Thanks. Night.
- Night.

746
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,546
Hey! Sir? Sir.

747
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,843
That kid in the bed next to you,
the one who couldn't breathe?

748
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,078
The hockey player?

749
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,931
Yeah. Yeah, well, it turns out,
that he had internal bleeding.

750
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,083
Would've killed him
if you hadn't caught it.

751
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,674
You saved that kid's life.

752
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,144
- For real?
- For real.

753
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:13,691
Woo-hoo!

754
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:16,299
<i>Our heroes aren't
special. They're just people.</i>

755
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,936
<i>They're like us. They're
just trying to survive.</i>

756
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,013
Uh... Hunt wants
you to come home.

757
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,080
- How'd that family turn out?
- Good.

758
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,204
She's not out of
the woods yet, but...

759
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:41,869
everyone's still alive.

760
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,443
Good. That's good.

761
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,931
Good. I'm gonna
turn in, if that's all right.

762
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,782
Good night.

763
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:00,259
<i>They're trying to be happy.</i>

764
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,081
<i>Trying to do better,
be better, feel better.</i>

765
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,384
Hey, Dr. Robbins, wait up.

766
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,065
Hey, Dr. Minnick,

767
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,034
I've been awake for more
than 48 hours, so I'm gonna...

768
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,753
This'll just take a second.

769
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,223
- I wanted to thank you.
- What?

770
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,997
Murphy told me you let her run
with that baby from the trauma.

771
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,001
That's the spirit. That's really
putting my method to work.

772
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,205
Good to have you on board.

773
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,774
Good night.

774
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,243
<i>Heroes aren't more special, more
courageous than the rest of us.</i>

775
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,881
<i>After all, they're only human.</i>

776
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:45,332
You're not okay.

777
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,036
- What?
- That hockey kid today?

778
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,170
He dropped a lung.

779
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,105
We had to take him up to
the OR. Where were you?

780
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,157
I was in Path. I was
getting a culture.

781
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,509
Come on. You've been
in your head all day.

782
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,113
It's fine, 'cause I covered
for you, but talk to someone.

783
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,938
- Work it out.
- What do you need, Warren?

784
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,185
Do you need me to be fragile?
Do you need me to fall apart?

785
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,154
- Come on, now.
- Would that help you?

786
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,590
Because you keep looking
at me with your eyes all soft

787
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,493
like you want to help me, you
want to make me feel better.

788
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:16,602
I don't need to feel better. I
don't need your sympathy.

789
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,133
Stuff like this happens,
and I am built for it.

790
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,759
I'm fine. Leave me alone.

791
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,862
<i>They hurt, they
break, they bleed.</i>

792
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,259
Hey.

793
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,416
You okay?

794
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:56,375
- Is it a patient?
- No.

795
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,795
But, yeah. Yeah, that, too.

796
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:03,650
- Do you want to talk about it?
- I can't.

797
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,186
It's nothing that you
wanna hear about.

798
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:10,690
Okay.

799
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,879
I miss Alex.

800
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:22,217
And I know that that's not
fair to say to you, but it's true.

801
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:25,316
I hate that he's
gone. I just... I hate it.

802
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,968
<i>But sometimes,
every once in a while...</i>

803
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,032
What?

804
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,144
<i>When it matters,
they get it right,</i>

805
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,145
<i>and that changes everything.</i>

806
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,085
Hey. Anything?

807
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,917
Three counties, four jails,
nothing. No one will tell me anything.

808
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,874
Maybe, they're
still processing him?

809
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,571
You'll find out tomorrow
what happened.

810
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:50,141
I know what happened. He's
gone. That's what happened.

811
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:53,127
<i>A hero is only human,
but that's the point.</i>

812
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,329
<i>If they can do it, so can you.</i>

813
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,420
- Did Owen find Amelia?
- Amelia?

814
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,524
Where's Amelia?
Where is everybody?

815
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,879
I'm dirty. I stink. I need
to wash off this day.

816
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,707
<i>So, you keep going.
You don't give up.</i>

817
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,710
<i>You stand tall. You fight.</i>

818
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:27,200
- What the hell, Mer?
- Alex? Alex?

819
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,613
<i>You always show
up to save the day.</i>

820
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:30,637
Oh.

821
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,505
Wait. I've been
looking for you all day.

822
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,841
I've been here.
I've been sleeping.

823
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,665
<i>- All day?
- All day.</i>
