1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,669
So, Nathan and I...

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,006
we are...

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,643
becoming a couple...
I think? I don't know.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,293
But, you're my sister,
and I wanted to tell you,

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,317
because I don't want
it to come between us.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,164
Huh, she's gonna hate me.

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,189
That's a good point. It has
taken me a long time to tell you.

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,959
Attraction is messy. It grabs
you when you least expect it.

9
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,136
Of course, this
isn't what I wanted.

10
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,308
- Mommy.
- We got to go.

11
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,759
- We're gonna be late. Come on.
- Okay.

12
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,395
And in the end, what really matters
is that we care about each other,

13
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:36,818
and that will never change.

14
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,155
- How's that sound?
- Forced.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,603
Well, it sounds forced,
because I'm a horrible person.

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,422
You could use the plane. Near-death
experience. That's a good excuse.

17
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,842
Lie? Your advice is to lie?

18
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,310
Planes have taken
a lot from you.

19
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,094
When have they ever
given you something good?

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,829
Gave me a hospital.

21
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,506
I mean, it happened before I
even knew she liked him, you know?

22
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,708
But then it happened again.

23
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:01,655
I just, I don't know.

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,157
I don't even know
how it got this far.

25
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,849
Well, he lost his wife,
you lost your husband.

26
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,529
Look, if you don't want
to lie, just be vague.

27
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,936
No details. She's an
adult. She can take it.

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,533
Less is more.

29
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:15,824
- What if she hates me?
- She's not gonna hate you.

30
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:20,657
And I called it off and I kept
it off until I couldn't anymore,

31
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,681
and I'm really very, very sorry.

32
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,425
That's the one.

33
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,199
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

34
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,663
- You're in the ladies' room.
- So?

35
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,639
Show me your teeth.

36
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,458
All clear. Okay, so,
this is the shirt you like.

37
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,722
I brought it, because I
knew you would forget it.

38
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,336
Thank you.

39
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,082
You're nervous. Yeah.

40
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,426
It's a big crowd, bright lights,
but you're gonna be great.

41
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:52,010
And, I'll be there, so if you
get nervous, you just look at me.

42
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,663
- You just talk to me, okay?
- Okay.

43
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,332
- You got this.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,242
You're right. She
might hate you.

45
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,540
- All right. Edwards?
- Mary Parkman, 25.

46
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,609
Complaining of gradual
onset severe abdominal pain.

47
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,944
History of previous appy.

48
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,479
She's moving around so
much, I couldn't really get a read.

49
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,647
Hi, Mary.

50
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,849
I'm gonna just gently
palpate your abdomen

51
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,585
to check for tenderness, okay?

52
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,726
Yeah, abdomen's distended.

53
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:30,193
Hang in there, noodle.
You're doing great.

54
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,895
I hate that you're
seeing me like this.

55
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,635
You hurt, I hurt, sugarbear.

56
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,353
I'm here for you.

57
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,218
- They do that a lot.
- Mary?

58
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,721
Uh, Mary, can you tell me if
the pain is localized in any part of

59
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,312
- your abdomen, or is it...
- No, it's... It's everywhere.

60
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,645
Okay. All right.
You are doing great.

61
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,780
Can you breathe? Deep breaths.

62
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,538
In. Good.

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,084
Out. In.

64
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,271
Dennis made me breakfast
in bed. It was, so sweet.

65
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,880
Pancakes, bacon and...

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,532
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

67
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,567
- No, it's fine.
- Here you go.

68
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,588
Edwards, admit her,
and page Dr. Webber.

69
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,307
- I'm just gonna go...
- Wash the puke out of your hair?

70
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,863
Got it! Here you go.

71
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,811
I can't believe you saw me yack.

72
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,646
I am so disgusting.

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,237
No. It's real, just like you.

74
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,269
I love how real you are,
boo-boo. You're so beautiful.

75
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,493
I love you, too.

76
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,317
Look at this turnout.

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,030
I know.

78
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,088
Hero doctors save
lives on a plane?

79
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,001
It's a great story,

80
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,358
and great publicity.

81
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,740
Catherine agrees.

82
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,789
She's over there. Did you see?

83
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,097
Yep.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,760
What's the matter?
Crowd not big enough?

85
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,906
Richard's not sitting
with Catherine.

86
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,806
Okay. You need to
leave that man alone.

87
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,161
Agreed. I'm moving
on to Catherine.

88
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,642
Their marriage is not your lane.

89
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,317
Your lane is over here with me.

90
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,662
Stay in it.

91
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,064
- I mean it, Miranda.
- You're right.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,717
My lane is with
you, in this marriage.

93
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,402
- I am blessed.
- Alright, then.

94
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,037
I have also been
blessed with the ability

95
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,407
to change lanes, because
my car belongs to me

96
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,525
and I take it
where I want to go.

97
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,561
Leave no lane untraveled.

98
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,219
That's big talk for somebody
who's scared of Catherine Avery.

99
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,817
Wha... Please!

100
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,122
- I am not afraid of Ca...
- Dr. Bailey.

101
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,129
- See? You made me late.
- Mm-hm.

102
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,197
Hello. Good morning, all.

103
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,297
Uh, I am Dr. Miranda
Bailey. Chief of Surgery.

104
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,182
And I would like to extend
a very warm welcome

105
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,046
to the members of
the press here today.

106
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,305
Welcome back. I just
talked to your oncologist.

107
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,489
- How you feeling?
- I told him not to page you away

108
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,742
- from some sick kid.
- Veronica's in a lot of pain.

109
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,667
It's her back and everywhere.
She can hardly walk.

110
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,181
Hey, you try walking
with a bowling ball

111
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,083
attached to a
body full of cancer.

112
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,686
- You're about 35 weeks now,
right?
- Thirty-four weeks, three days.

113
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,404
Her husband's more
informed than most.

114
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,239
- Not her husband.
- Not my husband.

115
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,124
Just friends. But,
we get it all the time.

116
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,831
Oh, Jer, could you...

117
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,147
Your back pain, how long?

118
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,504
Uh, about a week.

119
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,835
Who'd have thought skipping
cancer treatments would hurt so much?

120
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,353
You passed up cancer treatment?

121
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,139
Yeah, I didn't want to
microwave the baby.

122
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,824
Any numbness in your
legs or feet, any tingling?

123
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,968
Yeah, actually, a little.

124
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,817
What? You look
worried. I can tell.

125
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,863
What does that mean?

126
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,882
Tingling could mean
any number of things.

127
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,072
Baby okay?

128
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,061
- I can still make it to term,
right?
- This could just be pregnancy.

129
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,392
We'll get an MRI,
and we'll go from there.

130
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,844
On the 13th of this month,

131
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,447
Doctors Meredith
Grey and Nathan Riggs

132
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,083
were on a flight to Philadelphia

133
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,942
to attend the National
Conference on Operative Advances.

134
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,622
While on that flight,
the turbulence...

135
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,594
You know, we can always
skip out on this if you want.

136
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,417
Yeah, right. I wish.

137
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,086
This is great press
for the hospital.

138
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,388
Brings in more
people, more money.

139
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,065
Do you have any idea how
much it costs to run this place?

140
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,830
And I'm going to make the
time to talk to Maggie today, too.

141
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,529
Just make me the bad guy.

142
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,629
- Just tell her it was all me.
- No, I don't want to.

143
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,853
I don't want to lie.

144
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:32,808
- Doctors Meredith Grey
and Nathan Riggs.
- Let's get this over with.

145
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,844
Dr. Riggs! Dr. Grey,
we've got questions.

146
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,547
Did your life flash
before your eyes?

147
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,516
How did it feel to receive a
commendation by the governor?

148
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,334
Is it true you got a
call from the president?

149
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,686
Did you kiss the ground
when you landed?

150
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,821
- Did you think
you were gonna die?
- Okay, slow down.

151
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:57,348
I was... We were on our
way to a medical conference.

152
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,317
Pretty routine stuff, really.

153
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,367
Certainly didn't expect to be
sitting here, in front of all of you.

154
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,134
Now, you see those big loops?

155
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,504
That's a classic sign
of bowel obstruction.

156
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,205
You have something
blocking your intestines.

157
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,673
Something like what?

158
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,660
Most common cause is a scar
from your previous appendectomy.

159
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,284
Or, it could just be
something you ate.

160
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:18,652
We'll do some more studies,
but often it'll resolve on its own.

161
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,450
And if not, then you'll
have to have surgery.

162
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,921
- Surgery?
- Oh, Mary, babe, you poor thing!

163
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,429
Now, now, now. Hopefully
it won't come to that.

164
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,948
These things can. They
can get better naturally.

165
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,847
Naturally? You got her hooked
up to machines just to stay alive.

166
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,855
That is an IV to
keep her hydrated.

167
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,876
Now, what can that be?

168
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:03,192
I never thought I
could fall in love so fast,

169
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,167
but I've never felt like
this... about anyone.

170
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm so glad we found each other.

171
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,769
Me too, dumpling.

172
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,246
Every day.

173
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:18,713
It's like, affecting
my body and soul.

174
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,815
Does make you want to puke.

175
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,498
Oh, my... Oh, God!

176
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,362
It's only been a
few months, but...

177
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,724
when you know, you just know.

178
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,375
- You know?
- I do.

179
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,507
I know so much.

180
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,510
DeLuca, can you stop
doing that, please?

181
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,462
- Sorry. Uh, Dr. Webber?
- What is it, DeLuca?

182
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,798
- Could you...
- Oh, my God.

183
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:00,822
What? What? What am I missing?

184
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,761
- Worms!
- Worms.

185
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,862
It's just, I just found a worm
from her stomach in my hair.

186
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,330
It was really long.

187
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,250
And there's one in the
suction canister, too.

188
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,081
A worm?

189
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,687
Wait. So that means that's...

190
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,091
A whole lot of worms.

191
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,926
Huh.

192
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,663
Dr. Riggs, you've
served as a field surgeon

193
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,198
in war-torn parts of the world.

194
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:35,100
- How did this compare?
- Less dust, less wind.

195
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,619
There was less legroom.

196
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,740
Uh, I mean, look. I
was there, I pitched in.

197
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:43,942
So was a pediatric
dentist, flight attendants.

198
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,184
Even some of the
passengers helped out.

199
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,382
But Dr. Grey was
working on a man's brain

200
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,368
in conditions under
which I've never seen,

201
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,660
and she didn't fail
or falter, not once.

202
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,093
She was incredible.

203
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,878
And so she is
your story, not me.

204
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,868
<i>What's it feel like...</i>

205
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:39,654
<i>She was incredible.</i>

206
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,690
<i>So she is your story, not me.</i>

207
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,024
<i>So she's your story, not me.</i>

208
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,835
Oh. I thought
Ryan was in on this.

209
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,403
I tagged in.

210
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,418
RAM or LDM flap?

211
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,653
Uh, neither, actually.
We're doing an EOM.

212
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,338
Did you get a chance
to look over the chart?

213
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,373
- Yeah, I'm caught up.
- Great.

214
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,660
Oh, Grey's calling you. I just got
started. You want me to grab it?

215
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:10,251
No, just leave it, Jackson.

216
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,120
Sure.

217
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,508
- You alright?
- Yes.

218
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,061
Okay.

219
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,026
Hey, I couldn't make the press
conference. Did I miss anything?

220
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,233
Yeah. Yeah, I learned a lot.

221
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,785
Veronica, it looks as though
your tumor has metastasized

222
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,409
to your spine. It's starting
to compress your spinal cord.

223
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,923
The cancer's spreading?

224
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,424
Well, we knew this could happen,

225
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,159
but this does accelerate things.

226
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:41,463
What things?

227
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,715
Okay, come on. Just
give it to me straight.

228
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,324
I would give you two,
maybe three more months.

229
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,009
Two?

230
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,356
It was supposed to be seven or
eight. That's what they said. That's...

231
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,813
We've been holding onto that.

232
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,085
There's more.

233
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,614
Yes.

234
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,588
We also need to
keep your baby safe.

235
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,270
And given how much
the cancer has spread

236
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,978
and how difficult the spinal
mets would make a term delivery,

237
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,974
I want to deliver
your baby today.

238
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,998
No!

239
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,544
No. It's too soon.
He's still too little.

240
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,879
You're at 34 weeks.

241
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,986
I've delivered way
smaller babies than this.

242
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,705
Yours should be just fine.

243
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,068
And the safest
option is a C-section.

244
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:25,393
And I'll be there to handle
any spinal-cord issues.

245
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,645
If they deliver today...

246
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,445
then that's two
months with the baby.

247
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:34,002
That's you and me...

248
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,537
and the little boy.

249
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,825
But we deliver today.

250
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,079
Okay.

251
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,013
All right. Let's
cheer up, everybody.

252
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,685
We're having a baby.

253
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,516
Do we know what they are?

254
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,218
<i>Ascaris lumbricoides,</i>

255
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,470
the intestinal roundworm.

256
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,373
Can grow to a
length of half a meter.

257
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,420
It's rare in the U.S.,

258
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:17,522
but an estimated one-sixth of
the human population's infected.

259
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,675
Yeah, and our
patient has half of 'em.

260
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,990
Is there a world
record for these?

261
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:25,864
No.

262
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,655
No, no, no. No.

263
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:29,990
I don't understand.

264
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:33,789
They're breeding in her
stomach, like, right now?

265
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,179
Well, technically,

266
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,381
they're not in her stomach.

267
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,298
The larvae travel
through the bloodstream.

268
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,620
Where they go to the small
intestine to mature and mate.

269
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,604
Where they will
deposit more eggs.

270
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,029
- The worms, they...
- Stop saying "worms"!

271
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,768
How long have
they been in there?

272
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,488
Um, we, we can't say, um...

273
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,919
The lar... um...

274
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,424
They take at least a couple of
months to mature into adults.

275
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,547
So...

276
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,300
She's had these since we met?

277
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,399
You, you could have ingested
them from unwashed fruit or...

278
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,509
- Ugh, just get them out.
- The surgery,
it's extremely simple.

279
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,707
Um, DeLuca, let's book an O.R.

280
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:25,908
Mm-hm.

281
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,176
- Uh, Dennis?
- Hey.

282
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,999
You can accompany
her to the pre-op room.

283
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,964
Um...

284
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,104
Dennis?

285
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,874
I can't. I... I just
have to... uh...

286
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,254
I got to make a phone
call and let your mom know

287
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,557
that you're okay
and other people.

288
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,908
- Who?
- Work.

289
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:46,150
I have a work call. I mean, I
have to call your work and family.

290
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,134
Oh, okay. Let's see
about these worms.

291
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,158
Uh-huh.

292
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,846
<i>Dr. Reynolds to the E.R.
Dr. Reynolds to the E.R.</i>

293
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,927
Hi. Thank you.

294
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:08,534
Uh, I see that you're
working with Dr. Webber.

295
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,602
Mm-hm.

296
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,605
- How does he seem?
- Oh, great. Yeah.

297
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:15,909
We have a patient with a gut full of worms
so he's, you know, in his happy place.

298
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,727
I, on the other hand, can't stop
scratching my head, because a patient

299
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,796
threw up in my hair, and now
I'm convinced something might

300
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,165
be crawling around in
there, which is not a thing that

301
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,269
- anyone wants.
- Yeah, good, good. Uh...

302
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,619
Do you think you
could try to talk to him?

303
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:30,595
- What?
- Richard and Catherine
need some help

304
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,330
coming back together.
I'm on a mission.

305
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,633
Great. Great. What's the plan?

306
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,448
I don't have one, but
we need to do something.

307
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,582
We?

308
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,652
Oh, okay, I get to be part
of the mission, too? Okay.

309
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,721
No. Okay. I could
be good at this, umm.

310
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,724
- Have you talked to Catherine?
- I tried. It didn't work.

311
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,877
Okay, try again while I scrub
in with Richard and the worms,

312
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,185
- and I will talk to him.
- Worms?

313
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,354
Your patient threw up worms?

314
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,061
There was only one.

315
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,043
That's one too many.

316
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,025
- Hey.
- Hi.

317
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,862
I have a quadruple-bypass
surgery, so...

318
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,497
We should talk

319
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,427
about me and Nathan.

320
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,229
So there is a "You and
Nathan"? You're admitting that?

321
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,287
- Well, I would like to explain.
- No.

322
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,635
- I don't need details.
- I would like to explain.

323
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,777
Mer, I have
surgery. I got to go.

324
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,826
You should feel a cold
sensation right now.

325
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,100
It might burn a little,
but only for a moment.

326
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,881
This is gonna numb
you for the surgery.

327
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,367
You'll be awake during
surgery with the drape up.

328
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,636
Once I begin, you'll feel
a little bit of pressure,

329
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,170
and it might be a
little uncomfortable.

330
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:53,811
But it won't hurt. I promise.

331
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,481
Does the cancer make
it harder to deliver?

332
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,729
Your body is already
working overtime as it is,

333
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,681
so the surgery is
an added stress,

334
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,284
but if there's any complications
then we will take care of it.

335
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,588
That's what we do.

336
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,079
I want to sign a DNR.

337
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,818
We didn't mean to spook you. The
surgery should go very smoothly.

338
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,138
I'm dying already. It's
just a matter of time.

339
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,254
But if something happens during
surgery and I end up stuck on a machine,

340
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,888
I don't want to leave
Jeremy with that.

341
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,413
I want to sign it
before surgery. Please.

342
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:34,267
And don't tell him.

343
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,903
He won't understand.

344
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,508
We can do that.

345
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,985
I bet Dennis is
already on the train,

346
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,088
headed back to Capitol
Hill, where he's gonna tell

347
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,357
all his hipster friends over
coffee what a bullet he dodged

348
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,915
by getting away from wormy Mary.

349
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:06,967
I'm sure he's not.

350
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:12,623
I was alone for six years
before Dennis and I met online,

351
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,538
and I had gotten
good at being alone.

352
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:19,380
I had gotten good at saying
"just one" at restaurants.

353
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,245
I was looking at adopting a cat.

354
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,120
Life was just fine.

355
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:31,592
But then Dennis messaged me,
and I was doubtful at first, but...

356
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,862
he turned out to be perfect.

357
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,499
I had forgotten what it was
like to come home to someone.

358
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,336
I had finally found it.

359
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,836
Mary, life can be
just fine on your own.

360
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,909
Oh, hang on...

361
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,330
Hang on a second. We
still don't know if Dennis left.

362
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,433
You're not alone, Mary.

363
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,669
You're about to de-worm me.

364
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,921
No one's ever touching me again.

365
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:18,122
Uh, I heard that Dr. Webber's
got a stomach full of worms today.

366
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,524
Excuse me?

367
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,359
Not Dr. Webber.
His patient. Sorry.

368
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,441
He likes worms.

369
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,097
He likes anything that's...

370
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,669
out of the norm, so the
worms will be good for him.

371
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,483
They might uplift his mood,

372
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,386
which has been a little down
lately. Wouldn't you agree?

373
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,920
Dr. Bailey, I have surgery.

374
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,712
If you need to say
something, say it quicker!

375
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,563
I know that Dr. Webber's spending
the night in the on-call room

376
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,314
- when you're here in town.
- That is his choice.

377
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:52,401
And I know that things
between you two have been

378
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,104
less than favorable
since Dr. Minnick arrived,

379
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,340
- which is a decision
that I made.
- A decision I led you to make.

380
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,642
Wha... Yeah.

381
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,444
Yes. Um, but...

382
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,396
Dr. Bailey, just because
you feel responsible,

383
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,371
doesn't mean you have to fix it.

384
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,774
Stay out of it!

385
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,400
Brody, why haven't you sent
me Mrs. Vonn's latest hematocrit?

386
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,614
Okay, what is so mesmerizing
that you can't do your job?

387
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,822
- Are those worms?
- I can't look away.

388
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,124
Oh...

389
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,962
Please tell me you're using
those pictures for a journal.

390
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,465
Oh, Sure, Kepner.
I'll make copies.

391
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,055
Oh, Dr. Webber? Big Mama.

392
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,936
Oh, Joanna, make
sure you get this one.

393
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,441
Someone have a ruler?

394
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,226
That's got to be at
least 10 inches long.

395
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,478
Uh-huh. That's bigger.

396
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,312
She's got a few ulcerations,

397
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,776
but I'm not sure it's anything
that needs additional repair.

398
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:01,135
Do you think they were
trying to find a way out?

399
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:06,275
Well, it's possible. Okay, let's
scoot that bucket over here. I got it.

400
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,376
Okay.

401
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,733
Okay, yeah.

402
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,768
Right there.

403
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,526
Okay, okay. No, no.

404
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,593
Okay, I agree with Dennis.
Worms are a deal-breaker.

405
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,991
- DeLuca?
- I don't know.

406
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,126
It might take me a minute before
I share a meal with her again,

407
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,368
- but she's nice.
- Yeah, she is nice.

408
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,515
And it's really sad. I mean,
you all saw how happy

409
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,579
- they were together.
- Pre-worm.

410
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,453
No more photos! They
really like each other.

411
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,857
They shouldn't be apart, you
know? Mary shouldn't have to lose out

412
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,660
on a magical relationship just
'cause everything's not perfect.

413
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,962
You know, people are flawed.
That's, you know, that's real.

414
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,398
Well, Dennis didn't realize
that something so ugly

415
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:47,832
would be inside
the woman he loves.

416
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,434
I mean, he has a
choice in the matter.

417
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,122
I'm just saying he shouldn't write her
off 'cause of this one thing, you know?

418
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,724
He should... He should
give her a chance.

419
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,414
Well, maybe he doesn't want to.

420
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,567
Maybe he's... seen enough.

421
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:03,003
3-0 chromic, please.

422
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,470
You okay?

424
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:19,615
Oh, I just had to tell a patient that
I like that her cancer's spreading,

425
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,633
but, I don't want
to talk about it.

426
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:22,856
How'd it go with Maggie?

427
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,175
Well, she shut me out.

428
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,911
Don't want to talk about it.

429
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

430
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,784
- Can I sit?
- Yes.

431
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,986
Did you join the Mile High Club?

432
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,593
Is he a good kisser?

433
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,098
- Maybe I should go.
- Why?

434
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,181
You probably already know.

435
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,650
- How many people did
you tell before me?
- Nobody knows.

436
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,554
So you kept it from everyone?
Were you scared they would tell me?

437
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,483
If you'd like to go somewhere
and talk about this, I'd be happy to.

438
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,179
You know, I would
love to, but I got to run.

439
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:09,220
Whoa.

440
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,302
No outlet protectors. We
haven't gotten those yet.

441
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:17,261
All over the house, electric
floor-level death traps.

442
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,997
- He won't be crawling
for months.
- Also don't have a stroller.

443
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,944
I was gonna pick
one up next weekend.

444
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,648
Order it now. It'll be
waiting when we get home.

445
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:28,917
The O.R.'s almost ready,
Veronica. We can take you up soon.

446
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,941
Okay.

447
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,188
When the baby comes,
he's your priority, remember?

448
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,624
You don't leave his
side, like you promised.

449
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,549
- I don't want to leave
your side. Jer, it's your job.

450
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,218
Where the baby goes, you go.

451
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,627
- Okay?
- I know.

452
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,677
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought
I had O.R. three booked

453
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,734
for my lap colectomy
this afternoon.

454
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:42,706
You did, but I have a valvuloplasty,
I wanted O.R. three, so I took it.

455
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,504
We do that now, right?

456
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,015
Hey!

457
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,313
I feel really bad.

458
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,015
I feel terrible, Maggie.

459
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,879
But now you're
just being a jerk.

460
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,870
- I'm the jerk?
- Yell at me, scream at me,
curse.

461
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,155
Whatever you need
to do, I can handle it.

462
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:05,791
What I need to do
is go back to work.

463
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,910
- Well, I want to explain this.
- Look.

464
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,901
I get it, okay? You...
There was a plane.

465
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,671
Emotions were heightened.
You almost died together. I get it.

466
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:16,923
No, it wasn't just the plane.

467
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,860
It happened before that.

468
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,930
When?

469
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,033
When?

470
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,689
Before Amelia and
Owen's wedding.

471
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:36,003
But it started before I
even knew you liked him,

472
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,873
and as soon as you told me
you liked him, I called it off.

473
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,196
We talked about it!

474
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,267
- I...
- You let me go on and on!

475
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:45,936
I was going to tell you,

476
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,172
and then your mother died,

477
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,307
and then I just couldn't.

478
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,388
I didn't want to hurt you,

479
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,452
- and Nathan didn't want
to hurt you.
- No.

480
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,932
This isn't about
Nathan. It's you!

481
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:03,048
I trusted you to
be honest with me,

482
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:05,100
when even my mother lied to me,

483
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,404
and now she's dead.

484
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,226
I thought I could
count on you...

485
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,044
to tell me the truth.

486
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,807
But you've been
lying this whole time.

487
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,633
I was trying to
do the right thing.

488
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:19,567
Well, you didn't.

489
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,174
I know that.

490
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,443
Maggie, please, please, please.

491
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,798
Can we just not
leave it like this?

492
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,621
You were all I had left.

493
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,306
Heart rate's up to 130.

494
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,874
Veronica, how's your breathing?

495
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:05,515
It's fine, it's a little tough.

496
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,613
What's happening?
What's going on?

497
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:11,071
Hey, Jer, come on. Look at him.

498
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,408
He has the sweetest eyes.

499
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:19,240
Her sats are dropping.
She's persistently tachycardic.

500
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,359
Let's put her back
on high-flow oxygen.

501
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:22,526
It could be an embolus.

502
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:26,547
- Time to get him out of here.
- Yeah, in a minute.

503
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,199
If it's an embolus, we
don't have a minute.

504
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:31,408
She did this so she can meet the baby.
Just give them another damn minute.

505
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,428
Jer, can you take him?

506
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,878
He needs to go to the NICU now.

507
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,715
- I know. What about Veronica?
- She's in good hands.

508
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,390
She'll be just fine. I'll
take good care of her.

509
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,458
Jer, you... you stay with him.

510
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,532
You promised. I'm
counting on you.

511
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,536
- But I don't...
- Go on.

512
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:00,971
Stay with him.

513
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,023
I'll see you in a little bit.

514
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,075
Okay.

515
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,381
Are we pushing heparin or
going straight to thrombolytics?

516
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:17,699
Thrombolytics are
contraindicated.

517
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,618
We need to do an embolectomy,
and let's get an IVC filter.

518
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:22,470
Veronica, you've thrown a blood
clot, and it's traveled all the way

519
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,788
to your lungs.
It's very serious.

520
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,990
We need to remove it immediately
so we're gonna need to put you

521
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,747
under and open up your chest.

522
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,350
Is that...

523
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,731
- Will that work? The
procedure will only last

524
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,839
- about half an hour.
- Will it work?

525
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,458
There's no guarantee
you'd survive it.

526
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,820
And what if we
didn't do anything?

527
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,820
Veronica, we need
to do this procedure.

528
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,456
If we don't, you might not
make it off this table today.

529
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:57,939
Okay, pressure's dropping.

530
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,495
- Get a cart ready!
- No.

531
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,060
I signed that DNR for a reason.

532
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:03,816
You can rescind.
Let us help you.

533
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,085
I did what I wanted.

534
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,388
My baby's okay.

535
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,861
I'm so tired.

536
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,051
I know.

537
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:27,903
I know.

538
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,874
Hey, how did it go?

539
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,511
Well, we got all the
worms out of the patient.

540
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,047
I did not get very
much out of Webber.

541
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,844
Kepner! You've been
with the man for hours.

542
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,247
I know, I know! And
I tried many times,

543
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,905
but everything I threw
at him, he just shot down.

544
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:01,488
It's way worse than
we thought. I mean...

545
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,577
it's like he's dead inside.

546
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:05,612
How'd it go with Catherine?

547
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,582
She told you to mind
your own business?

548
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,131
She is a hard woman to talk to.

549
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:14,299
Hmm.

550
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:16,973
- So are you.
- I know. But...

551
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,288
it's because I'm usually right
and people are wrong, and

552
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,912
- it's hard for them.
- Yeah.

553
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,745
Catherine usually
thinks she's right, too.

554
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,153
Are you saying that I
just think that I'm right?

555
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,004
No, I'm saying...

556
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,779
I'm saying you and Catherine
Avery are very similar women.

557
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,715
Very.

558
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,368
I mean, very.

559
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,924
I love Jeremy.

560
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:12,212
I never told him.

561
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:15,749
'Cause we were friends.

562
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:19,052
And I thought, "What
if it didn't work out"?

563
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,024
So ridiculous now.

564
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,695
Was I waiting for
something better?

565
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:49,265
He's loved me my whole
life, through everything.

566
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:52,602
Through cancer.

567
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,655
I know him.

568
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,426
He's gonna want
to keep loving me...

569
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,362
after I'm gone.

570
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:04,830
That's the kind of guy he is.

571
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,037
Will you... Will you tell him...

572
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,024
not to look back?

573
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,345
He's a dad now.

574
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,183
And he has to be...

575
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,752
He has to be fearless.

576
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:27,854
He has to leap.

577
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,474
What do you want? What
do you need right now?

578
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:38,865
I'm so cold.

579
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,552
- I'll get a warming blanket.
- No! No.

580
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,707
Can you... Will
you just hold me?

581
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:11,932
We did good.

582
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,270
The baby's good.

583
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:21,874
Baby's good.

584
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,006
How is she?

585
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,279
Say something.
Did you get the clot?

586
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,954
Now, you see these clusters?

587
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,845
Those were secondary
boluses starting to form.

588
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,059
We removed hundreds of them.

589
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,667
- They were breeding like crazy.
- Like babies.

590
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:24,865
I wanted babies with Dennis,
but now I'm a worm farm.

591
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,189
Um...

592
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:30,138
We'll monitor you,
but I think that you'll be

593
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,707
- up and at 'em again
in a few days.
- Thank you.

594
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,199
Mary?

595
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,056
I'm sorry.

596
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,590
It's okay.

597
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,210
I was being weird.

598
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,929
- I was repulsive.
- No.

599
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,216
Love-bug.

600
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,602
You were sick. That's all.

601
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,310
I am concerned about
you and Dr. Webber,

602
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,567
so I need to say
what I need to say.

603
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,436
I don't want you to fail.

604
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:34,173
I want you to succeed, and
right now you're not doing that.

605
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:36,544
Noted.

606
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,912
You can go now.

607
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,828
I got divorced, raised
a boy on my own.

608
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:47,331
I found a new man,
became that new man's boss.

609
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,387
Sound familiar?

610
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,888
See, I know it can
feel impossible at times,

611
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,278
but I figured it out.

612
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:59,832
I know what I'm doing, which
is how I know that you do not.

613
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,653
You do not know
how to be married.

614
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:09,153
Not to a real man, to
someone who's your equal,

615
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:13,363
your champion, who loves
you and respects you, and...

616
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,897
is mad as hell at you, because
I do. I've done this. I do this.

617
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:24,807
And I plan to grow old with my
man and to have old-people sex.

618
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:29,945
Well, don't you want to have
old-people sex, Catherine?

619
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:35,896
Because that's what you'll get if you
set your ego aside and listen to me

620
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,767
instead of dismissing me the way you
keep dismissing your own damn husband!

621
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,593
Ma'am.

622
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,263
Doctor.

623
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,831
Avery.

624
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,521
Good night.

625
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,450
I was wrong.

626
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,389
I had a patient
full of worms today.

627
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,430
Did you take any pictures?

628
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:12,532
What? Did I...

629
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,167
You know who you're talking to?

630
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,137
Come here.

631
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:27,958
<i>I didn't mean to hurt you.</i>

632
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,942
<i>That's the last thing
I would ever want.</i>

633
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,388
<i>Because I care about
you more than anything.</i>

634
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,088
Okay.

635
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:24,497
<i>So, no matter how mad you are...</i>

636
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,805
<i>how much you
want to shut me out,</i>

637
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,774
<i>know this.</i>

638
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,828
What are you doing?

639
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,692
What does it look
like I'm doing?

640
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:36,927
Didn't Amelia tell you?
She's waiting in the car.

641
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,871
The sitter's upstairs.
We're going out.

642
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:42,688
Well, if you want to go out so bad,
why don't you call Riggs? I'm busy.

643
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,980
I want to go out with you.

644
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,729
Meredith.

645
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,847
- Stop.
- No, I won't.

646
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,806
I am very sorry that I
screwed up and I hurt you.

647
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,809
But you're my sister.

648
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,132
And I'm sure as hell
not losing you over a guy.

649
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,078
Please come out with me.

650
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,920
<i>You are my sister,
whether you like it or not.</i>

651
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,767
- I'm still mad at you.
- That's okay.

652
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,371
I may only talk to Amelia.

653
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,201
Well, she's been sitting
in the car waiting for us

654
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,859
for like 10 minutes, so she
may not talk to either one of us.

655
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,014
<i>And I'm not going anywhere.</i>

656
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:47,164
- Oh, my goodness.
- We named that one Geraldine.

657
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:51,469
Look at you. So silly.
You are just too much.

658
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:52,636
Edwards was right
in her element there.

659
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,621
And you right along with her.

660
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,157
- Yeah.
- That thing is awful.

661
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,359
- I'm telling you,
it was like...
- I can't believe.

662
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,144
Discovery Channel
here or something.
