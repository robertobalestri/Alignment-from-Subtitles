1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,291
 <i>During our
ER rotation in med school,</i>

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,827
<i>my roommate fell in love with
emergency medicine.</i>

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,162
 Avery.

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,497
Care to tell me
why you've pulled

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,399
all of my residents
from the ER?

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,068
Yeah, I just wanted to speed up
our free COVID testing.

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,804
But, I mean, hey, if you want,
I guess we could...

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,073
We could start turning
them away.

9
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,409
It's a great program.

10
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,077
Forget I asked, okay?

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,079
<i>She loved being
on the frontline.</i>

12
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,782
<i>She felt that's where she had
the most impact.</i>

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>But I knew, three days in,</i>

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,786
<i>emergency medicine
was not for me.</i>

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,355
<i>Most treatments were meant
to just tide patients over</i>

16
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,190
<i>until they could see
their own physician,</i>

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,692
<i>a specialist, or a surgeon.</i>

18
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,193
 <i>And how is
her base deficit?</i>

19
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,828
Same as I told you
five minutes ago.

20
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,496
And her inflammatory
markers?

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,333
<i>Altman, we would not be here
without your tireless effort.</i>

22
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,401
<i>But you still have
two days off.</i>

23
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,736
<i>Enjoy them,</i>

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,104
<i>because you're gonna miss them
when you're back.</i>

25
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,439
Okay. Thanks.
Uh, one more thing...

26
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,074
<i>Goodbye, Altman.</i>

27
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,110
<i>And I thought,
"What's the point</i>

28
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,045
<i>of starting something
you won't get to finish?"</i>

29
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,947
...closer, I saw it didn't
have a ball in its mouth,

30
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,716
it had an avocado.

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,552
No idea where he got it from.

32
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,554
You're gonna love dogs.

33
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,956
Oh, you're gonna love everything
about the outside. Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,193
The trees, grass,
rainbows.

35
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,361
Isn't that right,
Luna?

36
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,528
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

37
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,830
Say her name again.
Why?

38
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,098
Because I think
she understood it.

39
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,332
Her face changed.

40
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,767
Yeah, Luna...
Luna.

41
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,502
Luuuna...
Luna!

42
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,004
For what it's worth,
she doesn't respond

43
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,071
when<i> I</i> say her name,
either.

44
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,307
Yes, she does.
She's a genius.

45
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,975
All right if I complete
my rounds now?

46
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,544
Or is she such a genius that
she can look after herself?

47
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,780
No. Go ahead.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

48
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,448
Wilson, Chief,

49
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,917
while I think these visits
do Luna the world of good,

50
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,587
I have about 15 other patients
and their very worried parents

51
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,555
waiting for me,
so if you don't mind...

52
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,391
Nyah nyah nyah
nyah nyah. Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,592
Thank you.

54
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,796
<i>♪ Used to have a lover

55
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,801
No. Go back
where you came from.

56
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,970
I already have all the clothes
in the house.

57
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,972
Ellis thought her laundry went
under her bed,

58
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,306
not in the hamper.

59
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,644
He just ate.

60
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,179
Well, I ate a lot
when I was a kid.

61
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,313
Still do.

62
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,982
Okay.

63
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,150
Baby or laundry?

64
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,217
Neither.

65
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,552
I... I just want
everything to stop.

66
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,721
The whole planet,
it can just stop turning,

67
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,022
and we can all
just melt.

68
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,190
Is it for us?

69
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,458
Is it for us?

70
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,759
Is it for us?

71
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,927
Is what for us,
buddy?

72
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,263
The camping truck,
the camping truck!

Hey, kiddos!

77
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,477
Surprise!
Huh?

78
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

79
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,046
COVID! And stranger.

80
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,215
Aw, we've talked on the computer
screen lots of times.

81
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,983
We're old friends.
Where are your masks?!

82
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,719
Where's my grandson?
That's what I want to know.

83
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,722
Oh, don't worry, honey,
we have been totally safe.

84
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,391
Two-week quarantine
from Colorado

85
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,625
while we took in
the scenery.

86
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,361
Dad packed for everything.
We didn't even have to shop.

87
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,797
Haven't spoken face-to-face
with another soul

88
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,798
since we left.

89
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,667
Mm. So romantic.

90
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,039
I guess I'll...
go get Scout?

91
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,041
Okay. Alright, I'll
do you one better.

92
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,742
We thought we could take
all the kids

93
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,144
to check out
Mt. Rainier.

94
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,646
Fun!
Can we go, please?

95
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,048
Uh, I'm sorry.

96
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,717
You're say... you want to take
everyone from here?

97
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,053
Those first few months
with a newborn...

98
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,222
Impossible without help.

99
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,506
Only if it's okay.

100
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,327
Okay.

101
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,329
Yes!
Yay! Come on!

102
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,331
Have I told you two
how much I love you?

103
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,832
Because I definitely
love you.

104
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,667
And we love you, too, hon.

105
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,669
We couldn't have asked for
a better daughter-in-law.

106
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,873
She is the mother
of my grandson,

107
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,175
and even if you haven't
gotten around to proposing,

108
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,978
I am gonna call her
what I want to call her.

109
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,980
I don't get why they're not
married, either.

110
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,648
Okay. Time to
hit the road. Zola.

111
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,150
I'll go get Scout.

112
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,486
I can't wait
to meet my grandson!

113
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,360
That's it?

114
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,061
I can go again if
you want.

115
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,464
You'll get a text in 30 minutes
with the results.

116
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,132
Thank you.
All right.

117
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,234
I've almost used all my kits.
I'm so sorry.

118
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,136
It's just that the... the...
The turnout's so high.

119
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,138
Relax, Schmitt.
We have more in the van.

120
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,640
If we run low,
we can go over

121
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,308
to the drive-through site
at Station 19.

122
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,476
They've got extras.

123
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,478
Oh.
Wow. That's amazing.

124
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,679
How did we get
more kits?

125
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,015
20 hours of virtual meetings
with the Fox Foundation,

126
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,750
convincing them it's the right
thing to do... that's how.

127
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,501
You don't just ask your mom?

128
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,356
Ready for you, sir.

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,025
Thank you. Why don't you
go ahead and have a seat?

130
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,159
How you doing?
Good.

131
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,295
One of our cashiers tested
positive at the store.

132
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,530
I feel fine, but, you know,
I figured I should make sure.

133
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,098
Good. Smart.
Okay.

134
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,716
Can you take your mask down
a little bit for me?

135
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,972
All right, one more.

136
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,440
Great. All set.
Yeah.

137
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,608
How many days
till I know?

138
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,642
Uh, well,
it's a rapid test,

139
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,277
so about 30 minutes
for your results.

140
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,879
Oh, wow. I won't be late
for my shift, then.

141
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,880
Thank you so much.

142
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,615
You're very welcome.
Thank you.

143
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,988
I wouldn't be the surgeon I am
without you, Meredith.

144
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,491
You taught me to push myself,
to innovate,

145
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,995
to see what's possible,
and to trust my instinct.

146
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,114
And right now, that's telling me
to change to OB.

147
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,635
Go with God?

148
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,136
Meredith wouldn't say that.

149
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,639
I have literally never known
what Dr. Grey is gonna say.

150
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,307
Ooh! Why don't you be me
and I be her?

151
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,809
Oh, how about
you be you<i> and</i> her

152
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,110
so that I can get back
to the testing tent?

153
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,712
She's my mentor!

154
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,614
I don't want to disappoint her
or Bailey or Dr. Webber.

155
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,681
This is stressful.

156
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,183
Well, so is
pissing off Dr. Avery.

157
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,384
Oh, crap... trauma.

158
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,019
I gotta go.

159
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,021
I had to go first!

160
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,357

00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,026
Hold up, Khan.

163
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,028
Chris, did you want
to wait for Hollie?

164
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,163
Or I can set you up with
a video-chat on a tablet?

165
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,165
No. Thank you.

166
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,968
It's... not a good time.

167
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,637
She has work, so...

168
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,804
go ahead.

cardiomyopathy,

172
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,279
He's currently on
day 12 of ECMO,

173
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,614

Do a lot of kids with his
condition stay on it this long?

176
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,588
It's unusual.

177
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,390
It means he's strong.

178
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,492
He's already held his own
through several procedures.

179
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,327
None of which have fixed
the holes in his heart.

180
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,098
We're hoping he can hang on
a little bit longer,

181
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,934
until a donor heart
comes through.

182
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,070
I'll be back to you
in a couple of hours, okay?

183
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,610
Chief.
Welcome back.

184
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,944
Mm.

185
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,047
So, uh, this is the car
that got stuck in a truck?

186
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,548
Yep, ran right up
the loading ramp.

187
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,050
They had to cut open
the side of the van. Mm.

188
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,000
Newlyweds, I heard.

189
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,387
Hell of a honeymoon.

190
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,837
Huh.

191
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,224
Shayne Riley, 45.

192
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,993
Unstable pelvis
and lower abdominal pains

193
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,062
after sustaining crush injuries
in an MVC.

194
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,731
Initially unresponsive,
but now alert and orientated

195
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,232
after saline boluses.

196
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,734
Shayne, you are
in good hands now,

197
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,802
and I'm not
just saying that

198
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,603
because Dr. Bailey here
is my wife.

199
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,406
But you are looking
really good, Chief.

200
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,842
All right, this is
Karissa Skolaski, 42.

201
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,677
Vital signs stable,
A and O times three.

202
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,013
Minor lacerations to the face,
arms, and legs.

203
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,014
Patient complains
of headache.

204
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,615
Let's take her
to trauma one.

205
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,451
Shayne?!
W-Where's my husband?!

206
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,753
He's right over there, ma'am.
He's being taken care of.

207
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,621
Oh, Shayne,
I'm sorry, babe!

208
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,889
I didn't mean it!

209
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,990
Wait,
can he hear me?

210
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,492
Uh, he's heavily
sedated, ma'am.

211
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,961
I can hear her just fine.
I'm just not talking to her.

212
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,745
Ever again.

213
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,267
Improving ground glass
opacities,

214
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,603
no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax,

215
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,373
and no signs of stroke
on head CT.

216
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,323
This is great news.

217
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,245
It's not great news?

218
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,414
Great news doesn't matter

219
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,199
if she's too weak
to stay awake.

220
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,488
Captioning provided by
ABC Studios and ABC, Inc.

221
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,573
And brought to you by: Ford,
Built Ford Proud

222
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,163
Karissa, you can't get up. We're
waiting on neuro to see you.

223
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,197
Okay? Just squeeze.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

224
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,198
But my boyfriend...
Husband...

225
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,199
Uh, he...
He hates needles.

226
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,300
He really hates needles.

227
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,635
He's being worked on
by excellent doctors.

228
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,703
Can you follow my finger?

229
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,871
But can't you put us
in the same room?

230
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,205
I really need
to talk to him.

231
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,240
When we were
in the accident,

232
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,941
I kinda said a thing,
and I feel terrible.

233
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,110
Well, you're in luck. They pay
me to help people who feel terrible.

234
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,612
Any loss of consciousness?
Dizziness?

235
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,613
I don't think so.

236
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,281
So, what?
You cheated on him?

237
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,283
You stole all his money?
You ran over grandma?

238
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,118
Okay, CT's calling for her.
Do you want to come?

239
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,586
Please and thank you.
Squeeze my hands, please.

240
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,889
I told the paramedics
to save me first.

241
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,390
Over him, my husband.

242
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,226
Yikes. Well, maybe you can
blame that on a brain bleed.

243
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,162
Can you please tell him
I'm okay?

244
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,330
Yeah.
Let's go.

245
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,899
You know
what else she said?

246
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,035
That except for her, no one
would miss me if I died.

247
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,871
She thinks I'm a loner
and no one cares about me.

248
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,706
A lot of people panic
on their wedding day.

249
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,208
I know I did.

250
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,825
Dr. Hunt knows that...

251
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,446
Does this hurt?

252
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,847
Ow! Yeah.

253
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,583
Don't people normally panic
<i>before</i> saying "I do"?

254
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,452
We'd already been married
four hours.

255
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,587
I'm not sure,
but your scan does show

256
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,255
that you have an open-book
pelvic fracture.

257
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,723
We're gonna have to do a CT
to make sure

258
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,225
there's no other
abdominal injuries,

259
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,993
but you<i> will</i> need a
surgery, okay?

260
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,329
Shayne, we're taking
Karissa to CT,

261
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,198
but she is stable
and she's feeling okay.

262
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,633
Let me guess...
She asked to go first.

263
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,635
No, she's very worried
about you.

264
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,471
Good.
Don't tell her how I am.

265
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,872
She doesn't get to know
anything.

266
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:16,988
 Let's go.

267
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,610
I'm just gonna
not tell her anything?

268
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,778
She's terrified.

269
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,061
You know the rules.

270
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,519
It's not just me, right?

271
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,087
This is weird.

272
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,755
Super weird.

273
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,925
It's like we won
the lottery of silence.

274
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,909
Where do we even start?

275
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,930
By getting naked?

276
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,432
Okay.

277
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,316
Loving that.

278
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,538
Whoa, Amelia.

279
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,006
I don't think
you're grasping

280
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,875
the extent
of our freedom here.

281
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,743
There are no
baby monitors.

282
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,245
There are no
homework assignments,

283
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,746
no one's...
No one's hungry.

284
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,081
I'm a little hungry.

285
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,350
Then let's have sex
in the kitchen.

286
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,685
We can do whatever we want.

287
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,853
You realize that?

288
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,522
We can...
We can be loud.

289
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,139
Oh, do you remember
being able to be loud?

290
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,728
What's wrong?

291
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,070
Okay.

292
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,740
All right. Amelia...

293
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,123
look at me.

294
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,911
Oh, my, God. No, no!

295
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,413
No?
Get up, get up!

296
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,249
I-I-I thought you were crying
because my mom and Zola...

297
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,250
No, I'm not!

298
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,552
I'm... I'm not, just...

299
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,588
I just really need
to be crying right now!

300
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,961
Okay.

301
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,001
Marcel tested positive.

302
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,336
He needs to be home,
isolating.

303
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,605
I told him that, but apparently,
he lives with his family...

304
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,607
Six people in
a two-bedroom apartment,

305
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,108
including his grandpa.

306
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,910
He doesn't want
to get them sick.

307
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,245
Can't we just admit him?

308
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,246
Get him some care
and a place...

309
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,447
This is not a hotel,
Schmitt.

310
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,399
He can't afford to stay
anywhere else.

311
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,603
Okay.
Book him a hotel room.

312
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,658
On you?
Are you sure?

313
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,493
It's a matter
of public health, okay?

314
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,330
Anybody needs a room...
just book them a hotel.

315
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,498
No questions.

316
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,167
We got you a hotel.

317
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,743
<i>Dr. Feldman
to the Step Down Unit.</i>

318
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,679
<i>Dr. Feldman
to the Step Down Unit.</i>

319
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:37,947
Chris?

320
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,849
I had to
get out of there for a minute.

321
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:40,984
I understand.

322
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,652
You want to get outside,
get some fresh air?

323
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,987
Or there's a chapel.

324
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,137
So I can pray for
someone else's kid to die?

325
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,596
I lied earlier.

326
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,932
Hollie wasn't
on a work call.

327
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,267
She hasn't signed on to work
in weeks.

328
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,270
I don't know if
it's postpartum depression

329
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,607
or Arthur or the world...

330
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,275
Listen, it's...

331
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,645
It's been a terrible ordeal
for the pair of you.

332
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,114
She's so depressed,
she can't get out of bed.

333
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,049
When COVID hit,

334
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:17,553
seeing people lose
whole families in a week...

335
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,055
we knew
we had to be careful

336
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,557
'cause of Arthur's
heart condition.

337
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,226
And we were.

338
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,728
And in the end,
it didn't matter.

339
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,797
I'm still losing them.

340
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,566
The only thing keeping me going
right now

341
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,070
is the hope for a miracle.

342
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,072
Arthur gets a heart,

343
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,241
Hollie
comes back to life...

344
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,309
and we a family again.

345
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,512
And I know we can't have
our miracle

346
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,547
unless someone else
loses theirs.

347
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,516
Lives what I'm living
right now.

348
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,617
Gets shattered.

349
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,369
And I pray for it anyway.

350
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,024
'Cause Arthur...

351
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,026
He's your son.

352
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,576
I can't lose him,
Dr. Hayes.

353
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,532
We can't lose him.

354
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,700
Please.

355
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,243
How's she looking?

356
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,378
<i>Squirmy.</i>

357
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,346
<i>Karissa...</i>
Did I hear Dr. Wilson?

358
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,514
<i>Is Shayne okay?</i>

359
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,183
Uh...

360
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,020
<i>Sorry, Karissa.
Um, patient confidentiality.</i>

361
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,688
Confidentiality?

362
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,690
From his wife?

363
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,358
Wait.

364
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,194
Did he ask you
not to tell me?

365
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,696
That is also
confidential.

366
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,331
He's still mad.

367
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,668
My sisters said we were crazy
for moving so quickly.

368
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,337
<i>They said three months is not
enough time to get to know</i>

369
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,639
<i>someone you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.</i>

370
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,641
Well, neither is six
years.

371
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,943
Scans are up.

372
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,279
Karissa, you have a very small
contusion on your brain.

373
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,782
It's benign
with a very minor bleed,

374
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,851
so minor I don't think we can
blame it for anything.

375
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,352
<i>Sorry.</i>

376
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,688
<i>But we do have to keep you
overnight for observation.</i>

377
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,356
I was wrong.

378
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,692
<i>I was wrong that
no one would miss him.</i>

379
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,662
Because
it's only been a few hours,

380
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,832
and I miss him so much
I could burst.

381
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,608
Hi.

382
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,109
Got your page.
What's up?

383
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,811
Can you think of
a salvage procedure we can do

384
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,980
on a 14-month-old
with multiple VSDs?

385
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,314
Another one?

386
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,150
We just did one
two weeks ago.

387
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,318
It's the same boy.
Arthur Beaton.

388
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,320
The one
we put on ECMO?

389
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,822
He's hanging on.

390
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,657
What about
a double pump EXCOR?

391
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,858
You know,
an artificial heart

392
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,160
that can take over
for the ventricles...

393
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,662
No, I know what it is.
Uh...

394
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,931
Arthur's chest cavity
is too small.

395
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,433
The cannulas would push up
against his vital organs.

396
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,968
We'd have to
leave him open

397
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,304
<i>and</i> leave him
on a vent.

398
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,807
He's been on ECMO
for 12 days.

399
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,475
I don't think
he has the strength

400
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,810
to withstand
a transplant,

401
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,812
and that's even if
we could find a donor.

402
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,814
So, then,
what do you suggest?

403
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,750
I think you should have
a very difficult conversation

404
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,585
with his parents.
It's time.

405
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,921
Aren't you supposed to be some
sort of genius or something?

406
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,589
Youngest cardio chief
in the country?

407
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,925
More innovative and published
than any of her peers?

408
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,327
So what?
You're just gonna give up?

409
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,996
We have been at this
for months.

410
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,332
We have done everything
we can for that boy.

411
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,334
At this point,
we're just prolonging his pain,

412
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,169
and his family's.

413
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,838
It's not giving up.

414
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,673
It's letting them go on.

415
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,659
I think it just hit me
that it's been months

416
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,328
since I've been able to feel
whatever I want

417
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,165
without worrying that I will
permanently scar a child.

418
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,000
I mean,
the constant pressure

419
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,952
of not ruining a life
is exhausting.

420
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,173
Are you mad

421
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,841
that I shouted no
and made you get up?

422
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,344
No, I'm not mad at you.

423
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,346
I'm mad at my mom
for bringing it up.

424
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,115
Are you... wanting
to get married?

425
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,417
After you shouted no
and made me get up?

426
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,086
No, not so much.

427
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,289
I meant, "No,
you're misreading the moment,"

428
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,292
not, "No, I don't want
to marry you."

429
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,793
So you do want
to marry me?

430
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,629
I wasn't saying
I want to marry you, or...

431
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,063
Or I don't want
to marry you.

432
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,233
I, um... haven't
thought about it.

433
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,902
I haven't had time.
Yeah.

434
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,403
I haven't had time
either,

435
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,739
but I've still
thought about it.

436
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,074
What have you thought?

437
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,413
I love you,
and I love Scout,

438
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,082
and I love us
together, and...

439
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,753
you know, marriage
is, uh, I guess

440
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,155
kinda how society
locks it all in...

441
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,556
Eh, but it doesn't
lock it in.

442
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,724
It doesn't lock it in!
Mnh.

443
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,393
And your parents' divorce
was hell.

444
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,661
It was hell!

445
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,529
And I-I swore that I'd never
put a kid through that.

446
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,530
Mm-hmm.

447
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,666
So...

448
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,568
I know that your mom
has big ideas,

449
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:04,240
and Zola has big
wedding-dress dreams,

450
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,275
but, um...

451
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,726
have you really
changed your mind?

452
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,083
I was a terrible wife.

453
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,085
You had a brain tumor.
I did.

454
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,420
But I'm not sure that

455
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,221
the sexy brain tumor
can take all the credit.

456
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,774
I still think I'm wired
for self-destruction.

457
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,994
Why do you think that?

458
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,231
Because, every day,

459
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,900
for a lot of days now,

460
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,403
I go to sleep thinking about
getting high,

461
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,374
and I wake up thinking about
getting high,

462
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,877
and sometimes, in the middle
of feeding Scout,

463
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,046
I zone out...

464
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,148
and think about
getting high.

465
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,627
...and he won't let me
tell his wife anything.

466
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,597
It's their wedding day,
and he's already over her,

467
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,434
which is just...
It's just sad and messy and...

468
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:09,271
And it's not that
I am sick of adults.

469
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,941
Okay, I'm a little...
I'm a little sick of adults.

470
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,777
Adults are always here
on the worst day of their lives,

471
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,913
and I am so sick
of worst days.

472
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:22,084
And people being terrified of me
because I'm cutting them open.

473
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,755
But with moms,
they want you here,

474
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,590
even though it's scary
sometimes,

475
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,925
because you being there

476
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,261
means that they're getting
to meet their baby,

477
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,763
their dream,

478
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,547
and they can't do it
without my help.

479
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,270
And since, uh...

480
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,939
Since Alex left, um...

481
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,777
my house hasn't been
my happiest place.

482
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,346
So...

483
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,715
I want work to be.

484
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,884
And I think
that you get that.

485
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,552
And I am so grateful to you,

486
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:02,558
because you believed in me
before I believed in myself.

487
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,061
And I will tell you
all of this again

488
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,796
when you're awake.

489
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:13,235
Please, please be awake soon.

490
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,572
Please be well soon.

491
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,742
We can't take any more
worst days around here.

492
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,714
I've booked
18 hotel rooms.

493
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,616
The manager wondered if
you'd rather book a whole floor.

494
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,085
Well, we got
a lot of positives.

495
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,087
Tell him we'll take all the
rooms we can get. Thank you.

496
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,755
I think I've memorized
your credit-card number.

497
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,057
When did hotel stays become
part of the plan?

498
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,892
Well, people need
more than a test,

499
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,661
and quarantining isn't easy
for everybody.

500
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,429
And you realized that today?

501
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,431
Excuse me? You know
he's your boss, right?

502
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,732
I'm sorry. And,
technically, so am I.

503
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,201
I'm sorry. Schmitt,
give us a minute.

504
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,036
Well, don't fire her.
Schmitt!

505
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,806
Come here, please.

506
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,641
I assume that wasn't
your real question.

507
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,977
So would you like to tell me
what is going on?

508
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,313
You're booking up
hotel rooms.

509
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,315
So is Seattle Partners.

510
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,983
Okay.
I've heard of them.

511
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,085
A group of, uh,
community organizations, right?

512
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,088
<i>Longstanding</i>
community organizations

513
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,258
that have been providing housing
and wrap-around services

514
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,594
for people who test positive
for COVID

515
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,262
in low-income
neighborhoods.

516
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,431
Okay. So, the more the better,
so what's the...

517
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,267
Yeah, maybe in theory, but they
can't book their hotel rooms

518
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,768
at their discounted rates

519
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,438
because a local doctor
is booking them at full price!

520
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,273
And hotels are
kicking people out

521
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,942
to make room
for your new arrivals.

522
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,611
I got it.

523
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,613
I apologize.
I didn't... I didn't know that.

524
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,947
Great.

525
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,283
We'll just tell everyone
it wasn't on purpose.

526
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,619
That should keep them
real warm tonight.

527
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,034
Oh, I fell asleep?

528
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,669
I think
it's a defense mechanism.

529
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,638
Noticed you do that.

530
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,772
Do what?

531
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,109
Fall asleep when you are
emotionally overwhelmed.

532
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,444
Some people cry.
Some people talk.

533
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,946
Some people yell.

534
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,115
You... fall asleep.

535
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,551
All right, well, I'm not
avoiding my feelings,

536
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,885
if that's what
you're implying.

537
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,555
I just...
I-I process them better

538
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,657
while I'm unconscious.
Mm.

539
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,894
Okay.
Let's figure this out.

540
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,564
There's not much
to figure out.

541
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,232
I'm an addict.

542
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,900
You're an addict
in recovery.

543
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,902
So, what?
You need to hit up a meeting?

544
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,438
I've talked about it
in meetings.

545
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,940
A lot of us have.

546
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,043
This pandemic feels like
Satan has designed

547
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,611
the perfect set
of circumstances

548
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:38,280
to make sobriety seem
impossible.

549
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,283
Isolation, fear,
futility,

550
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,618
anger, hopelessness.

551
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,386
I mean, name a trigger,

552
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,122
it is stronger.

553
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,791
For the record,
I don't believe in Satan.

554
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,459
I'm just saying
it feels like that.

555
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,462
Also, what's weird is
I'm not even craving pills.

556
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,630
I'm just...

557
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,298
I just want to, like,
drive to a dispensary

558
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,967
and buy some weed
and smoke it.

559
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,301
Well, is that allowed?

560
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,669
To, um... To smoke weed

561
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,671
if that wasn't the thing
that you were addicted to?

562
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,774
Well, there's no such thing as
"allowed" in my program.

563
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,610
There are just
suggestions.

564
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:12,114
And, no,
it is not suggested.

565
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,450
Why not?
Because...

566
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,952
if I smoked weed,

567
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:21,072
it is very likely that I would
forget to not do heroin.

568
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,027
Well...

569
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:28,030
for the record...

570
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:31,033
I would marry you
in a hot minute.

571
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,201
Why?

572
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,536
Because most drug addicts
who crave drugs

573
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,705
just do drugs.

574
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,041
But you don't.

575
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,877
That makes you stronger
than most people.

576
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,046
And cooler.

577
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,384
And the opposite
of self-destructive.

578
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,918
So...

579
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,522
All right, Amelia...

580
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,058
Oh, my God. No, no.

581
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,059
Oh, my God!
Get up!

582
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,395
Got it.

583
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:02,331
Like, not ever
or not today?

584
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,599
Just...

585
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,501
Not when I'm confessing
my darkest secrets

586
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,503
and I have snot
rolling down my face.

587
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,840
Okay.

588
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,275
Is Luna okay?

589
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,576
Yeah, she's fine.

590
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,346
I just needed to see a
friendly face.

591
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,014
I'm about to ask a father

592
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,350
about taking his baby
off life support.

593
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,519
Oh, my God.

594
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:24,853
She's the best.

595
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,188
Doesn't judge.

596
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,856
Isn't selfish.

597
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,026
Isn't bitter or resentful about
the cards she's been dealt.

598
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,862
Oh, I hope she doesn't.

599
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,865
Become bitter or resentful.

600
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,703
I mean, I wouldn't blame her
if she did.

601
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:43,205
I spent a lot of my life
being angry

602
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,507
about the way that
I came into the world.

603
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,509
Took me a long time
to realize

604
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,378
that that anger
didn't serve me.

605
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,881
And the more I let it go,
the better off I'd be.

606
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,551
Letting it go was like...

607
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,654
breaking off the crusty
black pieces of my heart.

608
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,157
It hurt at first,
but with time, it just...

609
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,492
Oh, wow.
Wilson...

610
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,493
What?

611
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,994
Thank you!

612
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,369
The Cooper ligament is
completely destroyed.

613
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,038
Yeah, I think Stoppa
technique's our best bet. Agreed.

614
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,706
Uh, pick-ups?

615
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,475
What a wedding day.

616
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,810
Started with his bride
calling him a loser.

617
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,747
Can't imagine much worse.

618
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,464
Not... that I...

619
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,085
How are the kids?

620
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,587
If you ask me, he's lucky.

621
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,721
How so?

622
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,056
Well, he found out the truth
on day one

623
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,958
instead of
20 years from now.

624
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,260
No house, no kids.
Lucky.

625
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,595
Mayo scissors, please.

626
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,430
And how is Altman?

627
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,931
She'll be back
in a couple days.

628
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,433
That's not why I'm asking.

629
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,602
Respectfully, Chief,

630
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,171
the OR has heard enough
about my personal life, okay?

631
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,672
Mesh.

632
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,673
Thank you.

633
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,509
Hayes, you paged again?

634
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,843
You said there's
not enough space

635
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,961
for a total
artificial heart.

636
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,984
You paged me 911 after
I told you it was impossible?

637
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,319
His chest cavity
is too small. I know.

638
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,322
Too small because his heart's
taking up space.

639
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,824
But what if
we made space?

640
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,826
Sure, let's just
take out his heart.

641
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,661
Don't be ridiculous.

642
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,496
We'll leave
some of it behind.

643
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,707
You want to cut out
part of his heart?

644
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,042
The lower part,
the ventricles,

645
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,710
which are not functioning
properly.

646
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:29,878
So the answer is yes...

647
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,147
You want to cut out
part of his heart.

648
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,383
To create space for
a total artificial heart pump

649
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,018
to act in place of
what we removed.

650
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,521
Have you done this
before?

651
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,224
'Cause it sounds like
you haven't done it before.

652
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,726
We have used the device
on older children.

653
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,061
But in those cases,

654
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,230
we did not have to remove
both ventricles.

655
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:51,515
So you could do this
and it doesn't... work?

656
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,136
Why would you even
suggest...

657
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,205
'Cause Arthur's chances of
survival are exactly the same

658
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,474
as if we did
absolutely nothing.

659
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,375
I know this sounds insane.

660
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,877
But we are running out
of options,

661
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,213
and Arthur is almost
out of time.

662
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,215
You asked me
to save your son, yes?

663
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,732
I am telling you,
this is his best chance.

664
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,087
I need to call Hollie.

665
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,757
She'll want to see him
before...

666
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,426
Just in case.

667
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,927
Of course.

668
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,839
Your surgery went better
than we could have hoped.

669
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,840
Yep.

670
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,008
You may have
a couple months' rehab,

671
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,143
but everything looks good.

672
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,613
Months of rehab,
alone in an apartment

673
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,948
during a pandemic.

674
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,617
Oh, so that's it?

675
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,286
It's been, what, 12 hours,

676
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,621
and you're jumping ship?

677
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:46,955
Bailey, maybe we should
just let them...

678
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,459
Shayne, my parents were together
for over 60 years.

679
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,127
Look,
after my mom passed,

680
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,696
my dad and I were going through
their old photos,

681
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,232
I-looking for something
that we could post

682
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,234
with her obituary.

683
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,403
60 years...

684
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:05,007
is a lot of hairstyles
and fashion trends.

685
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:08,176
Anna mdad told me
that I should just pick,

686
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,579
because when
he looked at them,

687
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:14,082
all he saw was the woman
he fell in love with.

688
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,286
She was still
the same caring, nurturing,

689
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,956
kind-hearted person
she was the day they met.

690
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,692
Look, people are
who they are.

691
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,361
Karissa said some things

692
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:31,199
while you were trapped in a car
and she was terrified.

693
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,869
My guess is...

694
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:37,072
she's still the same person
she was when you met.

695
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,776
You might want to give her
a chance to prove that

696
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,227
before you just
throw it all away.

697
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,798
Is there any way
I can see her?

698
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,787
I'll get you a tablet.

699
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,393
I just got off
with Kelly Bernard,

700
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,795
who runs Seattle Partners.

701
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,464
No one is losing their bed,
nobody's losing a room.

702
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,299
She's gonna point me
in the direction of hotels

703
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,468
so I can sponsor
patient rooms

704
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,303
without getting
in anybody's way.

705
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,976
Oh, come on.

706
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,144
Do you have a problem with
all your attendings or just me?

707
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,312
'Cause I'm trying
to make this right.

708
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,547
I know you are.

709
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,550
It's just, this whole situation
pisses me off.

710
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,051
And, what, that's my fault? No.

711
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,053
No.
It's the whole system.

712
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,889
It's not designed to help the
people that actually need it.

713
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,558
Especially when
they look like us.

714
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,060
Right.
That's why I'm trying to help.

715
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,564
When I was a social worker,
I saw a lot of temporary fixes

716
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,232
that came
from a good place.

717
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,068
But they never get to the root
of the problems.

718
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,404
Hotel rooms are great
for quarantine.

719
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,072
But then people
have to go back

720
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:47,576
to risky jobs
and overcrowded homes.

721
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,578
I know
you're trying to help.

722
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:50,812
It's just that all this

723
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,882
is just...
Is... is too much.

724
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,752

and I wasn't lonely,

874
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,637
and so I thought I could
overlook, basically,

875
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,139
the rest of her personality.

876
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,274
Okay, then maybe we should
do this later. The...

877
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,943
No,
I want to do it now,

878
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,744
and then I want to be
done with it.

879
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,213
You're selfish, Karissa.

880
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:39,714
<i>And you were
the same person today</i>

881
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,217
<i>that you were the day we met,
the same person who ate</i>

882
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,285
<i>all the trail mix
I'd packed for our hike</i>

883
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,187
<i>without offering me
so much as a peanut.</i>

884
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,156
You're dumping me
over a peanut?

885
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,325
<i>It's an example.
One of many.</i>

886
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,494
You're the center
of your own universe,

887
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,963
and I'd rather be alone
than with someone

888
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,299
who isn't capable of
considering anyone but herself.

889
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,235
Well, now I feel
terrible.

890
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,270

891

every hour of it.

896
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,383

of giving up.

I gotta call Hollie!

900
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:22,957
Of course.

901
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,126
Honey, he's okay!

902
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,462
He's okay.

903
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,631
And he's... bionic.

904
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,966
Just for a little while, Hollie.

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,235
Soon as a donor heart comes up,
we'll remove the machine.

913
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:57,358

I'm too tired to ride my bike.

914
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,194
Well, if I'm driving,
you're cooking.

915
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,663
Ugh, who knew sticking things
up people's noses

916
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:02,830
would be so exhausting?

917
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,832
Wilson,
you got a minute?

918
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,001
Sure, yeah.
What's... What's up?

919
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,504
Oh, I was hoping
you could tell me.

925
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,651

Zola's reading

And the others
fell asleep

00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:39,500

Toad's bathing suit. Mm.

930
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,502
And this guy's down.

00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,607
How long can your parents live
in the driveway?

932
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,210
So my mom can keep
"accidentally" referring to you

933
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,545
