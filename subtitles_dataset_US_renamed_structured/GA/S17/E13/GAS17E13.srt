'Cause I...

111
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,517
Sorry. It's just,
I had a dream about Mer.

112
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,352

113
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,622

114
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,557
Um, you know,
it's still early days,

115
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,593
you're only four months
post surgery,

116
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:13,763
and it was
a decent-sized tear.

117
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,962
<i>This is the last season

118
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,396

119
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,931
Why are you still here?

120
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:21,125
Right. I'm gone.

121
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,135
Uh... yeah, Felix, it's gonna
take a little bit more patience.

122
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,313

00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,140

125
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:28,708

a-are you right-handed?

00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,469
<i>Yeah.</i>
Amelia.

127
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,445
I know this is weird.
I'm... I'm a surgeon, too,

128
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,315
and I just, uh, wanted
to check one thing with you.

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,818
H-Have you noticed
that your left arm

130
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,686
feels stronger
than your right arm recently?

131
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,288
<i>I guess so.
Kinda?</i>

132
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,531
<i>Why?</i>
What the hell?

133
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,859
If this is
a neurological issue,

134
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,327
it could end more than
just his career

135
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:49,929
if it goes untreated, so
I'm...

136
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:53,299
Hey. I just want to to over a
couple maneuvers with you, okay?

137
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:54,600
Okay.

138
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,536
Meredith's vitals
have been stable for days.

139
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,639
Her X-rays have shown
a remarkable improvement,

140
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:02,617
and her oxygen requirements
have gone down.

141
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,220
Which is why
she should be awake

142
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,557
for more than two minutes
at a time.

143
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,352
Why isn't she?

144
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:11,125
What is it?

145
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:13,944
Her labs this morning showed
elevated liver enzymes.

146
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,770
It might just be a side
effect from the medications,

147
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,367
but we do want to order
some new tests.

148
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:22,395
And we'd also like to get CTs,
both chest and abdomen.

149
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,227
It might seem extensive,
but...

150
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:25,832
Well, let's do it.

151
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,352
We're seeing more and more
patients in the same position.

152
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:31,358
It seems like they're finally
out of the woods,

153
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,702
and then
some new problem arises

154
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,961
and they just...

155
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,630
they just crash.

156
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,309
We can't let this happen
to Meredith.

157
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,344
Were you in pain?

158
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:56,744
You know, the worst part
was knowing

159
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,156
they were
getting it wrong.

160
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,453
I didn't want
to leave you,

161
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,297
but I knew, you know,
at a certain point...

162
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,641
I came
to the hospital.

163
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,344
I know.

164
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,174
You could hear?

165
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,932
Not through my ears.

166
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,704
Dying is exhausting.

167
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:26,156
You know that point
as a surgeon...

168
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,293
you've done everything
for your patient.

169
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:31,695
I could try and will them
to fight,

170
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,232
will them to live,

171
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,594
but I never understood
the level of exhaustion.

172
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,609
There comes a point

173
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:45,836
where the desire to rest
overrides the desire to live.

174
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,273
You got that.

175
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,187
You gave me permission
to go.

176
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,714
You told me it was okay.

177
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:58,516
You got me.

178
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:03,383
You gave me everything I needed
until my last breath.

179
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,696
Do you need more time
to think about it?

180
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:19,234
No.

181
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:21,500
Okay.

182
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,285
And your answer is...

183
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,031
I just told you.
No.

184
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,120
Bailey...

185
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,356
I didn't come
to this decision lightly,

186
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,024
and without
your recommendation,

187
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,494
I may have to redo
my entire intern year.

188
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,163
Only if you were
changing specialities,

189
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,664
which you are not doing.

190
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:40,199
That is not your decision
to make.

191
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,201
It's not.
No. It's yours,

192
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:44,637
and you made it
when you signed a contract

193
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,238
as a general surgery
attending.

194
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,174
It's got a few more years on it,
last time I checked.

195
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:49,709
Bailey, you can't...

196
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,510
I-I need this.

197
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,380
And I need surgeons,
Wilson.

198
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,783
I'm losing them
to, uh, sickness, exhaustion,

199
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,119
hell, murder,
or in Avery's case,

200
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,355
just suddenly taking
a leave of absence.

201
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,056
Y-You need to think
about the hospital.

202
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,158
I can't afford to lose you
right now,

203
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:08,661
especially
when Meredith...

204
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,602
Look, we can, um, revisit
this topic

205
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:18,738
after this thing is over,

206
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,422
but for right now,
my answer is no.

207
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,579
Okay.
Felix is headed in.

208
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:28,347
Mm. Great.

209
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:31,150
Uh... Is he set up for his MRI
in case he beats us there?

210
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:32,852
Yes. You know,
I would have caught

211
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,720
- that right-sided deficit.
- Yeah, I know you would have.

212
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,222
We had just started.
I was focused on the shoulder.

213
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:37,356
Yeah, I know you were.

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,758
Not to mention
I kept getting distracted.

215
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:40,059
All my fault. I got it.

216
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,193
I'm ready.

217
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:42,294
No, we...
We can't leave.

218
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:43,329
Maggie's not here yet.

219
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,663
Oh, well,
that means<i> you</i> can't,

220
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,132
but I can,
and I should.

221
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,900
Or, you know,
I could call Koracick

222
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,168
and you could stay here.

223
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:50,403
Well, this was my find.

224
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,304
Oh, I'm sorry. You wouldn't
want somebody waltzing in

225
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,773
and stealing your patient? W...

226
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:54,840
Please don't take this
from me.

227
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,642
I have not operated
in over a month.

228
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,177
Oh, and this sudden need
to operate has nothing to do

229
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,912
with your sister
still being unconscious?

230
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,447
Nope.

231
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,515
I just
really miss cutting.

232
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,582
Got it.

233
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,618
- Okay.
- I-I'm still coming.

234
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:06,986
Hey.
Great to see you, Maggie.

235
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,853
Thanks for all the help.

236
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:09,971
Um, everybody's eaten.

237
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,673
Hi?

238
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,631
I take it this is a new hobby?

239
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,266
Should have started
with the plow stop,

240
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,435
but my kids wanted
to learn the moonwalk.

241
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,227
I was killing it
until I hit that railing.

242
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:26,772
My mom
would never do that.

243
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,108
She's a total worry...
Dr. Schmitt, order tib/fib X-rays

244
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,643
and page me when they're done,
please.

245
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:33,879
Okay, Erika, I'd like to
do an abdominal ultrasound.

246
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,147
Oh. Nice.

247
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,383
I've lost 50 pounds
in Q-tine.

248
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,151
Check out these abs.

249
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,152
Damn.

250
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,954
That railing ate me alive.

251
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:43,328
- Yep.
- Oh.

252
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:45,354
Okay, let me know
if this hurts at all.

253
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:49,232
50 pounds, huh?

254
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,499
Tech lawyer. Boatloads of money,
but... tech lawyer.

255
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,235
Sedentary job,
sedentary life.

256
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,961
Then COVID hit, and I figured,
if the world's ending,

257
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,198
I might as well be happy.

258
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:03,509
I was so tired of being tired,
you know?

259
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,478
So, I quit that job
that I hated,

260
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,012
spent time with my kids,

261
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:08,581
started working out,

262
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:11,283
then I started my own business
making peanut brittle.

263
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,752
Ooh. Try some.

264
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,488
Ooh.

265
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,123
No eating
in the hospital.

266
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:20,392
Um, so, Erika, it looks like
you have some bleeding

267
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:21,894
under
your abdominal muscle,

268
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:25,664
so we'll need to do a CT
to evaluate how severe it is.

269
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:27,949
Alright, page me
when she's ready, Schmitt.

270
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,370
I won't tell
if you won't.

271
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:41,437
And I know we've only
technically met on the phone...

272
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:44,613
but I'm marrying
your sister,

273
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,352
so how about you wake up

274
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,486
and give me a "Congratulations"
or something?

275
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:51,223
I mean,
I heard you were tough,

276
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,874
but I didn't think
you were cold.

277
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,631
I want you closer.

278
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:00,533
You're worried
about the kids.

279
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,667
If you get closer...

280
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,068
I'll never leave.

281
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,204
I think
that's the theory.

282
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:08,107
Your dad died
when you were young.

283
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,074
Yes.

284
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:10,309
And it almost ruined me.

285
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,211
But it didn't.

286
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,913
Kids survive.

287
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,182
And struggle
makes them stronger.

288
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,284
Sometimes. Sometimes,
it makes them stronger,

289
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:22,354
and sometimes,
it makes them...

290
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,556
Amelia.

291
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,359
She's doing great,
by the way.

292
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:29,061
- I know.
- And she named her baby...

293
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,129
I know!

294
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:35,267
Oh.

295
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,251
People love you,
Meredith.

296
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,106
People need you.

297
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,875
I'm tired.

298
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,343
Your body's tired.

299
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,711
But your soul...

300
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:49,081
Your soul won't even
let me near you.

301
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:51,198
You're still fighting.

302
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,521
Have you seen
the last...

303
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,471
one or two years?

304
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,025
Yeah.

305
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:02,294
Was that hard for you?

306
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,764
It's harder watching you
be lonely.

307
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,272
I want to say
you're beautiful,

308
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:16,642
but it's... shallow.

309
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,544
Say "pretty on the inside."

310
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:20,379
That's what I tell Zola
to say.

311
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,115
"Be pretty
on the inside."

312
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,818
You're pretty on the inside,
Meredith Grey.

313
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,029
- How's Grey?
- Not getting better.

314
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:40,766
She won't stay awake, and her
liver enzymes are elevated.

315
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,268
Any sign
of acute infection?

316
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:43,636
No, but that
doesn't mean anything

317
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,063
because
this stupid disease causes

318
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,337
every complication
in the book

319
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,973
without any consistency
whatsoever.

320
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:49,174
Well, it's still
relatively new.

321
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:50,943
There's information coming out
every day, and...

322
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,177
Yeah,<i> vague</i> information.

323
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,280
We have no idea
how this disease

324
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:55,981
is gonna affect these patients
in the long-term.

325
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,549
I mean, there could be
permanent lung scarring,

326
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,052
vascular damage,
neurological issues...

327
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,383
Eh, oh, no, please,
keep... keep going.

328
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,019
Tom, I didn't...

329
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,491
I'm... I'm sorry.
That's...

330
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,664
I'm sure that you're fine.

331
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:09,305
Alright.
She's all set.

332
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,579
Okay. Great. Thanks.

333
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,332
Tom, I'm sorry.
I...

334
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,633
Hey, Doc,
you're just stating facts.

335
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:15,834
Don't be sorry.

336
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,504
Okay.

337
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,911
What happened?

338
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,313
Carolyn Hexton.

339
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:29,547
Cardiac arrest.

340
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,182
When I talked
with her yesterday,

341
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,618
she didn't even
need oxygen.

342
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:35,220
Yeah, and then she started
having arrhythmias,

343
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,589
and then she went
into V-fib.

344
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:38,883
37 years old.

345
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,286
Kindergarten teacher.

346
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,771
She ran 10ks
for charity.

347
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:46,172
I thought she'd be going home
this week.

348
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,732
Yeah.
So did she.

349
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,001
We all did.

350
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,871
I got to call her family.

351
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,592
Hello, Mrs. Hexton.
This is Dr. Hunt.

352
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,328
No. No, um...

353
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:20,129
No. She...
Uh, she's, uh...

354
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:26,004
Um, there were
some complications.

355
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:29,341
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hexton.

356
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:31,477
Could you give me one moment,
please?

357
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,181
<i>Dr. Seip.
Dr. Tracy Seip to Recovery.</i>

358
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:44,849
Please tell me
you're not eating in...

359
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,829
I'm not! I'm not!
I'm just, uh... I'm smelling.

360
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,260
I-I miss smelling things.

361
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:51,597
Smell things after work
in the comfort of your own home.

362
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,482
My home smells like
unwashed laundry.

363
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,071
It's impressive, huh?

364
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:01,240
Leaving a successful career,

365
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,307
getting in shape,

366
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,442
being there
for your family.

367
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:07,112
She really made lemonade
out of, um...

368
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:10,015
a-a very deadly virus.

369
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,384
Must be nice.

370
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,119
You think she should be doing
something different?

371
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:18,190
I think if I suddenly started
baking snickerdoodles

372
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,359
and going base jumping,

373
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,861
do me a favor
and throw a big net over me.

374
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,530
It's peanut brittle.

375
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,665
It's... It's actually
a-a lot harder to master

376
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:27,766
than snickerdoodles.

377
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,034
Scans are up.

378
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:31,069
Mm. Mm.

379
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:33,071
Okay.
Deep breaths, buddy.

380
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:36,675
She told me to drop everything
I was doing and rush to the ER.

381
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,343
Well, Dr. Shepherd has a
tendency...

382
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:41,947
...to, uh, raise the stakes
of any situation.

383
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,482
MRI results will be back
in a second.

384
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:46,218
You look worried, and he keeps
telling me I'm gonna be fine.

385
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:48,687
Dr. Shepherd,
baseball is Felix's life.

386
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,189
It's what got him
into junior college,

387
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,356
and it's his only hope
of getting

388
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,458
into a Division I school.

389
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:53,625
What would you do
if suddenly,

390
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,827
you couldn't be a surgeon
anymore?

391
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,296
You paged Koracick?

392
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,730
No. Radiology did.

393
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,447
Uh. Be right back.

394
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:04,002
He has a meningioma,
C6, 7.

395
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,104
Let me look at it,
please.

396
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,773
That is
a nasty little tumor.

397
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,209
We'll have to do an intricate
multi-level decompression.

398
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:11,910
Start with a wide excision,

399
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,745
but that will destabilize
his cervical spine,

400
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:14,980
so he'll need hardware.

401
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:16,281
Forget
about his pitching arm.

402
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,183
Any slip, and you risk
making him a paraplegic.

403
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,486
I mean, but there's a lot
going on with your sister

404
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,620
and our lives.

405
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,255
It's been a long time
since...

406
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,424
I'm not that rusty,
thank you.

407
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,625
You can go, Tom.

408
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:27,993
Alright,
one millimeter off...

409
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,528
I said you can go, Tom.

410
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:30,796
And, uh,
if you want to help,

411
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,948
you can comfort the patient
while I book an OR.

412
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:40,239
How we doing today?

413
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:41,373
Oh, you know,

414
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:44,209
just thinking
about how selfish it is

415
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,078
to follow my dreams.

416
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:48,013
I meant Luna,
but, uh, good to know.

417
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:49,982
Luna's trending upwards,

418
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:54,386
so Luna is a bright spot
in a sea of unfettered misery.

419
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,521
What's all this
about dreams?

420
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:56,822
I want to switch to OB,

421
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,390
but Bailey said
it's a bad time.

422
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,425
Ah,
she's not wrong there.

423
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,194
Thank you.

424
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,829
Listen, everything
will sort itself out

425
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:04,897
once Grey's
back on her feet.

426
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,532
<i>If</i> she gets back
on her feet.

427
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,634
Well, I thought she was
on the mend.

428
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:10,168
We all did.

429
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,571
Well, how bad is it?

430
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:15,440
Her liver enzymes
are elevated this morning,

431
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:16,808
and her creatinine
is worse,

432
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:21,413
so her kidneys could be failing,
and nobody knows why.

433
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,682
God, it's just one thing
after another, isn't it?

434
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,818
This is my way of remembering
that there is more to the world

435
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,721
than just misery
and death.

436
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,290
At least,
I hope there is.

437
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,727
I'll get out
of your way.

438
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:44,102
Tell me
you found something.

439
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:46,738
Meredith's chest CT was clear.

440
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:49,207
However,
her abdominal CT wasn't.

441
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,377
We found a filling defect
in her IVC and hepatic vein.

442
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:53,812
And is that clot
in her liver?

443
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:55,747
Yes, which explains
why she can't stay awake.

444
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,516
Her body's fighting a build-up
of ammonia.

445
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,953
It's a small clot, but
if we don't treat it quickly,

446
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:02,421
then there could be
fluid build-up,

447
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,523
which will just wreak havoc
on her liver.

448
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,426
Can you do, uh, an IR shunt
or thrombolytics, or...

449
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,728
A TIPS procedure should be done
in the IR suite, for sure,

450
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,863
but I don't think
I should do it.

451
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:13,098
Why not?

452
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,067
Because Dr. Altman's here,

453
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,970
and because Dr. Grey
is Maggie's sister,

454
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,039
and if anything...
Dr. Altman...

455
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:23,424
are you sure
you're up to this?

456
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,311
It's a simple procedure.

457
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,280
I know what it is.

458
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:29,615
I'm asking, are you...

459
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:32,417
I will book
an IR suite.

460
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:33,585
Altman...

461
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,990
...are you sure?

462
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,941
Meredith doesn't have time
for this conversation.

463
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,166
Hey.

464
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,701
Webber send you
to check in on me?

465
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,169
No. No, he told me
what was going on

466
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:53,105
and asked me if we thought
you were okay to operate.

467
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,540
And? And I told him
you were fine to operate

468
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,275
and there was no one better
to do it.

469
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,212
Thank you. And I also told him
that if something goes wrong,

470
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:01,413
either something
within your control

471
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:02,514
or something
outside of it,

472
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,383
I'm not sure
that you'll recover.

473
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,723
I lost a kindergarten teacher
today.

474
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,792
I had to call her family.
I broke down on the phone.

475
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,427
I don't know if they knew
that I was crying

476
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,662
or if they thought
that I was choking,

477
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:19,097
but I was pretty much
doing both.

478
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:22,300
Never in my career
have I... cried

479
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,036
while delivering news
to a family.

480
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,037
It is unprofessional,

481
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,872
and honestly,
it is embarrassing.

482
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,341
And after all we saw in the war,
all that loss,

483
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,943
and this kindergarten teacher
that I barely knew

484
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:34,528
just... broke me.

485
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:37,683
Because, uh...

486
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,151
Because COVID.

487
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:40,267
Yeah.

488
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,255
You've been through a lot,
Teddy,

489
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:47,325
and you just came back,
and it is<i> Meredith.</i>

490
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,560
If something goes wrong...

491
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,911
I might not recover.

492
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,301
Can you page Dr. Ndugu for me,
please?

493
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:24,796
Dr. Shepherd, I've worked
with a lot of neurosurgeons.

494
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,732
None of them
were as good as you.

495
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,366
One millimeter
in the wrong direction,

496
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,336
and I end
this kid's career.

497
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,337
That's what Tom said.

498
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,371
<i>That is what he said,</i>

499
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:34,840
and that's what I said.

500
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:37,624
<i>But you are
Amelia Shepherd.</i>

501
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:41,146
<i>So you got this.</i>

502
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,333
What's she doing?

503
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,602
She's getting ready
to crush it.

504
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,842
Did something happen?

505
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:13,245
Yeah, you'll be
joining me. Okay.

506
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:15,480
She's not just your family
or Maggie's.

507
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:17,582
She's mine.
She's everyone's.

508
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,518
So, she's gonna have
two of the finest

509
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,586
cardiovascular surgeons
in the country,

510
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,788
and we're
not gonna think about

511
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,322
what she means to us
or to everyone.

512
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:27,459
We are gonna help each other do
what we know how to do,

513
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,462
and we will watch
each other's every move.

514
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:33,465
No ego. There's no question
that's too stupid to ask.

515
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,133
It's just about the work,

516
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,769
and we are going to remove
this clot.

517
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,004
Deal.

518
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,372
Okay, then.

519
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:43,141
Here we go.

520
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,943
Ultrasound?

00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:49,581
♪ Wake up miles 'round ♪

522
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:51,283
Ellis draws this picture
of us.

523
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,517
I'm in a wedding dress.
Uh-huh.

524
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:53,819
And then
you're in a suit.

525
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,555
I showed her the Post-it Note,
but she just...

526
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:57,989
Hates it.
Hates it.

527
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:59,558
She feels robbed.

528
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,026
Well, she gets that

I hate weddings.

00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:17,658
But I would give this to her
if I could.

When my teachers try to talk
about it,

554
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,744
they get really weird
and seem scared to say anything.

555
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,212
That happens.

556
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,581

00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:30,749

But she doesn't even know
what's happening.

561
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:38,556
She says she works
at the best hospital

562
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,724
with the best doctors.

563
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:40,992
She does. We do.

564
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,276
Then why isn't she home?

565
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,564
You know Dr. Fox?

566
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:50,268
She told me
to try something

567
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,671
when I'm really upset
that really helped.

568
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,539
What?

569
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:56,308
Screaming.

570
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:57,642
I'm serious.

571
00:23:57,726 --> 00:23:58,743
It'll wake up the baby.

572
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,845
It's okay.
It's time for his bottle anyway.

573
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,448
Come on. Come on.

574
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:04,382
Okay.

575
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,518
Come on.
Shake it off. Ready?

576
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:10,422
One, two, three.

577
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:29,641
Your CT shows what's called
a rectus sheath hematoma.

578
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:30,775
It's when you have bleeding

579
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,377
under
your middle abdominal muscles.

580
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:33,912
Banged myself up good,
didn't I?

581
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:36,147
And your
blood counts are a little low,

582
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,149
so we'll need
to watch you overnight

583
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,752
to make sure the bleeding
doesn't get worse.

584
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,721
Well, your tib/fib
fracture should heal nicely

585
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,189
without surgery,
but we're gonna need

586
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:45,890
to put you in a cast
before you're discharged,

587
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,659
which you'll have to be in
for about six weeks.

588
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:49,461
Mm, I can make brittle
from a chair.

589
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:55,000
Must take a lot of peanuts to
make what you made as a lawyer.

590
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:56,735
I-I'd need a factory
for that.

591
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,604
Yeah.

592
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:02,307
You think I'm crazy,
don't you?

593
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:03,742
I didn't say anything.

594
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:06,544
There was this poem I read
in high school.

595
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:08,380
This lady stood
near a cliff,

596
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:10,582
afraid to get close to the edge
for a better view

597
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,118
because she thought
she might fall.

598
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:15,286
But then
someone pushed her.

599
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,888
Was the poem
about murder?

600
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:20,725
No, because she didn't fall...

601
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:22,127
She flew.

602
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:24,195
The cliff was a metaphor...

603
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,331
It's what
we're afraid will happen.

604
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:28,700
There's so much
the world tells us we need

605
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:30,969
that we don't really need.

606
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:34,039
Couldn't see it
until I took the jump...

607
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:36,174
Isssh...

608
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,876
beautiful...

609
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,778
Shhhhome...

610
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,346
Uh...

611
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,463
Oh.
Pulse is thready.

612
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,251
Hematoma's expanding.

613
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:47,252
She's actively bleeding.

614
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:48,353
Let's get her to the OR.

615
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,155
We're coming up
to the OR!

616
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:57,262
Stent looks patent
after the procedure.

617
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:58,963
And liver enzymes?
The creatinine?

618
00:25:59,047 --> 00:25:59,898
Already improving.

619
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,766
Then why
isn't she waking up?

620
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,502
It takes time. We have given
her time. We have given her time,

621
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:06,438
and every test
and every treatment.

622
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,873
We removed that clot
perfectly... perfectly...

623
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:10,241
And she's still
not waking up,

624
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,377
and she's still not improving,
and she's still not going home.

625
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,411
Why isn't she?
Altman, there is...

626
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:14,412
I'm sorry.
I-I can't.

627
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:15,780
I have to take a walk.

628
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,455
More suction.

629
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,326
Ah, there's the inferior
epigastric artery. Mm.

630
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,961
Hemostat.

631
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:33,364
Yeah, looks like she'll live
to skate another day.

632
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:34,799
2-0 silk.

633
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:37,836
You know how a pearl is formed,
Schmitt?

634
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,904
Should I?

635
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:45,710
It all starts with one
very irritating grain of sand.

636
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,645
The oyster
doesn't like it,

637
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,648
wants to keep its shell
pristine.

638
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:52,650
So,
to get rid of the sand,

639
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:56,721
the oyster coats it with
the inner layer of its shell.

640
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,891
Then we're gonna tie off the
collateral while we're in there.

641
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:01,192
Good.

642
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,694
Perfect.

643
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:05,330
But that just makes
the sand bigger.

644
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,166
And even more annoying
to the oyster.

645
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:13,771
So, the oyster just keeps adding
layer after layer,

646
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,908
until... a pearl.

647
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,043
Lap pads.

648
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:20,411
So, I'm the sand,

649
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:23,348
and you're trying
to transform me?

650
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:24,983
The story wasn't about you,
Schmitt.

651
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,185
The<i> pandemic</i> is the sand,

652
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:30,588
and it's pushed its way
into all of our homes,

653
00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:35,293
but it doesn't mean
it has to ruin everything.

654
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:38,930
Maybe it is an opportunity
to transform.

655
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:42,000
Maybe Erika here has
the right idea.

656
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,850
I guess that's what
Jo Wilson's doing, right?

657
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,372
Now, why would you bring up
losing one of my best surgeons

658
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,774
when I just got
to my happy place?

659
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,877
Goodness.

660
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:57,482
Goodbye, tumor.

661
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,118
You two
really are co-dependent.

662
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:03,121
She ask you
to chaperone?

663
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,222
Nope.

664
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,858
Just living vicariously.

665
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:07,959
You here to chaperone?

666
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:09,961
No.

667
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:10,995
Don't tell her
I said this,

668
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,764
but Shepherd's fun to watch
in there.

669
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,799
Elegant,
focused, confident.

670
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:17,602
Pippen to my Jordan.

671
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,070
What do you hear
about Meredith?

672
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:20,104
Uh, I don't.

673
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:22,974
Uh, I... don't.

674
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:25,410
I largely try to avoid that
entire wing of the hospital

675
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:28,880
because... God.

676
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:32,617
When is it
just too much, Lincoln?

677
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:34,786
When do we get to scream
at God?

678
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,321
When do we get to open
a bottle of Scotch

679
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,122
and pour him
a giant God-sized glass,

680
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,658
push it across the table, and
when he's too drunk to smite us,

681
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:44,062
just scream...

682
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,413
"What kind of
a sick joke is this?"

683
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:52,686
I don't get how kids still
get cancer during all this.

684
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:56,923
What kind of a sick joke
is this?

685
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:01,646
Is she awake?

686
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,263
No.

687
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:05,783
What if we did
something wrong?

688
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:06,818
You didn't.

689
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,319
What if we caused the clot
to break off

690
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,121
and now she's having
a massive stroke?

691
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,390
Teddy, there's nothing that
indicates any of that, okay?

692
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,192
Then why isn't she awake?

693
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:17,562
Teddy, breathe, okay?

694
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,297
Just... Just breathe.

695
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:20,431
Listen, hold my hand.

696
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,734
Can you feel my hand?

697
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,736
Okay. Just feel that
and just concentrate on that.

698
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,438
Concentrate on the weight
of my hand on your hand.

699
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:31,576
Good.

700
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,478
No. No. No.

701
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:34,512
Owen, please...
Teddy, no.

702
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:37,849
Listen, I'm here.

703
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,784
I am here with you.

704
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:41,686
Okay?

705
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,322
But you need to feel this,
Teddy.

706
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:45,623
Just feel it.

707
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:03,207
Dr. Webber,
maybe you should go.

708
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,243
Why? Because
it's only my first day,

709
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:09,580
and I want to try something that
could very well get me fired.

710
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,715
Absolutely not.

711
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,650
<i>Well,
at least hear the man out.</i>

712
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,585
I've heard.

713
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:16,754
Zola is
already traumatized.

714
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:19,357
<i>I am not bringing her
to the hospital.</i>

715
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,059
We need to do something,
Maggie.

716
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:23,094
Hearing her daughter,
feeling her?

717
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:26,197
Maybe it could help. Winston,
if your mother or my mother

718
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,465
could have stayed and lived,

719
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,300
they would have stayed
and lived,

720
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:31,402
but people
don't just decide.

721
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:32,970
<i>It's not a choice.</i>

722
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,972
Our mothers
were terminally ill,

723
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:36,607
<i>but Meredith...</i>

724
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:39,192
<i>we have fixed the only thing
we found that was wrong.</i>

725
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:44,048
It's too much
to put on a child.

726
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,783
<i>All she'll know is that
she's coming to see her mom,</i>

727
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,486
which she wants to do anyway,
and Meredith's negative now.

728
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,822
It's safe. <i>Maggie, you
know good and well</i>

729
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:53,658
that there is a psychological
component to recovery.

730
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:55,093
I've seen it
again and again.

731
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:56,394
I have, too.

732
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:58,296
Well, don't you think
it's at least worth trying?

733
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,664
Maggie, whether it works
or it doesn't,

734
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:02,248
<i>at least Zola
gets to see her mom again.</i>

735
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:07,086
Let me call you back.

736
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:10,074
Hey.

737
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:11,342
I want to go.

738
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:13,044
I want to see Mommy.

739
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,553
You got it?

740
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:23,888
All of it?

741
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,124
All of it.

742
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,426
And my arms?

743
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,161
You show us.

744
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:35,099
Oh.

745
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,571
Alright,
you get some rest.

746
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,476
Okay.
I need Scout.

747
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,412
I know. We haven't even
been gone that long.

748
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,580
I miss him, too.
Ooh, no, my boobs hurt.

749
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,682
I need to nurse or pump.

750
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:52,517
Or both.

751
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:54,452
And let's go.
Hmm.

752
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:57,588
Bandage is clean and dry
and intact.

753
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,157
No evidence of bleeding.

754
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,291
How's your pain, Erika?

755
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,659
Nothing I can't handle.

756
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,361
How long
until I can work again?

757
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:05,512
Well, you'll be back
in brittle business in no time.

758
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:10,268
I meant work-work,
not brittle.

759
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:12,003
At least,
if anyone's hiring.

760
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,271
To the job you hate?

761
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:16,107
To the job that keeps me alive
and in one piece,

762
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:17,775
and keeps my kids fed.

763
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,410
Quarantine was
a nice vacation,

764
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:21,279
but I can't live
in the clouds.

765
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:23,114
I need
to be realistic.

766
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:25,383
God,
what was I thinking?

767
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:28,853
That this world
had more to offer.

768
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,388
Oh, Erika.

769
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:34,025
You know, that...
That feeling

770
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:36,160
that you have to keep going
no matter what,

771
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:38,329
that it's all
on your shoulders...

772
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:43,201
It's something
that we're taught as women,

773
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:44,902
as Black women.

774
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:47,205
And I'm guilty of it.

775
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,207
And the pressure
to keep this place running?

776
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:54,111
I never used to
take any breaks.

777
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,413
I never used to
let down my guard.

778
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:58,749
I never...
I never took breaks.

779
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,153
And then I had a heart attack
in my 40s.

780
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,489
"Rest" is not
a dirty word.

781
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:07,558
Rest is... not laziness,

782
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:08,626
no matter
what you're told

783
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,828
or how many times
you're told it.

784
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,631
Rest...
Rest is love.

785
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:15,900
Rest is peace.

786
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:22,206
Rest is a beautiful model
for your children.

787
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,208

No. I will not be

surgeries

846
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,454
are non-existent anymore,

847
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:53,858
and if I have to hire
a new general surgeon,

848
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:56,060
I will,
but that's not your problem.

849
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:58,562
That's mine. I will help
you find anyone to...

850
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:00,965
Eh...

851
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,767
Thank you. Thank you.

852
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,969
Just love it, Wilson.

853
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:08,906
Love it

854
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:16,247
Hey.

855
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:18,315
How's the, uh,
peanut brittle woman doing?

856
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,017
Heard you had to rush her
into surgery.

857
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,220
Nico, I think you're standing
on a cliff and you're scared.

858
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:26,290
Sounds a little crazy because
you're never scared of anything,

859
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:29,927
but me having a little space
in your apartment...

860
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,896
It's not
the end of the world.

861
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,698
Doesn't mean
I'll never leave.

862
00:36:33,782 --> 00:36:36,567
It doesn't mean
that we're getting married.

863
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:39,503
It just... It means
that you're carving out

864
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:43,307
a small amount of room
for me.

865
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,642
Huh.

866
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:46,343
Well, move in with me.

867
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,247
You're right. I guard
my own space out of habit

868
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:53,851
because it makes me feels safe,
but safe from what?

869
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,953
You?

870
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:59,156
I love you, Levi.

871
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,825
So just...

872
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:02,860
move in with me.

873
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:05,963
Oh, I just... I just remembered
I can't come over tonight.

874
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:08,733
Jo is really sad
about Jackson leaving.

875
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:09,967
She is? What?

876
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:12,536
Yeah, and I-I promised her
that I'd hang out.

877
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,705
But... great talk.

878
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:15,573
Levi!

879
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:16,574
See you tomorrow.

880
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:19,243
Hey.
Hey.

881
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,579
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Bailey said yes!

882
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:23,214
Great. What are we
watching?

883
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,715
Wait, what happened
