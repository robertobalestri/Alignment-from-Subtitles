00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,144
<i>In some residency programs,</i>

2
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,320
<i>graduating surgeons
get a wooden chair,</i>

3
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,106
<i>emblazoned with the emblem
of their program.</i>

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,543
<i>♪ Thug life, baby</i>

5
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,373
<i>♪ It chose me,

6
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,896

<i>♪ Well, tell me,

11
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,897
<i>When those residents
become attendings,</i>

12
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,263
the chair usually goes
in their office,

13
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,267
where it collects dust
for the rest of their careers.

14
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:42,366

17
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:48,042
Well, don't just stare at me.
Did I pass?

18
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,783
Not only did you pass,

19
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:53,178
but your lung capacity
is 50% greater than we'd expect.

20
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,702
And your sats are consistently
in the high 90s.

21
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,573
Mer, you killed it.Yeah.

22
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,707
So, as long as your labs check
out, we're kicking you out.

23
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,709
Are you happy?

24
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,103
I am happy.
I'm just not sure I believe you.

25
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,800
We are going to have
this framed.

26
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:08,976
Well, I am.
I'm having it framed.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,022
You give your program years
of your life,

28
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,806
your sweat, your tears,

29
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,982
and in my case, at least,
your blood,

30
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,810
and your program
gives you a chair.

31
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:18,159
Oh.
Please.

32
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,161
Give me some good news.
Is it happening?

33
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:21,554
Is it finally happening?

34
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:22,903
Yeah, looks like
it's finally happening.

35
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,864
Perez, let's get
a clap-out ready.

36
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:28,779
And you know what?
Keep it quiet.

37
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,868
I want it to be a surprise.

38
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,826
Understood.
I know how to handle a queen.

39
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,960
Ah.
Mm.

40
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:38,658
DeLuca took
such good care of her.

41
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:40,660
We need to tell her
about DeLuca.

42
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:44,272
I wish he could see this.

43
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,448
Maybe he can.

44
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,194
I suppose
it's a nice tradition,

45
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,066
if you're into
that sort of thing.

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,632
And if you want
a constant reminder

47
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,888
of the hell you went through
to get here.

48
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:09,254
Hey, you okay?

49
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,038
Yeah. Sorry. I just, uh...

50
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,084
I needed a minute to...

51
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:17,175
Meredith's going home.

52
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,916
She's going home.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,005
I mean, I haven't had
good news since forever,

54
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,442
and I-I know that we are still
in the thick of things,

55
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,619
but we're finally getting
a handle on how to treat this.

56
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:29,361
I actually feel hope.

57
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:30,928
It's about time.

58
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,930
Okay.

59
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,409
I'm ready. Let's go. Okay. Okay.

60
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:36,020
Oh! Sorry. Sorry.Sorry. Sorry.

61
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,369
Sorry. After you. Okay. No, ser... Okay.

62
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:38,587
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:15,233
Scout is dressed
and chewing on his plastic cat.

64
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,670
It is a giraffe.

65
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,019
I used to get dressed.

66
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:20,978
Clothes are overrated.

67
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,110
Says the man
leaving for work.

68
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:24,329
You sure you don't want
to help Ellis

69
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,678
with some finger painting?

70
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,375
No, I'm good with work.

71
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,030
If Nico ever sends me
those post-op scans.

72
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,641
I used to get texts
about post-op scans.

73
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:36,994
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,517
What?
Oh, my God!

75
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,127
Mer's
pulmonary function tests

76
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,608
show a total lung capacity
of almost 4 liters.

77
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:43,783
That's amazing.

78
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:44,958
And aren't her other numbers
good enough

79
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,395
to send her home
instead of rehab?

80
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,962
What if she comes home?

81
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,878
What if
she finally comes home?

82
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:54,576
Oh, my God.
Oh... my... God.

83
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,056
Oh, my God.
What if she finally comes home?

84
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,231
This place is a dump.

85
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,711
She is gonna report us
for child abuse.

86
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,973
What... What?
Hang on. Hang...

87
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,366
Look, if you start now,
it's gonna take Ellis

88
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,063
all of five minutes to undo
the whole thing.

89
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:05,587
How about I go to the hospital,
confirm the good news,

90
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,459
and I'll call you
with an update?

91
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:09,026
That's a good idea.
Good.

92
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,333
Yes.
I will see you later.

93
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,379
Oh, God! Oh!

94
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,949
Why aren't you going?

95
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,124
Because you're crying. No, no.

96
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,429
This... This is
gonna happen all day.

97
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,604
Just go, go.

98
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,129
Alright.

99
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,608
Oh, God.

100
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,658
You didn't get my text. Which one?

101
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:33,789
The one about Dr. Grey.

102
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,748
Oh. Yeah.

103
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:38,272
One less person to wheel
to the freezer truck.

104
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:39,795
Gotta go.
Incoming.

105
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,102
Dr. MeredithGrey!

106
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:45,976
Chief of general surgery?!
Mentor to all?!

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,153
Okay, so, you need to teach me
everything you possibly can

108
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,371
before you move
back to Italy,

109
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,069
which I'm
a little devastated about

110
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:55,028
because everyone says
that you are the best OB.

111
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,857
I did quit,
but then I begged Bailey

112
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,815
for my job back
this morning.

113
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,817
I am getting married
instead.

114
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,123
What? Ha! Yeah.

115
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:06,561
Congratulations! Grazie mille.

116
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,346
I'm still going back to Italy,
though.

117
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,217
Oh. Yeah. I'm only
going for a month.

118
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,872
I'll help where I can,
and...

119
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,874
I'll scatter
my brother's ashes

120
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,832
and, um, yeah,

121
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,965
there will be plenty of rounds
when I get back,

122
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,707
but now I need you
to update my patient roster

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,100
while I find coffee.

124
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,450
Oh, wait.
I can get you coffee.

125
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,234
No.
Cappuccino?

126
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:30,237
Uh, double espresso,
but no, Dr. Wilson, y...

127
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:31,804
Just call me Jo.

128
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:32,979
Jo, you are an attending.

129
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,459
You don't...
Not anymore.

130
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,245
Dr. Koracick.
Thanks for meeting us.

131
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,812
Do I know you?
Your forehead

132
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:40,987
and your irises look familiar.
What...

133
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:42,467
I'm an intern here.
James Chee.

134
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,817
He almost quit
after his first day

135
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,123
when you took over
the class.

136
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,516
Oh. Right.
Not my finest moment.

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,561
What do we have here, Chee?

138
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,041
William Lawrence,

139
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,043
a 68-year-old Suquamish
and Duwamish man,

140
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,654
presents with aphasia
and right-sided paralysis.

141
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,308
Hello, sir.
What does a duck say?

142
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,530
Yeah.
Just making sure.

143
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,228
Helm, call a stroke alert.
I'll meet you in CT.

144
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,490
Go, go, go, go, go.

145
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,187
I treated him for COVID
a couple months back

146
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:08,667
at the urban Indian
health clinic I work at

147
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,277
on my time off. We're
not paying you enough?

148
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:12,323
He made a full recovery,
but about a half an hour ago,

149
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,020
his granddaughter
brought him in like this.

150
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:16,240
How's he doing?
I-I'm his granddaughter.

151
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,589
You have to save him.

152
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,634
That's the plan. He's
an elder in the tribe.

153
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:20,940
A language keeper.

154
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,159
Well, that doesn't change
the plan.

155
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:23,725
Dr. Chee, show
Mr. Lawrence's granddaughter

156
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,075
to the waiting tent.

157
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,163
We'll update you
when we know more.

158
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:27,592
Come on. Let's go.

159
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:31,733
So, you're
going to fulfill

160
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,301
this new leadership position
from Boston?

161
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,694
I am.

162
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,696
Not here, in Seattle,
where you work?

163
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,612
For me.

164
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:42,396
My official resignation.

165
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,832
I have to take off
first thing in the morning.

166
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,573
What?! Bailey, I know it's sudden,

167
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,053
and I apologize.

168
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,663
It's just...
It's a really good thing.

169
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,143
The work I'm gonna be able
to do,

170
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,058
the changes we'll be able to
enact from the foundation...

171
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:54,445
It's gonna be really great
for all of us.

172
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,201
It would have been...
Been better

173
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,415
if you'd have left me
a surgeon

174
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,418
who's double board certified
in plastics and ENT.

175
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,203
Pretty good list of
recommendations there

176
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:07,726
on the second page. What? Wait.

177
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,031
Why am I the only one
who's surprised?

178
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,730
Did you know about this? I did.

179
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,290
It wasn't my news
to share.

180
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,086
I went to see my dad,

181
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,219
who I realized my entire life
has shown me

182
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:25,439
exactly the kind of man
I never want to be.

183
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:30,966
Checked out and unwilling to
really fight for anything.

184
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,233
The two of you
showed me the opposite.

185
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,931
Example after example
of not giving in

186
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,672
to hopelessness
and despair

187
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:43,283
and consistently resist
complacency.

188
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:48,984
You get up over and over
and over again and fight.

189
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,813
I learned the kind of surgeon,
the kind of father,

190
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:55,165
the kind of person I wanted
to become from you.

191
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,943
I'm always gonna be grateful
for that.

192
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:02,955
We're proud of you, Avery.

193
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,435
I'm proud of you, son.

194
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,265
Thank you.

195
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,315
Talk to you soon.

196
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:20,581
To clarify what just happened,
Jackson Avery is now...

197
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,271
Our boss.

198
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,113
I see that Ms. Mora was
discharged this morning.

199
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,420
And Evan Pearson. Wow.
He was only here for three days.

200
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,379
I'm not sure if our meds
are getting more effective

201
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:37,381
or the trends are changing,
but we're seeing more patients

202
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,078
breeze in and out. I need more doctors

203
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,558
in order to keep up
with the turnover.

204
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,212
Already took care of it.

205
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,475
Y-You called these guys?

206
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,085
Ouch.
No. Sorry.

207
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,087
I just... I-I just thought
that we would grab

208
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:51,003
a few residents,
not heads of departments.

209
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,744
They said it was slow
downstairs.

210
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,920
Well, if you don't need us two,
then...

211
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,878
you know, I could just go back
and check on the ICU or...

212
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,315
No, no.
I mean, it's just...

213
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,142
You know,
um, it's up to you.

214
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,709
Do...
Do you want to be up here?

215
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,755
I just want to help.

216
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,974
Well, it's probably just
gonna be proning patients

217
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:09,935
and checking vent settings
and inspecting chest tubes,

218
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,546
but, I mean, if you
don't... if you don't mind.

219
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,635
I'm happy to.

220
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:18,160
So am I.
If I'm still being asked.

221
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,161
Oh, um...
Yeah.

222
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,243
Okay, great.
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

223
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,342
Was that normal?
Are they, uh...

224
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,995
My advice... Don't ask.

225
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,046
You still have laps to do.

226
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:38,050
I want to talk about
something else.

227
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:41,176
You're all making me feel
as if I'm going to drop dead.

228
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:43,360
Not that I blame you.

229
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,972
So, Maggie,
uh, when's the big day?

230
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:50,497
Oh, you know, we're still
considering our options.

231
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,760
'Cause there's just
a lot to plan.

232
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:56,242
We don't want to do anything
without his grandma and my dad.

233
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,462
Oh, right, right.
Of... Of course. Mm-hmm.

234
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,290
Wait,
have you even met Winston?

235
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,553
Well, apparently, we've been
in the same room together.

236
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:03,641
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:04,642
But only on the phone,
so...

238
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:05,991
Pierce locked that down.

239
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,949
Well, so did we.

240
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,995
He signed
a five-year contract.

241
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,911
Well, Zola cannot stop talking
about his dance moves,

242
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,042
so I think he's in.

243
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,482
So, what else?

244
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,179
Um...

245
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,747
Jackson's moving
to Boston to...

246
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,531
run the Fox Foundation.

247
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:25,837
What about Catherine?

248
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,447
It should be interesting.

249
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:29,101
It's sad, is what it is.

250
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,755
Okay.

251
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,887
Any other tragedies
I should know about?

252
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,892
Um... well,
it'll be tragic

253
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,416
if you have to spend
one more night here.

254
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,808
Yes. Come on.
On your feet.

255
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,114
Come on.
Let's go. Chop, chop. Come on.

256
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,420
Ooh.

257
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,291
Have I ever told you
that my days

258
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,207
of wearing ugly bridesmaid
dresses are over?

259
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,036
Who said you were
going to be a bridesmaid?

260
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,827
Uh, looks like he had
an ischemic stroke

261
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:02,649
on the left side of his brain
due to...

262
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,921
Probably that.

263
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:09,663
And by that,
you mean the large clot

264
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:12,666
in his
internal carotid artery?

265
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,147
Okay, book an IR suite,
please.

266
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:18,237
Unless you have
someplace else to be.

267
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:21,762
<i>Dr. Sellers...
Dr. Marty Sellers, 4619.</i>

268
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,195
Hey, Luna.
Meet your new roomie.

269
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,118
Hey.

270
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:31,293
Vanilla?

271
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,556
Vanelle.

272
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
That's your handwriting?

273
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,255
Yeah. I just...
Oh. I, uh...

274
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,474
Sorry.
I was in a rush.

275
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,823
Great. That's what
we'll tell the parents

276
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,433
when it's wrong
on the birth certificate.

277
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,000
Crap. Give me a pen.

278
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,266
Go. I got it.

279
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,186
Wow.

280
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,274
That's, um...

281
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,450
Yeah.

282
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:03,500
Well, you're lucky
I'm in pink scrubs today,

283
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,365
so I can take
a little extra sad.

284
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:08,505
Well, you look good
in them.

285
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,245
Happy.

286
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,944
Turns out
you canchange careers

287
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:14,249
in the middle
of a pandemic, I guess.

288
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,418
Yeah.
We're totally normal.

289
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,119
These last couple months,
um...

290
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,956
Thank you.

291
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,958
You're thanking me
for all the sex?

292
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:30,048
I'm thanking you
for being a good friend,

293
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,224
especially when
I really needed one.

294
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:33,660
Okay.

295
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:36,620
Also, the sex is worth...
worth a thank you. Yeah.

296
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:44,062
Well, thank you for saying
goodbye in person

297
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,542
and not in a letter,

298
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,806
and for being...

299
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,156
A bridge. You're more than a bridge.

300
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,550
You're a friend.

301
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:57,554
When I feel like I have
fewer and fewer of those.

302
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:03,037
It's Carina. A patient's
fully dilated and effaced.

303
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,039
Now that you're
a resident again,

304
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,476
I do have some dry cleaning
I need picked up

305
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,825
before I leave town.

306
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,740
Can't hear you.
But good luck saving the world.

307
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,350
Bye.

308
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,632
Whatever happened
to putting in your two weeks?

309
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:34,416
One day's notice.

310
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,810
You know, Avery should have
to hire his own replacement,

311
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:38,638
as far as I'm concerned.Yeah.

312
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:40,597
Any word
on Meredith's morning labs?

313
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,121
Uh, I keep refreshing
my e-mail, and nothing.

314
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,732
Mm-hmm. But I have every reason
to believe that...

315
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,342
Oh. Hello.

316
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,433
Yeah? Oh, the physical
therapy gave clearance.

317
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:53,174
Just as I suspected.

318
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:57,614
There's no longer any
medical reason to keep her here.

319
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,877
You can't keep
not telling her, Bailey.

320
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:04,490
I know.
I-I just don't want to.

321
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,710
Meredith's
gonna be clapped out tonight,

322
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:08,494
and if Andrew DeLuca
were alive,

323
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,541
you can bet he'd be the first
in line to cheer her on.

324
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,710
She needs to know
he won't be here.

325
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,722
Mm-hmm.

326
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:21,551
I'll remove the clot
with a catheter endovascularly

327
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:22,856
and then place a stent.

328
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,379
Once the blood flow's
been restored,

329
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,512
we're hopeful that his symptoms
will improve, uh,

330
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:27,905
fairly quickly.

331
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:31,125
He has teachings, stories
that have been passed down

332
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,301
for hundreds of years
in Lushootseed,

333
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,914
the ancestral language
of our people and this land.

334
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:39,090
I tried to learn them
as much as I can,

335
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,093
but it's a full-time job,
and I already have one of those.

336
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,965
We can't lose him.

337
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,271
Indigenous communities

338
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,621
have already lost
so many elders to COVID.

339
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,927
We've been hit hard.

340
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,015
The clinic's been packed,

341
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,756
and still doesn't have
enough PPE.

342
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,409
The government was supposed to
send in a shipment, but...

343
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,673
Let me guess...
All booties.

344
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,892
Body bags.

345
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:01,286
I'm...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

346
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,853
That's awful.

347
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,463
Tribes in other parts
of the country

348
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:06,508
with less access to healthcare
and running water

349
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:08,119
have it worse,

350
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,687
but we believe
we're all connected,

351
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,776
like my Diné friend here.

352
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,780
Mary Ann, I'm gonna look out
for your grandfather.

353
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:18,085
I'm gonna do
everything I can

354
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,913
to make sure
he can pass down his knowledge

355
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:21,436
to little junior
in there.

356
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,351
Thank you so much...

357
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,179
Oh! Mary Ann, are you okay?

358
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:26,441
Helm, Chee,
get a wheelchair.

359
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,834
She's not due yet.
Okay, okay.

360
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,270
Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe.

361
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,204
It's alright. I need my husband!

362
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,627
Okay, Mary Ann,
when's your due date?

363
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:38,715
In five days.

364
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,239
Any past medical issues
or surgeries?

365
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:43,894
Okay, Mary Ann, you're
8 centimeters dilated.

366
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,722
You're having
this baby today.

367
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,332
T-This can't be
happening right now.

368
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,204
Um, my OB at the clinic.
Dr. Mills.

369
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,337
I-I'm supposed to have
this baby there with her.

370
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:53,904
It's okay.
Dr. Wilson here will call... Yeah.

371
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:55,383
And see if she's available
to join us.

372
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,820
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And my parents,

373
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:58,473
and... and my husband.Everyone.

374
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,692
I will call everybody.

375
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh, my grandfather!
His surgery.

376
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:02,739
I'm on my way.

377
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,700
That's one impressive thrombus
right there.

378
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,833
Helm, pop quiz...

379
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:13,003
What's the normal etiology
of an ischemic stroke?

380
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:17,318
Hello?!
Did that sound rhetorical?

381
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:18,842
I, um...

382
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,670
I don't remember.Hmm.

383
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,367
You don't remember, or you
weren't paying attention?

384
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:23,542
Where do you need me?

385
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,674
Schmitt, step right up.

386
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,588
What's he doing here?

387
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,329
He's taking over for you.
Call me old fashioned,

388
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,854
but I think our patients
deserve surgeons

389
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,030
who can at least muster
the strength

390
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:35,075
to pretend
to want to be here.

391
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,208
Fine.

392
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,135
- Hey.
- Oh, uh, any updates on Mer?

393
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,486
I've been too busy to check,
but I'll ask Teddy.

394
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,227
I miss something?

395
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,272
Nope. No.
Um... no.

396
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:01,667
Where do you keep
your... incentive spirometers?

397
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,103
Okay, what's going on?

398
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,801
Sorry.
It's just the new guy

399
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,977
trying to get
the lay of the land.Mm-hmm.

400
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,371
Alright, I couldn't help but
notice earlier,

401
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:13,418
you and Altman
seemed... friendlier today.Mm.

402
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:14,811
So I...
But it's not my business.

403
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,160
It's not my business.

404
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,075
You know, I couldn't explain it,
even if I tried.

405
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:20,077
Which is fine, you know?

406
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,079
Privacy is in short supply
these days.

407
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,604
I can't wait
to get mine back.

408
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,780
As soon as Mer's got
her house under control,

409
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,564
Amelia and I
are out of there.

410
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,610
Mm.

411
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:32,829
What?

412
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:33,917
Good luck with that.

413
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,527
Incoming. Okay.Yep. Let's go.

414
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:45,885
That was a big one.

415
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,061
Uh, contractions
are three minutes apart.

416
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:49,976
They're getting
closer together.

417
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,760
It's almost time.

418
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,587
Okay.

419
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,067
The good news is,

420
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,417
is that your husband
and parents are on the way.

421
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,941
The bad news
is that Dr. Mills

422
00:17:58,025 --> 00:17:59,333
had an emergent
premature delivery

423
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,901
and won't be able
to make it. Twins.

424
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:04,469
I was supposed to be with
the same OB that delivered me.

425
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,776
I'm so sorry.

426
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,866
But I promise, we'll take
great care of you and your baby.

427
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,085
Oh.
How's my grandfather?

428
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, that's me, too.
Got it.

429
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,874
Before I'm in too much pain

430
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,266
to remember my own name...

431
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,442
do you think you could save
the placenta for me?

432
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,140
Of course.

433
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:26,708
We're taught to bury it
on Suquamish land,

434
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,842
so she always knows
where her home is.

435
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,236
Mm.
That's beautiful.

436
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,936
Deploying the stent.

437
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,025
Is Dr. Helm coming back?

438
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,419
She is not.

439
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,029
So, you... you met
our friend William

440
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,465
at the Indian Health Clinic?

441
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,990
Yes, sir.
I volunteer on my time off.

442
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,905
Mostly
primary care visits,

443
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:50,341
but there's also
an apothecary,

444
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,865
so sometimes I'll make salves
for burns and scars

445
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,085
using local plant
medicine.

446
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,739
Other times, we use
traditional practices

447
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,916
like prayer and song.

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,961
And I do
a lot of smudging.

449
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:02,962
What's that?

450
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,442
Burning sage, right?

451
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,270
Or, uh... tobacco?

452
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,662
Here they use cedar.Mm.

453
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,882
But I'm Navajo,
and we use tobacco.

454
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,928
It's one tradition a lot
of tribes have in common.

455
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,320
Hey.

456
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,061
Any update for Mary Ann?

457
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:16,628
Oh, just have to shoot
one more angiogram...

458
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,543
to make sure the blood flow
has been restored

459
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,326
and he should be
good to go.

460
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,547
Great. Okay.

461
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:24,418
Did we run out
of blue scrubs?

462
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:25,855
Oh, she changed
specialties.

463
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,726
Yeah, but really.

464
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,988
That's really
what happened.

465
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,077
She was sick of general.

466
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,343
Dr. Koracick?

467
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,121
Fluoro.

468
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,870
So, you're ditching us?

469
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:42,959
Well, I mean, in fairness,
I saved you.

470
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,308
So anything after this

471
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,223
is really gonna feel like
a letdown anyway.

472
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,138
Right,
because that was all you.

473
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,966
I mean, Altman
kind of helped out.

474
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,706
I think I recall
Bailey and Richard

475
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,186
being there now and then.

476
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,102
But, yeah, I did... I did
the heavy lifting, mostly.

477
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,887
Do you know
how cold it gets in Boston?

478
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,236
Yes, Meredith.

479
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,456
I did spend the first 18 years
of my life there.

480
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,371
Well, good luck
finding any racism.

481
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,856
So, what's first
on the agenda?

482
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,773
Making sure the girls
are settled in, happy.

483
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:17,036
And then change the world?

484
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,726
And then change the world.

485
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:24,130
So... I win.

486
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,089
How's that?

487
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:29,309
I'm the last man standing.

488
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,225
It was you and me,
from our residency class.

489
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,359
Everyone else has either
abandoned me or died.

490
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,448
We were
the only two left.

491
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:39,015
You think they're giving out
a medal for that?

492
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,320
I could...
I could stick around.

493
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,106
They probably should,
because it sucks.

494
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,021
Yeah.

495
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,500
Did I ever tell you
what I thought

496
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:47,980
the first time I met you?

497
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:51,114
Oh, God.
Um..."legacy hire," probably.

498
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:52,376
Or, "Is he single?" maybe?
No.

499
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,030
No. No, no, no, "legacy hire"
is what I...

500
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:55,553
Is what I meant, yeah.

501
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,730
I thought, "That's
a big name to live up to."

502
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,951
I mean, you would know.
Mm.

503
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:05,041
I honestly can't imagine a time
when the name wasn't ruined.

504
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,825
It isn't ruined.

505
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:08,870
It took
some well-deserved hits,

506
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:10,829
and you are making it
your own.

507
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,787
You're reinventing it.

508
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,876
I'm impressed.

509
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,617
Well, don't give up hope.
There's still plenty of time

510
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,141
for you to make something
of your life, kid.

511
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,579
Okay, now you can go.

512
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,627
I guess this is, uh...

513
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,368
the real thing, huh?
This is it.

514
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,066
You're not gonna come
to my clap-out?

515
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,806
How do you know
about the clap-out?

516
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,026
Are you new here?
No one can keep a secret.

517
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,072
Oh, God. I mean, I know
it's become a tradition,

518
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:37,595
but it really feels...

519
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,988
It's a little too much.
I know.

520
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,120
Yeah.
I mean, I survived,

521
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:44,384
and so many people haven't
and won't.

522
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:47,126
And not because I did
anything special.

523
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,432
Just because I'm lucky

524
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,912
and I have the privilege
of great health care.

525
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:53,654
Ishould be applauding
the people who took care of me.

526
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,830
This place almost broke
with you sick,

527
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,920
so maybe let them
celebrate a win, huh?

528
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah.
It just feels...

529
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:03,447
I feel you, but none of them
are gonna stop.

530
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,970
They're all gonna be there.
I'll be there.

531
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:08,843
I just didn't want that
to be our, uh...

532
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:12,586
I-I didn't want it to be
our goodbye.

533
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,198
I don't want this
to be our big goodbye.

534
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,643
You go give 'em hell,
Avery.

535
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:29,342
Well, thanks
for showing me how.

536
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:54,759
Oh, I can't...
I can't do this.

537
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,108
You can.
And you will.

538
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,544
Yeah, you're almost there.

No.
Grew up with it.

564
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,312
I was born into a family
of healers.

565
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:10,574
Same here.

566
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,053
Only change "healer"

567
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,404
to failed Broadway singer
and substitute math teacher.

568
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:18,712
Mr. Lawrence,
how are you feeling?

569
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,366
I've been better.

570
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,890
Well, given the day you had,
that's to be expected.

571
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:25,023
Can you tell Mary Ann
I'm okay?

572
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:25,937
Yeah,
as soon as she's settled.

573
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,373
Squeeze my fingers.

574
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:29,158
Your great-granddaughter
was jealous

575
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:30,333
of all the fun
that you were having.

576
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,769
She decided to make
an appearance.

577
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,292
She had the baby?

578
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:35,251
She did.
So, get some rest,

579
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:37,122
and we'll be back soon
and set you up

580
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:39,255
with the, uh,
time-honored COVID tradition

581
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:42,475
of meeting new family members
over video chat.

582
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,869
Okay?

583
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:47,567
You know, Amelia wants out
more than I do.

584
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,047
It's one of the only things
she talks about.

585
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:50,788
Well, talking about it
and doing it

586
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:51,789
are
two very different things.

587
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,965
Historically speaking
at least.

588
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:55,532
Didn't you and her
share a house?

589
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:58,274
Yeah, we did, but Meredith's
house... it just has this power.

590
00:24:58,358 --> 00:24:59,971
It's like a magnetic pull.

591
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,060
Karev used to call it
the Sister House,

592
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,062
because no matter who else
lives there,

593
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:05,585
you're just kind of
in their orbit.

594
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,108
They do have a special bond. Mm.

595
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:08,806
Okay, you're making it
sound like a coven.

596
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,199
It's just a house.
Sure.

597
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:11,722
It's nice there, man.

598
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,767
It always smells like
toasted waffles in the kitchen,

599
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,769
and the kids are excited when
you walk through the door.

600
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:17,162
I never had that
growing up.

601
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:19,295
Well, me either. But
I think I've filled my quota.

602
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:20,731
I miss my house.
And my bed.

603
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,080
And my guitar picks.

604
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,777
And quiet.
God, I miss quiet.

605
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:25,910
Well,
quiet is overrated.

606
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,216
Hard disagree.

607
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,087
When Meredith comes back,

608
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,132
there will literally be
too many people in the house.

609
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,918
It'll probably break
fire codes, so we gotta go.

610
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,615
Totally. On your side. Me, too.

611
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,138
And there's a reason
that I got my own place

612
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:38,314
before I moved here.Hmm.

613
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:39,619
So that's it?

614
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,317
I'm trapped?

615
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:42,876
Pretty much.

616
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,324
Oh, I hate this.

617
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:49,890
I do, too.

618
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:53,539
But nobody would be happier
for her to go home than DeLuca.

619
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,500
Okay.

620
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:07,814
What is it?

621
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:11,122
What?
Pleural effusion?

622
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,567
The physical therapist
changed his mind about rehab?

623
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:17,483
No, no, no.
Nothing like that.

624
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,356
Then what is it?

625
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,360
M-Meredith, there is
something we need to tell you.

626
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:25,926
It's about Andrew.

627
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:35,675
He's okay.

628
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,244
Meredith... he's not.

629
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,953
He... is with his mother.

630
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:11,189
Your grandfather is fine.

631
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:14,497
He is awake and asking to see
his great-granddaughter.

632
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,021
One new life and one saved.Mm.

633
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:19,458
I told you
nothing could kill that man.

634
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,155
I want to thank
both of you.

635
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,115
We... haven't had
the best of experiences

636
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,464
in big hospitals.

637
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:27,684
Oh, it's our pleasure.

638
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,686
When could he meet
our baby girl?

639
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,819
It should be
any time now.

640
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,125
Oh. There you go.

641
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,127
Right.
Someone wants to say hello.

642
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,044
What'd I tell you?

643
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:41,045
Pretty cute, huh?

644
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,873
She's perfect.

645
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,265
She has your eyes.

646
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,267
And your... feet.

647
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:49,046
Thank you for that.

648
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:54,363

- Hi. Hi, Rosie.

649
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:57,184

655
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,902
your brother
was incredibly kind to me.

656
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:15,471
He was good.

657
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:17,473

658
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:18,648

00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,478
And I-I just...
I just want to say that.

661
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:26,046
I know that you're going
to scatter his ashes.

662
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:31,138

Okay?

703
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,899
Okay. Yeah.
Okay, here she is.

704
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:04,117
Get ready, get ready!

00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:07,294

706
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:10,254
- Yeah! Finally!
- Whoa!

707
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,299

708
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:14,867

- Yeah!

709
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,045
Fair. Fair.

710
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,177
What happened?

711
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:22,179
Uh, Dr. Grey
is not in her room,

712
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,137
and all of her things
are gone.

713
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,972
Nice one, Grey.
Brilliant.

714
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,191
Evening, everybody.

715
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:38,848
Where the hell is she?

716
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:45,028
You know, you're
really milking this.

717
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,812
We're supposed to leave
the chairs at the entrance.

718
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,510
This is so much more fun.

719
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,600
Your chariot.

720
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,246
Oh.

721
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:55,952
You good?

722
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,910
Take me home.

723
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:03,256
Thank you.

724
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,796
So Meredith just left?

725
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,667
I guess
fanfare's not her thing.

726
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,060
I guess not.

727
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,279
Um...
you two have a minute?

728
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:20,933
Yeah.
Of course.

729
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,500
When, uh,
I asked you earlier

730
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,111
if you'd chosen a date
for the wedding,

731
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,288
I hope you didn't take that
as me inviting myself,

732
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,291
or trying to take anything
away from your father.

733
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,426
Um, I know the lines
of our relationship

734
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,254
have been blurry,

735
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:40,344
but I would never
presume anything.

736
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,956
We didn't really want
to do this right now.

737
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,915
Yeah, maybe over coffee.

738
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,699
Or dinner.

739
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:50,920
Richard, my father is going to
walk me down the aisle.

740
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,486
Of course.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

741
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,490
But he had
a really great idea.

742
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,668
We'd like you to officiate
the wedding.

743
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:01,713
Oh...

744
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:03,019

745
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:05,761

one was, uh...
One's single,

827
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,147
one was very happily divorced,
and

828
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:24,541
um... one came and went
so fast, you know,

829
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,672
I didn't...
I didn't even get a name.

exactly out of the woods,

I owed it to them

835
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:40,078
