Ah, this one worries
too much.

80
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,379
He needs more patients.

81
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,048

00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,684

00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,800

00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,970
<i>Mama!</i>

98
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,818
<i>And do everything that

99
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,154
<i>Okay, I love you.</i>

100
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,127
And when did you first start
to feel the pain?

101
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,629
Uh, a few nights ago.

102
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,365
I was watching
these cat videos online when...

103
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,866
For God's sake,
what happened?

104
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,501
The boys are fine.

105
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,836
A little worried.

106
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,604
I told them you'd call.
They called<i> me.</i>

107
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,672
They thought
I might be interested to know

108
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,107
that their aunt left
in an ambulance.

109
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,176
She has a history of acid reflux
and lives with MS.

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,510
Right, yes.
She told me.

111
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,680
Irene, are you on any
medications other than steroids?

112
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,182
And those damn teas.

113
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,050
She has an infantile resistance
to Western medicine.

114
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,886
She's had a catastrophic
family experience

115
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,721
with Western medicine.

116
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,391
Okay, it... it... it looks to me
like it's kidney stones,

117
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,825
but I'd like to get a CT
just to...

118
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,160
Then what are you waiting for?
Let's go.

119
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,962
I'm waiting for you to let me
finish a single sentence,

120
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,131
but I'll give up
on that now.

121
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,282
Life of the party, isn't he?

122
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,038
I appreciate everyone
pulling extra shifts.

123
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,706
Bailey does, too.

124
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,541
Uh, she'll be back
in a few days.

125
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,044
Thank you, Dr. Ndugu,
for pitching in where needed.

126
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,880
Boston's hit another surge,
so we need to let him get back.

127
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,715
How's Meredith? Her
vital signs are stable.

128
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,916
Her morning labs
were good.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,018
Oxygen requirements
are decreasing.

130
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,320
Enough to take her off
the vent?

131
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,721
Let's see if the trend
continues.

132
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,890
Well, let's hope it
does, and not just for her sake.

133
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,625
As of 5:00 this morning,

134
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,728
we are down to our last four
available ventilators.

135
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,232
So, until relief arrives, I need
us all to think creatively.

136
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,234
Ventilators
are our last resort.

137
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,904
Put them on BiPAP, the
hyperbaric chamber, uh, proning.

138
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,740
Let's exhaust all options
first.

139
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,242
So, if you extubate
Meredith

140
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,876
and she starts to trend
downward again,

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,179
we may not have another one
available.

142
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,047
So let's not make the call
to pull her off

143
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,751
until we are 100% certain.

00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,046
It's not up to him.
It's up to you.

175
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,714
What do you mean?

176
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,550
The sand isn't real,
Meredith.

177
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,153
I wish everybody would stop
saying that to me.

Yes!

196
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,821
I like it here.

Sorry to disappoint.

200
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,935
You heard about
the vents? I did.

201
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,503
So you know if we pull
Grey's tube

202
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,537
too soon,
we don't have...

203
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,638
I heard about
the vents, Tom.

204
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>...to Nuclear Medicine.</i>

205
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,809
<i>Dr. Sellers
to Nuclear Medicine.</i>

206
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,814
Hi!
Hey.

207
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,282
Leo threw up on the
way over here. Oh, no!

208
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,617
Do you have a shirt
that I can borrow?

209
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,952
Yeah, come on in.
Thank you.

210
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,621
Okay.
Okay.

211
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,490
Hey, Leo,
come this way with me.

212
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,358
Here, let me take off
this jacket.

213
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,527
Let me just sit down
for a sec.

214
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,028
Yeah, he gets carsick.
Okay.

215
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,699
He once puked on my op notes
for a glioblastoma.

216
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,701
You know, Ellis really
wants to show you

217
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,202
what she's working on
in the playroom.

218
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,538
Do you want to go see her?
She's right there. Look.

219
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,874
Go say hi.
Okay, bye-bye.

220
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,208
If you had told me
two years ago

221
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,043
that you and I
would be excited

222
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,880
to spend the afternoon together
with six small children...

223
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,382
I know that Owen asked you
to babysit me.

224
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,218
You don't have to
put on a show.

225
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,220
Both things can be true.

226
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,388
I need company.

227
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,991
We can have tea and discuss
life pre-pandemic,

228
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,860
and we don't have to be covered
in puke alone for an afternoon.

229
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,262
It's great.

230
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,766
I just told Liam and Austin
not to worry.

231
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,435
Please tell me
I wasn't lying.

232
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,403
<i>You know it's probably
minor, right?</i>

233
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,805
<i>It's not that.</i>

234
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,306
I mean, it<i> is</i> that,
but...

235
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,642
Irene insisted on moving down
here when the pandemic started,

236
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,676
and we drive
each other mad.

237
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,178
We do.

238
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,946
But I'd be lost
without her.

239
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,482
You're trying
to make me cry.

240
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,684
Don't go getting a big head
in there, now.

241
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,768
Hm.

242
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,623
Kidney stone,
like I thought.

243
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,292
In the right ureter.

244
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,795
It's big, so we should get
urology to weigh in.

245
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,297
Is Catherine Fox
here today?

246
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,364
For a kidney stone?

247
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,799
My boys already lost
their mother.

248
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,968
Irene's her sister and the only
family they have left.

249
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,337
So, yes,
I want the best.

250
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,441
<i>Nurse Hydren to
the OR. Nurse Hydren to the OR.</i>

251
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,776
Well, there he is.

252
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,110
This is happening?

253
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,278
It is definitely
happening.

254
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,646
I hope this wasn't
a bad time.

255
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,482
I abandoned a play date,
and I need a calendar

256
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,150
to remember the last time
I operated.

257
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,319
So,
definitely not a bad time.

258
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,154
How severe is it?

259
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,323
See for yourself.

260
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,273
Crosswalks,
am I right?

261
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,361
Okay, folks,
let's get the OR ready

262
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,096
with the ex-fix set
and the C-arm.

263
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,098
Let's fix this bad boy. Mm.

264
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,433
And, Dr. Webber?

265
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,268
Thank you so much.

266
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,273
Sorry to keep paging you,
Dr. Pierce,

267
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,442
but her breathing is becoming
more labored by the hour.

268
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,613
Let's consider BiPAP if she
continues to decompensate.

269
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,281
But it may be time
to consider next steps.

270
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,949
There's no directive.

271
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,285
Marcella says
that her daughter

272
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,835
will be making all decisions
for her.

273
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,623
Then...

274
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,325
it's time to call her.

275
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,333
<i>Hi. Who's calling?</i>

276
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,783
Jackson?

277
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,838
Maggie, over here.

278
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,773
Rig brought her in
about half an hour ago.

279
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,857
Hey, Dr. Pierce.

280
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,865
Dr. Fox, thank you
for coming in.

281
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,381
I know how busy you must be,
so I appreciate you being here.

282
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,248
I told you not to give me
special treatment.

283
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,890
Did you pull strings?

284
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,092
He pulled
the biggest one.

285
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,427
I sign his checks.

286
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,728
Dr. Wilson?

287
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,399
Irene Davis, 35, nephrolithiasis
with a history of MS.

288
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,069
These are her scans
and a CT. Mm. Mm-hmm.

289
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,071
They say
it's kidney stones.

290
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,739
Which is apparently
my fault.

291
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,241
I did not say that.

292
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,743
She gets some very strong teas
from her acupuncturist

293
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,245
to help manage
her MS pain.

294
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,514
You got to drink a lot of water
to flush those out.

295
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,882
- Which she knows.
- Which she usually does.

296
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,885
So, this stone is apparently
lodged in your ureter.

297
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,054
That's the tube between
your kidney and your bladder.

298
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,222
I'm going to have to perform
a lithotripsy...

299
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,725
That's a procedure
with a tiny, tiny laser

300
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,927
that breaks it down
into smaller pieces.

301
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,596
Broken into pieces?

302
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,064
That's what killed
my sister.

303
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,399
No, this is nothing like
the morcellator, Irene.

304
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,635
If it was, I wouldn't let it
anywhere near you.

305
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,971
So it's safe?
Completely routine.

306
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,139
Takes about 45 minutes,
in typical cases.

307
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,642
I have MS.
Am I still a typical case?

308
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,810
No.

309
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,813
Because you have me
for your doctor.

310
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,083
See you in the OR.

311
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,784
Another screw, please.

312
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,286
Everything okay?

313
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,787
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

314
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,924
I just wanted to enjoy
the moment. Mm-hmm.

315
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,459
Lord knows when
it'll happen again.

316
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,960
After this,
we'll secure the frame.

317
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,129
You'd never know you didn't do
three of these this morning.

318
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,631
Well, I didn't.

319
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,299
But I did change
three diapers.

320
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,936
One was what Amelia has dubbed
the "poo-tastrophe."

321
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,271
That's when the poo
actually kind of explodes

322
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,040
out of the diaper
and hits the wall.

323
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,078
Got it. That is impolite
adult conversation.

324
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,147
Sorry, I rarely get
to talk to adults. Mm.

325
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,483
Wait. What happened?

326
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,551
Heart rate's in the 120s
and his sats are dropping.

327
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,420
He could have thrown a
fat embolism. Oh, come on!

328
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,554
A-Alright, push fluids,

329
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,256
and let's get him packed up
for a CTA.

330
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,028
Did you call
your mom?

331
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:28,364
I did, and she was
at a grocery store,

332
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,732
which I have asked her
not to go to

333
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,067
at least
a hundred times.

334
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,435
She's stubborn,
like you.

335
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,837
Marcella?

336
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,143
Marcella, Veronica's just been
admitted to the hospital.

337
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,278
No. No.

338
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,613
She was mild.

339
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,114
I know.

340
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,950
But her symptoms became
more pronounced.

341
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,603
Use your time with her,
not me.

342
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,091
Marcella,
you need care, too.

343
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,393
I don't care about me!

344
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,961
Save my baby girl!

345
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,534
Okay. Come on.

346
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,673
But my mom's still alive.

347
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,076
She is,
but she isn't improving.

348
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,511
Veronica, we need to know
whether your mom would want

349
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,680
a machine to breathe for her if
she... No, no. She wants to live.

350
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,515
So instead of scaring
the hell out of me,

351
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,517
can you go
and concentrate on that?

352
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,153
Do whatever you can
to save her.

353
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,255
Maybe now's not
the best time, Maggie.

354
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,257
It may be the only time.

355
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,926
This is my fault.

356
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,761
I'm so sorry.

357
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,296
I'm so, so sorry.

358
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,533
Her sats are in the 80s.
I'm gonna increase the O2.

359
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,202
This is my fault.

360
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,536
All of this.

361
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,907
I-It was her birthday,
and...

362
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,576
and she'd...

363
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,245
She'd been alone
so long,

364
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,416
so I went over to her house
to... to cook for her.

365
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,018
We wore masks
and we ate outside

366
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,856
and w-we... we tried
to stay distanced,

367
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,525
but it was her birthday,
and she's my mom,

368
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,527
so I gave her a hug.

369
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,963
I just gave her one hug.

370
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,415
And I might have killed her.

371
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,036
I killed my mom.

372
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,371
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

373
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,206
Listen to me.

374
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,709
This is not
your fault, okay?

375
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:23,045
And I promise you, your mom
will never regret that hug.

376
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,647
Never.

377
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,516
Okay?

378
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,918
And, listen, my daughter's
a doctor here, too.

379
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,486
And she's with your mom
right now,

380
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,855
and she's taking care
of her, okay?

381
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,791
It's okay.

382
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,760
It's okay.

383
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,763
Down that hallway
is PACU.

384
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,932
That's recovery.

385
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,600
This is
a supply closet.

386
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,637
Nice. Here we have
someone's office.

387
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,806
You're an incredible
tour guide.

388
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,974
Well, not much to see
in a pandemic.

389
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,544
Is she here today, or are you
keeping me from her?

390
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,379
She? Who's she?
Come on, Mac.

391
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,880
The boys tell me
everything.

392
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,216
Said you've been talking about
somebody that you work with,

393
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,551
a general surgeon?

394
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,419
I work with several
general surgeons.

395
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,587
Oh, okay.

396
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,756
Do you smile when you talk
about all of them?

397
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,407
I'd like to meet her.

398
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,429
Yeah, well, you can't.

399
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,097
Why?

400
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,601
'Cause she's on a breathing tube
in the ICU.

401
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,203
Mac...

402
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,653
again?

403
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,309
I'll, uh...

404
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,144
check in on you
after the procedure.

405
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,879
Yeah, okay.

406
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,791
Well, he's stable,

407
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,459
but with that large
of an embolism,

408
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,760
he's gonna have to stay
on the vent

409
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,762
for at least
a few days.

410
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,180
This never
should have happened!

411
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,434
I know
I'm a little rusty,

412
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,935
and I probably shouldn't
have been talking

413
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,103
about exploding diapers,
but...

414
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,939
No, I am not angry at you,
Lincoln.

415
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,941
This was
a... a complication.

416
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,276
I mean, there's nothing

417
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,677
you could
or should have done better.

418
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,147
I'm just angry
with this whole situation!

419
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,649
I mean, saving
this young man's life

420
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,918
means we're down
to one available vent!

421
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,754
Which now means I have to close
the doors to our trauma!

422
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,073
Which means people will die
unnecessarily!

423
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,094
Even more people
will die.

424
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,233
We're closing to trauma?

425
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,668
Looks like it.

426
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,756
Okay.

427
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,057
Cristina.

428
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,017
This is nice...

429
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,286
just being able
to talk to you.

430
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,788
What do you mean?

431
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,724
Well, I spend
a fair amount of time

432
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,559
trying to talk
to people.

433
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,395
Sofia, Callie, Arizona.

434
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,564
I try to warn them
sometimes.

435
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,066
Warn them about what?

436
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,069
I can't let go.

437
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,738
When you have
a little kid like that...

438
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,741
hard to let go.

439
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,745
So I hang out,
watch her grow up.

440
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,613
Sometimes I see
something coming.

441
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,416
Like the divorce?
Yep.

442
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,580
I stand beside them.
I yell in their ears, "Wake up!"

443
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,522
"Wake up!
You're missing it!

444
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,858
You're missing the best
part of life!"

445
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,309
When you love someone,
you tell them.

446
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,766
And then w-what do they do
when you yell in their ears?

447
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,868
Well, sometimes they listen.
Sometimes they hear me.

448
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,204
I never
get the credit, though.

449
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,206
They think
it's their own idea.

450
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,756
She looks
so much like you.

451
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,923
Ellis?

452
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,725
Everybody says she looks
like Meredith.

453
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,729
Yeah, she does, but also weirdly
just like you.

454
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,680
You really are sisters.

455
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,235
I'm not gonna ask.

456
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,404
You can. I just...
I don't know anything.

457
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,572
And Richard won't even let me
near the hospital

458
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,673
or any of the charts.

459
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,842
Well, that's because
you need a break,

460
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,011
not because
you did anything wrong.

461
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,013
DeLuca was not
your fault.

462
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,848
We all lost him.

463
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,183
That grief belongs
to all of us,

464
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,852
and it might...

465
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:00,022
be easier
if you learn to share that.

466
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,695
Is there a recovery program
for people who trash their lives

467
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,165
and can't blame drugs,
so that I can get some of that

468
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,367
sweet program
zen master stuff you have?

469
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,904
You don't have to be
an addict...

470
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,273
It's called therapy.

471
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,607
Hmm.

472
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,443
How many sessions
until Owen feels safe

473
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,112
to leave me alone
with the kids?

474
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,015
I tried therapy.
It makes me uncomfortable.

475
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,516
Mammograms make us
uncomfortable,

476
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,019
but we still get them.

477
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,022
Yeah, the man stared at me
and nodded

478
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,857
and grunted
on every fourth word.

479
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,525
I counted the grunts.

480
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,028
It was an... an expensive
kind of torture.

481
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,530
So, when the first therapist
you tried

482
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,867
was clearly the wrong fit,
did you...

483
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,702
try another one?

484
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,037
You know I was
just being nice

485
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,505
when I said
Ellis looked like you.

486
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,307
Now we're both
right side up.

487
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,978
How'd the mom take it?

488
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,980
How do you think?

489
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,982
Is it just me, or did this job
used to be fun?

490
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,085
Like, not even 10 years ago.
Like, very recently, fun.

491
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,337
This used to be the greatest job
in the world.

492
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,258
Please tell me
Veronica's okay.

493
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,727
Well, I'd hoped with
oxygen therapy and antivirals,

494
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,329
we'd see a better
response, but...

495
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,365
...that hasn't been
the case.

496
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,933
Crap.

497
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,301
I need you to get back in bed.
Take me back. Take me back.

498
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,302
I know, baby. I know.
Ortiz, what the hell?

499
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,804
Sweetheart.
No, no, no, no.

500
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,005
I found her halfway to the
elevator, almost collapsed. No.

501
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,173
Let's get you back in bed.
I need to...

502
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,374
Alright. I need to
see my mom, please.

503
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,509
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Okay.

504
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,576
Please, I need to
see my mom. Okay.

505
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,978
We want to get you
feeling better first,

506
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,646
then we can talk about
visitation, okay? No, no.

507
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,482
Everyone here is dying,

508
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,152
and you guys have no clue
how to save us,

509
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,155
so at least
let me see my mom.

510
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,756
Let me say goodbye.

511
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,991
Before...

512
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,325
Veronica.

513
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,326
Veronica? Hey!

514
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,995
Blood pressure's tanking.
Veronica?

515
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,163
I've got no pulse.

516
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,731
Alright, get me epi and
a crash cart in here, now!

517
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:49,832
Okay.

518
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,167
I want to start compressions
right away.

519
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,835
Okay, go, go, go.

520
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,205
Come on, Veronica.

521
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,989
Come on, Veronica.
Here we go.

522
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,044
You're doing great,
Marcella.

523
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,828
Stay positive.

524
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:10,219
If you can make it to Friday
without needing a vent...

525
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,221
you're on your way.

526
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,390
You know, we're, um...

527
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,693
We're almost there,
because it's...

528
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,795
♪ Hump Day ♪

529
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,463
♪ What do you say? ♪

530
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,466
♪ You look at the week
and you say, "Half way!" ♪

531
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,302
♪ Half what? Half way ♪

532
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,304
♪ That's 'cause
it's Hump Day ♪

533
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,307
♪ The next thing you know,
it's gonna be Friday ♪

534
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,109
My mom gives me
that exact same look

535
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,311
every time
I do that rap.

536
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,647
Mnh-mnh.
No, no, that is not rap.

537
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,184
Oh, God.
She's decompensating.

538
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,852
I need a crash cart
in here, now!

539
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,521
And someone page Dr. Pierce!

540
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,189
What? Are you sure you don't
want to wait until the...

541
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,291
No! Her saturation levels
are plummeting and...

542
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>

543
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,395
Oxygenate patient.

544
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,999
Uh, prep induction
and paralytic agent.

545
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,501
Uh, ch-check, uh,
pa... patent cuff.

546
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,903
Tube ready?

547
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>

548
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,293
You're in.

549
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,611
No. No!

550
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,698
Schmitt, what did you do?

551
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,500
She was desaturating.
I had no choice.

552
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,103
Now, can we please get
a ventilator in here?

553
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,173
Oh, my God.

554
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,458
There isn't one.

555
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,284
Removing the last few
pieces of stone.

556
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:48,652
Stent?

557
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:51,988
Stent's gonna stay in place
to ensure proper drainage.

558
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,157
You know, you have
a really good touch, Wilson.

559
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:56,827
We don't have nearly enough
women in urology.

560
00:22:56,911 --> 00:23:00,163
Have you ever considered
changing specialties?

561
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,833
Change specialties?

562
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,168
That would be just...
No.

563
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:06,503
I... No.

564
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,339
Uh, n-no. No.

565
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,675
Mm.

566
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,793
Okay, all done here.
Removing the scope.

567
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:18,815
Oh, my God.
Is that...?

568
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,984
I have never seen
this before,

569
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,819
only read about it
in a textbook.

570
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,721
This is
the patient's ureter.

571
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,490
Her tissues
are so friable,

572
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,158
the scope pulled
the whole damn thing out.

573
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,593
We're gonna have to
open her up.

574
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,261
Prepare an ex lap!

575
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,769
Veronica's X-rays show
worsening consolidations.

576
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:39,803
I put her on BiPAP.

577
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,004
Her oxygen levels
keep decreasing.

578
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,773
She needs this vent.
She needs to be in ICU.

579
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,441
Marcella is already
intubated.

580
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,909
Schmitt can't bag her
forever.

581
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,910
Well...

582
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,078
Save the daughter.

583
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,113
Protocols say you have to save
the patient

584
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,615
most likely to recover.

585
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:54,117
We know.
Yeah, we know.

586
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,453
If she wakes up and finds out
we chose her over her mother,

587
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,789
she's not gonna be able
to forgive herself.

588
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:02,241
Marcella's last words to me
were, "Save my baby girl."

589
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,129
Put Veronica on the vent.

590
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,880
Before somebody else
takes it.

591
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:13,937
How in the hell does her ureter
come out with a kidney stone?

592
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,373
We will try to reattach it
to her bladder

593
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,442
without having to remove
the kidney.

594
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,445
Irene is everything
to my boys, Wilson.

595
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,946
I mean, everything.

596
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,948
She's always been their aunt,
but now she's their teacher,

597
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,284
their football coach,
their... their therapist,

598
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:29,568
their best bloody friend.

599
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,959
I-I can't believe this.

600
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:38,295
I can't. I can't.
I can't.

601
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,131
I cannot do this again.

602
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:44,401
I cannot look at my boys,
who've already lost everything,

603
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:45,902
and tell them that
they've lost her, too.

604
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,604
I cannot... I cannot do
that. Okay, okay. Stop. Stop.

605
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,439
This is...

606
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:53,058
This is not a catastrophe,
this is a complication.

607
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:59,149
Then what in the hell
are you still doing here?

608
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,567
Get in there and
bloody fix her.

609
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,123
We've reached out to
every hospital in Washington.

610
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:08,625
I never imagined...

611
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,926
I know.

612
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,797
Schmitt, you did
the right thing.

613
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,081
Another vent will come.

614
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,669
It has to, right?

615
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,493
Have a nice lunch?

616
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,243
I was updating
Dr. Hayes.

617
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,198
You had to take
the kidney?

618
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,066
The remaining piece
of the ureter wasn't long enough

619
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,568
to do a simple
reattachment.

620
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,069
But Irene has MS.

621
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:54,704
She could have bladder issues
in the future,

622
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:56,072
which would be much more
complicated

623
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:57,874
with just one kidney.

624
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,310
Why would she only have
one kidney?

625
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,812
What? I'm putting
it back, Wilson!

626
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,481
You're doing
an auto-transplant?

627
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,815
I am trying to!

628
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,152
It'd be a lot easier if I had
a second pair of hands.

629
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,321
Are you coming or not?
Yes. Yes.

630
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,789
Irrigation.

631
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:17,227
Child, who throws away
a kidney?

632
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:18,395
Lord.

633
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,633
<i>Dr. Sikes to Recovery.</i>

634
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,936
<i>Dr. Sikes to Recovery.</i>
Thanks.

635
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,707
If she keeps breathing
over the vent consistently,

636
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,375
we should be able
to take her off it soon.

637
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,292
That's good to hear.

638
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,147
Be a shame if someone like me
got to walk away

639
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,764
while someone like her...

640
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,201
I'll, uh...
I'll get out of your way.

641
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,371
Hey, Tom?

642
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,026
When I got back
from Iraq, I, uh...

643
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,128
I remember thinking,

644
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:55,165
"Why do I get to
keep working?

645
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:59,002
Why do I get to
cook dinner?

646
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,670
Swim in a lake?

647
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,038
Fall in love?"

648
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:06,176
It's a terrible feeling.

649
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,845
I wouldn't wish it
on anyone.

650
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,680
Even me?

651
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,258
Tell me
your favorite thing.

652
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:23,259
About what?

653
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,428
About life.
Life right now.

654
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:27,397
There's
a global pandemic.

655
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,232
That
is your favorite thing?

656
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,568
No.
I just meant that I don't...

657
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:32,902
Oh, okay.

658
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,704
You're saying
that the pandemic...

659
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,773
No, it just feels
very shallow

660
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,408
to talk about
my favorite things

661
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,577
when there's people dying
in record numbers.

662
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:41,911
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Alright.

663
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,447
Well, that's...
That's stupid.

664
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,282
Excuse me?

665
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:49,285
You're saying that you're not
allowed to enjoy your life

666
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,621
because people are dying
in record numbers?

667
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:54,791
That makes
exactly zero sense.

668
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,595
If the having of a life
and a body

669
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,597
isn't cause
for celebration,

670
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,600
then what's the point
of avoiding death?

671
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,802
I mean, just... if you're not
gonna enjoy it,

672
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,253
then you might as well
join them.

673
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:14,978
Bailey just had a birthday
and I asked him what he wanted,

674
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:18,148
and he said a whole cake,
all to himself.

675
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,150
He did not want
to share.

676
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,819
So, of course,
I got him the cake.

677
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:25,789
And so, do you know what he did
as soon as he got that cake?

678
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:26,623
What?

679
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:27,857
Faceplant.

680
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:31,476
Just planted his face
smack in the middle of the cake.

681
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:38,368
And we laughed and laughed
and laughed.

682
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,171
It was me and Zola
and Ellis

683
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:44,007
and Maggie and Amelia
and Link.

684
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:47,644
Zola laughed so hard,
she peed her pants,

685
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,579
so then we had a laugh
at that.

686
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:52,415
And then
as we were laughing,

687
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,984
Bailey started licking
the frosting off each finger

688
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:58,021
really slow and making
a whole production out of it.

689
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,356
And I looked at him
watching us laugh,

690
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,358
and I realized that
that was the point.

691
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,428
That was his plan... he wanted
to make us all laugh,

692
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:08,098
because the baby had been
keeping us up all night

693
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:09,833
and the pandemic was
all over the news,

694
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,634
and none of us were having
any fun at all,

695
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:15,805
and nobody was laughing,
and he wanted to make us laugh.

696
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,307
Yeah.

697
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,392
And that's what he wanted
for his birthday.

698
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:24,380
And when I looked at him and
I saw that light in his eyes,

699
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,464
he looked
just like his dad.

700
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,719
That same sparkle.

701
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,055
That same delight.

702
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:35,058
That's a pretty good
favorite thing.

703
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,343
If I'd known I was going to
have to choose

704
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,612
whether to vent a mother
or her daughter,

705
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:57,729
I would have quit
med school.

706
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:04,287
If I'd seen a tenth of what
I've seen these past few months,

707
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:06,071
I would have quit, too.

708
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,628
We shouldn't even
be here.

709
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,630
How did we get here?

710
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:15,131
Let's quit.

711
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,633
Don't go back
to Boston.

712
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,635
We've got each other.
We've got our earbuds.

713
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,853
Let's just live
while we can.

714
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,308
I'll go where you go.

715
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:29,461
But we both know
you won't let yourself quit.

716
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:32,764
Take a break, okay?

717
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,954
I'll check on
your patients.

718
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,744
We can share earbuds.

719
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:49,581
And...?

720
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,269
What if they can share
a vent?

721
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,192
Tell Schmitt
to keep bagging!

722
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,750
The machines
are capable of delivering

723
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:10,119
much stronger pressure
than any one patient needs.

724
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,321
And we just need
to adapt the vents

725
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,789
to serve
two patients at once

726
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,625
by using a T- or a Y-shaped
splitter on the airflow tube.

727
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,127
And we're using viral filters
to prevent cross-contamination

728
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,462
of particles
between patients.

729
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,964
All of this
was Pierce's idea.

730
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,966
It's not ideal,
but it buys us some time

731
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,434
until we get some
reinforcements.

732
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:26,135
Yes!

733
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,137
Hey!
Hey, hey!

734
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,272
Uh-huh.

735
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,874
Uh-uh-uh.

736
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,375
Richard, you okay?

737
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,410
I am so good.
I just have to dance

738
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,579
because you all doubled
the amount of vents

739
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:37,914
we have in the hospital.

740
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:40,683
I have to dance because we can
now open the doors to trauma,

741
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:44,854
and you have to dance
because you just got a raise.

742
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,489
Oh, hey!

743
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,658
Oh! I'll dance to that.

744
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,501
Keep an eye on their vitals
and get labs every hour.

745
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,337
Page me for any change,
no matter how small.

746
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:11,147
Mom...

747
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,983
Come here, mamita.

748
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,818
I know.

749
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:17,487
It's okay.

750
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,989
It's alright, baby.

751
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,773
I know.

752
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:28,598
Your vitals look good,
and you are making urine.

753
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:30,600
One of my party tricks.

754
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:32,268
You'll be able to go home
in three days

755
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,604
if your pain's under control.

756
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,105
Wilson?

757
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,941
Thank you.

758
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:40,191

00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,047

Who... Wilson?
Yeah.

763
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,158
I don't know. Why?
You trying to set me up?

764
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,793
I was hoping
you could set<i> me</i> up.

765
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:58,294
Mm-hmm.

766
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,963
I mean, she did have my kidney
in her hands.

767
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,965
It doesn't get more intimate
than that.

768
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,633
Uh-huh. Have you
checked on the boys?

769
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:05,301
Austin's supposed to be reading
"Animal Farm,"

770
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,303
and I'm worried he hasn't
made it past page 50.

771
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,471
Page 50?

772
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,275
We'll be lucky if he's even
opened the book.

773
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,213
Her lungs are clear.

774
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,215
Her ABGs are showing
improved oxygenation,

775
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,050
and she's passed her SBTs.

776
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:24,220
Her vitals are normalized.

777
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,304
Okay.

778
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,728

779
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,650

Why would you bring up my mom

naked?

in the laundry room

887

Hey, Zola.

We, um...

892
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:09,265
We took your mom off
the ventilator today,

893
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,168
and she's breathing
on her own.

894
00:39:12,252 --> 00:39:14,437
Yes! Thank God!

895
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,073
Bailey! Ellis! Scout!

896
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,074
Hope that was alright.

897
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,076
That's fine.
This is amazing.

Thank Teddy.

She, uh... She's the one
who never gave up.

904
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:34,156
She stayed with her
night after night.

905
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,594
I just... I just did
what the numbers told me.

Yikes. Well maybe you can blame
that on a brain bleed.

wedding day, I know I did.
