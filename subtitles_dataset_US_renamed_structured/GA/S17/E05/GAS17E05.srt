93
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,397
Oh, when did your mother
go to San Francisco?

94
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,234
What? No, no. That's a...
That's a fake video background

95

98
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,598
She's in a germ-collecting car
with her driver with no mask.

99
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:48,975
She wears masks.

100
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,478
On her chin, okay,

101
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,273
or dangling from her ear
like a weird piece of jewelry.

102
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
She is living with cancer.
She is immunocompromised.

103
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,600
I got to get to surgery.

104
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,515
Just get her to wear the stupid
mask correctly, please.

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,850
Well, you know
what it's like

106
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,311

to do something!

107
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,940

I'm calling for reinforcements.

with segments 5 through 8

110
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,266
due to bleeding
from hepatic pregnancy.

111
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,564
Her drains were pulled
two days ago,

112
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,389
but this morning
she's tachy to 120,

113
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,577
her BP has decreased,

114
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,936
and transaminases and bili
are both trending upwards.

115
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,020
She's kind, giving, successful,

116
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,085

117
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,838
Without shame.

118
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,053
I need compliments,
too, guys.

119
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,085
I'm glad that you're
in good spirits, Val,

120
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,589
but, um, your labs
are concerning.

121
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,050
I'm ordering a CT.

122
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,319
I carried a baby
in my liver.

123
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:42,366
Can't you make an exception for
moms and babies who defy odds?

124
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,006
I-I'm sick of video chats.

125
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:48,302
Luna's gonna think
her mom's a pixelated blob.

126
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,807
Technically, that's what
you'd look like even in person.

127
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,633
Babies can only see
about six inches in front...

128
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,593
Schmitt! Not the point.

129
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,539
Val, I know that it's not
what you wanted to hear,

130
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:00,812
but Luna's on a vent, and
moving her is very precarious.

131
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:03,165
Plus, we... we need to make sure
that you're taken care of

132
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,453
before you meet her.

133
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,748
For Luna's sake
and for yours.

134
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,202
Okay?

135
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,506
Do we know if he's okay?

136
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,273
Not sure. This is him.

137
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,234
You're not listening...

138
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,954
I have to be at home.
I don't want to miss it...

139
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,085
Oh, my God.

140
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,524
Okay, we have a COVID-positive male,

141
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,804
heart rate 123, BP 90 over 60.

142
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,093
Pulse ox of 92 on 100%,
high flow.

143
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,023
He's incoherent
and disoriented.

144
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,046
I just saw him
two days ago. He was fine.

145
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,085
Is this a stroke?

146
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,281
Could be. Or encephalitis
brought on by COVID.

147
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,493
I have tickets to Opening Day,

148
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,062
and David's dying

149
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,565
- Who's David?
- His son.

150

Let's get him

151
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,789
Hang on. He's seizing.

Doesn't matter.
You're a resident,

Out. Now.

wait a minute, and the meds will kick in.

00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,715
Teddy, I got this, okay?

172
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,425
Please, call up to CT.

173
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,630
Okay.

174
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,851
Hey, Angel.

175
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,797
I'd be there with you,
but the mean doctors say no.

176
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,564
Can you say "mean"?

177
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,500
Can you hold the phone
closeenough for me to smell her head?

178
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,431
How about I bring you
one of her blankets?

179
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:44,250
Ah! I will literally
marry you.

180
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,804
Val.

181
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:49,032
Crap.
That is your bad-news face.

182
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,305
Your CT showed
that you have an abscess

183
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,632
that's eroding into an artery
in your liver,

184
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,352
causing what's called
a pseudoaneurysm.

185
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:58,563
Okay.

186
00:06:58,648 --> 00:06:59,955
It's a weakening
of the blood vessel,

187
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,368
which is causing it
to leak.

188
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,533
We need to take you to surgery
right away to repair it.

189
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:06,546
I am so sorry
that it's not better news.

190
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,307
Leave.

191
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,445
Eight years.

192
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,640
I've wanted to be a mom
for eight years.

193
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,490
I've known my baby's name.

194
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,201
I've known the color
I would paint the nursery.

195
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:33,288
I've known the made-up lullaby
I would sing at night.

196
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:36,208
And now that I finally
have the chance...

197
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,210
being a mom
is just some weird TV show

198
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,671
I'm watching on my phone,

199
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,548
and I don't know
if it will ever be real.

200
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,585
Please make it real.

201
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,672
Have you heard about Koracick?

202
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:56,290
Yes. He's
gettingthe world's best care,

203
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,768
and I'm trying
not to think about it.

204
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,979
So, can you wait that
longfor the converted rooms?

205
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,882
Is sooner an option?

206
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,858
See, even with the lockdown,
we are getting slammed.

207
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,361
We got six cases today from
assisted-living facilities,

208
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,154
- three from the same one.
- <i>I'll go check.</i>

209
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,907
- Oh, which one?
- Silver Villas in Ballard.

210
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,159
COVID spreads through
those places like wildfire.

211
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,382
Where are you going?!

212
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:16,850
Uh, that's where
my parents are.

213
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,210
<i>Next.</i>

214
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,960
- A rescue mission?
- Yes.

215
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
Just stop what you're doing
and get to Silver Villas.

216
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,627
To grab your mom and dad?

217
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,962
I've been trying
to call the front office,

218
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,213
but they're not answering.

219
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,256
Well, where do you want me
to take them?

220
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,715
Uh, to my hotel.

221
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,717
Y... Uh, I don't care.
Just get them out.

222
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,484
Yeah, I'm on it.
I love you.

223
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,570
- JOkay, lap pads...
- Here you go.

224
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:44,328
Khan was an attending
in Pakistan.

225
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,940
We could probably
be assisting him.

226
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,351
Not gonna happen.

227
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,657
No, I know. I just...
Making a point.

228
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,737
Suction.

229
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,344
You were a vascular
surgeon, right?

230
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,226
Yes, Dr. Schmitt,

231
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,017
one of the first to be certified
in my country.

232
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,285
Why would you leave?

233
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,578
Okay, Kelly clamp.

234
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,343
Uh, it wasn't exactly
a choice.

235
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,281
I love my home,
it shaped me.

236
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,540
Still nice not to worry
about religious persecution

237
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,281
or bombings.

238
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,432
- So I just started over.
- Clamp.

239
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,991
Just?
It's a five-year residency.

240
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,843
If I finished this
and had to start over...

241
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:13,301
Ugh. Pass.
Can you imagine?

242
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,970
Can you imagine payingmore
attention to the field

243
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,304
so the patient
doesn't die?

244
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,681
Damn it.
Her tissue's so friable

245
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,515
it's just disintegrating
into my hands.

246
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,269
- We got to get control of...
- I know what we need to do!

247
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,671
Everyone shift. We're doing
a modified pringle maneuver.

248
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:25,882
Clamp.

249
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,932
Okay, thank you.

250
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,757
Hey. Your phone has been
ringinglike crazy.

251
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:35,926
Oh.

252
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:41,324
Oh, wow. Okay.

253
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,188
Uh, okay.
Let's just, uh...

254
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,774
- tried to call you.
- Ben, how did it...

255
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,874
I picked up your mom,
and she's sick. - Wait, slow down. I ca...

256
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,531
- We're at the hospital.
- Now?!

257
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,701
Right now.

258
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,601
Mom!

259
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,414
Mom?

260
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,875
Hey, it's me.

261
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,570
I'm here.

262
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,976
- William?
- Alright, okay.

263
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,250
Where...
Where... Where's William?

264
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,978
Mom, you're in
the hospital.

265
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,064
We're gonna
take care of you.

266
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,607
He's gonna
be here soon, right?

267
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,109
Okay. Yes, yes.
He's coming soon.

268
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,969
Okay?
Just lay back and relax.

269
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,806
I can't wear this.
I got to get my clothes.

270
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,164
Where my clothes?

271
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,284
Okay.
She seems really agitated.

272
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:27,815
Are there any meds
we can give her to calm her?

273
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,246
I can order some meds?

274
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:35,665

275

What do you see, Shepherd?

287
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,694
Uh, I see a lesion
on his thalamus,

288
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,701
but it's small,
so that's something.

289
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,829
Have you been able to talk
to him since the seizure?

290
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,889
He was post-ictal,
and they gave him lorazepam,

291
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,600
so he wasn't really coherent.

292
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,248
Okay. I'm coming in.

293
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,730
Are... Are you sure? I mean, do
you want me to call Dr. Mehta?

294
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,481
It's Tom. I'm coming.

295
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,803
Thank you.

296
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:43,819
Uh, Ellis decided she didn't
want her mac and cheese

297
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,532
after begging me to make it,
so if you're hungry...

298
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,334
What's going on?

299
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,088
It looks like Tom is having some
neuro complications from COVID.

300
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,841
I thought he was asymptomatic. Yeah,
so did I.

301
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,513
I just pumped, so there is milk
in the fridge for Scout.

302
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,058
Uh, Bailey and Ellis
need a nap.

303
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,725
Make sure you check in with Zola
about her homework.

304
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,084
If Scout starts to fuss,
just try the yoga ball.

305
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,717
What am I forgetting?

306
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,303
To breathe.

307
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:09,763
We'll be fine here, okay?

308
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,723
Go. Save your friend.

309
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:14,928
He was my teacher.

310
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,427
And he saved my brain.

311
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:18,764
And, uh, he was my first sex
after Owen,

312
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,732
which shouldn't matter,
but it kind of saved me, too,

313
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,045
so I don't want him to die.

314
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,796
And I don't want to leave Scout,
and I'm scared of the pandemic.

315
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,740
You had sex with Koracick?

316
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,069
What?

317
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:41,251
Hey. Oh, um,
Mr. Anderson's trach in 4722

318
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,837
needs to be suctioned, please. I'm on it.

319
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,727
Hey, got your page.
Did you hear anything from Mom?

320
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,813
She's just texting me back
hearts and "Love you, baby"s

321
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,164
like that's gonna
shut me up.

322
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,387
No, I haven't had the time. Richard,
this is not something

323
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,102
that can wait till your schedule
frees up, right?

324
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,021
It's my mom. She's gonna give me
a damn rage stroke.

325
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,400
Bailey's mother was just
admitted, COVID-positive.

326
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,992
It's bad.

327
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,149
Look, can you fill in for her
at the board meeting today,

328
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,820
take a few of her patients?

329
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,740
We'll all pitch in.

330
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,184
Yeah, of course.
Whatever she needs.

331
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,797
We took a lot more of
her liver than I was hoping to.

332
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,157
Keep an eye
on her liver panel.

333
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,827
The next few hours
will be crucial.

334
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:18,078
You think
she'll need a transplant?

335
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,492
Knowing her luck, probably.

336
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:23,961
But if she needs it,
we can try liver dialysis first.

337
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,798
Khan, finish the op notes.
Keep an eye on her.

338
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,516
Dr. Wilson, thank you

339
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,955
for allowing me
to observe your process.

340
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,466
That was amazing.

341
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,070
She could still
need a transplant.

342
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes, I understand, but
you resected most of her liver,

343
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,138
and she's still alive.

344
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,682
I mean, do you know
how rare that is?

345
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,289
That... That's unheard of
in so many parts of the world.

346
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:45,265
I know. Op notes.
I'm going.

347
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,940
Was I really amazing,

348
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,547
or is he just
some weird happy person?

349
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:54,164
If you impressed him,
I think amazing's a safe bet.

350
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,758
Glad you got
to operate again.

351
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,767
Her ferritin is 2087.

352
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,203
600 is severe in COVID.

353
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,547
Her CRP is 87.

354
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,300
Creatinine's 2.3.

355
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,123
W-What about
her oxygen requirements?

356
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,836
<i>♪ Caught swimming in your new sundress
♪ </i> - She's at 100% F-I-O2.

357
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,500
40 liters.

358
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,393
She went into A-fib
an hour ago.

359
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:27,922
We pushed dig,
but so far, no response.

360
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>♪ Keep living
like the sun don't set ♪</i>

361
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:31,712
Her systolic was in the 80s,
but we pushed a fluid bolus

362
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,781
and got it back up
into the 90s.

363
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:38,679
So she's starting to have
multi-system organ failure

364
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:41,266
in addition
to her cytokine storm.

365
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,444
I'm sorry, Bailey.

366
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,438
There is still
more we can do.

367
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:50,133
We can take her to the ICU,
intubate...

368
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,594
She didn't want
to be on machines.

369
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,039
Or be kept alive
with medication.

370
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:04,000
I got to call my dad.
Um...

371
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,617
I'm here if you need me.

372
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,567
H-How...
How do I tell my dad

373
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:16,070
that the love of his life

374
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,218
won't make it
through the night?

375
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,760
Neuro exam's intact.
No deficits.

376
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,304
He asked for his son.

377
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:41,559
I think the seizure and delirium
are secondary to hypoxemia

378
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:44,841
and inflammation from COVID...
Possible early sepsis.

379
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:46,145
Let's just watch him

380
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,940
and, uh, see how he responds
to treatment.

381
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,151
Okay. Oh, hey, Shepherd.
Didn't realize you were back.

382
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,013
Welcome to... hell.

383
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,755
Just consulting
on Koracick.

384
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,782
Oh, right, 'cause he needs
somebody to cover his service.

385
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,990
On him,
not... uh, not for him.

386
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,035
Sats dropped,
he's got a fever of 103,

387
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,810
and he seized
when they brought him in.

388
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,537
Well, I hate everything.

389
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,674
<i>Dr. Cade to
the ICU. Emma Cade to the ICU.</i>

390
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,379
I was wondering
if you get used to this,

391
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,200
but I'm guessing
that's my answer.

392
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,091
How's the baby?

393
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:15,677
Uh, yeah, uh, well,
he won't let me sleep,

394
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,430
but other than that, um, yeah,
I can't wait to get back to him.

395
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,390
Leo and Allison
are with Owen's mom.

396
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:21,850
I'm just...
I miss them like crazy,

397
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,240
but with both parents
treating COVID patients,

398
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,243
it just...
It doesn't seem safe.

399
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,763
Uh-huh.

400
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,755
So, um, guess you heard
what happened.

401
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,872
Yeah.
And I have feelings.

402
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,905
But I've also done

403
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,324
more hurtful and complicated
things in my life

404
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,919
than anyone I've met
outside an NA meeting, so...

405
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:42,466
Some of them to Owen.

406
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,646
Owen won't say a word to me

407
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:45,765
that doesn't have to do
with the kids,

408
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,668
and everyone
is ignoring me

409
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:51,588
or treating me like
I'm wearing a scarlet letter.

410
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,075
What about Tom?

411
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,325
He's hurt, too.

412
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,333
Well, um,
I'll keep checking on him.

413
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,935
And, uh, thank you
for getting Mer into the trial.

414
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,187
Oh, yeah, uh, of course.

415
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,935
Hi, Grey.

416
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,365
It's me.

417
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
I'm gonna say it.

418
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:18,115
I miss you.

419
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,865
When I was a kid,
I had big thoughts.

420
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,724
Big feelings.

421
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,561
And I never knew
where to put them.

422
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:41,669
Physically, they ran through
my body like a high-speed train.

423
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,700
And anytime
I felt the train coming,

424
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,997
my mom could see it.

425
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,021
So she took me around the corner
to the park

426
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:55,786
with this strange,
twisted tree.

427
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:58,011
Said it was mytree.

428
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:01,763
And I could scream at it,
hit it, hold it...

429
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,942
And it would make
the feelings small enough

430
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,903
that they would fit back
inside of my own body again.

431
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,567
So I did.

432
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,751
And it worked.

433
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:18,356
But now I'm an adult,
and tree-hitting is...

434
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,094
frowned upon.

435
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,770
I can be your tree.

436
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,254
My mother has Alzheimer's.

437
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:30,737
I never told you

438
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,371
because she's older,

439
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,294
and I didn't want to bring up
any old pain

440
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,731
for your or Richard.

441
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,332
But it would be a lie

442
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:46,817
to say
that it hasn't been hard.

443
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,637
Or painful.

444
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:54,301
Even as a doctor
who knows about the disease,

445
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,293
I feel like...

446
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,307
I didn't know crap.

447
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,879
...like I don't
know anything.

448
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,354
It's difficult
to talk about it

449
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,232
with someone
who hasn't been there,

450
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,285
been through it.

451
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,543
No one understands
that you are

452
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:19,006
watching
your own mother die...

453
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,676

454
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,723
I'm so sorry, Bailey.

455
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:28,184
I wish you were awake.

456
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,723
Val's still not awake.
LFTs are up slightly.

457
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay. Do another panel
in a few hours.

458
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,450
Absolutely, Dr. Wilson.

459
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:47,145
Okay, has your attitude
always been this good?

460
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,358
My mom used to say every day
above ground is a good day.

461
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,310
Did she get that
from "Scarface"?

462
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,575
She did. Still, it's true.

463
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,332
You! You're a doctor, right?

464
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,654
Yeah. Great, follow me.

465
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:05,457
- We're delivering a baby.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

466
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,251
I'm not an OB,
I'm a general surgeon. I don't care.

467
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,128

and all our OBs are busy.

468
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:10,838

we need a doctor.

469
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:12,669
I haven't
delivered a baby...

470
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,966
You heard the "I don't care"
part, right?

471
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,092
We'll talk you through it.

- Okay.

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,337
Look, Dad's here, too.

517
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,160
Hi, honey.
I'm here.

518
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,497
Wait till you see
Miranda's hotel.

519
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,500
I mean,
there's room service,

520
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:23,296
and the view is so much better
than Silver Villas.

521
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,972
You can actually
s-see the water.

522
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,379
William?

523
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,934
Is that you, William?

524
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,437
Right here by your side,
as always.

525
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:36,004
I love you.
I love you so much.

526
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,325
Sweetheart?

527
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,497
Uh, she drifts
in and out, Dad.

528
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:46,241
In her state,
even breathing's exhausting.

529
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:48,231
I can't do this.

530
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:49,746
I know.

531
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,442
It's difficult.

532
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:52,910
I should be there.

533
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:54,567
It's too risky, Dad.

534
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:58,530
She should be in her own bed,
not in some sterile box.

535
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:04,412
She spent 60 years
taking care of me, and now...

536
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:08,167
She hardly ever got a cold
before this.

537
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:11,395
Just call me

538
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,590

my heart was filled up

Mad because no one
told me she was sick,

576
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:15,394
mad because she probably
has no idea what's happening.

577
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:20,105
You know, if I'm being
totally honest,

578
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:22,985
I don't want her to suffer
from this Alzheimer's anymore.

579
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:25,868
You know,
it's a horrific disease,

580
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:28,878
and I want her to be free.

581
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,089
But I don't want COVID
to be the reason.

582
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:32,249
I d... I don't want her

583
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,879
to be just another

584
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:37,588

585
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:39,581

100%.

587
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:46,284
None of this is easy.

588
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:49,448
All of it
is confusing and...

589
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:52,253
hard and awful.

590
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:56,300
But even with Alzheimer's,
she's been healthy.

591
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:59,629
And now I'm
watching her struggle

592
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:04,612
to do the most basic
of human reflexes... breathing.

593
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,847
And if she's saying
she's not ready to go...

594
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,823
I don't know what to think.

595
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,261
I felt so sure

596
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,168
that she wouldn't want to live
like she's been living,

597
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:20,214
but maybe I'm wrong, yeah?

598
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:25,105
Maybe she's happy in the world
her mind takes her to.

599
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,888
Now I'm questioning
every choice I made.

600
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,473
I mean,
s-should I be doing more?

601
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:33,012
Should I move her to the ICU?
Intubate her?

602
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,355
Am I just thinking about
how I feel

603
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,167
instead of what's going on
with her... inside of her mind?

604
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,175
- Do you want my opinion?
- Please.

605
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:46,487
I've been the one
who does everything,

606
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:51,581
who fights tooth and nail
against death at all costs.

607
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:55,434
But truthfully,
with my mom,

608
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,370
it didn't give me
more peace of mind in the end.

609
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,714
It might have done
the opposite.

610
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:07,675
I didn't think so at the time,
but it was the easier choice.

611
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,707
To fall back on
acting like a surgeon

612
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,851
and searching
for all the answers.

613
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:20,331
Bailey, you've given your mom
so much.

614
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,082
She's gotten to raise you

615
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,996
and watch you turn into
this incredible surgeon

616
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,776
and chief of a hospital.

617
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,878
She watched you
fall in love.

618
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:32,386
- Twice.
- Twice!

619
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,526
And raise a family.

620
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:43,296
Of course you're never going
to feel ready to say goodbye,

621
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,831
but...

622
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,401
she's had an amazing life.

623
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:53,206
I brought my parents
to Seattle kicking and fighting.

624
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,105
I promised them,
if they moved here,

625
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:58,206
it was the right thing
to do

626
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,073
so they could be closer
to their only daughter.

627
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,230
I told them I knew best.
Just listen to me.

628
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,519
And if they hadn't done that,
they would still be at home.

629
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,771
Isolated.

630
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,926
And Mom wouldn't be dying.
Not yet.

631
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,026
You don't know that.

632
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:14,745
She was exposed at the place
that I set up for them.

633
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:20,401
The... The facility let someone
move in from New York,

634
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:22,636
a retired surgeon.

635
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,093
He became symptomatic
the day after his arrival.

636
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:30,348
Afterthey said they had
shut down to all outsiders,

637
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:31,425
including family.

638
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,806
How in the hell could you have
known that was going to happen?

639
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,894
How could you have known
any of this was going to happen?

640
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:40,916
Bailey, you cannot
feel guilty about this.

641
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:49,026
My mom, she left me
five voicemails

642
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,779
for my birthday
last year.

643
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,800
She kept calling

644
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:54,701

that she had already

645
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:56,761

00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,497
yeah, that was classic.

692
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,126
Oh, and guidance counselors,
oh, my God.

693
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,670
Oh, yeah, yeah,
always trying to suggest

694
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,210
a school where we might
feel "more comfortable."

695
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,702
"Oh, Wellesley.

696
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:34,593
That's a fine school, Miranda.

697
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:38,179
But, um, I think state school
is more your speed."

698
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,057
- Mm-hmm.
- Like I don't know my speed.

699
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:42,311
- Please.
- Try harder and do better

700
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:43,813
just to be
considered average.

701
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:45,983
Or to be considered
at all.

702
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:49,757
But how they underestimate
our greatness.

703
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:52,386
- Graduated magna cum laude...
- Mm-hmm.

704
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:56,062
...with my biology degree,
by the way.

705
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:01,528
And you better bet my mom cut
out the graduation announcement

706
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:04,282
from Wellesley and mailed it
to my guidance counselor.

707
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,255
I don't know
how I'm gonna do this.

708
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:30,348
Oh. Uh, I c...
I can come back.

709
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,184
No. No, no, no. Uh, no,
I just finished up his EEG.

710
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:34,935
I wanted to, um, make sure

711
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,312
that the seizure
was a one-and-done,

712
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:40,066
before I head home,
take 10 scalding hot showers,

713
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,859
and hug up on everybody.

714
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:46,072
Um, Maggie says
that his numbers are holding.

715
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,077
Good. Thanks.

716
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:00,418
I don't know
if you were ignoring me

717
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,879
when I came by the house

718
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:03,881
or... or if you were
just too sick to answer,

719
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,133
but I-I'm...
I'm gonna go with too sick

720
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,437
'cause then... then maybe
there's a-a ray of hope for us,

721
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:12,013
which I could really use
right now,

722
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:13,796
and I know you could.

723
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:16,727
You know, I'm...
I'm gonna stop asking.

724
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:17,780
I'm just gonna decide.

725
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:22,094
I-I'm deciding that
we mean enough to each other

726
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:24,835
that, even though
I hurt you and I-I...

727
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,363
I hurt you
more than I could ever imagine,

728
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:31,218
that a repair could be made,
that...

729
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:36,914
maybe you could...
remember

730
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:38,708
some of the things
that you don't hate about me

731
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,015
and we... we could salvage
our friendship because...

732
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:45,445
I don't know how we're going
to get through this pandemic,

733
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,322
but I do know... I do know

734
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,279
that we're not going
to get through it alone.

735
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:52,158
So if you want
to have nothing to do with me,

736
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,056
then you are just going
to have to get all better

737
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,182
and tell me yourself,

738
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,101
because until I hear you
say the words,

739
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:58,866
you're not gonna get rid of me.

740
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:04,827

00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,804

was an imminent delivery,

816

and the next second,
I was catching a baby.

817
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:26,475
I was literally the first person
in the universe to hold him.

818
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,392

to his parents,

819

handing out babies,
