1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,736
This job isn't easy.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,978
The sheer amount of pressure and loss

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:12,614
that we square off against every day...

4
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:16,117
...can leave you exhausted...

5
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:19,220
...or helpless.

6
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:21,589
You're okay. You're okay.

7
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:28,342
You're going to need to find
an outlet for the stress.

8
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:44,812
Maybe it's physical...

9
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,217
...maybe it's emotional...

10
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:55,156
Hey, buddy. Hey!

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,557
- Hi.
- Oh, you're so big.

12
00:00:56,592 --> 00:01:00,495
Mommy misses you both so much.

13
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,296
I love you, Mommy.

14
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:04,165
I love you. I miss you.

15
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,733
...maybe it's family...

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,205
...but trust me, you're not
going to survive residency

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,874
unless you have a happy place...

18
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,982
...somewhere that you
can just escape it all.

20
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:32,760
I need another ABD.

21
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,128
Why aren't we there yet?

22
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:36,064
We're going as fast as we can
without crashing.

23
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:37,231
Uh...

24
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,766
You need to tell them
it's him so they're ready.

25
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,602
Okay, Carina, I know you are
scared, but this isn't helping.

26
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:43,771
"B."

27
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,322
"B"? "B" what, buddy?

28
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,942
"B" positive. That's my blood type.

29
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,477
We'll call ahead
and make sure they know.

30
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,745
Give me a 4x4.

31
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,147
Andrea, you are gonna be okay,
Andrea, okay?

32
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,050
Okay?

33
00:01:58,954 --> 00:01:59,921
Val Ashton.

34
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,056
Two days post extended liver resection.

35
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,424
LFTs are still elevated.

36
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,793
Blood cultures are growing
gram-negative bacteria.

37
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:09,197
How are you feeling?
Any tenderness or nausea?

38
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,265
Honestly, I think I can get out of bed

39
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,867
and do a couple laps.

40
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:15,737
She's still septic.

41
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:18,139
Start her on Levophed,
add an antifungal,

42
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,708
and order a repeat CT.

43
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,444
You feel like crap, and you're
acting like you don't.

44
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,645
Why would I...

45
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,347
So I'll let you out of bed
so you can see Luna.

46
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:28,249
I've tried this your way.

47
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,351
It isn't working.

48
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,819
Val, I know that this...

49
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:34,021
Please don't say you
know how this feels,

50
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,657
because I like you,
and I want to keep liking you.

51
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,893
But unless you've had
a baby that you haven't

52
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:42,730
been allowed to hold or even see
in person her whole life,

53
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:45,299
you don't know.

54
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,373
I finally got a hold of Luna's father.

55
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,542
He signed over his parental rights.

56
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,043
Isn't that what you wanted?

57
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,211
Yeah.

58
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,213
But I expected at least a little fight.

59
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:02,216
Not a text back that says, "Good luck."

60
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,218
Baby emoji.

61
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:08,568
So, yes, I feel like crap.

62
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:12,493
I feel sick down to my bones
that I made a child

63
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:16,297
with someone who doesn't
even care she exists.

64
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,369
Let's get the sepsis under control,

65
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:23,805
and then we can talk about seeing Luna.

66
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:37,096
They were out of oat milk,
so it's gonna be almond.

67
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,719
Savages.

68
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,278
Right?

69
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:43,944
Mm.

70
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:51,899
Hmm.

71
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,741
You should eat.

72
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,539
Coffee first.

73
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,409
And I don't need a speech
about breakfast

74
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:04,745
and nutrients for my brain
because my brain

75
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,447
is finally turned off.

76
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:10,546
I'd like to keep it that way
for as long as possible.

77
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,419
Want to get some fresh air?

78
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,676
We could go for a walk.

79
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,357
I'm right where I want to be.

80
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,578
Maggie, I don't know if you are asleep

81
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:41,896
or if you are ignoring me
or the world entirely, but call.

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,154
Still nothing?

83
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,490
Uh, she could be passed out
on the floor from COVID,

84
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:46,624
and no one would know.

85
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,667
Or... Or she could be
hit by a car on the I-94

86
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:50,762
on the way to Wyoming.

87
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,130
- What's in Wyoming?
- I don't know.

88
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,866
But one sister's on a vent
and the other one is missing,

89
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,300
and the last time a sibling was missing,

90
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:57,502
he was dying on the side
of the road, so...

91
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:59,504
Is my mommy gonna die?

92
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,431
Uh...

93
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:04,142
It's okay. You can tell me.

94
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:10,648
Come on, Zo. Let's go inside.

95
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,724
I called up to the blood bank

96
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,325
to have type "B" blood on standby.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,453
Hopefully, it's a sign.

98
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:26,697
You know, "be positive"?

99
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:28,266
Rig's here.

100
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,004
Carina, what the hell?

101
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,472
- It's Andrea.
- What?

102
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,140
Stab wound to the abdomen,
possibly into the chest.

103
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,542
Slightly hypotensive
and tachycardic after

104
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:39,310
- one liter of NS.
- What happened?

105
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,345
He was following a sex trafficker,
and she attacked him.

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,382
They got her. I-I think I'm okay.

107
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,917
DeLuca, try not to talk. It's Dr. Hunt.

108
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,518
You're at Grey-Sloan.
Let's get him to trauma one.

109
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:48,686
Let's move. Schmitt, let's go.

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,521
- Owen.
- Yeah?

111
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,723
Please save him. Please.

112
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:53,758
Okay.

113
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,140
There's fluid in his abdomen

114
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,241
and around his heart.

115
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,411
- How you feeling, DeLuca?
- Like I got stabbed.

116
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:05,925
Chest films are up.

117
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,628
Okay, let me see.

118
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:12,034
DeLuca, you have a hemothorax.

119
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,993
I'm gonna have to place
a chest tube, okay?

120
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:15,962
- Great.
- Schmitt, hang another unit.

121
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,272
Here it comes. Ready?

122
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,900
BP's still dropping.

123
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:37,617
Okay, let's call the O.R.

124
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,684
Tell them we're on our way up, okay?

125
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:40,310
- Hey, I want to go with him.
- Carina, no.

126
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:41,784
Andrea, I want to come with you.

127
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,258
Carina, he's right. Please.

128
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,026
Okay, ready? We good?

129
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,995
Oh, God.

130
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,696
Okay, good. Let's go. Move.

131
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:12,203
Uh, Dr. Webber.

132
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,447
Um...

133
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:16,792
There's a...

134
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,392
a huge trauma that just
came in, and, um...

135
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,717
Well, did Hunt ask for help?

136
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,364
No. Uh...

137
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:26,189
Did he ask you to come to stare at me?

138
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:30,193
It's, uh...

139
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:31,889
It's DeLuca.

140
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:34,497
He's been stabbed, and, um, I saw him,

141
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:36,399
and I-I wish I hadn't,

142
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,135
but, um, I did,
and I thought you should know.

143
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:01,758
Hey!

144
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,226
Hey yourself.

145
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,942
Impressive.

146
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:10,967
Your turn.

147
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,769
Let's see what you got.

148
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,871
Okay.

149
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:15,938
There you go.

150
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,340
Just gotta put a little bit
more muscle into it.

151
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,008
Yeah.

152
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,676
You know, this is
the first time in my life

153
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:23,676
I can ever remember
not feeling competitive.

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,915
Is this your life?

155
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,283
What?

156
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,886
Well, you said
the first time in your life,

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,221
but I don't know.

158
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,023
I'm not so sure.

159
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,091
Are we alive?

160
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,060
I think so.

161
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,800
You look good.

162
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,868
The beach suits you.

163
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:48,362
You too.

164
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:54,243
I made Zola a grilled cheese.

165
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,012
She's watching a movie
with the other two.

166
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:59,082
Did you actually say anything?

167
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:01,651
Ellis interrupted us
before we got too far.

168
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:02,785
Which feels like divine intervention

169
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,088
because I have no idea what I would say.

170
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:08,991
I mean, I can't lie because... lying.

171
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,561
And Zola's so smart she'd just
see right through it.

172
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:14,897
So you're just gonna keep
making grilled cheeses?

173
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:16,999
Are you just gonna walk for two hours

174
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,468
every time Scout needs to sleep?

175
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:19,969
You want to see what
happens when I stop?

176
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:21,804
I'm sorry. I need Maggie.

177
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:23,606
Maggie is thoughtful and levelheaded,

178
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,808
and I know I have to tell
Zola the truth,

179
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,111
but I need help knowing how
to tell her the truth.

180
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,812
She's not picking up.
I have to go get her.

181
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,315
W-What? No, you haven't slept.

182
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,250
You can't stand still.
You're not driving.

183
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:35,852
You haven't slept either.

184
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,086
Okay, deep breaths.

185
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,289
We'll figure this out.

186
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:44,927
Um, I-I'll just call somebody
that can find Maggie.

187
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,429
Who?

188
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,097
I don't know.

189
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,436
Ooh.

190
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,742
Hey, where's Carina?

191
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:01,010
Uh, they headed up to the chapel.

192
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:03,279
Okay, can you tell her
that DeLuca is stable

193
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:04,614
and he's on his way to the O.R.?

194
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:05,882
Yeah. Thanks.

195
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,083
Who's that?

196
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:08,885
Uh, it's the woman DeLuca was following.

197
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,253
Detectives need her photo.

198
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:11,854
Why? You... You know her?

199
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,291
She was here last night,
and I treated her.

200
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,292
For what?

201
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,094
She said she was mugged. Oh, my God.

202
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,795
- Schmitt, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God. Is this my fault?

203
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:22,298
No, none of this is your fault.

204
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,809
Hi.

205
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,745
What, no gifts?

206
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,647
At the very least, some crosswords,

207
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,283
peanut butter cookies, contraband porn?

208
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,686
Kidding.

209
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,389
I'd trade all that
for good conversation.

210
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,258
Okay, if this is about the nurses,

211
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:50,393
they need to calm down.

212
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,395
We both have COVID. It was no biggie.

213
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,930
What are you talking about?

214
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,231
I went to see Grey.

215
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,166
I needed to see some living scenery.

216
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,569
You would have loved it...
The two of us under blankets,

217
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:00,937
it was like "On COVID Pond."

218
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,038
It's not funny.

219
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,113
It's a little funny.

220
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,419
We intubated Meredith, Tom.

221
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:10,012
You know, if you ever
find yourself thinking about

222
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,914
cheering up kids
in the cancer ward, don't.

223
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:14,887
Sorry. I'm sorry. I-I just...

224
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:19,088
I just needed to be in a room
with someone who doesn't hate me.

225
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:26,095
Well, no one can
clear a remarkably low bar

226
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,064
like Tom Koracick.

227
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,980
Have a seat.

228
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:45,481
I don't hate you, Altman.

229
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,370
But it would help me to hear you admit

230
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,797
that you never loved me.

231
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,256
You don't have to say it now, but...

232
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,303
You're tired. We're both scared.

233
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:59,364
But it would help me
to hear it sometime soon.

234
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:05,635
- Dr. Wilson.
- Yeah?

235
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:07,403
I've maxed out Ms. Ashton on pressors,

236
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:09,772
but her MAPS keep dropping.

237
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:13,909
Her repeat CT shows no fluid,
which means that

238
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,778
what's left of her liver is failing.

239
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,314
Um, start her on liver dialysis

240
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:21,417
and keep me posted
if she gets any worse.

241
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,123
Luna Ashton's mom
is your patient, right?

242
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:28,157
Why?

243
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,859
Luna has a bronchogenic cyst.

244
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,193
I'd like to get her into the O.R.

245
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,095
before it causes respiratory distress.

246
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,131
Thought you might like to
join me to tell her mom.

247
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,098
No.

248
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,199
Okay, suit yourself.

249
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,934
No, I just... I don't want you
to tell her either.

250
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:40,336
I don't want anyone to tell her.

251
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,505
I suppose we could sneak Luna in

252
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:44,640
and say it was emergent,
that Val was sleeping.

253
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,142
We didn't have time to ask her.

254
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,210
- Really?
- No. What's wrong with you?

255
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:50,112
She just... She needs some really

256
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:51,714
not-terrible news right now.

257
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:53,149
We all do.

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,788
You're gonna do an ex-lap
and a sternotomy?

259
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,056
Is that necessary?

260
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,191
His FAST exam indicates cardiac injury.

261
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,326
Well, then I'll scrub in.

262
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,027
Respectfully, Richard,
you haven't operated in months.

263
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,163
I'm not sure that this is
the way to jump back in.

264
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,764
Well, respectfully, you need the help,

265
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,499
and I'm not about to wake up Bailey

266
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,702
when she's sleeping for the
first time since her mother died.

267
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,070
I'm not asking you to. Get Altman.

268
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,639
Altman's coming off
a 20-hour shift which ended

269
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,240
in putting Meredith Grey on a vent.

270
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,276
She's in no condition to operate.

271
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,598
Look, DeLuca saved my life.

272
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,081
It's only right that I do the same.

273
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:28,884
When Teddy and I were in Iraq,
this was our job.

274
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,387
To sew up our own people
when they were broken.

275
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,089
We knew the names of
their kids, their dogs,

276
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:35,157
what compelled them
to serve their country.

277
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,860
Day after day, they'd go
out there, they'd take shrapnel,

278
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:39,695
and we would take it out,
we'd sew them back up,

279
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,164
and then we'd send them out
there and do it all over again.

280
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,265
There was no sleep, no rest,

281
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,801
no time to let the gravity
of it all sink in.

282
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,170
That was the job, Richard.
Not many people can do it.

283
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:51,374
Altman can. So, please, get me Altman.

284
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,994
Hey, I got your page,
but DeLuca doesn't need ortho.

285
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,086
I needed ortho.

286
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,587
I saw the woman who did this to DeLuca.

287
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,155
She was here last night.

288
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,091
She said that she was mugged,
but I think that she was lying.

289
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,126
I mean, I-I know she was lying.

290
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,695
And she was asking about the kidnappers,

291
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,964
but I didn't put the pieces together.

292
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,466
And I don't know if I could have,

293
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,602
but I still feel like I should have.

294
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,004
Which is crazy, right?

295
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,140
I-I-I just need to focus
on DeLuca's surgery.

296
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,342
No, you can't scrub in.

297
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,511
This was a pep-talk page.

298
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,114
Okay, then, switch services.
You can do it. Come on.

299
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,616
I want to help.

300
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,185
Then make sure DeLuca gets
a surgeon that's not a wreck.

301
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:37,522
Said with love, in case you
couldn't tell behind the mask.

302
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,128
It's a small piece
of abnormal lung growth

303
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,029
that I need to remove
so she can breathe normally.

304
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,165
And then it'll be my turn
for another surgery.

305
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,433
And then hers.

306
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,468
And then maybe I'll go twice
so you keep me guessing.

307
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,804
I know it sounds scary,
but Dr. Hayes has done

308
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,340
this surgery countless times.

309
00:14:56,876 --> 00:15:00,044
Has anyone even held her
since she was born?

310
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,147
Well, she has to stay in the incubator

311
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,781
for her own safety, I'm afraid.

312
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,116
That's not right.

313
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,352
She is helpless, and she is scared.

314
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,022
Babies aren't supposed to live
in a plastic container.

315
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:15,059
You're right, Val. You're right.

316
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,328
You need to see her.
It's not right that you haven't.

317
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:18,532
Wilson.

318
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,565
I'll bring her to you before
she goes into surgery.

319
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,133
Thank you.

320
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,456
Thank you so much.

321
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,138
Wilson.

322
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,075
Webber paged.

323
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,144
Yeah, for me. DeLuca got stabbed.

324
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,680
He has a massive hemothorax
and blood in the pericardium.

325
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:37,148
- Sternotomy tray?
- And Balfour.

326
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,017
We treated a kid in Jordan
who had shrapnel

327
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,285
in the same area.

328
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,719
Right. Texas Hold 'Em guy.

329
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:43,388
And we sent him home in one piece.

330
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,590
Alright, let's do it again.

331
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,225
Yep.

332
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,196
Ready?

333
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,864
Okay, Schmitt,
let's call the blood bank,

334
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,632
make sure there's more coming,
and you can scrub in.

335
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,934
Khan, not Schmitt.

336
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,535
Dr. Schmitt said he needed
to switch services.

337
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,505
I assume because of my time in
Pakistan as a vascular surgeon.

338
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:01,873
Excellent call, Schmitt.

339
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,608
Alright, you'll assist me
with the sternotomy

340
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,745
while Dr. Hunt explores the abdomen.

341
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,825
We're gonna go fast.

342
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,083
Understood.

343
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,598
Okay, then.

344
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,348
Scalpel.

345
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,766
Warren got called to
a four-alarm downtown.

346
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,069
Do you have to go?

347
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:33,204
Carina, I'm not going anywhere.

348
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,917
Hey, hey.

349
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:49,787
Before she died, Mama called us
two halves of one whole.

350
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,791
It loses something in translation.

351
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:57,595
My dad, he thought
we were completely different,

352
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:04,068
but my mom knew that we couldn't
breathe without the other.

353
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,172
One year, when Dad was
too manic to talk sense to,

354
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,175
he, um, spent all our Christmas money

355
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,978
on stuff he didn't need,
but Mom saved up,

356
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:17,348
and she surprised us with one gift.

357
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:19,183
A pair of roller skates.

358
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,185
Andrea tried to give them to me,

359
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,656
but I-I put on the left
and he put on the right,

360
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,527
and we held the other
two legs up like flamingos

361
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:32,347
and skated around the house.

362
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:39,203
Two parts, one whole.

363
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,343
Looks like the knife went
through the pericardium

364
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,611
and just nicked the ventricle.

365
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,480
You can repair the ventricle
with 3-0 prolene.

366
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:51,316
- Altman?
- Yeah, he's right. I'm on it.

367
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,717
Okay, get in there.

368
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,218
Right, 3-0 large taper needle.

369
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,054
Damn it. Looks like it's gone through

370
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,356
his spleen, his stomach,
and his diaphragm.

371
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,390
We're gonna have to remove his spleen

372
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:01,326
and check for intestinal injuries.

373
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,227
Dr. Knox, how many units
has he received so far?

374
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,363
Six units of blood, six of FFP.

375
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:07,959
Alright, run a TEG to check
for his clotting factors.

376
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,234
You good?

377
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,569
Yep.

378
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:12,537
Bovie.

379
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,277
Please don't take this boy.

380
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,881
Please don't take this boy.

381
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:32,557
Mm.

382
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,695
Mm.

383
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,193
Okay.

384
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,378
Comedy or drama?

385
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,673
C-SPAN?

386
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,210
Listen, there's something
really soothing about

387
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,946
the whole scrolling at the bottom.

388
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,881
It's like this endless
potential of information.

389
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,249
You're gonna make me read that to you

390
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:00,251
when we're 80, aren't you?

391
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,353
I mean... I didn't mean...

392
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,897
Yeah, you did.

393
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,358
You did mean it.

394
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,595
Okay.

395
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,465
Did you order more champagne?

396
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,800
No.

397
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,436
Hold on. I'll get rid of them.

398
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,193
We're coming.

399
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,842
Yeah, we're coming.

400
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,616
Hey, uh, can I help you?

401
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,485
Oh, sorry. Wrong... Wrong room.

402
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,220
Jackson?

403
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,723
Oh, um, this is...
Okay, it's the right room.

404
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,057
Why are you here?

405
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,026
Link called me. You need to come home.

406
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,074
How are we, Knox?

407
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,098
Just hung another two units.

408
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:50,533
Blood pressure's starting to come up.

409
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,863
- Just a few more sutures.
- Nice repair.

410
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,122
I don't see any leak.

411
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,190
I'm just gonna run
this bowel one more time,

412
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:56,825
and then I am good to go down here.

413
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,028
Alright, I just need to place the drain,

414
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:03,365
and then we are good
to start the wire closure.

415
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,273
Great work, everyone.

416
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:13,985
When was everyone tested?

417
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,986
- Last night.
- Yesterday.

418
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,621
This morning. Alright, come on in.

419
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:19,704
Amelia's in her room, and, uh,
please keep it down.

420
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:22,142
This guy just went to sleep.

421
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:27,366
Anybody want a beer?

422
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,000
- I'm good.
- It's pretty early.

423
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,335
Okay, I'll get some.

424
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,816
The wound was more
severe than we'd hoped,

425
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,017
but he's pulled through.

426
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:47,419
Oh, my God.

427
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:48,854
He's alive. Your brother's alive.

428
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:50,055
Oh, my God!

429
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,524
Oh, it hurts not to hug you right now.

430
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,393
Hey, look at them while you hug me.

431
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:59,262
Thank you.

432
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:03,535
Thank you for getting me to help.

433
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:04,736
Yeah, don't read into it.

434
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,004
I owed it to DeLuca.

435
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:07,539
And if there was someone else
I could've called,

436
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:08,540
I would've.

437
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:16,948
I said no and I meant it.

438
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,050
I do not take preemies on joyrides.

439
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:21,253
You're already moving her.
This is adding a stop.

440
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:23,021
Plus, I told Val
we would make it happen.

441
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,556
Without consulting me first.

442
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,558
It's out of the question.

443
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:27,759
Get out of my way, Wilson.

444
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:29,895
Were you nice before your wife died?

445
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:30,996
Excuse me?

446
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,197
I'm just curious.

447
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,732
You know, I lost the love of my life.

448
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,801
He didn't die,
but he might as well have,

449
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:38,770
and I was sad and angry and confused,

450
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,305
but I still cared about other people.

451
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,706
In fact, I think it made me care more.

452
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,108
I'm looking out for my patient.

453
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:44,476
You know this won't jeopardize Luna.

454
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,378
Grey was laughing and joking,

455
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:47,913
and a few hours later she's on a vent.

456
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,115
This is not the time to play
fast and loose with rules

457
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,383
that keep our patients safe.

458
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:53,552
If it was Meredith Grey
asking to see her child,

459
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,120
would you say the same thing?

460
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:01,393
Five minutes, not a second longer.

461
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,868
Ah. Ah.

462
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,241
ABG's the same as this morning,

463
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,710
but no fever and labs are decent.

464
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,246
DeLuca's awake.

465
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,881
- Does Bailey know?
- She's still sleeping,

466
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,650
but, uh, I'll tell her in a bit.

467
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,686
That was a great save, Altman.

468
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,654
Thank you.

469
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,314
I'm gonna go check on my other patients.

470
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:43,869
I don't regret it.

471
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,670
How did you know I was wondering that?

472
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:46,872
I don't know.

473
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,497
I just did.

474
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,276
I don't regret it.

475
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,577
You know, we walk through our lives

476
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:53,979
and we witness atrocities.

477
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,981
See homeless people
on the street asking for help

478
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:58,517
and we just walk right past them.

479
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,886
See people that can't pay
for medicine for their children,

480
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
see people beating their kids,

481
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,122
and we just say, "Well,
it's none of our business."

482
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,658
See atrocities on the news every day.

483
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:08,894
Crimes and cruelties committed
by our government,

484
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:11,930
paid for, nonetheless,
by our own tax dollars.

485
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:15,133
And what do we do? We just
change the channel, right?

486
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,003
We just... We tune it out.

487
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:20,038
Then we go back to work and we
pretend like what we just saw,

488
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:24,309
or that article we just read was
somehow normal or acceptable,

489
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,777
and the people who take to the streets

490
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:27,913
screaming out for change,

491
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,281
they're written off as crazy,

492
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:31,483
they're written off as extreme.

493
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,485
Doesn't make any sense.

494
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,253
Makes no sense.

495
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,788
But what you did, Meredith,

496
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:39,157
risking your medical license
to save that little girl...

497
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:40,358
That made sense.

498
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,560
And what I did... Following that woman,

499
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:42,661
not letting up,
not letting her get away,

500
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:46,264
not letting her harm
another single human being.

501
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:49,224
Yeah, it was dangerous,
but it made sense.

502
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,768
It's the only thing that made sense.

503
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,140
So I don't regret it.

504
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,047
He suffered a lot of bleeding,

505
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,415
but his vitals are stable.

506
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,749
Oh, Andrea.

507
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:08,720
Hey, hey.

508
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,257
Hey.

509
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,333
Easy, easy, don't try to talk.

510
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:17,662
You did it. It's over.

511
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:18,797
They arrested the woman,

512
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,298
they arrested the man who stabbed you.

513
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,434
You saved so many children, Andrea.

514
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:25,579
_

515
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:28,707
Now, blink once for morphine

516
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,476
and twice for "I'm a dummy
who will never ignore

517
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,111
his sister ever again."

518
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,695
What was the surgery? I want details.

519
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,566
It was a trauma. It went well.

520
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,070
Your oxygen saturation's gone up.

521
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,105
That's encouraging.

522
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,547
I did love you,

523
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,382
even though I tried so hard
not to love you

524
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,251
because I also loved Owen.

525
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,219
I think I thought
that I could love you both,

526
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,688
but instead, I just...
I tore it all to the ground

527
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,590
and took you both with me.

528
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,994
Wow.

529
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,897
I asked you for one thing, Altman.

530
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,765
You asked me for the truth.

531
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,100
No, no. I didn't ask you for that

532
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,169
because the truth is relative.

533
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,037
You got yourself convinced
that you loved us both,

534
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,706
but empirical evidence
would suggest otherwise.

535
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:43,254
- Empirical? I...
- He doesn't want you.

536
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,781
You're right, you dragged us
both to the ground,

537
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:49,835
but he doesn't want anything
to do with you

538
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,350
and I'm still here sitting in the dust.

539
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,854
If you loved me, Teddy, we'd be together

540
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:59,354
instead of... together in our misery.

541
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,148
Empirical evidence.

542
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:06,532
I asked you to admit you never loved me

543
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,070
because...

544
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,574
I need it.

545
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:16,876
If I survive this thing...

546
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,380
...I want to get up off the
ground where you dropped me,

547
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,748
so...

548
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,186
...I need it.

549
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,236
I never loved you, Tom.

550
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,673
Thank you.

551
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:53,479
You want to sit, or...

552
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:55,281
Oh, the second I stop,

553
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,316
Scout starts wailing
like a human ambulance.

554
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,351
As you were.

555
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:00,386
And Scout needs me to keep moving.

556
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,323
Zola, Bailey, Ellis...
They need us to keep on moving,

557
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,092
playing songs and eating.

558
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,260
They eat so much.

559
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,794
So I just keep
going to the grocery store

560
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,664
and buying food
that Amelia keeps pretending

561
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:12,865
she knows how to cook,

562
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,767
and what if Meredith
doesn't survive this,

563
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,973
you know what it's gonna do to my life?

564
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,539
Yeah, you just said that out loud.

565
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,775
Don't worry about it,
we're all scared. No one's judging you.

566
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,010
I'm a little bit judging,

567
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:26,412
but that's 'cause I've only
known you seven minutes.

568
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:29,749
I'm on my knees every night
praying that she survives this,

569
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,884
and I'm not an
on-my-knees-praying kind of guy.

570
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,519
- I get it.
- I'm not praying for myself.

571
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,688
You're human, Link.
Give yourself a break, alright?

572
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,023
You're exhausted.

573
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,458
Meredith is... She's family to me.

574
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,228
I mean, Meredith is family.

575
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:46,232
I can think of a million reasons
I don't want her to... die.

576
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Some of them are about her,
some are about me,

577
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,869
some are about the world at large.

578
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,570
Point is, you're allowed
to have your reasons.

579
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:53,306
They don't all have to be selfless.

580
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,552
I just...

581
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:58,511
I mean, those kids already lost
their dad.

582
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:01,392
I don't want them to have
to grow up without a mom, too.

583
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,083
And all we can do is just...

584
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,151
Keep moving.

585
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,533
Yeah.

586
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,087
I mean, literally keep moving,

587
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,488
'cause human ambulance.

588
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,157
Yeah.

589
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:12,825
You know, you're pretty good at this.

590
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,393
The whole "keep somebody calm

591
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,196
you've only known seven minutes" thing.

592
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,166
Well, to be fair, it's been more
like eight minutes now.

593
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,634
It's true.

594
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,769
And, Jackson, thank you
for getting Maggie over here.

595
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,471
I-I-I'm sorry if that was awkward.

596
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,298
- You were the only one picking up.
- No, it's fine.

597
00:28:27,545 --> 00:28:29,504
Why would it be awkward?

598
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,259
Uh, just...

599
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,849
Yeah.

600
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,552
Okay, you're, uh...
You're her ex, aren't you?

601
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,587
- Mm.
- Another round?

602
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:42,788
Yeah.

603
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:51,998
I was Zola and Bailey and Ellis.

604
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,799
I was the kid who lost a parent

605
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,488
and the world turned upside down.

606
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:59,163
And I don't know...

607
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:02,308
if I hadn't been there to see
my dad dead on the ground,

608
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,877
how long they would've waited
to tell me.

609
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:10,316
Nobody talked about it.

610
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:14,215
I didn't expect answers, but...

611
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,760
there wasn't room for questions.

612
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,707
Just... silence.

613
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:25,435
Meredith told the kids about Derek.

614
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:28,591
We can do this for her.

615
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,398
She deserves us

616
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:32,442
stepping up.

617
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,445
And the kids do, too.

618
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,676
Can we just stay here a little longer?

619
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,489
Your mom is gonna freak out
when she sees you.

620
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:51,824
Yes, she is.

621
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,427
Code blue, code blue.

622
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,728
Code blue.

623
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:56,829
Val's coding! Hurry!

624
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:57,963
No.

625
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,632
No, no, no.

626
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,390
Hey.

627
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,752
Comfortable?

628
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,340
Well, your sister just went
to get coffee,

629
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,743
but she left strict instructions.

630
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,135
No car chases, okay?

631
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,351
Okay.

632
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:24,423
He's tachycardic and his CVP's going up.

633
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:25,858
Code blue, code blue.

634
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:26,859
Must be cardiac tamponade.

635
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,227
We're gonna have
to open him back up again.

636
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,096
Let's get a scalpel
and order more blood.

637
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,364
Code blue, code blue.

638
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,000
DeLuca? DeLuca, we're gonna have
to open you back up, okay?

639
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,869
But I am with you, okay?

640
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,037
I got you, okay?

641
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,039
Come on. Staple remover.

642
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:41,552
Thank you.

643
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,977
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

644
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,309
Okay, wire cutters.

645
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,850
Okay.

646
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,520
Good, let's go.

647
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:56,288
One, two, three.

648
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,295
Somebody page Altman and have
her meet me in the O.R.!

649
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,215
Call for more blood.

650
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,199
Start the massive transfusion protocol.

651
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,935
Almost there, DeLuca, okay?

652
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,661
Let's go, let's go!

653
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:21,320
Charge to 150. Clear.

654
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:23,805
Come on, Val!

655
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,763
You're so close
to seeing your baby girl.

656
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:27,889
Charged to 200.

657
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:28,969
Clear.

658
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:35,145
What happened?

659
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,670
He went into DIC. He's bleeding out.

660
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,704
Push TXA...

661
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,740
- I already have.
- Push more.

662
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,174
I'm gonna need a ton of lap pads.

663
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,280
Let me in.

664
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:56,890
He's crashing.

665
00:31:56,924 --> 00:31:58,838
Starting cardiac massage.

666
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,599
Charge to 270.

667
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:06,967
I think it's too late.

668
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,602
Clear.

669
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,734
So, this morning they put
your mom on a ventilator.

670
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,849
That's the machine
that breathes for her.

671
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,051
Yes.

672
00:32:24,118 --> 00:32:25,752
When will they take her off of it?

673
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,612
Different people come off of it
at different times.

674
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,893
My dad never did.

675
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,694
Do you think my mom will?

676
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,337
We hope so.

677
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,214
But we don't know.

678
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,799
We just...

679
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:44,838
We don't know.

680
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,224
We shouldn't tell Bailey and Ellis.

681
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:54,560
Not unless we need to.

682
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,983
They're just too young to understand.

683
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,386
Okay. We'll wait.

684
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:33,787
No respiratory distress,

685
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,789
chest tube's barely
putting out anything.

686
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,157
Thank you.

687
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:38,358
She's a trouper.

688
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,064
She's gonna need to be.

689
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,316
No.

690
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:45,098
I ran the code for an hour.

691
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:52,826
You know...

692
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:55,788
I was nicer...

693
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,375
before Abigail died.

694
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,628
I was a great deal many things,
most of them better.

695
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,284
I'm sorry, I never should've...

696
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:07,554
Oh, it was kind
what you wanted to do, it was.

697
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,413
I'm so sorry.

698
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,487
Me too.

699
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,405
Val is dead.

700
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,685
I heard.

701
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:05,858
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,175
DeLuca was okay and now he might not be.

703
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,059
I spent so many years
pretending to be someone else.

704
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,396
So many years afraid
of what my mother thought,

705
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,365
neighbors thought, what I thought.

706
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,716
I wasted so much time.

707
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:36,977
And now we're all just working
and surviving and waiting.

708
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:39,913
For what?

709
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,117
Is this all just gonna end one day?

710
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:46,987
Like, one day we're all gonna get a memo

711
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:50,027
that says, "COVID's over.
Everyone back to normal"?

712
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:54,794
I think I wasted all the time
I was supposed to be happy.

713
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:11,111
Mm.

714
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,981
How long have I been asleep?

715
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,317
Uh, most of the day.

716
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,621
Bailey, something's happened.

717
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:25,191
No, it's... It's not Meredith.

718
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,960
It's DeLuca.

719
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:28,061
What?

720
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,790
Richard, what?

721
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,874
Okay, give me 1 of epi.

722
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,752
The tide is coming in!

723
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:53,887
I know.

724
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,455
It's gonna wash it away.

725
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,957
I know, I'm trying to beat it.

726
00:36:57,992 --> 00:36:59,492
You're trying to beat the tide?

727
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,394
Yeah. I had more to do.

728
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:02,896
I had plans.

729
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,464
Wanted to do another tower over here

730
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:07,438
and a... a... A bridge with a moat.

731
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,441
Tide's coming in too fast.

732
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,906
Come on. It's too fast.

733
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,737
I had plans.

734
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:18,244
Come on.

735
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,480
You can't build a sand castle
without a moat.

736
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:25,039
I don't know what happens
from here, Meredith.

737
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:27,041
Me either.

738
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,223
But no matter what happens,

739
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,426
I want you to know that I never
felt seen the way you saw me.

740
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,262
I never felt inspired
the way you inspired me.

741
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,498
You made me want to be
not just my best self,

742
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,732
but better.

743
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,891
And yeah, I felt small
around you sometimes.

744
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,883
I felt insecure.

745
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:47,228
I wanted something from you that
I needed to give to myself.

746
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:50,403
But here, now, on this beach with you,

747
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:53,898
I... I get it.

748
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,002
I don't just get it, I feel it.

749
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,127
I get who I am.

750
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,887
I know my own soul, my strength.

751
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,030
Do you want to take a walk?

752
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:06,622
We can watch the sunset from the dock.

753
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:08,457
In a minute.

754
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,836
I just want to feel this first.

755
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:14,987
I just want to hold onto this
a little longer.

756
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:17,013
I'm a little bit of an exception

757
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:19,306
when it comes to having a happy place.

758
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,899
Because the hospital's always been mine.

759
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,424
Internal paddles.

760
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,083
- Come on, come on.
- Let's go, let's go.

761
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,268
Charge to 20.

762
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,084
Clear.

763
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,788
- Again.
- Clear.

764
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,330
Charge to 30.

765
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,391
Clear.

766
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:39,592
Come on.

767
00:38:39,627 --> 00:38:40,693
- Again.
- Again.

768
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:41,728
Clear.

769
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Come on.

770
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,337
Maybe it's because it's where I grew up.

771
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,078
Andrea!

772
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,355
Mom?

773
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,590
Mom?

774
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,358
Andrea!

775
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,985
I'll miss you.

776
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,447
If I go back and you don't,

777
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:23,470
I'll miss you.

778
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:26,911
It'll be okay, Meredith.

779
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,164
It will. It'll be okay.

780
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:32,541
Andrea!

781
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,113
I have to go.

782
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:35,548
Okay.

783
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:46,392
Mama!

784
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:56,065
Oh!

785
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,752
His heart won't restart.

786
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:20,026
He's been down for 40 minutes.

787
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,191
Isn't somebody going to call it?

788
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:20,782
Time of death... 22:50.

789
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,839
But if you're not like me...

790
00:41:59,426 --> 00:42:01,928
...you're going to want somewhere else.
