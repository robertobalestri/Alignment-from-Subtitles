1
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:04,117
<i>Wash your hands.
Wear a mask.</i>

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:06,366
<i>Stay six feet apart
at all times.</i>

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,147
<i>Work from home.</i>

4
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:11,309
<i>Only leave the house
for essential services.</i>

5
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,136
...thank you, doctor. All good.

6
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,191
We're ready here.

7
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,542
<i>- ♪ Broken, disillusioned ♪</i>
- In 3, 2...

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,400
Good morning, Grey-Sloan.

9
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,061
Richard Webber, here,

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,608
...chief medical officer for
the Catherine Fox Foundation.

11
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:31,624
<i>And at times,
we even need you</i>

12
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,288
<i>to isolate from
the people you love.</i>

13
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:35,952
This time has been
extremely difficult.

14
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,358
<i>Many members of our staff
have been unable</i>

15
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,921
<i>to see their families,</i>

16
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:42,069
<i>we've struggled with supplies,</i>

17
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:45,270
<i>and we've lost more patients
than we could ever imagine.</i>

18
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:47,233
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

19
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:48,615
I gotta say,
it's a definite improvement

20
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,147
from his last
on-screen performance.

21
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:52,811
Only two people in the lounge
at a time. COVID protocol.

22
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:53,960
- Since when?
- Since now.

23
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>Along with our patients,</i>

24
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:57,889
<i>we need
to take care of each other.</i>

25
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:00,032
<i>That's why
I'm pleased to announce</i>

26
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,358
<i>that Grey-Sloan
has been fortunate enough</i>

27
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:06,327
<i>to secure enough COVID tests
for the entire staff.</i>

28
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:09,098
<i>Today, we will be testing
hospital-wide.</i>

29
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:10,975
<i>It is not an option.</i>

30
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:14,001
<i>Additionally,
and effective immediately,</i>

31
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,531
<i>residents will not be able
to go into rooms</i>

32
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:17,969
<i>with COVID-positive patients</i>

33
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:20,077
<i>or those patients
whose results are pending.</i>

34
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,914
That's half the hospital's
patient intake!

35
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,578
- Why?!
<i>- It is imperative</i>

36
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:27,046
<i>that we control the hospital's
transmission rate</i>

37
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,615
and protect our residents.

38
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:30,737
Oh, and speaking of residents,

39
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,171
please let's give our new class
of interns a warm welcome.

40
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,226
And they have graciously agreed
to start early

41
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:40,983
to help us
in our time of need.

42
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,343
<i>We have to press pause</i>

43
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,663
<i>on everything that makes us
feel like we belong.</i>

44
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:49,460
<i>Sadly, quarantine looks a lot
like surgical internship.</i>

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,725
<i>No joy if you want to survive.</i>

46
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,257
Sorry, I went to get a few hours
of sleep.

47
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,093
Hey. Okay. Present.

48
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:57,913
Patient was admitted
for respiratory support

49
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,288
four days ago,
after a positive COVID test.

50
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,779
Her O2 is 92%
on six liters nasal cannula,

51
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:05,682
WBC count is downtrending,

52
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:07,733
and her latest creatinine
is .89.

53
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,634
How's she feeling?
Any body aches?

54
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,486
Increased fatigue?

55
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,819
<i>Why don't you ask me
yourself?!</i>

56
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,218
Lungs sound good.

57
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,124
Hey.

58
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,561
When are you gonna
let me out of here?

59
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm gonna let you out of here

60
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,975
when I'm convinced
you won't collapse again.

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,979
Well, that was
four days ago. I feel fine.

62
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,897
I think you should just release
me with supplemental oxygen

63
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:33,736
so I can go quarantine
in a hotel.

64
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:36,261
Let's give the room
to someone who really needs it.

65
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:39,032
According to the tracker,
we're almost at capacity.

66
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,302
I told them to take away
your log-in privileges

67
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,367
so that you would rest.

68
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,281
I have connections.
I own the place.

69
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,392
Well, let me take a look
at your inflammatory markers

70
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,561
and your D-dimers,
and then we'll talk.

71
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,483
Who's on my service?!

72
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,909
It's handled, Mer!
We got it!

73
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,444
And will you stop yelling?

74
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,303
You need to save
your breath.

75
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,983
Damn it!

76
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,826
We were not able
to resuscitate Mrs. Lewis...

77
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,200
Respiratory failure.
Time of death 8:12.

78
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,727
Do you want me
to call her daughter?

79
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,395
No. I've been getting to
know her these past two weeks.

80
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,763
I should call her.

81
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,231
I want to call her.

82
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,192
You okay?

83
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,036
That's the seventh patient
I've lost this week.

84
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:37,895
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,997
Me, too.

86
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,325
- Are you lost?
- No.

87
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,449
It's quiet on the peds floor,
so I thought I'd come down here

88
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,442
and see if I could
ease the burden a little bit.

89
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,786
Turns out,
adults aren't as funny as kids.

90
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,520
Unless you find death funny.

91
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,387
Sorry, I'm in a really
dark mood.

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,613
How's Grey doing?

93
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,951
Oh, I hear she's bossing
everybody around up there.

94
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:01,090
Glad to see some things
are returning to normal.

95
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,257
Want me to tell her
you said hi?

96
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,934
God, no. Wouldn't want her
to think she's special.

97
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:11,090
I would get another CRP,
ESR, D-dimer,

98
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,777
and I'd like to schedule her
for a chest CT

99
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,612
before we even consider
discharging her.

100
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,314
I'm sorry, "I"?

101
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,882
We. You.
Whomever.

102
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,751
What's going on?
Meredith wants to leave

103
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,918
to go to a hotel.
Her pulse ox is above 92%,

104
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:26,348
her ABG looks good,
no fever for 48 hours.

105
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:28,262
I'll check her daily labs,

106
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,120
but she does not want
any more tests.

107
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:32,739
And this is protocol.

108
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,301
And she wants us
to follow it.

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,583
Meredith breaks protocol
for every patient.

110
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,437
We can't break it for her?

111
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,892
Part of being an attending

112
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:43,481
means no longer asking
for permission.

113
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,013
- Hey!
- Meredith! Oh, my God.

114
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,815
- Mer? Mer! Hey!
- Meredith?

115
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,949
- Hey!
- Hey, Mer!

116
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,351
- Meredith?
- Hey, okay, okay.

117
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,369
Meredith? Okay.
Let's turn her over. 1, 2, 3.

118
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,270
Meredith, come on.
Stay with me, Mer. Hey.

119
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,942
Okay, come on.

120
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,457
- Meredith?
- Come on. Come on.

121
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,403

Hey, do you know - Okay, sats are 88.

138
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:39,931
Where you are?
Can you hear me?

139
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,066
I can hear you.
And you're loud.

140
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,005
Well, sorry.

141
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,270
Come on.
Take a deep breath for me.

142
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,355
Come on.

143
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,841
I just was trying
to take a couple of steps.

144
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,083
I thought
I could make it.

145
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,887
I want to go to the beach.

146
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:02,892
The only place you're going is
radiology for a chest CT, Mer.

147
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,614
No more tests.

148
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,966
Meredith, that is where
we are going right now.

149
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,023
E-Excuse me. Ma'am,

150
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,459
despite what you may read
or hear in the news,

151
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,427
sunlight does not in fact
kill COVID-19.

152
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,552
Ha. I've been covering
Meredith's service.

153
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:31,059
I haven't been outside
in four days.

154
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,247
- What are you doing here?
- Hand trauma.

155
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,623
You left Amelia alone
with four kids for a hand?

156
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,943
She told me to come in.

157
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,376
Oh. You're already
annoying her.

158
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,052
What's on your shirt?

159
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:44,161
Ooh, that's, uh, syrup?

160
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,872
I made pancakes
this morning.

161
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,451
Weird.
You're a dad.

162
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,028
- Missed you!
- Yeah.

163
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,505
Abdominal pain consult
in the ER.

164
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:55,525
I have faith in you.

165
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,622
COVID test is still pending.

166
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:00,403
I feel like I could just
lay down and die.

167
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,802
Ah.

168
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,719
You really shouldn't say that
during a pandemic.

169
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:06,020
God.

170
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,574
We should have
gotten scans hours ago.

171
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,270
She felt fine
hours ago.

172
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:13,291
That's the thing
with these patients.

173
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:14,639
They think that they're
on the other side of this thing,

174
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,052
- and then they tank.
- DeLuca...

175
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,447
Instead of waiting around,
we should have started

176
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,050
interferon alpha 2b,
anti-retrovirals,

177
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:21,551
antimalarial drugs.

178
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,607
I got a-a dozen patients in the
ICU already on this protocol.

179
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:25,856
And you're seeing
positive results?

180
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,593
With some, but I've also
read a lot of studies

181
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,436
that show that these meds,
they reduce the sev...

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,757
What studies?
Are these peer-reviewed?

183
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:32,262
- Have they been published?
- They're credible.

184
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,309
Nothing is credible.
Not yet.

185
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,565
And I don't feel comfortable

186
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,602
giving Meredith Grey
some experimental drug

187
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,804
that's gotten some foot traffic
on a Reddit board.

188
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,039
Let's just
get the scans first.

189
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,607
We can fight
about the plan later.

190
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,681
Val Ashton?

191
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,919
Hi. I'm Dr. Wilson.

192
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,061
Okay, so you've had
abdominal pain and vomiting

193
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,482
- for the last two weeks?
- But it's not COVID.

194
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:01,224
I have gone nowhere,
seen no one, touched nothing.

195
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,286
I couldn't stop talking
to the nurse that took my blood.

196
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,262
It was the first
in-person conversation

197
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,698
I had had in months.

198
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,904
I told her about
the fight with my co-worker,

199
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:11,172
all about my ex.

200
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:14,170
And I think
I invited her to lunch.

201
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,474
Don't worry.
They're used to it.

202
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,459
Okay, so your labs came back
already, and...

203
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,095
congratulations.

204
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,553
You don't have COVID.

205
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,701
You're just pregnant.

206
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,039
- What?
- Pregnant.

207
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,076
- What?
- Yaay?

208
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,334
Sorry they even called you in.

209
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,680
I know you're technically
on leave,

210
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:37,671
- so if you need to...
- Happy to help!

211
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,862
- What do we got?
- Ssssh.

212
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:44,014
Bryan, Lucy needs time

213
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:47,776
and she needs patience.
Try again.

214
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,866
Any chance you can come back
in 15 minutes?

215
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,842
My clients are about
to have a major breakthrough.

216
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,514
No, sorry.

217
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,154
Helm?

218
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:58,280
Manoj Joshi, closed crush
injury to the right hand

219
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,874
due to a sandblaster
falling on it.

220
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,552
He presents with pain,
swelling, and numbness.

221
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,093
X-rays didn't show any fractures.

222
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,156
But he does have
delayed capillary refill.

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,623
My therapy practice
has boomed with the pandemic,

224
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,312
so I finally could afford
to make some improvements

225
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:11,928
to my home office.

226
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,443
I guess I should
have let a professional do it. Uh.

227
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,834
How long is my hand
gonna be out of commission?

228
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,163
I do a lot of
demonstration in my work.

229
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,913
As a... therapist?

230
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,171
<i>Do I do it
counter-clockwise now, Dr. J?</i>

231
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:28,593
<i>I think she likes it.</i>

232
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,480
- Oh!
- Sex therapist.

233
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,865
Mute, mute, mute.

234
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,749
- You think it's a joke.
- Absolutely not.

235
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,576
Physical touch and pleasure

236
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:41,810
are two of the most important
forms of communication.

237
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,827
What I teach
is more vital than ever

238
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,028
in the middle
of a global crisis

239
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,702
that's destroying
human connection.

240
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:48,065
I need my hand
to function.

241
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,021
Well, we just need a CT to
determine if you need surgery.

242
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,717
Fine.

243
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,257
Can I have the room now?

244
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,756
- Yep.
- Yep.

245
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,060
Alright, Bryan.

246
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,315
See, Lucy likes that.

247
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,650
Drive-thru testing should be
up and running by tomorrow morning.

248
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,418
- Thank you for that, Webber.
- Sure.

249
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,474
I asked Koracick about that
for weeks.

250
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,014
Uh, speaking of inefficiencies,

251
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,202
I have a whole list

252
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,584
of things Tom Koracick did
that I'd like to change.

253
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,587
How about putting it
in writing, you know?

254
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:20,831
E-mail me.

255
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,811
Uh, since when do you
prefer e-mail?

256
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,858
Ah. Times have changed

257
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,437
since the last time
I was chief, Bailey.

258
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,210
- You got to keep up.
- Of chiefs. Chief <i>of</i> chiefs.

259
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,742
I'm still chief.
And I'm still yours.

260
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,256
Well, now that you have his job,
what happens to Tom Koracick?

261
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,428
Don't worry about him.

262
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,974
I have a plan.

263
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,295
I am Dr. Thomas Koracick,

264
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,698
but you can call me
Dr. Koracick.

265
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,538
Maybe you were expecting
Dr. Webber,

266
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,296
but today is a day
of many surprises.

267
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,718
The first of which,
I have drawn a very short straw.

268
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,933
The second, you have
won the lottery today.

269
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,905
I'd spend some time regaling you
with my accomplishments,

270
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,093
but I'm very busy.

271
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,739
Treat yourself
to an Internet search.

272
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,674
- Which one are you?
- Reza Khan.

273
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,560
You're on scut.

274
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:08,046
Respectfully,
I can handle more.

275
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:09,778
I'm a vascular surgeon
in Pakistan.

276
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,748
The U.S. is just making me
repeat my training.

277
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,650
Ah, unfortunate.
But you're still on scut.

278
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,919
Chee? Progress notes.

279
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,754
Jensen, discharges.

280
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:22,066
Ortiz, a new shipment of PPE and
testing supplies arrives today.

281
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,527
You get to sort them.
Riveting.

282
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,597
Excuse me?
Which Ortiz?

283
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,497
- I'm Sara Ortiz.
- And I'm Alma Ortiz, her mother.

284
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,176
- We both matched here.
- Ah, how sweet.

285
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:32,919
But two interns
with the same name won't fly.

286
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,276
Who's changing theirs?

287
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:38,018
Alright, we'll go
with nicknames.

288
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,276
Big O, Little O?

289
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,478
You decide.

290
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,830
Name tags
for everyone.

291
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,084
If you need anything
at all,

292
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,690
ask someone else.

293
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:57,433
Ground-glass
opacities of the lungs.

294
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,207
Someone sent me an article

295
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,737
about triple antiviral therapy
for COVID patients.

296
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,532
The side effects are
kind of tricky,

297
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,961
but I think I could handle it.

298
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,523
You're supposed
to be resting.

299
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,740
I specifically asked them
not to give you a tablet.

300
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,842
Here, I found it.

301
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,844
Triple antiviral therapy.

302
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,524
Phase 2 trial of combination
antiviral therapy

303
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,050
could speed recovery
in COVID patients.

304
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,492
What do you think?

305
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,720
I'll ask Altman.

306
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,611
Are you good?

307
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,079
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you mean.

308
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,600
I mean are you good? Because
I've respected the boundaries

309
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:37,767
for the last four days.

310
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,069
I've played the role
of family member.

311
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:42,516
I have... respected your authority
as a physician.

312
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,188
Maggie, I've got this.
Do you?

313
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,727
Because we both know
what happens

314
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:48,345
when a patient's lungs
start to look like that.

315
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,898
They could turn on us
at any moment.

316
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:55,773
So...
I need you to swear

317
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:58,788
that no matter what is going on
in your personal life,

318
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,320
you have this.

319
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,679
Because I can't be
her doctor.

320
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,031
I have to be her sister.

321
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,757
I have this.

322
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,836
I'd like DeLuca
to be on her medical team.

323
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,037
He's seen more COVID cases
than any of us.

324
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,460
Okay.

325
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,551
My husband and I tried
to get pregnant for years.

326
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,953
Six rounds of IVF.

327
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,219
And we ended up with no baby,
no savings,

328
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:36,891
and we hated each other.

329
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,235
So we split up.

330
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,235
And then I had a one-night stand
with this weirdo, Newman,

331
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,953
who was renting our back house
for a couple of weeks.

332
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,367
I had lost my job,
had some wine,

333
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,538
then I switched to tequila.

334
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,430
Ugh!

335
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,193
My rock bottom
is the father of my baby.

336
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,702
He's not.

337
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:58,452
- What?
- I see no baby.

338
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,261
I'm not pregnant?

339
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,779
I'm sorry, but no.

340
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,472
A positive pregnancy test
with no pregnancy

341
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,274
can indicate other things.

342
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,781
I'll order a scan.

343
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,310
Other things like what?

344
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,814
Some tumors, uh,
can release beta HCG.

345
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:16,516
- A tumor?
- We will take it

346
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,093
one step at a time.

347
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,858
I saw the scans.

348
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:27,938
Displaced fracture
of the hook of the hamate?

349
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,719
Exactly.
You know, the ulnar artery

350
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,283
looks a little narrow
by the fracture site,

351
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,813
which I've seen
in plenty of patients

352
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,368
that use a lot of
vibrating power tools.

353
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,769
You don't say.

354
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,798
Yeah. You gonna be able
to help me with the excision

355
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,707
- or you got to get back?
- Oh, I'm staying.

356
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,110
Four kids in lockdown.
This place is like a dream vacation.

357
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,713
Got to say I think
I'm a little jealous.

358
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,282
I don't get to see my Harriet
as much as I used to

359
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,133
'cause I take more COVID shifts
than my ex,

360
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,969
so she's with her stepdad
more than me,

361
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,329
which, you know,
he's a good guy,

362
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,585
but I don't like hearing

363
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,157
that Matthew cuts sandwiches
better than Dada.

364
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,938
Kinda weird
having my place so quiet.

365
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,532
I kinda miss the mess,
honestly.

366
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:03,992
Apparently he's famous
in the Pacific Northwest.

367
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,211
He saves marriages.

368
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,071
You're Googling our patient,
Helm, really?

369
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,742
Whoa,
37 an hour.

370
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,920
37... dollars?
Like his rate?

371
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,429
No. Not possible.

372
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,201
Good to have goals.

373
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,055
You're doing it wrong.

374
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,710
No, you're doing it
wrong again.

375
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,546
Hey, are you
in charge of him?

376
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:26,407
Well, depends.
Has he killed anyone, or...

377
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:27,892
I've been waiting for
the progress notes

378
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:31,124
and summaries for two hours,
and he hasn't even finished one.

379
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:32,759
Fix it.

380
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:35,671
You clearly don't know
how to make friends.

381
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:37,558
Scoot.

382
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,891
Well, here's your problem,
next to "Discharged."

383
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,110
I-I-I type
"Home and awaiting follow-up."

384
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:50,438
And I keep getting "Error."

385
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:51,978
That's because they're not
being discharged to go <i>home.</i>

386
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,353
They're being
discharged to the morgue

387
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:56,148
or to the giant Popsicle truck
in the south parking lot,

388
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,976
which is very sad.

389
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,619
All these people
have died?

390
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,977
You're doing death summaries
during a global pandemic,

391
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:04,601
so... yes.

392
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:07,061
All dead.

393
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,429
Carry on.

394
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,188
Wilson, I need you to
keep covering Grey's service.

395
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:18,188
I'm hoping
to persuade Dr. Webber

396
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:19,640
to come back
to the OR,

397
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,414
whenever he finishes
adjusting his crown.

398
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,758
Chief of chiefs.

399
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,391
I could be
chief of chiefs.

400
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,646
You'd be really good
at that.

401
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,616
Hmm.
What do you got?

402
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:32,819
Abdominal pain, vomiting,
positive beta HCG.

403
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:34,821
She's not pregnant,
but I want to rule out a mass.

404
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:36,461
Mass!
There. In the liver.

405
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:39,992
That is no mass.
That is a fetus.

406
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:43,679
She is pregnant, but her baby
is attached to her <i>liver?</i>

407
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,430
Mine.

408
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,039
Uh, th-this patient
doesn't have COVID.

409
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,656
I'm allowed to be
on the case.

410
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,373
I feel better.

411
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,755
<i>Go wash up, Ellis.</i>

412
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,037
Shh, Amelia,
you'll increase her heart rate.

413
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,225
What's happening?

414
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,741
<i>- We were watching you sleep.
- Why?</i>

415
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,506
Well, we didn't
want to wake you.

416
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,057
How are you feeling?
Like I want to go back to sleep.

417
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,522
How are my kids?
Did Bailey lose that tooth yet?

418
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:14,780
<i>They miss you.</i>

419
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,863
<i>Bailey's tooth is stubbornly
still there.</i>

420
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:19,498
So, Meredith,
I was looking at your chart,

421
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,935
and I noticed
your healthcare directive.

422
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,471
- It says...
- I know what it says.

423
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,443
Okay. Good.
Um, so,

424
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,743
well, we were thinking
that maybe

425
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,420
you might want
to reconsider.

426
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:33,756
<i>Mama?</i>

427
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,419
<i>Is that Mama?
Is she okay?</i>

428
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,857
<i>Hold on, Ellis.
I-I will let you talk to her</i>

429
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,077
<i>in one minute, okay?</i>

430
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,873
- Put her on, Amelia.
<i>- Of course, I...</i>

431
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,405
<i>But can we talk about w-what
happens if you suddenly...</i>

432
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,982
I don't want to talk about that.
I want to talk to my kids.

433
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,444
<i>- Mama!
- Hey.</i>

434
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,444
<i>Look at you, so big.</i>

435
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,466
Auntie Amelia is feeding you
all that growing-food, huh?

436
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,091
I love you so much,
Ellie bell.

437
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,998
Derek!

438
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,716
Why can't I get
anywhere?!

439
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,530
You're worried
about the kids!

440
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:46,919
I don't understand!

441
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:49,943
The sand isn't real,
Meredith!

442
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,451
I miss you!

443
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,468
I know.

444
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,686
Hey. Things seem to be
running smoothly down here.

445
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,988
Webber.

446
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:16,192
Right.

447
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,333
I talked to the kids this morning.

448
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,793
They seem good.
Spoiled.

449
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,353
How's Meredith?

450
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,531
Her numbers aren't
where they should be.

451
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,212
I got to drop these off.

452
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,036
- Ortiz?
- I'm sorry.

453
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:30,485
For what?

454
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,111
- I don't know.
- Your PPE's on incorrectly.

455
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,208
Your gown is loose
in the back,

456
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,206
and you just touched the inside
of it with your gloved hand.

457
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,979
And your face shield
is not in place.

458
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,463
Tseng, show her how to correctly
don and doff PPE,

459
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:42,158
which someone should have shown
her first thing this morning.

460
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,043
- But I'm next in line, so c...
- Now.

461
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,182
There's a baby in my liver?

462
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,752
You have what's called
an abdominal pregnancy,

463
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,626
where the fetus develops
outside of the uterus.

464
00:20:57,884 --> 00:20:59,900
You're about 26 weeks.

465
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:02,447
Val, these pregnancies

466
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,106
don't normally survive
to term,

467
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,576
but...
your baby is very much alive.

468
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,313
Your case is
extremely rare.

469
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,899
He made me feel like crap
for eight years.

470
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:19,352
Every time IVF didn't work...

471
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,291
he would
look at the doctor and say,

472
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,837
"Well, what can she do
differently next time?"

473
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,341
When clearly
it was his fault.

474
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,231
Because I had
a one-night stand

475
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:31,557
with a guy that wears
square computer glasses,

476
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,621
and I'm knocked up.

477
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,868
Val.

478
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,337
Do you want this baby?

479
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,151
Okay.

480
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,102
Then we need
to deliver her today.

481
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,400
The growth of the placenta

482
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:55,346
could cause the liver to bleed
at any moment,

483
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,527
and we need to operate
to save you both... now.

484
00:21:58,735 --> 00:21:59,938
It's a girl?

485
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:01,876
Yes, it is.

486
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:04,931
Luna.

487
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:06,962
That's her name.

488
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:10,595
Ever since I was a little girl,
I knew my daughter's name.

489
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,247
Val.

490
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,110
Yeah, okay.

491
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:19,540
Let's get her out!

492
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:26,188
<i>Dr. Sung to Recovery.
Dr. Sung to Recovery.</i>

493
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:28,235
<i>Dr. Sung to Recovery.</i>

494
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:37,732
If you think I look
bad, you should see my lungs.

495
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,102
Not funny.

496
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,790
We need to talk
about your POA.

497
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,845
My sisters
sent you in here.

498
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,705
I know what Alex Karev
means to you.

499
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,581
And I know he would have
your best interests at heart.

500
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,392
But he is halfway
across the country,

501
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,017
and we can't even travel
yet.

502
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,289
Look, God forbid,
this thing gets any worse,

503
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:05,294
he might have to make decisions
regarding your care.

504
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:10,446
And you know those decisions
can be rough over the phone.

505
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:12,514
You need to pick
someone local.

506
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:15,904
Amelia can't even decide
what's for dinner.

507
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:21,276
Maggie... She doesn't know when
it's time for someone to die.

508
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
She has a hard time
letting them go, so...

509
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:30,723
At least Alex... will pull the plug
if I need him to.

510
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,466
Let's just talk

511
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:37,593
about s-something else, please.

512
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,684
I'm about to scrub in
on a hepatic pregnancy

513
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:46,988
where the fetus
is attached to the liver.

514
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,426
No! Alive?

515
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:53,863
Ugh.
I'm so jealous.

516
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,801
Removing the bone.
Rongeur.

517
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,013
Careful around the ulnar nerve.

518
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,082
You want to take over, Helm?

519
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,652
Dr. J's right.
People need sex right now.

520
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,137
More than ever.

521
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:14,638
It's therapeutic.

522
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,007
What if you live in a house

523
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,505
that's like Los Angeles
International Airport

524
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,707
on Thanksgiving Day?

525
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,344
Your flight is delayed,
and there's no place to sit.

526
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,144
The bathrooms are disgusting.

527
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:26,957
Forget regular sex.
You don't even want to eat.

528
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,152
Looks like this
artery's thrombosed.

529
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,262
- Can you fix it?
- I've got to harvest a vein

530
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:32,801
and place a graft.

531
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,761
Take a little bit longer,
but, yeah.

532
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:36,105
I'm in.

533
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:39,931
I fear the night at Meredith's
house like a medieval villager.

534
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,064
Vessel loops.

535
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,697
"Mama Ortiz"?

536
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,681
Better than
the one you suggested.

537
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:55,385
Uh, fine. Can you tell me
why you're not, uh, in the ER?

538
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,088
Jensen is on Discharges.

539
00:24:57,173 --> 00:25:00,593
Yeah, Jensen quit after
two hours, and so did Stewart.

540
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,822
Okay, well,
why hasn't Mrs., uh, Cooley

541
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:04,634
been discharged?

542
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,837
I decided
not to discharge her.

543
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,165
Her chart is a mess.

544
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,915
Hand-off communication
has been nonexistent.

545
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,509
She's supposed to be discharged
to Hillridge Nursing Facility?

546
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:15,798
- You ever heard of it?
- I...

547
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:19,021
Yeah, 17 new COVID cases,
19 deaths.

548
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,933
Okay, the-these are all things
that can be discussed

549
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:22,101
with her doctor.

550
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,384
Great. I would love that.

551
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:24,627
Where is Dr. Grey?

552
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,822
Look, Dr. Grey is...

553
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,032
She's off today.

554
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,720
Look, your diligence
has been noted,

555
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:30,838
but these are
extraordinary times.

556
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:33,104
Let's not forget that we're
in the middle of a pandemic.

557
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:34,626
I haven't forgotten.

558
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:38,038
Before med school, I spent
20 years as a social worker.

559
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,589
I was there
through H1N1.

560
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:41,939
And I know
that people deserve better.

561
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:43,689
Especially in a pandemic.

562
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,978
So I'm not discharging her.

563
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:47,630
Have Dr. Grey call me.

564
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,126
Someone's messing with me, right?

565
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:54,009
We got a 26-weeker attached
to the liver? Still viable?

566
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,017
Come see for yourself.
Liver's exposed.

567
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:58,267
Wow.

568
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:59,986
Hello there, little one.

569
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,309
Okay, let's go through it again.

570
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,149
The placenta has left the liver
extremely friable.

571
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,120
We cut. We get the baby out.
We leave the placenta intact.

572
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,121
- Otherwise, she could bleed out.
- Which she will not.

573
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:13,237
Everyone in this room
needs a little joy.

574
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:15,943
- Ready?
- Ready.

575
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:17,940
Weirdest C-section
I've ever done.

576
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:20,456
- Also ready.
- Here we go.

577
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,426
Cutting into the amniotic sac.

578
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:29,215
Clamps for the umbilical cord.

579
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:30,566
Heavy scissors.

580
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:33,901
Thanks.

581
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,284
I'm not seeing any movement.

582
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,479
Prepare to intubate immediately.

583
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:50,526
Where is all this blood coming from?

584
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,462
Oh, the right hepatic artery.

585
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:53,784
More suction.

586
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,087
How's Luna?

587
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,533
Apgar 2, maybe 3.

588
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,675
Still trying
to get the tube in. Come on.

589
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,597
Come on, come on, come...

590
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:03,633
I'm in.

591
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:05,536
Bag her, please.

592
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,261
Okay, we need to get her up to
the unit as fast as possible.

593
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,681
Go.

594
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:20,495
Ready, let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on.

595
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,998
More lap pads, more.

596
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,266
More, more...

597
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,852
We should resect the right lobe.

598
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,768
No, that could lead
to liver failure. No.

599
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:30,285
Then we put her on dialysis and
get her on the transplant list.

600
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,510
That's not as easy
as it used to be. Hold on.

601
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,347
I'm not gonna let her die
before she sees her kid.

602
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:35,681
Clamp.

603
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,905
Hold on! Hold on!

604
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:43,362
Bailey?

605
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,940
Okay. Okay, do it.

606
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:47,588
Bovie.

607
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:11,852
You look like crap.

608
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:13,337
<i>Look who's talking.</i>

609
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:16,235
<i>I got a 26-week-old baby
looks stronger than you.</i>

610
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,421
- Liver baby?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

611
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:21,593
So, I hear you're looking
for a POA.

612
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,083
<i>Are you here to volunteer?</i>

613
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,256
I am cold, calculating,

614
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:27,265
<i>couldn't care less
about you or your kids, so...</i>

615
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:30,721
Everyone is family.
I don't want to do that to them.

616
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,796
<i>Then don't.
Write down on paper</i>

617
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,199
<i>what you want, every last detail,</i>

618
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:35,869
<i>and then choose
someone who'll defend it.</i>

619
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:37,771
The people who love you
the most, you know,

620
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:40,142
they're going to beg them to do
something, anything to save you.

621
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:43,437
So...
choose someone who'll choose you,

622
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,906
over and over again.

623
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:46,702
Is that what you did
for your wife?

624
00:28:46,787 --> 00:28:49,038
<i>Uh, no...
Knew better than that.</i>

625
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,919
But her sister followed every
last wish that Abi wanted,

626
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,812
no matter
how much we all hated it.

627
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:57,484
<i>Go on, get some rest.</i>

628
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,390
I'm afraid...

629
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,257
If I fall asleep...

630
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,968
I'm afraid
I might not wake up.

631
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,671
Everyone's scared of you, Grey.
<i>You know that?</i>

632
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,171
It's 'cause you're fierce.

633
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:19,656
You've got teeth, grit.

634
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:21,312
<i>You fight to the bloody death</i>

635
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,062
<i>about the stupidest,
little things.</i>

636
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,773
This virus has got nothing
on you.

637
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,507
We successfully removed
the bone fragment

638
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,510
and removed a blood clot
from your artery.

639
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,671
And fortunately,
the nerve was intact.

640
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,372
You're not gonna get
your feeling back immediately,

641
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,474
but we're confident you will
over the next few months.

642
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:01,070
And you still have your hand.
The hand.

643
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,740
We'll get you
an occupational therapist,

644
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:05,024
go through some exercises
to help you in your recovery.

645
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,476
I have my own regimen.

646
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:09,617
I exercise my hands
five hours a week.

647
00:30:10,764 --> 00:30:12,454
Maybe you could just
take your time

648
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,858
with whatever your...
regular routine is.

649
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:17,828
You want to know my secret,
don't you?

650
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,163
- Nah, I think we're good.
- Nah, no thanks.

651
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:22,242
Yes. I do, please,
tha-thank you, mm-hmm.

652
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,171
I ask my clients
what they want.

653
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,077
And I listen.

654
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,234
Your plan worked.

655
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:44,922
- Excuse me?
- Well, you had to know

656
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:46,452
I'm not the man
for this job.

657
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:48,266
Those kids are terrified.

658
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:49,548
At least the ones
who haven't already quit.

659
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:51,298
And the ones who stayed
have no idea what they're doing

660
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,763
and I have no idea
how to show them.

661
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,231
Or you just don't want to.

662
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:55,499
Maybe
you're unaware

663
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,446
because it's always
come naturally to you,

664
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:59,903
but teaching the way
that you do it, it's a gift.

665
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,812
It's not a talent we all have.

666
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:03,453
Amelia Shepherd said

667
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:05,867
that you were the best teacher
she ever had.

668
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,523
That's why
I gave you the job.

669
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,880
I teach neurosurgeons
how to cut.

670
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:13,749
I don't teach kids
how to walk through a pandemic.

671
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,312
I can't give them
what they need right now.

672
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,523
You can.

00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:26,210

00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,351
How was your surgery?

679
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,069
Well, it was a crush injury
to the hand.

680
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,913
The patient was some sort of
sex therapist.

681
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,007
Apparently he's very well-known
for helping women

682

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,696

waiting for me to tell them

695

going to be fine,

696
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:22,235

and wondering... who the person is

697
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,937
who is going to tell you
and me that.

698
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,216

701
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:34,407
There's a global medical crisis
going on, and I can't even help.

740
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:17,193

She was so funny.

She, um...

765
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:51,027
She thanked me every single time
I came in to check on her,

766
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,294

774

to not be a statistic.

776
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:25,426

785
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:04,880
