1
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,917
People often ask
what I've learned

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,963
from surviving COVID.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,012
I know they mean well, but it's
a really annoying question.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,365
Being away from work,
my children,

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,585
getting hooked up to a vent...

6
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,197
it's not exactly a masterclass.

7
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,551
Though it did teach me
something.

8
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:32,597
It taught me
that I'm still alive.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,700
Did you know that every avocado
sold commercially

10
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,442
originates from a tree this one
dude had in his backyard?

11
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:54,097
No, but did I know
that an avocado has

12
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,534
more potassium than a banana.

13
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,928
Well, did you know that
if you ate 400 bananas,

14
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,712
you might overdose on potassium?

15
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,836
Why would you say that?
You know I worry about dying.

16
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,630
Okay, whoa.

17
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,850
We'll shut up.
Please don't evict us.

18
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:08,851
That's not our stuff.

19
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,244
Are you evicting yourself?

20
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:12,202
I'm smart and I'm capable

21
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,944
and I have made livable homes
out of the humblest of places,

22
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,250
including my car.

23
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,733
But I deserve more
than just livable.

24
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:21,777
And so does Luna,
so I am fighting for her.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,257
I'm rich. Ha!

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,781
Technically, I am rich.
I own part of the hospital.

27
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:28,131
So I'm gonna sell my shares
and hire a lawyer

28
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,393
to help me adopt Luna.

29
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,352
And then, I'm taking
whatever money's left

30
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,005
and moving to a place

31
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,008
where I don't have to listen
to people argue about fruit!

32
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,575
â™ª Yeah, yeah

33
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,012
Dibs on the bed.

34
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,972
But explaining that
to my ex-husband

35
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,800
was like a full-time job.

36
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,976
Sounds like it.

37
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,325
You paged? Oh, hey.

38
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,153
Dr. Altman, this is, uh, Sophie.

39
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,807
She was in a little
fender bender.

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,785
She's all clear except her
heart rate is a little high.

41
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,352
So I thought you should
check on her EKG.

42
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:58,596
I told him it's probably just
white coat syndrome.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,990
One look at him and
my heart's off to the races.

44
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,210
Oh, sorry.

45
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,038
Keep forgetting it's COVID and
you can't just touch people.

46
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,605
Don't worry, I'm wearing
protection.

47
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,609
Okay.

48
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,196
I, uh... I'll come back
and check on you.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,613
See you soon, Sophie. Hope so.

50
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,137
Oh, you're wearing protection?

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,529
I didn't mean it how it sounds.

52
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,314
Well, she's throwing herself
at you.

53
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:21,750
No, she's just nervous.

54
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,336
Well, I can give her
your number, if you want.

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,928
Oh, really? No.

56
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,234
Now, look.

57
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,497
As Residency Director,

58
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,021
you're not only teaching them
to do surgery,

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,588
but you're...
You're guiding them.

60
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,590
When a resident loses a patient,

61
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,418
it's your shoulder they cry on.

62
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,091
If they succeed,
you're their cheerleader.

63
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,682
So, essentially, they...

64
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,858
You're on call 24 hours a day.

65
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,444
That's the way you always
described it to me.

66
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,775
I appreciate the advice.
I do know how to do the job.

67
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,578
I've been watching you do it
my whole career.

68
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,015
If I were you, I would be
doing the surgeries

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,388
that I don't get to do.

70
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,887
Well, you're the only one
I wanted for the job.

71
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,565
We'll see you at the wedding.

72
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,088
So, you gonna give
Richard's speech

73
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,089
or did you write your own?

74
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,613
No speech. No... No speech?

75
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,832
No.

76
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,792
No, no, no, no, no.

77
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,316
Okay, we admitted 10 patients
last night with COVID symptoms.

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,971
What are the statuses
of all 10 patients?

79
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:15,891
- Cardio tech, room 342.
- Cardio tech, room 342.

80
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,458
Give the O2 a minute, Gerlie.

81
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,262
We'll increase it if your sats
don't come back up.

82
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,071
Or you could present
the patient to me,

83
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,856
and I could decide if we should
increase it right now.

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,249
Present, Schmitt.

85
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,425
Gerlie Bernardo, 37,

86
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,558
admitted this morning
with sats of...

87
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,473
88. Temp was 102.

88
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:35,650
Heart rate 105, BP 96/54.

89
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,912
Dehydrated.

90
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,741
I'm a nurse... long-term care.

91
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:43,092
Gotten pretty good at knowing
when to call the ambulance.

92
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,050
Private or at a facility?

93
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,489
Lakeforest... assisted living.

94
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:50,447
I'm guessing that's where
I picked this up.

95
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:54,799
But I've helped take care
of Earl for 7 years.

96
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,323
Even when he has COVID,

97
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,976
I'm still helping him
to the bathroom.

98
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,587
He's 96.

99
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,676
The kindest person I know.

100
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,852
My parents were
at Silver Villas.

101
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,636
They were hit hard.

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,290
Yes, they were.

103
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:10,815
So, let's put her on high-flow,
order chest films,

104
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,602
and start steroids
and Remdesivir.

105
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,619
How did Luna do?

106
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,577
Couldn't have been better.

107
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,579
Hate that CPS made
the poor thing wait a week

108
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,581
before approving
her surgery, but...

109
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,018
Nurse Kaiser to the OR.

110
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,585
Your name will be
back up there soon.

111
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,587
I don't know.
They gave me an office.

112
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,501
And a desk. Mm.

113
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,720
And a chair.

114
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,548
Wow, a chair?

115
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,506
They must really fancy you.

116
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,639
You could have just
said no, you know.

117
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,293
When I asked you out
for a drink.

118
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,140
You didn't have to pass out and
spend two months in the hospital

119
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,513
just to avoid turning me down.

120
00:04:56,557 --> 00:05:00,125
That seems like
a lifetime ago.
Mm-hmm.

121
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,388
Did I hear you?

122
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,651
Did you come to my room
and tell me to fight

123
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,043
and talk about my kids?

124
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,262
Couldn't have been me.

125
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,612
I'm far too busy
to do sickbed visits.

126
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,048
Must have been
some other Irishman

127
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,833
hanging around around here.

128
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,531
That being said, I am glad
you didn't die, Grey.

129
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,098
Me too.

130
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,363
You'll get back there soon.

131
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,234
I should get going.

132
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,758
My sister is getting married.

133
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,976
Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,157
...as long as we both
shall live.

135
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,423
Now, very important question.

136
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,251
Is there anyone here
who objects to this union?

137
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,601
Oh, well, we do!

138
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,560
He... He was kidding, Nana.

139
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:46,084
Well, we aren't.
I'm sorry, Maggie.

140
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,348
Wait, is this real?

141
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,437
Mommy,
what's happening? I'm not sure, sweetie.

142
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,284
Winston,
I've been waiting for this day

143
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,876
since I could cradle you
in my arms.

144
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,966
And I know you went to a lot of
trouble to get us here,

145
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,489
but this... This is broke.

146
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,577
Ha!

147
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,624
Oh, I am so sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

148
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,453
No disrespect, Meredith.
You have a lovely home.

149
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,846
But Maggie, your own sister
isn't here!

150
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,631
Amelia had to be on call today.

151
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,807
Right, should she let someone
die of a stroke

152
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,504
just to be here with us?

153
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:17,289
But even if she was here,
you have more family.

154
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
You have uncles, aunts, cousins.

155
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,642
I have a savings account
for your wedding,

156
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,643
to do this right.

157
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:23,861
In a church.

158
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:26,081
Or at least with more
than 10 people.

159
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,866
Do you know how proud we are
of you two?

160
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,259
We want the world to see.

161
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,653
But it isn't safe
right now, Nana Ante.

162
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,263
We can't do it that way.

163
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,874
Well, then wait.
What's the hurry?

164
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,615
You all are already
living together.

165
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,752
So, uh... we wait?

166
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:51,933
Yeah, I guess so.

167
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,543
I'll get the champagne.

168
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,066
- Yeah.
- Vodka, please.

169
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,200
Can I cut the cake? Just wait a minute,
okay, honey?

170
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,854
You can do whatever you want,
sweetie.

171
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,769
Okay, she said
you can go get cake!

172
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,205
You wanna take this?

173
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,641
Great, thank you.

174
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,860
Champagne, anyone?

175
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,036
I'll take that.

176
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,865
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

177
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,344
Bottoms up, everyone!

178
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:28,143
Dr. Sellers,
Dr. Mari Sellers, 4619.

179
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:31,712
Uh, technically, I still haven't
signed the discharge paperwork.

180
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,802
I... I know, but I've never
missed a month of work

181
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,282
in my life, and they need me.

182
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:40,416
I heard Earl took his pants off
during Arts & Crafts.

183
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,809
Twice.

184
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,593
You were on a vent
for two weeks.

185
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:47,205
I know at your facility
it's all hands on deck, but...

186
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,425
Take it easy and go slow.

187
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,254
Yes, Dr. Bailey,
I know the recommendations.

188
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,604
Oh, so you know
they apply to you also?

189
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,040
Mm-hmm.

190
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,913
Come on, let's have
one last listen.

191
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,915
May I take a listen
first, Chief?

192
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,307
I don't have a lot of experience

193
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,068
listening to lungs that have
recovered from COVID,

194
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,703
and I think it'll be really
beneficial to my education.

195
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,099
Fine. Yes!

196
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,408
Just take a few deep breaths
for me, please.

197
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,065
Love.

198
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,502
Does that mean I can go?

199
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,721
Uh, no, I'll still need to take
a listen of my own.

200
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,418
"Love."

201
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:32,207
The rush I felt
when I watched that woman,

202
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,992
who'd been in a coma for weeks,

203
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,691
whom I could only
talk to via MRI,

204
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,693
leave the hospital
with her father...

205
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,479
The relief and the joy
and the hope...

206
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,613
I mean, I felt that for, like...

207
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,571
30 seconds.

208
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,181
And then just...

209
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:53,315
all the worst-case scenarios
started screaming in my head.

210
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,230
I mean, not for her,
for... for me.

211
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:58,625
For my family. My son.

212
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:03,499
And I don't know why my thinking
is so dark, except...

213
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,720
addict.

214
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:09,940
But it's been a year. Um...

215
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,377
So much. So much fear.

216
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,901
So much fear.

217
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,688
And I know you guys all get it.

218
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,951
And my boyfriend,

219
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:24,172
my, um, child's father...

220
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,696
he is not one of us.

221
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,916
And I am so glad

222
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,309
that he does not have to
go through life like that.

223
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:32,920
Um, but...

224
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:36,358
sometimes, there's a part of me
that wishes he got it.

225
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,318
You know, just, uh...
really got it.

226
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,494
I feel lonely in it.

227
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,541
So...

228
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,716
I'm here.

229
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,718
Thanks, Amelia. Jason?

230
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,764
Hi, I'm Jason. I'm an addict.

231
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,809
"And all the king's men

232
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:56,030
couldn't put Humpty
together again."

233
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,205
Hmm.

234
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,598
Huh.
Should've let the women try.

235
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,426
What do you think, Luna?

236
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,515
All this talk of eggs
is making her hungry.

237
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,082
Can I get her bottle?

238
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,172
Humpty Dumpty's an egg? Isn't he?

239
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,392
Looks like someone's got
an appetite.

240
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:14,091
Yep, eating like a champ.

241
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,658
I'm glad. Everything else good?

242
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,052
Yeah. Just checked her vitals.

243
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,836
How long until she's discharged?

244
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,056
She's still pending
an upper GI study

245
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,319
and pre-albumin
we need to monitor, so...

246
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,061
But if you had to ballpark it.
Days, weeks, months?

247
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,106
I'm sorry.
It's too early to say.

248
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,693
I know you want to get started
with a placement.

249
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,283
I've already got
a family interested

250
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,764
in fostering to adopt.
They're perfect.

251
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,742
They don't mind the extra
attention that she's gonna need,

252
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,769
but they did ask for a timeline,
so keep me posted.

253
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,774
You want me to foster Luna?

254
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,777
Just on paper.
I would do all of the work.

255
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,170
All of the... everything.

256
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,215
I... I know that
I'm asking a lot,

257
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,956
but I am out of options
and time.

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,871
And you... you are...

259
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,047
You are stable and good.

260
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,483
You already have a kid.

261
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,268
You're a doctor,
which might be a plus

262
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,965
for a baby with medical issues.

263
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,751
And unlike me, your background
check will be spotless.

264
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:05,882
Link,

265
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,276
I have never loved anybody
like this,

266
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,254
and the idea of her going to
live with somebody else,

267
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,149
it just... it carves out
my stomach.

268
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,368
I can't lose her.

269
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,413
I... I can't.

270
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,591
I-It's... It's temporary?

271
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,158
It's temporary!

272
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,726
A-And... And we will eventually
transfer custody to me.

273
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,530
And... And you probably won't
even have to take her home,

274
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,687
because she can't leave
the hospital yet.

275
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,689
Please, Link, please.

276
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
Jo...

277
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,261
I-I'm saying yes.

278
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,701
Amelia...

279
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,330
You know, w-we'll figure it out.

280
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,767
Hell, she'd probably do
the same thing.

281
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,749
So, Jo, my answer is yes.

282
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,142
Of course it's yes.

283
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,144
It's you.

284
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,687
But you're cool if I change
her name, right?

285
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,147
Shut up. Hear me out...

286
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,062
Hildegard.

287
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,764
How could this happen?

288
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,244
COVID's just a numbers game.

289
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,830
Oh, do you think that
it's a false positive?

290
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,353
I don't know, that's why
I'm testing you again.

291
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,746
What about the kids?
What about you?

292
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,119
Your mom... Teddy, I'm negative.

293
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,555
And you don't have any symptoms.

294
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,819
Let's just follow the protocol.
We're gonna be okay.

295
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,690
What if I'm not?

296
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,648
Meredith was... Teddy.

297
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,520
We'll be okay.

298
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,522
Let's not worry about anything
until we have to.

299
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,785
Go home, get in bed.
My mom will take the kids.

300
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,482
I have to go. Mm-hmm.

301
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,706
You're adopting a baby
for your friend?

302
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,316
It's fostering.

303
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,144
It's just to get Luna
off the market

304
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,755
while Jo figures out
the legal stuff.

305
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,321
And if she doesn't? She will.

306
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,541
But if she doesn't?

307
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:43,023
Then I guess we'll have
a daughter.

308
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,025
Bad joke.
Okay, that won't happen.

309
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:47,636
I promise, Amelia,
this is just a technicality.

310
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,986
And really, what other choice
did I have?

311
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,163
We didn't think twice when...
When Mer needed our help.

312
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,991
Meredith is my sister

313
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,124
and her kids are my family.

314
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,953
But they're not mine.
Technically.

315
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,259
But I love them, so I did it.

316
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,786
Is this really a problem?

317
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,178
Of course not.

318
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,572
It's just surprising.

319
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,356
I mean, it's only
for a little while, right?

320
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,357
You're sure?

321
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:14,358
Go to your surgery.

322
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,751
I'm fine.

323
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,926
Thank you.

324
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:32,072
I've been in the hospital
for a month.

325
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,726
Forgot what the sky looked like.

326
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,728
COVID?

327
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:38,121
I had it, too.

328
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,036
Well, if you're back at work,

329
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,909
that seems encouraging, right?

330
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,736
Do you sit at a desk?

331
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,957
Nurse. Oh.

332
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,351
Everyone recovers differently,
I think.

333
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,396
I'm still taking it easy.

334
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,139
Continuing shortness of breath,
fatigue, lingering cough...

335
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:58,533
Sounds like recovery's a blast.

336
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,449
They don't happen all at once.

337
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:03,843
What about the survivor's guilt?

338
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,583
That doesn't go away.

339
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,933
My ride's here. Okay.

340
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,239
Autzen? Thank you.

341
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,981
Take care of yourself.

342
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,896
Thank you for...
For being honest.

343
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,202
I'm... I'm Gerlie.

344
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,681
I'm Meredith.

345
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,686
Are you okay?

346
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,687
Dr. Grey!

347
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:24,211
Gerlie!

348
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,300
Call a rapid response.
I need a gurney!

349
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,692
Gerlie?

350
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,737
Gerlie?

351
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:42,011
Canceled? What?!

352
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,929
Grey...

353
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,235
Hey, hey.

354
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,367
Uh, what happened
to Grand Rounds?

355
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh, well, Gerlie's
post-COVID complications

356
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,981
are far more instructional.

357
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,591
She's got a pneumothorax,

358
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:00,203
she's day 14 post-op from a very
complicated VATS procedure,

359
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,423
and now she has
multifocal pneumonia.

360
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,642
Oh, so...

361
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,862
Grand Rounds aren't canceled,
they're just postponed.

362
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,865
It would have to be a really
slow day to make it worthwhile.

363
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,389
But i-it's tradition.

364
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,825
I-I can't tell you

365
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,629
all that I learned
in Richard's presentations.

366
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,453
Yeah, but the last thing
people need right now

367
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,614
is to listen to someone talk
about how surgery works,

368
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:22,008
especially
after the year they've had.

369
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,445
If you're dying to listen to
someone talk about surgery,

370
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,013
I've invited the class
to watch me do Gerlie's bronch.

371
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,797
You're more than welcome
to attend.

372
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,625
You're doing it yourself?

373
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,193
I've been back three months
and have not operated.

374
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:36,239
Are you ready? You sure?

375
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,633
It's just a bronch
and some cultures.

376
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,244
Don't forget, you gave me
this job to change things.

377
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,116
So that's what I'm doing.Uh...

378
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,658
Dr. Blast to nuclear medicine.

379
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:45,901
Okay.

380
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,643
Okay, great. Thank you.

381
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,992
Hey, listen...

382
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,428
Oh, no, you first.

383
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,691
Okay, I realized something

384
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,216
that's going to make your
foster application a shoo-in...

385
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,000
Owning part of the hospital!

386
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,437
How nice of you to think of me.

387
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:04,311
Ugh! I need the money
for stupid adoption legal fees

388
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:06,922
and a family-sized home,
but nobody wants my shares

389
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,620
because hospitals
are just bleeding money
during the pandemic

390
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,927
and it's, quote, "the worst
investment of all time."

391
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,494
Really selling me on the idea.

392
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,105
Okay, I didn't want to
have to go down this route,

393
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,325
but as part owner,
I'm kinda your boss.

394
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,327
So I could just order you
to buy them.

395
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay, but then wouldn't I
be your boss

396
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,306
and I could just make you
buy them back?

397
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,679
Some friend.

398
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,506
Sorry, Jo. Ah!

399
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,203
It's a no.

400
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,597
But I really hope you figure out
something fast because...

401
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,990
I got approved to foster.

402
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,817
What? Really? What?!

403
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,819
Why didn't you tell me?! You went first!

404
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:35,777
Oh, my God.

405
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,996
Thank you!

406
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,519
Okay, I have to tell Luna!

407
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,612
So, the social worker came

408
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,353
and looked through our place,

409
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,224
uh, so we can get ready
to foster a baby

410
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,487
that is never gonna be ours.

411
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:54,491
And, um, the social worker
gave us this to-do list

412
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:57,581
to get the place ready
for a second kid, and, uh,

413
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,454
my boyfriend is just
diving right into the project.

414
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:04,675
And, um, when I reminded him
that it was temporary,

415
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,460
he was like...

416
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,680
"Yeah, but we'll need it
one day."

417
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:14,859
Meaning, one day, when we have
a second kid of our own.

418
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:18,080
And it just feels...

419
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:22,650
It just feels like
I don't want what he wants.

420
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:26,654
And I don't know if that's
diseased thinking or...

421
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,657
if it's just me.

422
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,836
Marriage and more kids, um...

423
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,664
I don't want it.

424
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,492
And...

425
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,581
I can't tell him.

426
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,149
And I'm mad.

427
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,021
Not at him. He's...

428
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,110
nothing but wonderful, and...

429
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:51,766
I'm mad at me.

430
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,379
And I know that all of this
would be unimaginably worse

431
00:17:56,423 --> 00:18:01,167
and more confusing
if I was high, so...

432
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,084
since I can't be sure
of anything,

433
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,434
I'm just being sure of that.

434
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,964
Owen?

435
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,575
Happy end of quarantine.

436
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,770
Maybe we should wait
one more day.

437
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:20,969
Teddy...

438
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,579
I mean, just to be sure.

439
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,365
Listen. The kids are fine.

440
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,018
We're all testing negative,

441
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,387
and there's no patients
testing positive.

442
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,934
Okay. Good.

443
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,153
That's... That's good.Yeah.

444
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,589
How you feeling?

445
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:36,202
Got my energy back.
And no fever, no cough.

446
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:39,161
I mean, I did sneeze maybe once.

447
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,207
Teddy, come out.

448
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,078
Okay? You're safe.

449
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,865
And Leo made me bring you
a very special celebration meal.

450
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:49,171
Mac and cheese? Yep.

451
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,694
In a mug.

452
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,610
He was very adamant about
it being in a dinosaur mug.

453
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:56,396
I miss them.Yeah.

454
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,833
Okay...

455
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,139
Here we go.

456
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,622
Hey.

457
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,758
You look tired.

458
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,543
You look beautiful.

459
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,154
Owen, I just...

460
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,945
Wow. Two weeks is
a really long time.

461
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,299
Schmitt, look at all this
fibrosis and scar tissue.

462
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,867
I can't believe it's this bad.

463
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,521
Culture tube.

464
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,830
Dr. Grey?

465
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,572
Is everything okay?

466
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,184
Saline flush.

467
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,968
And someone get me a wheelchair.

468
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,709
Okay.

469
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,145
What's going on?

470
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,886
Phew. I'm dizzy.

471
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,322
My breath is shallow.

472
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,455
My heart rate has gotta be
in the 100s.

473
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,152
Should we page Chief Bailey?

474
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,547
I'm coming in.

475
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,733
We maxed Gerlie out on the vent
in the middle of the night.

476
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,125
She still wasn't
saturating well.

477
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,519
Then about an hour ago,
she coded for the second time.

478
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,497
Why didn't you call me
when she coded the first time?

479
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,870
It's Christmas Eve!

480
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,587
I thought you'd be
with your kids, or, you know,

481
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,328
wrapping presents,
baking cookies... Stop talking.

482
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,875
You put her on ECMO?

483
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,400
She's young, I saw no other
comorbidities in her chart,

484
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,402
and I've seen patients
walk out of here

485
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,055
weeks later after being on it.

486
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,511
I'm sorry, I know that
Gerlie is your patient,

487
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:33,623
but it was an active code.

488
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,321
No, it's okay.
It was the right call.

489
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,366
Alright.
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow?

490
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,281
Yes, of course.
Merry Christmas, Altman.

491
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,457
Merry Christmas.

492
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,460
Merry Christmas!

493
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,680
These guys will keep you company

494
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,377
and play you music

495
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,815
and stimulate
your extraocular muscles.

496
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,643
Jo. Yeah?

497
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:56,385
What do you think?

498
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,604
I thought it was pretty clear

499
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:58,842
we were just doing
the baby thing.

500
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,084
That would be funny

501
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,410
if I wasn't worried
Amelia was gonna say it.

502
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,889
Wait, you guys haven't
talked about marriage

503
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:05,307
since she said she didn't want
to get married?

504
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,136
She also said that she didn't
notwant to get married.

505
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,722
She just didn't want it
to feel compulsory,

506
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,705
and I've been planning this
for weeks.

507
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,316
It's too small, right?

508
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,492
You got another diamond ring?

509
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,451
I'm not stupid.
I got a sapphire, too.

510
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,235
Okay, stop.
This is getting weird.

511
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,019
I need your advice! Okay, I...

512
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,804
I am yourbest friend, not hers,

513
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,588
so I'm not sure
which one she'd like.

514
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,287
Um, you know, she's...
They're all so beautiful.

515
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,897
She's gonna love
whatever you pick.

516
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,898
Should I have gotten a fourth?

517
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:32,378
Okay, you're literally holding

518
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,989
the value of three of my lofts
in your hand.

519
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,556
Here goes nothing. Wish me luck.

520
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,254
Good luck. And merry Christmas!

521
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,485
Holidays are hard. Huh?

522
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,487
For me, anyway.

523
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,576
It's when I miss Abigail
the most, you know.

524
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh. Yeah. Joy to the world.

525
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,797
I was just hoping
that dying patients

526
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,539
who've recovered from COVID were
eligible for lung transplants.

527
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,932
What a world that would be.

528
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,542
Got you a present.

529
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,935
Might help.

530
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,371
A present?

531
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,549
It's open and half-empty.

532
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,204
Short notice.

533
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,772
Unless you'd rather
pass out again

534
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,208
to get out of this...

535
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,912
SlÃ¡inte.

536
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,871
Whatever you said.

537
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:33,090
â™ª Paper and ribbon

538
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,136
â™ª Candles glow in window panes

539
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,181
Bailey, wait your turn.

540
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:40,359
Okay, Leo, this one
is from Auntie Amelia.

541
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,708
And Uncle Link.

542
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,232
Uh, no, this one is just
from Auntie Amelia.

543
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,626
- Whoa!
- It's a brain!

544
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,846
Yay! It's educational andfun.

545
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,633
Yep, that one is definitely
just from Aunt Amelia.

546
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:56,070
Now, uh, I've got one
for you, Amelia.

547
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,202
Whoa, look. It's snowing.

548
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,203
- Snowing!
- It's snowing?

549
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,596
What? What?

550
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,293
Why is it snowing
only in the backyard?

551
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,445
That's weird.
Let's go see what's up.

552
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,079
Come on. Let's go.

553
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:09,039
â™ª Sending cards to loved ones
we never get to see â™ª

554
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,085
Look at this!

555
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:15,829
Why is it snowing
outside my bedroom?

556
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,613
What's happening?

557
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,268
Look at this!
Do you believe this?

558
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,444
You got me snow for Christmas.

559
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,534
It's snowing!

560
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:27,493
Oh, my God.

561
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,885
Oh, come on, man. Oh, my God.

562
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,497
Theodora Grace Altman...

563
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,500
Now, this is not the first time
I've asked you this.

564
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:37,546
And we've hurt each other,
I know,

565
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,548
but we have forgiven each other.

566
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,396
We may not make sense
to the rest of the world,

567
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,378
but we make sense to us.

568
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,815
So I am asking you,
in front of everyone...

569
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,035
Including your ex-wife.

570
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:51,778
Would you please continue to
make me the happiest man alive?

571
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:53,432
Yes. Yes.

572
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,826
- Yay!
- Oh, my God! Wow!

573
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,915
Whee!

574
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,658
Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:07,533
â™ª Paper and ribbon
seem to be everywhere â™ª

576
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,367
â™ª Hey!

577
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:25,594
â™ª Hey!

578
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:29,468
â™ª Hey!

579
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,254
â™ª When you're looking up
at the sky â™ª

580
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:37,258
â™ª I will always be
where you are â™ª

581
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:41,697
â™ª Oh, oh, oh,
our love carries on â™ª

582
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:45,658
â™ª So go, go, go
back where you belong â™ª

583
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:53,492
â™ª When you're looking up
at the sky â™ª

584
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:58,322
â™ª I will always be
where you are â™ª

585
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,499
Well, Hunt says
that the whole staff

586
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,153
should have their first dose
by the end of the day.

587
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:06,722
I love needles.

588
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:11,771
â™ª Back where you belong

589
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,555
â™ª Back where you belong

590
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,252
Yes, yes.

591
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:16,471
Hi.

592
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,255
We need to put Gerlie
on the list

593
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,301
for a double lung transplant.

594
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,085
Grey, I am in my joy.

595
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,870
Do not take me out of my joy

596
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,828
to remind me of something
we shouldn't do.

597
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,438
She can handle it.

598
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,571
Her hemoglobin has been stable
for weeks now,

599
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,573
but her lungs are not improving.

600
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:34,315
If this is the part where
you remind me of her cousins

601
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:37,100
or how she rescues puppies

602
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,712
or buys groceries for old folks

603
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,453
or sends half of her paycheck
to her family in Manila

604
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,020
and deserves to live, I...

605
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,066
I know who she is, right?

606
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,764
The work she does,
the lives she's saved.

607
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,158
I-I know what she deserves.

608
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,769
But Gerlie recovered from COVID.

609
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,989
Hey, she might recover
from this.

610
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,600
So, why risk putting her through

611
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:02,082
a potentially unnecessary
and dangerous surgery?

612
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,060
So, we're just supposed to wait
and hope she lives?

613
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,521
Or try other treatments.

614
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,610
What if we wait too long
and she develops sepsis

615
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,003
and is too sick
for a transplant?

616
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,832
We're not there yet.

617
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,137
You took my joy.

618
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,791
You took mine.

619
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,927
There you go.

620
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,929
Oh, thank you.

621
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,584
You are welcome.

622
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,195
So, uh...

623
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:31,415
You didn't, uh...
Didn't share today, huh?

624
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,940
Have you gotten some clarity
with things at home?

625
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,594
Nope.

626
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,987
Just tired of talking myself
in circles

627
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,642
on a subject with no answer.

628
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,950
Well, it doesn't have to work.
You know that, right?

629
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,168
Me and Link?

630
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:47,431
You and anyone.

631
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,651
You have a child...
You'll always have a connection.

632
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,306
And I'm sure you love
each other, so...

633
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:55,004
but it doesn't have to work.

634
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,619
It really sounds like
you're telling me to leave him.

635
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,056
But that also doesn't sound
like something you'd ever say.

636
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,494
I'm definitely not
telling you that.

637
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,279
You know, something
I've noticed in recovery...

638
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,412
You know we...
We get it in our heads

639
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:16,069
that the addiction is the only
reason our lives were a mess.

640
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:18,854
So we think, "Well,
I'm... I'm sober.

641
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,464
It should be working."

642
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,684
And that's not always the case.

643
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,140
And I'm not saying
that either one of you

644
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:26,383
are doing anything wrong.

645
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:29,996
But you're allowed
to want what you want.

646
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:35,697
Even if it's not what he wants.

647
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,003
Ah.

648
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,744
Anyway, that's my two cents.

649
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,618
That's like a billion cents.

650
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,446
Eh, it's some advice

651
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,405
I wish I'd have been able
to take in my life.

652
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,756
Giving yourself permission

653
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,237
for it not to work...

654
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,152
might give you peace of mind
to stay.

655
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,725
Thank you. Thank...

656
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,118
Thank you so much, Anne.

657
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,077
This... This means
the world to me.

658
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,906
Okay. Alright, bye.

659
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,083
Sounds like good news.

660
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:16,042
Luna's lawyer is a shark.

661
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:20,046
I am definitely getting custody.

662
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:22,701
Oh, congratulations, Wilson.

663
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:26,705
Oh, I'm so thrilled
for you and Luna.

664
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,881
Hey, if you need a character
reference or whatever,

665
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,056
just let me know. Thank you.

666
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,100
Alright.

667
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,802
She isexpensive, though.

668
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,629
Is this you asking me
for a raise?

669
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,414
No, this is me telling you

670
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:44,635
that I sold my shares
of the hospital.

671
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,986
And you're... wincing?

672
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,770
What, bad price?

673
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:51,140
Maybe I should just let the
person who bought them tell you.

674
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,295
Hmm?

675
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,579
Miranda!
Did you hear the good news?

676
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,822
Wilson. You didn't.

677
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,234
You know, it's easy
to push for change

678
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,409
when you don't feel
the consequences.

679
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:00,739
I wanted some skin in the game.

680
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,610
I offered you
a character reference!

681
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,003
You won't even know I'm here.

682
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,092
Aside from board meetings,
expense reports,

683
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,920
weekly progress reports.

684
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,138
Okay, talk to you later, Tom.

685
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,706
Wait, I...

686
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,403
Should I...?

687
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,405
Yeah, I should just...

688
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,798
Thanks again.

689
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,366
Thank you.

690
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,717
Wha...?

691
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,241
Gerlie has shown no improvement
since going on ECMO.

692
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,243
Oh, she's alive.
That's an improvement.

693
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,810
So, treatment options.

694
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,246
Double lung transplant.

695
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,683
Yes, but since she could suffer
additional bleeding

696
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:35,121
or sudden death,
that is not an option.

697
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,446
But it could be.
If you made it one.

698
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,819
Thank you, Helm. Who else?

699
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,647
Uh... Ortiz.

700
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,563
So, at first, I considered
monoclonal antibodies.

701
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,869
Mm-hmm. But then it hit me...

702
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,088
Double lung transplant
makes the most sense.

703
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,437
Anyone have any suggestions

704
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,005
other than
double lung transplant?

705
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,224
Thank you. Perez?

706
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,834
Uh, we transplant
her right lung,

707
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:56,055
and... also her left.

708
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,014
We could also try
a double lung transplant.

709
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,537
I'm sorry.

710
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,254
Dr. Grey said we literally
couldn't stop pitching it.

711
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,497
Thank you, Schmitt.

712
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,455
This was in no way obvious.

713
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:08,545
Move.

714
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,112
Just tell me before you do it.

715
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:12,158
I'm already done.

716
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:15,552
So, just ice it and drink
plenty of fluids, okay?

717
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,511
Oh, thank you, my boy.

718
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,295
You're sure I didn't steal it
from someone?

719
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,993
It was extra.

720
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,579
I actually called
our entire waiting list

721
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,778
before I called you.

722
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,345
If you hadn't gotten here
when you did,

723
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,539
I would have had to throw it
in the trash,

724
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:27,521
which feels like a sin.

725
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:28,914
The more people that get this,

726
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,524
the safer we'll all be.

727
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,309
And how long 'til I can hug you
without a mask?

728
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,877
Two weeks after
your second shot, so soon.

729
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,270
Did I miss it?

730
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,837
Oh, I missed it.

731
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,664
You can give me
my second shot, dear.

732
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:50,892
Okay, not only did you
take my joy,

733
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:56,289
I now have an army of interns
trying to do your dirty work.

734
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,682
Double lung transplant
is her best option.

735
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,772
You are supposed to be
teaching them, Grey.

736
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,339
This is me teaching them.

737
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,428
We have to stop thinking
about COVID

738
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,866
in terms of who survives
and who doesn't.

739
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,130
There are millions of people
who are going to be suffering

740
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,088
from the aftereffects of COVID,

741
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,351
and we need to advocate for them

742
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:17,614
as hard as we advocate
for everybody else.

743
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,401
It is risky, but it is also
her best shot.

744
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,230
So, you teaching them is just...

745
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:26,188
you breeding an army
of little yous?

746
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,668
No respect for legacy?

747
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,670
Richard Webber made you.

748
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,106
He made me.

749
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,716
And he's going to die someday.

750
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,501
And one day,
you're going to die,

751
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,503
and one day, I'm going to die.

752
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,940
And if this year
has taught us anything,

753
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,943
it's that that may happen a lot
sooner than any of us want.

754
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,466
So I'm not going
to waste any time

755
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,382
teaching anything other
than what matters most.

756
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:49,516
And Bailey, you know
if this was me or your mother,

757
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,127
you would be screaming
from the rooftops.

758
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:54,086
You know that, right?

759
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,915
Just please call UNOS.

760
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,742
Okay.

761
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,180
You can make changes

762
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,791
and still honor

763
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,967
what made you.

764
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,403
I don't know what that means.

765
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:09,405
It means I'm gonna make
the damn call,

766
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,016
but you're starting back
Grand Rounds.

767
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,322
Or you're fired.

768
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,210
Mom!

769
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:55,886
â™ª Talk

770
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,673
â™ª Let's have conversations
in the dark â™ª

771
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:04,939
â™ª World is sleeping,
I'm awake with you â™ª

772
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,725
â™ª With you

773
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,945
â™ª Watch

774
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,731
â™ª Movies that we both
already seen â™ª

775
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:19,736
â™ª I ain't even looking
at the screen, it's true â™ª

776
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,566
â™ª I got my eyes on you

777
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,309
â™ª And you say that
you're not worthy â™ª

778
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:31,139
â™ª You get hung up
on your flaws â™ª

779
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:34,969
â™ª Well, in my eyes,
you are perfect â™ª

780
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,800
â™ª As you are

781
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:43,543
â™ª I will never try
to change you, change you â™ª

782
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:47,373
â™ª I will always want
the same you, same you â™ª

783
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:50,332
â™ª Swear on everything
I pray to â™ª

784
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:54,945
â™ª That I won't
break your heart â™ª

785
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:58,732
â™ª I'll be there
when you get lonely, lonely â™ª

786
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,575
â™ª Keep the secrets
that you told me, told me â™ª

787
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,443
Can everyone
take their seats, please?

788
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:03,432
Thank you.

789
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,434
â™ª Your love is all you owe me

790
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,480
â™ª And I won't break your heart

791
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:13,225
It is my absolute pleasure to be
gathered with you today.

792
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,619
â™ª On Sunday mornings
we sleep in 'til noon â™ª

793
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,839
To love and to cherish.

794
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:23,800
â™ª Well, I can sleep forever
next to you â™ª

795
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,193
â™ª Next to you

796
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,240
In sickness and in health.

797
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:31,243
â™ª And we, we got places
we both gotta be â™ª

798
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:34,985
In Scripture, a young person
about to embark on married life

799
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:40,339
says, "I have found the one
whom my soul loves."

800
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:44,169
Maggie, Winston, this is
our prayer for you...

801
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:50,131
That you may love one another
with your entire souls.

802
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:54,135
â™ª But in my eyes,
you are perfect â™ª

803
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,919
â™ª As you are

804
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,356
â™ª As you are

805
00:34:57,399 --> 00:35:02,056
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

806
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,450
Go on, kiss her.

807
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,863
â™ª I will always want the same you,
same you â™ª

808
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,933
â™ª Swear on everything
I pray to â™ª

809
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:14,764
â™ª That I won't
break your heart â™ª

810
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:18,290
â™ª I'll be there
when you get lonely, lonely â™ª

811
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,119
â™ª Keep the secrets
that you told me, told me â™ª

812
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,468
Let's jump that broom.

813
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,426
â™ª And your love
is all you owe me â™ª

814
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,167
1, 2, 3!

815
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:29,039
â™ª I won't break your heart

816
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,221
Alright, now, everyone, um,

817
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,832
these two have to stick around
to take some pictures.

818
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,399
Would the rest of you be so kind

819
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,836
as to head to
the reception area?

820
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:46,796
â™ª I won't break your heart

821
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,450
Excuse me.

822
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,409
Hey, so they found
a donor for Gerlie.

823
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:51,453
We have to go.

824
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,889
What... Oh, my God.

825
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,171
I'm sorry we have to leave you
like this.

826
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,979
Yeah. Okay.

827
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,939
So, can you please tell Maggie
what happened?

828
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:00,636
Mm-hmm.
And can you watch
the kids?

829
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,637
Of course.
Yeah. Go, go, go.Okay. Alright.

830
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,466
Thanks. Okay.

831
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:07,730
You better give me a good price.

832
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:10,516
The economy is trash.
You're lucky I'm even looking.

833
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,494
Yeah, well, now that you
actually have some money,

834
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,694
maybe you'll, uh,
figure out how it works.

835
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:17,697
I really hope
you get a new joke.

836
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,481
Alright.
I gotta get back to work.

837
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,657
Welcome home, Jo.

838
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,749
Welcome home.

839
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,795
Welcome home, Luna.

840
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,197
What?

841
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,375
I have a village of people in my
life who wanted me to recover,

842
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,246
pulling for me
at every complication.

843
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,074
I could literally hear them.

844
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,684
And it helped.

845
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:52,688
And Gerlie's people can't be
here, so we're her village.

846
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:55,474
We're her village.

847
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:59,086
Stay with us, Gerlie.
We got you.

848
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,479
Scalpel, Bokhee.

849
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:04,613
â™ª I don't fear

850
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,663
â™ª 'Cause it won't be long now

851
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:18,671
â™ª 'Cause it won't be long
'til we're out of here â™ª

852
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,546
Ready for the specimen?

853
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,069
I'm ready.

854
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:34,600
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

855
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,384
Ready for the donor lungs.

856
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:43,261
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

857
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:49,658
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

858
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,843
You okay? You need a break?

859
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,541
No, why? Do you?

860
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,151
No.

861
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,500
Bokhee, irrigation, please.

862
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:10,331
â™ª Home

863
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:18,375
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

864
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:38,054
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

865
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:43,625
â™ª I'm gonna take you home

866
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,436
Whoo!

867
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,396
You've got this.

868
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,970
What's going on?

869
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:25,798
Well, you said you didn't
want compulsory,

870
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:28,278
so here we go.

871
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,198
I wasn't sure
what style you'd like,

872
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,809
so I-I thought you could pick.

873
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,201
Or you can just have all four.

874
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,507
Link... Amelia,

875
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,423
I-I know that this last year
has been intense.

876
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,835
Everything about us
has been intense.

877
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,252
It's... It's kind of our thing.

878
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:46,838
I don't think it makes sense
for us to wait

879
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:49,169
until life settles down,
because knowing us, it won't.

880
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,127
But I do know that
no matter what happens,

881
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:54,130
I want to go through it
with you.

882
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,524
You... challenge me,

883
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,222
you... you thrill me,

884
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,748
you impress the hell out of me.

885
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,054
There's definitely no one
on Earth like you,

886
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,882
so please,

887
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:10,495
will you do me the honor
of marrying me?

888
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:36,042
â™ª When the world was ending

889
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,479
I'm still alive.

890
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,700
â™ª And we talked about the places
we'd never been â™ª

891
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:45,704
People often laugh at that
answer, but it's not a joke.

892
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:51,231
â™ª When the world was ending,
we'd hold on to the past â™ª

893
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:53,276
Are you responsible for this?

894
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,844
â™ª 'Cause it's all we thought that
we would ever see â™ª

895
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:58,847
You do things your way,
I'm-a do things mine.

896
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,546
Being alive... it's everything.

897
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,984
â™ª Another day to begin again

898
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:08,204
â™ª To begin again, to begin

899
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:10,206
Okay, everybody, louder!

900
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:16,517
â™ª And cry because I'm happy

901
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:20,521
â™ª And hold my friends
like long-lost lovers â™ª

902
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:23,568
Time to celebrate.

903
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:27,746
â™ª Be kind to me
and love each other â™ª

904
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:36,929
â™ª The world keeps spinning on

905
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:41,368
And yes, time for pain.

906
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:44,545
â™ª When the world was ending Oh, Link.

907
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:48,157
I'm so sorry.

908
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,682
Do you have someplace
I can crash?

909
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,162
Yeah.

910
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:56,165
â™ª So far from comprehending

911
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:59,560
â™ª They'd lift us to the stars

912
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,649
Time to change.

913
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,477
â™ª Never seen each other
from so far away â™ª

914
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,826
To grow.

915
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,045
To love.

916
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,482
â™ª It's alright, it's okay

917
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,659
â™ª We will get another day

918
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,793
â™ª To begin again,
to begin again â™ª

919
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:18,274
â™ª To begin again

920
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:24,019
Meredith.

921
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,630
Gerlie!

922
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,022
How are you feeling?

923
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:30,025
You're still here?

924
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,984
I'm still here.

925
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:35,770
â™ª To begin again,
to begin again, to begin â™ª

926
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:37,380
â™ª To live and love

927
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,992
And time to give.

928
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,168
â™ª And breathe again

929
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,171
