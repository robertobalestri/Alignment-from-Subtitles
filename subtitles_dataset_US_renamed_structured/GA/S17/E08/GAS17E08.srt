Day off.

47
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:18,234
Hey, if I say something,
can you not judge me?

48
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,454
Because we're friends who bang,
not friends who judge.

49
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:22,151
Mm, I have wrapped my head

50
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:23,413

yeah.

51
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:27,461

00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,073
I can't even say it yet.

55
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,314
And I physically have
no more room left in my body

56
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,314
for sadness.

57
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:43,752
So I am switching specialties
to OB

58
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:47,176
and all I need from you
is encouragement.

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,786
You thought
I would judge you for that?

60
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,978

every day at work

61
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,594

walk out that door

62
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,698

myself hiking for three months

00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:56,944

64
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:59,666
There's not gonna be a vaccine
in three months.

but that's just ridiculous.

00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:07,650

about switching specialties?

68
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:08,806

The kids loved Andrew.

77
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,369
He used to
play his guitar for them

78
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:36,869
and teach them songs
in Italian.

79
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,728
He brought gelato
to every birthday.

80
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,282
And every half-birthday.

81
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,922

now think is an actual thing.

120
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,457

capacity's at 80%, ICU is okay.

121
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,338
Morale is pretty low

122
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,723
It's hit everyone
pretty hard.

123
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:26,399

DeLuca's autopsy results

124
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,087

125
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,340
You asked for his results?
Why?

126
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,037
Andrew DeLuca
was one of our own.

127
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,814
Obviously,
something went wrong.

128
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,084
I want to know what that was.

129
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,774
That's all.

130
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:48,314
Bailey, I already told you
every step of what happened.

131
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:49,962
Well after I could have done

132
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:52,680
something to change the outcome.

133
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,160

144
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,341
Byron Gibbis, 52, found
passed out on his front porch.

145
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,778
He's febrile, tachycardic.
I also heard a big murmur.

146
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,216
Rapid COVID was negative,

147
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:24,474
no signs of head trauma,
but I did order a pan scan.

148
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,848
Let's add a cardiac CT.

149
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,614
Um, do you work here?

152
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,059
He's got Osler's nodes.

153
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,289
Oh, my God.
My God.

154
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:40,670
Byron, I'm Dr. Maggie Pierce.
You're at Grey-Sloan Memorial.

155
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,061
You were found unconscious,
and an ambulance...

156
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,044
- Get away from me!
- Okay...

157
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,506
No, I'm serious.
Everybody back up, okay?

158
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,162
I'm not getting COVID.
Where are my clothes?

159
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,386
- Sir, please just...
- Everybody here is sick.

160
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,606
Oh, God.

161
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,880
Okay, Byron,
I know that this is a shock

162
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,208
and I know
that you're scared,

163
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,615
but if we don't get
a look at your heart,

164
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,966
you may not make it home.

165
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:57,372
We have all been tested.

166
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,536
If you need a mask
or if you need a face shield,

167
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,764
we can get you
whatever you need.

168
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:02,748
But, please, just stay.

169
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,434
I was so good.

170
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,795
I didn't go anywhere.

171
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,441
Let's get you ready
for CT.

172
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:14,286
One minute I'm sad,
'cause I think about his sister

173
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:17,328
and his family
and what a great guy he was.

174
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,809
Next minute,
I'm filled with guilt.

175
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,158
Then I'm filled with rage.

176
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,801
That a person could

177
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,949
Do that
to another human being.

178
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,403
I'm scared. Hopeless.
Sometimes numb.

179
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,075
I can always go back
to guilt.

180
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,041
Guilt is my go-to.

181
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,044
My go-to is numb.

182
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,816
Wow.

183
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,692
Did you just describe
exactly what was wrong

184
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,685
with our relationship
in only five words?

185
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,419
I think maybe
I just did.

186
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:53,152
I just...
DeLuca. I...

187
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,017
I-I just can't
get my head around it.

188
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,504
What is this?

189
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,729
Looks like whiskey.

190
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,879
Mm, what was it doing

191
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,169
on the top shelf behind
the fancy candlesticks?

192
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,786
What were you doing
on the top shelf

193
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,910
behind the fancy
candlesticks?

194
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:19,173
Are you drunk?

195
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,488
It's 9:00 in the morning.

196
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,132
Plenty of people get drunk
at 9:00 in the morning.

197
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,840
Yeah, well, not me,
Amelia.

198
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,006
I live at home
with four kids.

199
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,531
Sometimes late at night...

200
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,663
...I have a drink in the garage
and I play my guitar.

201
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:32,925
We're in a pandemic.

202
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,667
You drink in the garage?
Do you hear yourself?

203
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,177
Do youhear yourself?

204
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,583
Hiding alcohol
is an objectively bad sign.

205
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,586
Or it's a sign that I'm trying
to be respectful of you.

206
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,414
If you have a problem,
you can talk to me.

207
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,851
I'm, like, literally
the best person in the world

208
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:48,074
- you could talk to.
- Do you know stressed out I am?

209
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,107
All the time?

210
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,037
And now on top of everything,
if it wasn't hard enough,

211
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,163
now I have to make sure that
I don't accidentally mention

212
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,145
that their friend Andrew
was stabbed to death

213
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,895
by somebody
who sells children for sex.

214
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,958
Okay, that is all of us.
That is not just you.

215
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:01,345
And not all of us
have to drink to cope.

216
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,317
You don't have to,
or you don't get to?

217
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:06,012
Because I get to.
Because I'm not an alcoholic.

218
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,373
I'm not in recovery and...

219
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,262
Y'know what?

220
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:12,293
I can't be here right now.

221
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,270
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

222
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,256
Because I don't want to say
something that I might regret.

223
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,580
Because I love you
and because I'm a good guy.

224
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,996
But sometimes, Amelia,
you drive me insane.

225
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,428
And... And this is
one of those times.

226
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,309
So, yes, I'm leaving.

227
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:27,763
And I'm taking this
with me.

228
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,723
Oh, and, uh,
just so we're clear...

229
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:33,578
I'm coming back.

230
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:35,292
Because
I'm not a bad guy!

231
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,692
No pressure, Grey, but we really
need you to pull through this.

232
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,441
This place
can't stand another loss.

233
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:48,582
Are we ready?

234
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,544
I'm gonna lighten
her sedation...

235
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,311
...and then gradually
turn down all of her settings.

236
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,122
And if she tolerates it,
then we'll move forward

237
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,786
with spontaneous
breathing trials.

238
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,631
Dr. Altman, I'm more
than able to handle this

239
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:01,884
with the
respiratory therapist.

240
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,277
Maybe you should
get some rest.

241
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,192
I know how closely
you worked with Dr. DeLuca.

242
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:08,192
Which has nothing to do with
getting Meredith off the vent.

243
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,146
Come on, Grey.

244
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:22,411
Come on, Grey,
you can do this.

245
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,419
You look just like Ellis
just now,

246
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:27,686
the way you're looking
at your feet.

247
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,817
So serious.

248
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,826
Then she gets that
worried little brow.

249
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,439
This is torture!

250
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,145
You're right here,
and I can't...

251
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,364
It's torture!

252
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,227
It's a torture
of your own devising.

253
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,170
You were always good at that.

254
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,491
Good at what?

255
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,973
Torturing yourself.

256
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,552
I don't do that
as much anymore.

257
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,786
You never got to meet Ellis.

258
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,247
We didn't even know.

259
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:58,160
I wish
you got to know her.

260
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:00,238
She looks just like you.

261
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,466
She breaks the rules
just like you.

262
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,904
And she's quick to anger.
And quick to laugh.

263
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:11,387
And she's smart and pensive
and stubborn, just like you.

264
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,950
Hates pink and purple,
loves brown and green,

265
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,044
and... and gets enraged
at the thought

266
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,129
of anybody wanting to
cut down a tree.

267
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,521
Is... Is this thing clean?

268
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,927
People say you can't get sick
from surfaces, but you can.

269
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,513
We thoroughly disinfect
the entire room

270
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:35,645
in between patients.

271
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,060
- Sir?
- Just... I need a minute, okay?

272
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,122
Can I leave my face shield on,
please?

273
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,809
- Sure.
- Oh, God.

274
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,966
If you'd like,
I can stay with you.

275
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,395
- I can hold your foot or...
- No, no, no, no. I don't want

276
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,614
anybody touching me.
Nobody touches me, okay?

277
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,731
Osler's nodes,
so... endocarditis.

278
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:54,074
Yes, but what is
the underlying cause?

279
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:55,802
He denies
intravenous drug use,

280
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:58,403
there's no indwelling catheter,
no diabetes...

281
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,020
He said he hasn't left his house
since lockdown, right?

282
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,231
May I?

283
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,004
- Hey, Byron.
- Yeah?

284
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,435
Have you had any trouble
with your teeth lately?

285
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,544
I had a... a popcorn kernel
stuck in my teeth,

286
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,732
and I picked it out
with a paperclip

287
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,560
and... and now my gums
are a little sore,

288
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:15,920
but I-I'm not going
to the dentist.

289
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,873
I'm not gonna lay there with
my mouth open for 20 minutes

290
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:19,170
inhaling somebody's
spit droplets.

291
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:20,770
- No way.
- Bingo.

292
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:24,340
Dental infection, which led
to bacterial endocarditis.

293
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,691
Aortic valve abscess almost
completely blocking the valves.

294
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:31,215
Helm, order some antibiotics
and book an OR.

295
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:34,586
I thought of it.

296
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,013
You just said it first.

297
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,111
Oh, yeah, I believe you.

298
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:39,850
100%.

299
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,468
Were you looking
for me, dear?

300
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:48,156
Yeah, I was.
Yeah.

301
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,216
You know, I built my life,

302
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,215
my sanity,

303
00:12:57,332 --> 00:12:59,828
my sobriety...

304
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,332
around the surrender
to a higher power.

305
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,878
I mean, for me,

306
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:08,882
it's the belief
that there's some purpose.

307
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:14,017
That there's
a... a bigger plan.

308
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:17,785
Something that if
I got all the way above it

309
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:20,121
and could look down on it

310
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:21,764
like, um...

311
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,513
- like a jigsaw puzzle, okay?
- Mm.

312
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,335
That somehow it would...
it would make sense.

313
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:29,990
My faith is rooted
in the trust

314
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:34,342
that there's a... a meaning
and a wisdom

315
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:38,912
that I'm just not elevated
enough to see or understand.

316
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,809
A faith that
whoever made this puzzle,

317
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,176
it makes sense to Him.

318
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,512
- And it's beautiful.
- Mm.

319
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,927
Today,
I'm... I'm struggling.

320
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,972
I'm struggling
with my faith.

321
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,754
I'm struggling
to trust anything.

322
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:07,090
And I just cannot
see any wisdom in this.

323
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,637
I live
with stage 4 cancer.

324
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:18,038
A cancer
very few people survive.

325
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,138
I just got the results
from my latest scan,

326
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:24,043
and... nothing has grown.

327
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,395
It makes no sense.

328
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,974
Everywhere we look,

329
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,356
someone is dying
that was healthy yesterday.

330
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,316
It makes no sense.

331
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,855
"Puzzle"
is the right word.

332
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,674
You can look for the pain,
the lost, the unbearable.

333
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:49,988
Or you can look
for the beauty, the grace...

334
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,463
the miracle.

335
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:55,738
And nothing grew?

336
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,904
Nothing grew.

337
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,521
Okay, so, I know
that people buy and trade

338
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,598
and get rich
and then just lose everything.

339
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:12,488
But what exactly
is the stock market?

340
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,958
It's a good thing you already
know how to live out of a car.

341
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,653
Why? Well, questions like that

342
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:18,154
make me think you're
gonna end up back in one.

343
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,539
Uh...
who is it?

344
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,628
It's Jackson Avery!

345
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,282
I'm here for a quick bang.

346
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,761
I...
Jo!

347
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,015
I...

348
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,600
Shut up.

349
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:39,946
Bad time?

350
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,565
Oh, crap.

351
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,474
Hey. Really bad time.

352
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,741
Um, I brought whiskey.

353
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,459
Oh, we're day drinking.
Ah!

354
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,578
Sorry, dude.
I didn't realize, uh...

355
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,917
No, no, it's cool.

356
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,577
Guess you're aware of our...
situation, then.

357
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,553
Yep. Sweet deal.

358
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:02,533
Here.

359
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:03,926
Oh, no,
I'm on, uh, call.

360
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,420
Oh! Dibs.

361
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,936
Okay. Cheers.

362
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:10,498
Happy...

363
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:12,185
all-our-friends-are-dying
day.

364
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,795
I told him we'd move as fast
as was safely possible.

365
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:26,046
His echo showed
his ejection fraction at 64%,

366
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,779
so hopefully his heart is strong
enough to have a good outcome.

367
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,866
Who cleans his teeth
with a paperclip?

368
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,717
Isolation makes people
do crazy things.

369
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,428
We're not meant
to be alone.

370
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,600
People physically
need people.

371
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,272
Oh, no, no! Don't...
Don't... Don't touch me!

372
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,873
Just back away!
Please, everybody, back away.

373
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,031
- Dr. Pierce!
- I'm sorry. I can't be here!

374
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,656
- I can't do this. I can't! Get away from me!
- Dr. Pierce. Dr. Pierce.

375
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,656
- Dr. Pierce! A little help?
<i>- I can't be here! I can't be here!</i>

376
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,558
- Oh, God.
- I can't! I can't be here.

377
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:58,732
I can't.
I need to get out of here!

378
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,716
Okay, call security.
I'm gonna go to the elevator.

379
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,352
- You go to the OR board.
- I don't know where that is.

380
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,225
- It's...
- Did anyone lose a naked man?

381
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,677
Because he went that way.

382
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,928
Oh.

383
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,271
Byron?

384
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,857
Hey, Byron.

385
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,321
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

386
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,068
I can't do this.
I can't be here.

387
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,553
I...

388
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:36,121
Oh, my God, my masks.
I'm not wearing my masks.

389
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:38,075
Honey, you're not wearing
anything.

390
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:46,927
My best friend, Rory,
he was healthy as a horse.

391
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:49,436
Never worked a day job
his entire life,

392
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:50,538
he didn't smoke,
he didn't drink,

393
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:51,837
he... he ran triathlons.

394
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,471
He got the virus,
he was dead in a week. A week!

395
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:56,388
Wife and kids didn't
get to say goodbye to him.

396
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:57,737
Do you know
how many people

397
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,513
they're projecting die
from this?

398
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,018
- Hundreds of thousands.
- I know.

399
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,560
And if you
want to walk out of here,

400
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:06,021
I'm not gonna stop you.

401
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,670
Wait, what?

402
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,199
But I will follow you.

403
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,244
Because your heart's
only gonna get worse,

404
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:12,936
and I owe it to you,

405
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,769
I owe it to my oath,

406
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,419
I owe it...

407
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,646
I lost someone, too,
Byron.

408
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:23,739
Not COVID.

409
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:27,042
But I know that pain,

410
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:31,961
and I know how unfair it is
and how enraging it is.

411
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,474
But I think...

412
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,618
I think we owe it
to the people we lost

413
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,578
to live the lives
that they can't.

414
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,669
Even when it seems hard,
and even when we're afraid.

415
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:48,064
Byron, you have a problem
that we can fix.

416
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,413
We can fix this.

417
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:50,849
But you have to let us.

418
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,677
I don't want to die.

419
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:53,895
I don't want to die.

420
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,028
I don't want you to die,
either.

421
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:09,692
Okay.

422
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,348
Okay.

423
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:14,220
Let's get you
a gown first.

424
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,286
She didn't even know
that she was pregnant.

425
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:18,636
And then
we saved her baby.

426
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,334
And then...

427
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,728
she died.

428
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:23,905
It's like,
during a pandemic,

429
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,866
shouldn't all the other
tragic crap take a break?

430
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,429
You're seriously
gonna quit surgery?

431
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,021
I need some good things
in my life.

432
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,302
And babies are good.

433
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,326
You realize OB
is all about moms, yeah?

434
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,068
Yeah, who are happy
because they're having babies.

435
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:38,288
Not having my own
any time soon...

436
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:39,332
Fingers crossed.

437
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,927
...or maybe ever,

438
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,843
so I might as well hang out
with some others.

439
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,801
I got like 15 of them
at home.

440
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:47,170
- Hang out with those.
- It's so unfair!

441
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,647
You and Amelia
didn't even want a baby,

442
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,889
and then you got one
and neither of you died.

443
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,950
Oh, poor you.

444
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:57,139
You're young and single
and dating a plastic surgeon.

445
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:58,687
No, we're not...
not dating. It's just sex.

446
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,576
- And you can still work.
- Oh.

447
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,877
Last time
my life sucked this bad,

448
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:05,271
I quit medicine
and moved to Venice Beach.

449
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:06,959
Ah, yes.
The bike shop, right?

450
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,318
Heaven.

451
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,102
Jackson wants to
run away to the woods.

452
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,271
Oh, nice.
Can I come?

453
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,577
No, that would defeat
the purpose.

454
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:14,411
What is
the purpose?

455
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,500
- You kidding? Escape. Outta here.
- Mm.

456
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:19,092
Escape from pain and rage
and responsibility.

457
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,460
Escape from humanity.

458
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:22,068
I mean,
trees don't murder people.

459
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,507
- Trees are not racist.
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,378
Trees do not
politicize a disease

461
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:26,466
and convince
millions of people

462
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,811
not to protect themselves
and others

463
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,166
by using a simple piece of damn
fabric on their faces, so...

464
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,927
Trees don't even
have faces.

465
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,498
You know what?
Maybe you can come.

466
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,389
Ohh!

467
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,653
<i>♪ Oh</i>

468
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,436
Uh, primary repair
of the stomach...

469
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,163
...diaphragm, splenectomy,

470
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,537
and repair
of ventricular injury...

471
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,224
all intact.

472
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,536
Ultimately died
from coagulopathy.

473
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,930
- Like I told you.
- Well, now we have it in writing.

474
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,529
Which will make
the M&M go smoothly.

475
00:20:58,614 --> 00:20:59,804
The M&M?

476
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:01,941
Bailey, what in the hell
are you trying to prove?

477
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,724
It's Andrew DeLuca.

478
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,255
He gave five years of his life
to this hospital.

479
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:07,903
We own him due diligence.

480
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,558
What about what you owe to your
doctors that are still here?

481
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,458
The ones who've sacrificed
their lives to fight a pandemic,

482
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,385
who hardly sleep or eat
or even shower,

483
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,431
who see their families
on screens...

484
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:21,756
Their faces are full of bruises
because of the damn PPE,

485
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:24,115
and now you want them
to sit in front of a computer

486
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,896
and be grilled
on whether they messed up

487
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,701
trying to save
one of their own?

488
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,486
Let them grieve,
for God's sake!

489
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,536
You are causing me harm.

490
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:44,185
You are causing harm
to Hunt and Altman.

491
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:48,548
DeLuca was a victim
of a horrible crime,

492
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,778
and he lost
too much blood.

493
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:54,685
No mistakes were made,
no stitch was missed.

494
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,623
And the mere suggestion
that any of us

495
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,903
didn't do everything possible
to save his life...

496
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:04,764
...it's a pain
I wouldn't put on anyone.

497
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,646
I want you closer.

498
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:22,364
Could you please
just come here?

499
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:26,904
Do you remember when
you were trying to teach Zola

500
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:28,284
how to ride a bike?

501
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,329
She got so frustrated
because she couldn't,

502
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,286
and she threw it down,
and she goes, "Mama, you do it."

503
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,161
And you couldn't stop laughing,
and she got so mad.

504
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,311
Well, I was trying
not to laugh.

505
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:40,513
So am I.

506
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,864
I can't do it for you.

507
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,450
It's your beach.

508
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,442
Zola's amazing,
isn't she?

509
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:51,727
I mean,
she's just so brilliant.

510
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,420
She writes me letters
in her journal.

511
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,982
Did you know that?

512
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:03,039
Well, what is that?
What is that face?

513
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:05,129
Would you start a surgery
with a face like that?

514
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:06,530
No!

515
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:07,821
No.

516
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:09,188
You would relax.

517
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:34,078
It hasn't been that long.

518
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,221
Maybe we could decrease
sedation a bit further,

519
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:37,657
at least run another ABG.

520
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:39,275
And hope she doesn't go
into cardiac arrest

521
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,357
while we wait
for the results?

522
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,184
I'm turning the settings
back up.

523
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,891
Grey's staying
on the vent.

524
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,273
How's the book report
coming?

525
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,238
That was
one of my favorites.

526
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,071
That's what grownups say
to convince you

527
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,314
to finish your homework.

528
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,813
You got me there.

529
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:11,463
I'm supposed to write a whole
page about living forever.

530
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,689
Mom says it's impossible.
So what's the point?

531
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:17,313
Your mom is pretty smart.

532
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:22,743
If I made a medicine
where you could live forever,

533
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,997
would you take it?

534
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,434
I don't know.

535
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:26,870
Uncle Link said,
"Heck yeah."

536
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:28,734
That sounds like him.

537
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,482
Me, I don't know.

538
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:35,852
I think the fact
that we can't live forever

539
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,274
is one of the things
that makes life so special.

540
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:40,993
Impermanence.

541
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:42,668
I think if we could
live forever,

542
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,193
we'd spend so much time
losing the people that we love

543
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,238
instead of holding tight
while we still can.

544
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,109
Impermanence.

545
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,763
I like that word.

546
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,474
Me too.

547
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,783
If I had the medicine,
I'd give it to my mom right now.

548
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:58,103
Me too.

549
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,557
Hey,
you want to call her?

550
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,328
Alright.

551
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:11,493
Hello there.

552
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:12,676
<i>Can we have a minute?</i>

553
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,828
Of course.

554
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:18,995
Hi, Mommy.
I miss you so much.

555
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,234
I love you.

556
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,578
Um, I've been writing
a page about living forever.

557
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:27,383
How are you doing?

558
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,888
It didn't work?

559
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,516
Altman wants to try again
in a day or so.

560
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,614
When I lost my wife,
um...

561
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:42,250
...the therapist,
she said that

562
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,862
there's no wrong way
to process the loss,

563
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,794
the grief.

564
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,359
But there is.

565
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,281
Over a bloody computer screen,
it's...

566
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,445
...it's wrong.

567
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,268
<i>Dr. Lyon,
call the blood bank.</i>

568
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,879
Dr. Lyon,
call the blood bank.

569
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,781
Ohh!
Oh!

570
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:10,234
You know the rules.
Who deserves it?

571
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,531
Deserves what?
Rules to what?

572
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:13,843
"Make it Sadder."
We tell our sob stories,

573
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:17,587
and whosever story is saddest
wins the last shot.

574
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,633
"Make it Sadder"?
That's fun?

575
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:20,767
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

576
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:22,333
Okay. Alright.
I'll be the judge.

577
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,378
I'll be the judge.
Alright, go.Okay.

578
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:24,770
Alright.

579
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:28,208
I am currently raising
four children

580
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,602
in a hellscape of a world

581
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:32,474
where people
don't listen to science.

582
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,303
My parents are going ahead
with their second wedding

583
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,782
even though
there's a pandemic,

584
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,436
so they'll probably
get sick and die.

585
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,831
And, uh, my last shred
of me-time...

586
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,321
sneaking an occasional drink,

587
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:44,931
which was already
pretty pathetic,

588
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:48,272
I know... is now ruined.

589
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,535
- Strong. Yeah.
- Mm, alright.

590
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:56,106
I had plans the weekend
that everything shut down.

591
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,625
I had crawled out
of my depression,

592
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,500
and I was all set
to start over by...

593
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:03,649
going...

594
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:08,063
...going on dates.

595
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,292
- Oh, yeah.
- Aww!

596
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,164
Okay, yes, yes.

597
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,732
You guys,
I even bought outfits, okay?

598
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:17,320
Hang on. Okay.
Ah! Okay.Alright.

599
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,129
Let me show you.

600
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,262
What do we have?
Oh, this is cute, right?

601
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:26,179
The perfect thing
to declare someone dead in.

602
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:27,454
Oh, what about this?

603
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,313
This, for the, um,
career girl

604
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,794
that just spent, um,
seven hours

605
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:34,405
making more room for bodies
on the morgue truck.

606
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,581
Or...
Or...

607
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:38,250
How about this?

608
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,517
This, for... for
the funeral of a co-worker

609
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:44,680
who got stabbed to death...

610
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:49,801
who doesn't even
get a funeral.

611
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:56,703
Okay,
Jo wins the last shot.

612
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:00,344
No, no!

613
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,563
Yes. No way. Unh-unh.

614
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,892
- Unh-unh.
- Thank you so much.

615
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:06,524
She has an entire loft
all to herself!

616
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:07,743
Mnh-mnh.

617
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:10,049
- Hold on.
- Ahh!

618
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:12,356
What's that?

619
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:13,521
It's Richard.

620
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,524
The memorial for DeLuca
is tonight.

621
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:19,624
Alright, I'll drive.

622
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:22,570

623
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,934
<i>Orderly to 6 East.</i>

624
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:47,399
Hey. Uh, just moved
Mr. Cabrera up here.

625
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:48,625
Another complete white-out.

626
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,078
- How's Meredith?
- Um, uh...

627
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:52,918
It... It didn't work.

628
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:55,530
And I'm questioning
why I even thought it would.

629
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,576
Well, DeLuca's autopsy results
came back.

630
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,391
We did everything
that we could.

631
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:02,089
I know that.

632
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,149
And he's still dead.

633
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,118
Your kids call every day

634
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,125

635
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,697

647

They need you, Grey.

648
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:52,804
The little one...

649
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,198
- Ellis.
- She looks just like you.

650
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:57,188
She got
all your expressions.

651
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,899
She doesn't smile
easy or often,

652
00:29:59,025 --> 00:30:02,074
but when she does, sweet Jesus,
it lights up the room.

653
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,120
What did you do
to make her smile?

654
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,462
You shoulda seen it...

655
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:06,731
she smiles and she smiles,

656
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:09,168
and it gets bigger
and bigger until...

657
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:11,519
Boom!
She just bursts out laughing.

658
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,043
What did you do
to make her laugh?

659
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,045
Then her brother gets annoyed
because she's laughing so hard

660
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,176
right in his ear.

661
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,221
That's Bailey.

662
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:19,614
And then the oldest one
comes in,

663
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:22,181
and she takes the tablet
and says they're hogging it

664
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,661
and that she needs
time with you, too,

665
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:27,186
because she's the oldest
and she's your favorite.

666
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,232
Zola.

667
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:32,714
Then I hear a click and a lock,
but we're in darkness.

668
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,543
Can't tell who has it,
'cause I can't see a face.

669
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:39,111
But then I hear a voice,
and it's the oldest one.

670
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:41,461
And she's
sittin' in the dark.

671
00:30:41,545 --> 00:30:43,376
She's in her closet.

672
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,988
That's where she goes
to write letters to her dad.

673
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:49,165
And she says,
"I'm really sorry, Mum.

674
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,036
Didn't mean for things
to get so violent.

675
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,996

truly infuriating."

Dr. Webber
set something up for DeLuca.

702
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:26,130
A memorial.

703
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,934
I'm not a great Jew.

704
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:40,918
I cheated
at my bar mitzvah.

705
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,701
I was too busy trying
to ignore Lenny Rapkin's shins

706
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:47,435
that I didn't learn Hebrew,

707
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,481
so I just wrote it out
phonetically and read that instead.

708
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:54,311
I skip half the High Holy Days
and repent for it at Yom Kippur.

709
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:56,481
And if I'm honest, I...

710
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,925
go back and forth
about believing in God,

711
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,971
which is actually very Jewish,
but...

712
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:04,862
It's the traditions
that I find helpful.

713
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:09,559
When a loved one dies,
we have...

714
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:13,259
rules about how to grieve
and move on.

715
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:14,867
Protocols.

716
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:19,754
We force ourselves
to sit in the pain.

717
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,864
We cry.

718
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,341
And we laugh.

719
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:27,040
And we eat a lot.

720
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,809
And it doesn't bring
the person back,

721
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,059
but it does
start the healing.

722
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:39,268
Chief, your mom died.

723
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,601
My mom makes me crazy,

724
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:47,599
but I'm gonna fall apart
when she dies.

725
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,200
And you have people
you can be with.

726
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:57,551

and need to grieve with you.

727
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:01,481

735
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,320

737
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,356
I thought bad things
about him.

738
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:42,114
When he was sick, I thought,
"Great, more surgeries for me."

739
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:44,247
I had no compassion.

740
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,934

Uh, my name is Andrew DeLuca,
and I'm thrilled to be

802
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,921
applying to the surgical
residency program

803
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,402
at Grey-Sloan
Memorial Hospital.

804
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:47,696
A bit about me.

805
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:50,178
I am Italian,
but I grew up in Wisconsin.

806
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,066
A lot of doctors
in my family,

807
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,719
including my big sister,
Carina.

808
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:56,201
Um, I grew up stealing
her game of Operation,

809
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,631
so I guess you can say
it's, uh, been a dream of mine

810
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,438
for a very long time.

811
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:03,274
The idea of doing my training
at Grey-Sloan

812
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,617
and... and learning
from surgical legends

813
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:07,944
like Richard Webber
and Miranda Bailey

814
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,514
and Jackson Avery
and Meredith Grey...

815
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:14,691
uh, well, it just doesn't
get any better than that.

816
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:16,867
I think the reason I want to
become a surgeon

817
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,956
is that
I've always had

818
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,307
this insatiable desire
to help people.

819
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:25,311
And I think I get that from
my mom, who I lost too soon.

820
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:27,095
And, uh, she had
this really giving heart,

821
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:29,706
and she always pushed me
to do as much good as possible,

822
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,071
so I guess
I'm doing this for her.

823
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:34,871
Now, you should be warned,

824
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,006
I can be relentless at times,
and very stubborn.

825
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:42,403
