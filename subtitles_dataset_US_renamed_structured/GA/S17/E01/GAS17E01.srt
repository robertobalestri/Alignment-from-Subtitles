be allowed to be in there.

Now, I know that can't be good,

627
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,066
You went through the whole stack
of safety precautions?

00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,167
I-I-I... What was I say...

629
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:11,937
You committed all
of those protocols to memory?

Look, this is no longer

on being here,

then you are going to need
to know how we operate now.

to read the safety protocol,
