98
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,886
Well, the protein deposits
have brought on

99
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,193
congestive heart failure,
which is what's causing

100
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,282
the build-up of fluid
in your legs and lungs.

101
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,936
And it's causing your blood
to form clots,

102
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,200
so we need to insert a filter

103
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:55,593
to keep any from going
into your lungs.

104
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:57,073

a piece of her skull

126
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,441

But if we do,
it will be temporary.

130
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,666
We will implant the bone
fragment in her abdomen,

131
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,060
and then we will replant it
after the swelling goes down.

132

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,030
so why don't you
go in, okay?

176
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:37,424
Aww!

177
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,077
Ah.

178
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,688
Oh, okay, okay. Whew!

179
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,385
Wait. What do you need?

180
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,759
A time machine.
And set it back three months.

181
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,304
Talk.

182
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:50,437
What about?
Anything.

183
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,917
O-kay. Okay.

184
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,398
Um, still no replacement
for Jackson.

185
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,313
Um...

186
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:00,751
Oh, Joey got an "A"
in AP biology.

187
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:03,014
Hmm! Think he's
gonna be a doctor.

188
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:06,844
Um, Ben's tumor needs
no further treatment.

189
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,019
My dad...

190
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,673
Wait. What tumor?

191
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,720
Yeah, so, we found a lump,
and he had an orchiectomy.

192
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:15,375
Path came back cancerous,
but we got it in time,

193
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,289
so he's all clear.

194
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,162
No mets, no chemo.

195
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,817
And I've been so stressed out
about losing my husband

196
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,689
that I haven't been able
to think or talk about it,

197
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,474
which is why you're just
hearing about it now.

198
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,476
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,564
I had no idea.

200
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:31,826
Thanks.

201
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,393
And if I don't want
to talk about that

202
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,872
and you don't want
to talk about you,

203
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,352
then we better get another kid
out here or something.

204
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:37,682
Zola!

205
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,904
Hey, Gwen.
How you feelin'?

206
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:49,017
What's going on?

207
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,106
I got your page, Helm.
What's up?

208
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,890
I made her do it.

209
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:55,787
Wanted to... meet the man
you were marrying.

210
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,897
Winston Ndugu.
It's a pleasure.

211
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,596
Gwendolyn.
Now, tell me.

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,752
Do you have a single,
much older brother?

213
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,079
I'm afraid not, no.

214
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:09,536
I love weddings.

215
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:11,648
Is there a date?

216
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:12,954
We're working on it.

217
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,260
You are going to be
such a beautiful bride.

218
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,175
Promise you'll show me
pictures.

219
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,047
You know,
if I last that long.

220
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:20,942
Of course.
And thank you.

221
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:25,599
Helm, don't page anyone
unless it's about work.

222
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,540
No fever, no chills.
Nausea?

223
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:35,759
Not beyond my normal,
base-level nausea.

224
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,611
So I'll go with no?

225
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,591
Okay. That's it.

226
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:43,680
Maybe have some matzo ball soup
before our next check-in.

227
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,552
Does that make the vaccine
more effective?

228
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,249
Well, last time, you said
it helped settle your stomach.

229
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,470
I did? God.
I... I talk so much.

230
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:51,872
I remember
what interests me.

231
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,213
Um, I don't know
why I was so nervous.

232
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:58,173
This is nothin'.

233
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,175
Uh, but if you're
looking for recs,

234
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,351
Marty's Deli stuffs theirs
with chicken.

235
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,420
Oh, I didn't mean soup.

236
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,617
Oh.

237
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,165
See you next week.

238
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:22,676
Hey. Hey.
How you feeling?

239
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,112
Um... great.

240
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:27,115
Uh, or, uh, fine.
I'm okay.

241
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,769
Any side effects
from the vaccine or...?

242
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,858
Oh.

243
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,295
Nope.
All good there.

244
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,734
But I should, um, get back
to my patients, so...

245
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,519
Bye.

246
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:40,824
Hey, uh...

247
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,348
Did we break up or...?

248
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:46,134
When would we
have broken up?

249
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:48,136
Levi. Come on.
You said you wanted me

250
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,616
to make space for you,
and I did,

251
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,184
and you just walked away,
been avoiding me ever since.

252
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:54,446
I have not been...

253
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,368
But do you want to see
other people or...?

254
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,104
I don't know.

255
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,411
Well, I don't.

256
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,261
Okay? I want you, Levi,
and only you.

257
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,158
So when you
figure this all out,

258
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,963
you know where
to find me, okay?

259
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:14,945
Some good news...

260
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,468
Luna's results show
it is only reflux,

261
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,035
and it is mild.

262
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,429
So we'll continue to monitor
her, feed her upright.

263
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,431
Smaller volumes,
more frequently.

264
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,954
Try thickened formulas.
See how she does.

265
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,216
Do you need to
answer that?

266
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,349
Yeah. Sorry.
Either one of you two

267
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,264
interested in a 9-month-old
from county?

268
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,961
Kidding.

269
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,181
Poor thing's foster placement
fell through, so I have to go.

270
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:34,878
Anything I need to sign?

271
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,751
The nurses have
the latest paperwork.Thanks.

272
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,231
I can't tell you how nice it is
I don't have to think about Luna

273
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,059
because of you two.

274
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:43,844
You're her guardian.

275
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,672
You could think about her
a little.

276
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:48,565
Well, she's a social worker,
not a parent.

277
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,357
Hey.

278
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,381
She's still not awake? - Nothing.

279
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,209
It's been two days
since we closed her skull.

280
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,472
Her intracranial
pressure's down.

281
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,649
Scans don't show
anoxic brain injury. Nothing.

282
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,259
If she doesn't wake up
in a few days,

283
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:10,871
we're gonna have to
consider a trach.

284
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,264
And I'm gonna
have to call her dad.

285
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:16,248
No, you don't have to call him.
He's right outside.

286
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,977
Mr. Nichols?

287
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:31,282
Hey.

288
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,175
- Hey.
- Mind if we...?

289
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,070
Did, uh...
Did Sky wake up?

290
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,333
Uh...

291
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,596
Her status
hasn't changed.

292
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,860
We may need to perform something
called a trach and PEG.

293
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,906
That'll give her
long-term airway control

294
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,342
and keep her
getting nutrients.

295
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,704
So you don't think she'll
wake up for... for a while?

296
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,696
You know, when Sky was a kid,
I... I worked all the time.

297
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,393
Long hours, lot of travel.

298
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:57,221
I was just climbing that
career ladder, you know?

299
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:59,853
And I missed a lot.

300
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:04,576
That's a hard balance...
Work and family life.

301
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,318
This one time, I was
rushing back for the last night

302
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,364
of this high-school talent show
she was in.

303
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,366
And, uh, I remember
at the cast party,

304
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,107
one of her friends
came up and said to her,

305
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,761
"Who's that guy?"

306
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,719
You know,
that kind of haunted me.

307
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,482
And I thought, "Geez.
I just missed too much."

308
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:23,508
But then COVID comes along, and
Skyler moves back in with me,

309
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,641
and I think, "Alright.
This is good.

310
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:29,843
You know, I... I get a chance
to get to know my daughter."

311
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:38,109
I'll consent to that, uh...
That trach.

312
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:43,074
You just make sure
she's not in any pain, okay?

313
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,325
Late night?

314
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,892
3:00 a.m. call.

315
00:13:58,976 --> 00:13:59,893
Oh.

316
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,459
Dude snapped
both his tendons

317
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,723
when he slipped down
his basement stairs.

318
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:07,291
Pretty crazy to think we're all
basically just walking around

319
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,882
on a pair of matchsticks.

320
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:11,774
Ugh!

321
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:12,906
Everything okay?

322
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,908
More paperwork for Luna.

323
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,737
Her social worker
is just a lot.

324
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,390
And before you say it,

325
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:22,785
I know she has a thankless job,
but Luna deserves more.

326
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:26,223
She's not just an item
on a checklist.

327
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,835
Okay.
So what's the holdup?

328
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,793
Oh, sorry.
Are we pretending

329
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,055
like you're not
gonna adopt her?

330
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,276
Okay.
It's crossed my mind.

331
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,974
Which is just crazy

332
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:42,370
because I never pictured myself
doing this alone.

333
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,154
Maybe it's the pandemic

334
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:47,418
or the fact that I felt really
connected to Luna's mom.

335
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,855
Or...?

336
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,727
Or maybe
it's that Luna is just...

337
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:54,077
She is so perfect,

338
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,906
and I completely
freakin' love her.

339
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,214
Ahh. It's a pretty great
feeling, huh?

340
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:01,563
What?

341
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:02,845
Having a kid.

342
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,200
I think you can stop asking
yourself if you can do it, Jo.

343
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:12,293
I think you already are.

344
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,624
Okay.
So, hear me out.

345
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,019
Uh, so, New Zealand has COVID
pretty much wiped out.

346
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,021
So, we rent
a giant house and...

347
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,111
And ask your grandma to wear
a mask for 20 hours on planes

348
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,810
and then quarantine
when we get there?

349
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:34,878
Okay, so it's not quite perfect
yet, but we're getting there.

350
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:37,904
Alright. Look.

351
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:40,123
I hate that the pandemic
has our hands tied right now,

352
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,038
but we are two
very smart people.

353
00:15:42,122 --> 00:15:46,521
And we both love puzzles.
So we'll get it figured out.

354
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,784
Or maybe we should
just wait, you know,

355
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,831
until things just open up
a little bit more.

356
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,113
Wait, what, like a year?

357
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,705
Is this cold feet? Because
I thought you were all-in.

358
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,274
No, I was. I-I am.

359
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,537
You know, I just want it
to feel right

360
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,844
and not like
it's some big compromise.

361
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:06,758
"Big compromise."

362
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,349
That sounded bad.
I...

363
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,460
<i>Chaplain to Patient
Services. Chaplain to Patient Services.</i>

364
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,201
Oh, my God. I have to go.

365
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:16,270
We have a heart donor
for Gwen!

366
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,820
Hey. Thought
you were off today.

367
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,431
Skyler's EEG kept showing her
brain activity slowing down.

368
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:29,172
Damn. I was really hoping
she'd come through.

369
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,608
Well, she still might.

370
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,696
I'm starting serial MRIs

371
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,524
to see if I can detect
any patterns.

372
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,657
And I might even add ultrasonic
thalamic stimulation.

373
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm not sure.

374
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,228
Amelia, some patients
just don't wake up.

375
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:42,620
She's someone's baby, Owen,

376
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:45,209
and I'm a mom now,
so I can't give up.

377
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,674
How you feeling today?

378
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,806
I don't want to say.

379
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,330
I'm a flirt, and I'm sorry.

380
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,985
But I'm a big boy.
We can move on.

381
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,987
It's not that.

382
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,946
I noticed...

383
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,210
a rash on the back
of my neck.

384
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,038
And you're gonna need
to take a look at it.

385
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:12,128
But that just feels

386
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,262
a little... intimate.

387
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,960
Look, if you don't want me to
look at it, that's up to you.

388
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,897
But there aremillions of lives
at stake.

389
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,843
Metz.
Suction.

390
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,367
I can't believe
this happened.

391
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,717
I still just...
I can't believe it.

392
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,067
Gwen is very lucky.

393
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,373
I love her.

394
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,853
She's like a mom,
you know?

395
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,551
But only the good parts.

396
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:46,293
Like, she's smart
and she gives great advice

397
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,034
but never tells you
your lipstick color

398
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:50,123
makes your skin
look green.

399
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:53,300
Specimen coming.

400
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:54,890
Ready for the donor heart.

401
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:06,356
Oh, my God.

402
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,118
Oh, God.
I know.

403
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,796
Your place is so quiet.

404
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,669
I can hear myself think.

405
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:17,977
Yeah?

406
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,196
What are you
thinking about?

407
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,200
Hmm. Neurons
and functional MRIs.

408
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:25,201
And popcorn.

409
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:28,509
You?

410
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:29,901
Ah, nothing.

411
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,620
Mm.

412
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:35,014
It's bone spurs, isn't it?

413
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,608
Honestly,
I was thinking...

414
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,851
what if I just
knocked you up?

415
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,094
I think living at Meredith's
the last few months

416
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:51,749
has broken me.

417
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,491
I love being a dad.

418
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,861
I think I want more.

419
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,495
More children?

420
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,454
Like, of our own?

421
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:01,629
Yeah!

422
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:04,632
I mean, not tomorrow,

423
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:07,960
but... eventually.

424
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:12,596
Okay.
Now Iwant popcorn.

425
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,207
Link.

426
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,665
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

427
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,874
Hello?!

428
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,748
Hey.
Suture kit.

429
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:38,013
So you can get your dexterity
back between workouts.

430
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,581
Mm-hmm.
Hey. What you readin'?

431
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,061
My future.

432
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,151
Brain fog, neuropathy,
fatigue.

433
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,761
Some of the many gifts

434
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,893
I've been plagued with forever
due to COVID.

435
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,721
Or you could be just fine.

436
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,245
You know, there's
barely enough data.

437
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,377
The data that's out there
is terrifying.

438
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,466
Yeah, it's looking like
recovery can be long,

439
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,990
painful, and boring,
but the one thing it can't do

440
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,253
is do the work for you.

441
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,254
So, up.

442
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,473
No. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

443
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,171
I do not feel like it.

444
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,303
This attitude isn't gonna get
you back in the operating room.

445
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:09,436
And I can't lose any more
surgeons, so come on.

446
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,394
Bailey,
I may never get back.

447
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:15,050
I can't operate
if I can't stand on my feet.

448
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,573
I can barely
pick up my kids

449
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,314
without feeling like
I've run a marathon.

450
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:20,011
Alright, well, can you
at least take a break?

451
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,057
That's all I've been doing.

452
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,277
And I know
everybody means well,

453
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,367
but I don't want suture kits
and everybody hovering

454
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:30,370
and asking how I'm doing
every five minutes.

455
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,526
What I want
is my life back.

456
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,759
Still no activity.

457
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:51,869
Hey.

458
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,307
Hey.
I didn't hear you leave.

459
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,613
Yeah.
Skyler's just... nothing.

460
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,615
Well, you want to say
good morning?

461
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,120
Scout and I are just having
a little jam sesh.

462
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,474
Hey, Link, stop.

463
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,541
Why? He loves this.

464
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,350
But just stop.

465
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:15,613
Okay. Start again.

466
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:31,692
Gwen,
you're a rock star.

467
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,650
Great ejection fraction on echo,

468
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:36,087
the fluid build-up in your lungs
is almost resolved,

469
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,526
andyour labs show
no signs of organ rejection.

470
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,900
Well, you keep this up,
you'll be home in no time.

471
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,619
What's wrong?

472
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:48,535
Well, you're all so happy,
I hate to tell you.

473
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,885
I woke up with a headache,
and it's getting worse.

474
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,713
I'm seeing double.

475
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:55,019
Transplants can cause
perioperative strokes.

476
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,935
Or it could just be a...
A headache.

477
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,720
Yeah, we'll page neuro
to make sure.

478
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:01,243
Hang in there, Gwen.

479
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:04,401
I will, dear.
Thank you.

480
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:10,992
Hey.
Okay.

481
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,386
We know different parts of the
brain process different things, right?

482
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,302
Math problems, emotion,
spatial relationships,

483
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,304
and, as we've seen
with Skyler, music.

484
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,088
So we can take it
a step further.

485
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,307
First what we needed to do

486
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,134
was isolate distinct parts
of her brain.

487
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,614
A clear differentiation.

488
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,355
Okay.

489
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,704
Skyler, hi.

490
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,140
This is Dr. Shepherd.

491
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,210
I am going to
play you some music.

492
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:40,543
Great.

493
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:44,199
Okay. Now I would like you to
imagine your bedroom at home.

494
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,245
Imagine yourself
walking through it.

495
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,159
We... We know
that she can hear you.

496
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,987
That doesn't put her
any closer to waking up.

497
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,076
Maybe not,
but watch this.

498
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,600
Just wait.

499
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:56,472
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

500
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:58,474
If the answer is yes,

501
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,651
I want you to think
about music.

502
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:07,004
If the answer is no, I want you
to think about your bedroom.

503
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:12,033
Now, is your name Michelle?

504
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:18,649
Is your name Skyler?

505
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,064
Wow.
Amelia, that is...

506
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,805
Wow.
That is incredible.

507
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,764
Yeah, it's not bad.

508
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:30,854
<i>Code</i>
blue.

509
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:32,813
- Code blue. Room 4850.
- I got your page.

510
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:34,249
What the hell happened?

511
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,946
She turned blue after feeding.
Probably aspirated.

512
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,165
Are you in?

513
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,080
Not yet.
Have the CO2 detector ready.

514
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,735
I'm in.
Start bagging her.

515
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:42,953
Okay, Wilson.
CO2 detector.

516
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:43,998
What?

517
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,893
CO2 detector.
Sorry.

518
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,181
She's still bradycardic.

519
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,835
Let's resume compressions,
have epi on standby.

520
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:55,662
Why aren't you pushing epi?

521
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:57,644
Shush, please.

522
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,015
Hayes!
Stop.

523
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,216
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

524
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,912
We got it.

525
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:10,720
Oh, Luna, you gave us
a little scare.

526
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,461
Okay, let's start her
on IV fluids.

527
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:15,812
I want a chest X-ray, STAT.
We're holding enteral feeds.

528
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:18,206
Wilson?

529
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,340
I'm her mom. I'm gonna...

530
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:22,974
I want to be her mom.

531
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:38,661
I've been doing neuro exams
on Gwen for a week.

532
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,664
Completely normal.
I even did a CT and an MRI.

533
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,101
There's no sign
of edema or clots.

534
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:48,062
I can't find any reason
for her headaches. I'm sorry.

535
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,542
And I hate
to consult and run,

536
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,521
but I'm about to make
a father very happy.

537
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:57,201
I don't want to keep
telling Gwen to wait,

538
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:00,596
but we really
are out of tests.

539
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,773
It's a good thing
she doesn't seem to mind.

540
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:05,187
No, she doesn't.

541
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:07,627
Does she?

542
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,739
She sounds perfect, dear.
Why didn't you go on the date?

543
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:15,742
Her name is Taryn, too.

544
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:17,134
And as hot as she was,

545
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,006
I just don't think I can
make out with myself.Mm.

546
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,332
Hey, Gwen.

547
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:26,143
Well, your brain imaging
and neuro exams

548
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:29,799
haven't revealed
any abnormalities.

549
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,410
Your headaches
are a mystery.

550
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:34,978
Maybe it'll just work
itself out in a few days?

551
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:38,504
There is a rare complication
with some transplant patients.

552
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:41,420
It's acute borderline
cerebral dysplasia.

553
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,073
- Huh?
- Quiet, Helm.

554
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:46,228
It's not life-threatening, and
there is a simple test for it.

555
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:50,167
Patients with this condition
experience weakness

556
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:53,170
in downward movement
of their left arm.

557
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:56,347
So what I want to do is
I want to raise your arms...

558
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,415
and I want you to try to
keep them in the air, okay?

559
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,312
Oh. Well, looks like
we found our culprit.

560
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,750
Dr. Webber, I think
it was right-sided weakness.

561
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,231
Oh, oh, y-yes, yes.

562
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,341
Of course.
You're right, yeah.

563
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:17,215
Wait. Gwen.
You're faking?

564
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,829
I'm not ready to leave.

565
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:26,334
Gwen.

566
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,033
What you have survived,
you are a miracle.

567
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:32,471
Take the miracle.

568
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,363
But I have friends here.

569
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,215
The nurses and doctors.

570
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,695
You tell me
about your lives,

571
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,829
and you don't get bored
when I talk.

572
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:46,049

00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,796
Turns out
she was faking them

608
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,321
because she didn't
want to go home.

609
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,062

Hey.
You ride to work.

632
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:08,077
No.
Um, sometimes.

633
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:10,514

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,780

I just...

636
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,912
No, no, the rest of your face
is really cute.

637
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,479
Did you cut your hair?

638
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,806
I did.

639
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,571

Oh, no, sorry.
I meant later.

642
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,314
Do you... Do you want
to see each other,

643
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:29,142
like, out of the hospital?

644
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,144
Like, my place,
tonight?

645
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,406
Um...

646
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,060
I get COVID-tested
three times a week,

647
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:35,496
and I only go
to work and home,

648
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,541
and I don't even set foot
inside a grocery store.

649
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,891
So, um...

650
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,327
Yeah, you know, I'll just
text you my address

651
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:41,807
and see how the rest
of your day goes.

652
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,311
But I hope
I'm at the end of it.

653
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,821
We have tried extubating,
but she is not responding.

654
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,083
Modified barium swallow

655
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,346
shows that she is aspirating
with swallowing.

656
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,740
She's getting worse. I want to operate.

657
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,393
She justreached
full term.

658
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:04,830
We're aware.

659
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,354
A Nissen fundoplication
could help stop the reflux

660
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:08,747
and protect her lungs
for the future.

661
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,139
It's where I wrap the upper part
of the stomach...

662
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,619
Yeah, I'm familiar.

663
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,664
I've taken care of children
who have had this procedure.

664
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,362
And the county and I
respectfully disagree.

665
00:31:15,446 --> 00:31:18,234
Wait.
You're saying no? You ca...

666
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:21,324
I truly believe that you have
Luna's best interests at heart,

667
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:23,979
but until Luna is adopted,
I am as close

668
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:25,502
as she's ever gonna get
to a legal parent.

669
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,156
I'm sorry.

670
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,767
And, Dr. Wilson,
I'm sorry to hear

671
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:30,638
that your application
was denied.

672
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,707
It was a nice idea.

673
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:39,168
You were denied?

674
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:41,997
I didn't pass
the background check.

675
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:44,502
And explaining it
won't change anything.

676
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:55,924
Hey.

677
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:58,448
I'm surprised.
You came.

678
00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:00,494
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.

679
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:01,843
You look better.

680
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:05,064
I think
Koracick and Avery...

681
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,369
had the right idea.

682
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:09,503
Oh, Grey, no!
No, they did no...

683
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:11,548
I mean, yeah, they did,
but look.

684
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:13,376
If I lose any more surgeons,
then we just might as well

685
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,248
turn the hospital
into a clinic.

686
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,727
I'm not talking
about quitting.

687
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,992
I'm talking about learning.

688
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,995
And growing.
And getting better.

689
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,954
Anyway, I have spent
the last few weeks

690
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:27,782
worrying about
how to get back to normal,

691
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,915
but look where
normal got us.

692
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:33,614
Sexism, racism, inequality,
substandard care.

693
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:35,572
What has just happened,

694
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,487
we should neverwant to
go back to that.

695
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:41,622
Okay. I came here today
with an idea, Grey.

696
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:44,973
And... And you can say no,
but you can't say no right now.

697
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:47,236
Because you're

00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,667
Okay.
So... here's my idea.

875
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:44,147
We take the engagement ring
that my mom gave me

876
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,889
and we turn it
into my wedding band.

877
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:49,718
And we don't wait.

878
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:52,678
We get your grandma and my dad
out here as soon as we can,

879
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:54,636
and we just do it
with family.

880
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,857
And then someday, sometime,
when it's safe,

881
00:40:57,941 --> 00:41:01,403
we will have a party
that sets the world on fire.

882
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:03,906
Okay.
I'm good with that.

883
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,169
That is such a relief. Why?

884
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:10,652

Hello,
my sweet Winston!

Ahh! Nana Ante!

Hey, no, no!
No hugging for 10 days!

888
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:20,358
Hey, uh, so,
what's this I hear

889
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:22,360
about you wanting
to marry my little girl?

890
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:24,927
Oh, Dad. Stop it.

891
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:28,322
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe it.

892
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,584
Me neither.

893
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:31,456
My darling baby.

894
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,372
Maybe it's time
to rethink everything.
