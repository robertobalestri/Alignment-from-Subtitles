but the way we left things
last time,

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,138
I figured you did not want
to talk to me.

77
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,884

what...

83
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,581
She's 3 1/2 years old.
Her name is Harriet.

84
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,021
Right.

85
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:06,487
Look, I didn't travel
all this way

86
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:09,361
to just catch up,
so, um...

87
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,489
I need... answers.

88
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:14,495
Well, I've got about 150 lunches
to put together,

89
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,931
so if
we're gonna talk,

90
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,454
why don't you grab a pair
of gloves over here with me

91
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:19,413
and, uh...

92
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:21,025
help me out?

93
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,552

00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:25,660

97
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,493
She's not packed,
she's not ready, she's sick,

98
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:31,769
- and I have a calendar.
- It's okay, no, no, it's not...

99
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,777
- It's not my night. Alright? April, hey.
- No?

100
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,028
- It's not?
- No, no, no, it's alright.

101
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,386
Okay.
Just take a breath.

102
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,953
What's going on?
What's wrong?

103
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,651
- She has a temp of 102, and...
- Okay.

104
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:40,613
And she's coughing...

105
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,050
- ...and she has no appetite.
- Come here.

106
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:43,785
But I-I took a rapid test...
It's not COVID.

107
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,526
Come here, munchkin.
Come here. That's good.

108
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,092
Hey. Why didn't you call
me? I don't know what it is.

109
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,996
Whooping cough
or RSV or rickets?

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,999
- It's not rickets.
- People get rickets, Jackson.

111
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,044
And... And Matthew
just went out East with Ruby

112
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,278
to see his sister,
and the power

113
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,275
keeps going on and off,

114
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,402
and I know,
I am a doctor,

115
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:58,353
I need to take a deep breath
and I should be cool,

116
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:00,054
- but I am...
- You're not being cool right now.

117
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,801
You're not even breathing,
okay? Go ahead. Oh, God.

118
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,121
She's been sick before,
obviously,

119
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,480
but, like,
COVID just makes everything

120
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:05,954
feel so...
big.

121
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,316
And I know I need to calm down,
but no one

122
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,794
in the history of calming down
has ever calmed down

123
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:09,824
- by being told to calm down,
- so I'm not gonna, okay?

124
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:10,918
I'm not
gonna tell you to calm down, alright?

125
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,348
I'm not telling you to calm
down, I promise. I just...

126
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:13,730
Why don't you let me
in the house,

127
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,333
- Yeah, yes, okay. Just... sorry.
- Maybe? Okay?

128
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,336
- Come in.
- Hey, sweetheart.

129
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,176
I can't tell you
how long it took me

130
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,302
to come up with
this nifty system.

131
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,917
First, we start
with a bunch of these,

132
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,087
what I've coined
the brawn bundle.

133
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,221
Here's how we do it...
Two pieces of smoked ham,

134
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,703
one slice of honey turkey,
and provolone.

135
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:33,972
Are you serious
with all this?

136
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,698
Roll it up, and once you have
your ingredients set,

137
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:37,847
you move down here
to the bread.

138
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,048
You won't believe
how much time that saves.

139
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,311
Try a piece.

140
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,792
Look, I'll make
the damn sandwiches with you

141
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:45,893
in order to...

142
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:46,893
It's fine.
Okay?

143
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:49,416
But I don't need
to taste anything

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,597
or have any food
or coffee.

145
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,878
Just... I don't need anything
from you, honestly.

146
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:54,570
I just need answers.

147
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,632
Okay.

148
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,491
Answers?

149
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,885
Mom said
something to me

150
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,466
that I cannot get
out of my head.

151
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,034
Yeah,
she has a talent for that.

152
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:10,122
She said,
for the first time ever,

153
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,025
that I sounded
like you.

154
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,752
Did you piss her off?

155
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,364
I said
I can't really see change

156
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,357
coming from inside
the foundation.

157
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,446
- There's too much bureaucracy.
- Well, to be honest,

158
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,275
I haven't thought about
the foundation in a long time.

159
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,589
Yeah, but what do you think
she meant by that?

160
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,118
Years ago, I learned

161
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,213
to never put words
in your mother's mouth.

162
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:29,915
If you had to guess.

163
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,629
I've never been one
for the establishment.

164
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:36,351
I always thought
the whole system is rigged.

165
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,153
So, how we doing
over there?

166
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:41,134
You know,
I don't think

167
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:43,268
ham-and-turkey sandwiches
get enough credit.

168
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,853
They're simple,
but they get the job done.

169
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,637
So I said that
the whole system's just broken,

170
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,422
needs to be thrown out
and rebuilt,

171
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:53,130
understanding that
that's damn near impossible

172
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,611
considering how many people
benefit from it

173
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:55,892
the way it is
right now.

174
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,491
That does sound
a little like me.

175
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:04,147
You look like you could use
some more turkey.

176
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,307
Ever use
a commercial meat slicer?

177
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,053
- When would I have done that?
- Summer job?

178
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,616
Anyway,
it reminds me of the O.R.,

179
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:15,578
without the pressure
of possibly killing someone.

180
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:17,452
Come on,
let me show you.

181
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,500
Yeah, I can figure it out,
thank you.

182
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,031
Okay.

183
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,606
You might want to...

184
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,659
You might want to
turn it on first.

185
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,356
Yeah, right.

186
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,091
Just,
what is it?

187
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,627
Here, let me show you.
Okay.

188
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,680
First of all,
you gotta lift this.

189
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,097
Here's your gauge
for how thick

190
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,549
you want to
make the slice of meat.

191
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,812
Okay. Got it.
Thank you.

192
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,336
The carriage goes
back and forth.Great.

193
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,554
I got it.

194
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,209
Kinda relaxing when you get
a rhythm going, huh?

195
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,113
So... you're saying
you wanted change,

196
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,402
but what?

197
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:05,387
You felt powerless
'cause you were an Avery or...?

198
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:07,858
As you know, the Avery name
carries a great deal of influence,

199
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,432
but it also carries...

200
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,212
a great deal
of baggage.

201
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:12,895
That amount of money
can...

202
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,558
become a burden
pretty quickly.

203
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,767
Everybody knows
you have it, so...

204
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,301
they expect you
to be responsible

205
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,519
to fix everything
with it.

206
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,739
And there's almost no one
in your shoes,

207
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,836
so almost no one
seems to get it.

208
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,777
At least
not when I said it.

209
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,489
Certainly not
when the name is synonymous

210
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:32,056
with just the worst
behavior imaginable.

211
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,130
Well,
not here it's not.

212
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,082
Here, nobody knows
who my father was

213
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,700
or that
I come from money.

214
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,501
Out here,
they just think

215
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,899
I'm...
Robert, who runs the diner.

216
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,792
God.

217
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,254
Uh, Matthew's been working
a lot.

218
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:53,777
I mean,
I've been working a lot.

219
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,258
Yeah, don't worry about it.
My place is, uh...

220
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:56,417
Please don't do that.

221
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,541
Don't be all weird-nice
with your voice an octave higher

222
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,805
like you do with people
at hotels or at the bank.

223
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,675
I have
a weird bank voice now?

224
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,982
It's making you nuts.

225
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,568
You... You can say it.

226
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,309
Just mess everywhere.

227
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:08,628
Pillows all over
the place.

228
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:09,978
I maintain
that throw pillows

229
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,290
are useless and stupid,
yeah.

230
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,021
How long has my munchkin
been sick?

231
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,335
Couple days.

232
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,190
She just
hasn't wanted to do anything,

233
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:20,540
just lie on me.

234
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:22,227
Also, she needs a bath.
She smells like feet.

235
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,774
Well, I hate to break it to you...
that's you.

236
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,770
- No, it's not.
- 100 percent you.

237
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,812
Oh, God.
That is me.

238
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:29,897
Yeah.
Go take a shower.

239
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,100
Jackson, I...

240
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,886
April,
go take a shower, please.

241
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,773
- Hey, Jackson.
- Mm-hmm?

242
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,084
I'm calming down.

243
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,865
See?
I am. I am.

244
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,955
- 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes.

245
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,920
She ever taken
a 10-minute shower in her life?

246
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,666
I don't think so.

247
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,225
Some tunes?
Good idea.

248
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,449
Let's see
what she's got.

249
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,441
We got this, right?

250
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,888
We got this, baby.

251
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,673
We got this.

252
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:08,762
You're gonna feel better
in no time.

253
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,640
Harriet and Dad.

254
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,297
We got this.

255
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:15,859
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

256
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,435
Or maybe we don't.

257
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,192

what'd your dad think

265
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,248
when you decided
to walk away from it all?

266
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,964
At first,
he thought it was just a phase.

267
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,553
But then when he realized
I was serious,

268
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,992
he stopped speaking
to me.

269
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,193
Completely?

270
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,456

Which I now see
is such a complete joke.

273
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:00,115
No, he was never interested
in talking to me,

274
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,868
unless it was
about the hospital image

275
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,695
or profits
or expansion.

276
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,820
If I have to have
one more conversation

277
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,781

I swear...

278
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,044
Someone's got to
do it.

279
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,347
I just knew
it wasn't gonna be me.

280
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,750
I was never gonna be
the son my father wanted

281
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:18,200
because I didn't want to be
the man the role required.

282
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,669
That's why
you're here.

283
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:25,045
Why's that?

284
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,143
Because...

285
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,588
you're ready
to leave it all behind.

286
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,771
Why does anyone have
an electric water heater?

287
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:47,556
A power outage is when
you need hot water the most.

288
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,515
Well, Harriet cried herself
to sleep.

289
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,692
I propped her head up
to help with the coughing.

290
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:53,997
Okay, thank you.

291
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,521
And I found a flashlight
and a few candles,

292
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,306
but I can't find any
damn matches in this place.

293
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,395
Oh, yeah, well, I'm married
to a first responder.

294
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,501
The matches are in a drawer
even I've never found.

295
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:04,919
Alright.
Well, then, stove it is.

296
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,054
Geez.

297
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,194
Can you get
some more candles?

298
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,585
What?

299
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,714
Oh, crap!
Sorry.

300
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,672
This is a nun.

301
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,848
I just grabbed the, uh... The first nun
you could find?

302
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:20,688
Saying I'm going to hell?

303
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,648
Since when
do you believe in hell? True.

304
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:24,607
But they're your candles,
so you're going to hell.

305
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,210
Okay.

306
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,518
Alright,
just give me this. Yeah, grab that.

307
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:30,077
Her fever's at 102,

308
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,295
so you might be right
about RSV.

309
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,558
Okay.

310
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:35,560
So we just
give her acetaminophen

311
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,224
and wait it out
unless she gets short of breath?

312
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,418
Versus driving in a blackout
to Grey-Sloan in a pandemic?

313
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,143
Yeah,
we're not going anywhere.

314
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,667
The risk
of exposure alone...

315
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,874
We don't need doctors, April.
We aredoctors.

316
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,093
And if
she gets worse...

317
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,355
Which she probably won't.

318
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,443
Exactly.

319
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,619
Yeah.

320
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,490
How's Meredith doing?

321
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,318
I've been
praying for her.

322
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,407
Oh, she's, uh...
She's awake. Yeah?

323
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,279
And she's getting better
every day, stronger.

324
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,676
Oh.
Yeah.

325
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,718
So, tonight wasn't
your night.

326
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,329
Yes. As usual,
your calendar is impeccable.

327
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:06,008
Well done.

328
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:08,158
No, I'm just saying,
uh, tonight...

329
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,073
Tonight wasn't your night,
so why are you...

330
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,032
How have I never been
to your place?

331
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,077
I feel like I guess
we must always do drop-offs

332
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,339
at mine or work.

333
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,211
It's... It's nice.
It looks really nice.

334
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,778
I like what you've
done. Jackson...

335
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,605
You guys are happy,
you and... you and Matthew?

336
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,125
We're busy,
like everyone else.

337
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,048
And Harriet and you
and him and Ruby,

338
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:25,796
the same house,
it's going...

339
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,290
Exposed brick is...
is cool.

340
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,038
- I know you've always liked...
- Do you really think

341
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:29,032
I can't tell when you're being cagey?

342
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:30,812
- I'm not being cagey.
- Am I happy?

343
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:33,396
Exposed brick?
Would you just talk like a person?

344
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,180
I went
to see my dad again.

345
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:39,400
Oh, God.
Is he sick?

346
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,011
No,
he's the same as always.

347
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:44,357
Obliviously medium happy about
his obliviously medium life.

348
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,767
I thought you never
wanted to see him again.

349
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:49,134
I didn't.

350
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:54,178
I needed to know if I was right
about what I... what I wanted.

351
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,598
And we're back
to being cagey.

352
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:59,079
I'm not trying to be cagey,
April.

353
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,991
He couldn't handle it.

354
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:02,209
Okay?

355
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,995
He couldn't step up
or step into his own,

356
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,138
and I can.

357
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:10,965
I want to take over
the foundation.

358
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,878
Is this the, uh,
coffee you showed me

359
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:16,921
last time
I was here?

360
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,012
We sold out
of our first batch.

361
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:20,971
The local paper
wrote us up,

362
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,250
so we decided to add
four more roasts.

363
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,602
I was gonna branch out
into other parts of the state,

364
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,514
and then,
ah, COVID.

365
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,780
Yeah, I remember.
You guys got hit pretty hard.

366
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,741
Hospital was
turning people away, right?

367
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,287
It was a lot.

368
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,647
I did
everything I could

369
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,638
to keep this place open
after COVID hit.

370
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,654
But then I ended up
just... bagging up food

371
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:40,773
for the regulars.

372
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:42,413
Word spread,

373
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,343
and every morning,
I come in here

374
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,550
and crank up
the Doobie Brothers,

375
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,563
start packing lunches.

376
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,902
It was
weirdly therapeutic.

377
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:52,988
Kept my mind occupied.

378
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,482
Well...

379
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,527
you got
quite the bubble out here.

380
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,878
Built a very different life
for yourself.

381
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,096
We're all raised
to think

382
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,789
that's some kind of
wild concept.

383
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:04,609
But what's wild
is going to work every day

384
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,362
doing something
you do not like,

385
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:09,293
thinking one day,
it'll just magically stop.

386
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:10,882
Yeah.

387
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,314
I just feel stuck.

388
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:14,989
Hmm.

389
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,065
Like there's two of me.
Like there's this...

390
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:21,791
This successful surgeon
that I worked so hard to become,

391
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,345
was trying
to push the foundation

392
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,108
to be
more progressive.

393
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:26,806
And also just the guy

394
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,734
that didn't ask
for any of this, you know?

395
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,912
I'm worried
that maybe it's too late...

396
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,514
The system's beyond repair.

397
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:38,482
Maybe I could be effective
from the outside.

398
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,441
Or maybe you could
let go of the idea

399
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,448
that it's your job
to save the world.

400
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,925
You know,
there's nothing wrong

401
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,057
with wanting
to keep things simpler.

402
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,190
Yeah,
I think about that a lot.

403
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:52,384
Actually,
I think, you know,

404
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,727
I could get a small place
in the woods,

405
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:56,807
maybe open
a private practice,

406
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,599
do things
I really care about.

407
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,162
Explore the great outdoors
with Harriet.

408
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,000
We all deserve to live our lives
however we want.

409
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,174
Sure, yeah.

410
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,911
You are an older white guy
who's always had money, so...

411
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,375
If nothing changes
in the world,

412
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,184
you're still gonna be fine,
but I... I hear you.

413
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:16,912
You given any thought
to what if?

414
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:18,566
What if
I didn't come back here?

415
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,888
What if
you chose differently, yeah.

416
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:25,263
Well,
I'm more of a, hmm...

417
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,413
"never look back"
type.

418
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,704
Right, yeah.

419
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,330
Yeah, um...

420
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:44,069
When I was here last time,
I wanted to ask you why,

421
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,243
and I... I didn't...
I couldn't...

422
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,161
I guess I used to say
I was over it,

423
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,334
but I'm not.
I need to know

424
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,129
why you left.

425
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,219
'Cause, um...

426
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,307
...I realize that
it's really messed me up...

427
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,701
pretty badly.

428
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,536
And, um...

429
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,562
It just
made it hard to, like,

430
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,221
maintain relationships
and stuff.

431
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,013
Having this inclination
to run away all the time.

432
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,273
And I know,
I know...

433
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,883
Running away
doesn't actually solve anything.

434
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,439
I know that.

435
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:19,646
So...
And I've tried.

436
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,818
I've tried really hard
to rid myself of the shame

437
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,242
and the pain that comes with
all that, and, uh...

438
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:27,864
You know,
just kind of doubled-down

439
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,607
on being the best
at everything...

440
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,683
The best father
I could possibly be.

441
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,801
I probably stayed in my marriage
longer than I should have,

442
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,221
went along with
foundation business

443
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,571
longer than
I should have,

444
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,885
but no matter what,
when it gets rough,

445
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,345
I just end up...
right there,

446
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,652
running,
into the woods.

447
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:47,184
Try to fight
the you in me.

448
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,181
Can you not just sit there looking
at me? Can you say something?

449
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:53,835
Pretend that
I'm worth talking to?

450
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,793
I don't know how you can just
say nothing all the... Ow!

451
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,057
God! Aah!
Damn it!

452
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,189
God!

453
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:01,538
Oh, man.
You alright?

454
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,714
No, I'm not alright!
Give it... I got it!

455
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,637
Pressure,
pressure, pressure.

456
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:14,606
Okay.

457
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,820
Temp's down to 101.

458
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,561
It's just
a bad dream.

459
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,007
- Oh, yeah? How's her breathing?
- It's better.

460
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,265
- Oh, good, alright.
- Yeah.

461
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,661
- So we could be out of the woods.
- Yeah.

462
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,101
So,
were you hoping

463
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,976
- Matthew wasn't gonna be here tonight?
- What?

464
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,370
No, I don't have a problem
with Matthew.

465
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:39,720
- Really?
- What?

466
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,674
Whenever you guys
are in the same room together,

467
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:43,068
you say
one of three things...

468
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,251
"Yup," "Sure,"
"Not a problem."

469
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:46,172
Well, okay, yeah.

470
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:49,673
We're not best friends,
but, I mean, it's civil.

471
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,156
He seems like
a fine guy.

472
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,118
- He seems, uh, kind.
- Kind?

473
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,969
I don't have a badword
to say about him.

474
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:57,726
That...
That's something.

475
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,286
So then why did you want to
come tell me this in person?

476
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,210
You're considering
running the foundation.

477
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:05,429
What's that
got to do with me?

478
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,349
That's the thing
I'm not...

479
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,281
just considering it.

480
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,591
I'm doing it.

481
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:14,517
Running the foundation means
I got to move to Boston.

482
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,875
W... Without Harriet?

483
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,289
No. God, no.

484
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:20,547
I'm moving to Boston,

485
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:23,470
and I really
need you all to come.

486
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,462
The foundation will employ
you and Matthew.

487
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:27,407
You'll be set.

488
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:28,312
You can do
whatever you want

489
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:31,297
in terms of an outreach program
or design or build.

490
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:33,419
Anything you want to do,
we'll fund it.

491
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,911
I would never
leave Harriet.

492
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:40,726
I could never,
ever leave Harriet,

493
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,177
which means I really
need you all to come with me.

494
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,191
Please.

495
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:54,695
Doesn't look like there are
any tendon injuries.

496
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,957
Yeah,
the cut's not that deep.

497
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:56,836
Okay.

498
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,208
Another wash,
then let's glue it.

499
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,293
I can handle it
from here.

500
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:03,560
Actually,
just hand me the glue.

501
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:06,102
Okay.

502
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,661
Ow.

503
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,070
Just give me
your hand.

504
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:16,407
Come on, man. Let
me do this. Okay.

505
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,828
I may not have practiced
in a while,

506
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:21,694
but... it is like
riding a bike.

507
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,286
Not exactly,
but okay.

508
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,634
Hold it together.

509
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:29,339
See?
Alright.

510
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,648
That is not bad.

511
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:32,285
Okay.
Does it hurt?

512
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,952
- Do you want any Tylenol or anything?
- Um.

513
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,249
No, no, no.
It's actually just...

514
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,774
It stings a little bit,
but that's fine.

515
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,603
Thank you.
Look at us.

516
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,612
We ought to open up
a family practice.

517
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,974
You know,
I'm gonna...

518
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:52,374
I'm just gonna
grab some air.

519
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,038
I get it, Jackson.

520
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,735
You're not the only person
in quarantine

521
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,354
who's drowning in big

522
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:04,718
"What the hell am I doing
with my life?"

523
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,114
Kind of questions.

524
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,332
But you don't just
up and move across the country

525
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,230
on a whim.

526
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,177
No, no, no, that's not what
this is. It's not on a whim.

527
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,515
Since the moment I met you
at Mercy West,

528
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,519
you have rejected
your family name, the legacy,

529
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:17,769
even the freaking plane.

530
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:19,784
You've... You've wanted
nothing to do with any of it.

531
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,230
- I resisted. That's not necess...
- No, no, no.

532
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,399
Sorry, you've been running,
kicking and screaming.

533
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,052
That is not
where this is coming from.

534
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,137
Okay? I can use this
as an opportunity

535
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,137
to make some profound changes
in the world.

536
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,131
You understand?

537
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,898
I respect that. I mean,
I-I admire that, Jackson.

538
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:35,249
As long as it's not an inconvenience
to your perfect little life here?

539
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,886
Uprooting my entire life
is not an inconvenience.

540
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,740
Okay,
you're right.

541
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:42,150
But I need this.

542
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,965
I know
that I need to do this.

543
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,115
I can feel it in my gut, and I
just want to trust that for once.

544
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:46,779
Okay.

545
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:48,894
How many times have you
"felt in your gut"...

546
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:51,333
- ...the need to just pack up a tent
- Don't...

547
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,117
and go
for a walkabout

548
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,892
and talk to yourself
amongst the trees?

549
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:57,921
So I'm the only one that's walked
away when I was having a hard time?

550
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,559
Just me, huh?

551
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:00,724
How many times
have you been

552
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:01,795
sitting in the front pew
at a church,

553
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,373
talking to God about the plans
for your life?

554
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,202
- It's not the same thing. I...
- Why not?

555
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,466
Why is it that you can find
solace and purpose in a church,

556
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,927
but I can't find it
in nature,

557
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:12,147
where I can actually have
some time that's quiet... -

558
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,976
...hear myself think,
think about what I want,

559
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,349
not what everybody else
expects of me?

560
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,778
So how long
did you spend

561
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,179
thinking about
going to see your father?

562
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:20,857
How much time did you spend
doing that?

563
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,560
- Don't reduce it to that!
- Or did you just, like, get in a car

564
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:23,944
- No, it's not on a whim, okay?
- And... and go...

565
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:24,874
- It was a realization.
- Okay, I...

566
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,073
I needed clarity,

567
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:28,598
and I went and talked to Robert,
and I got it.

568
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:33,045
You have never
wanted any of this.

569
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:36,491
And... And I'm just
supposed to roll with it

570
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,162
and see
what happens?

571
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,469
What... What happens
when you regret it?

572
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,993
What happens when you realize
that you actually hate it?

573
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:44,287
What you're asking
of me,

574
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:47,105
of... of our family,
of our daughter, it's...

575
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:51,317
What happens
if it doesn't work?

576
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,765
Matthew got on one knee
and proposed to you...

577
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,780
- Please don't. Jackson, I'm...
- No, no, no, it's true.

578
00:22:57,864 --> 00:22:58,879
He got on one knee
and proposed to you

579
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,315
in front of me.

580
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,838
I stood there,

581
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,732
watched another man
become your husband

582
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,115
and stepfather
to my child

583
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,539
- ...our child...
- Mm-hmm.

584
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:08,932
...and at no point
did I come to you and say,

585
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,193
"Yeah, but what if
it doesn't work?"

586
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:11,413
I didn't do that.

587
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:13,566
I had your back that day
and every day since.

588
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:16,443
He bugs the hell out of you,
doesn't he?

589
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,335
I'm allowed
to be frustrated at the guy

590
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,946
who makes
sandwiches weird.

591
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,146
Who... I-It's... And he
calls her Hair-Hair.

592
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,042
I know. I know.
I'm working on that.

593
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:28,343
What I'm not allowed
to do, April,

594
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,170
what... what I've actually
never done,

595
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:31,248
is stand in the way

596
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:34,222
of the happiness
that you chose for yourself.

597
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,925
I had your back.

598
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,810
I know
this is a surprise,

599
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:42,038
but I'm just asking you...
Do the same for me.

600
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,941
I...

601
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:49,191
I... I want you to be happy,
Jackson.

602
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,191
You deserve it.

603
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:55,675
But running
the foundation?

604
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,286
I...
I'm sorry.

605
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,860
It's just...

606
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,974
You're not that guy.

607
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,316
I don't think
you ever will be.

608
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:13,287
So, that's it?
I'm either gonna fail or quit?

609
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,646
I'm sorry, Jackson. I didn't...
I didn't mean that...

610
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,139
Yeah, you did.
That's exactly what you meant.

611
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,915
Ok...

612
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,091
Fine. Yeah.
I did.

613
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,486
Jackson,
you are a brilliant surgeon.

614
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,173
You rebuild people's faces,
you rebuild their lives.

615
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,707
You find a way
to make them breathe

616
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,926
when...
When it seems impossible.

617
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,229
You gave a little boy back
his hands.

618
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,104
You prayed me
back into the world

619
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,354
when I was almost dead.

620
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:37,936
Y-You take out
impossible tumors,

621
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,896
and you make people
walk out into the world

622
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,507
with their heads
held high.

623
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:43,858
That's where
you've left your mark.

624
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:46,493
It's what
makes you exceptional.

625
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:47,886
Wh...

626
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,384
Why would you want
to give all of that up?

627
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,298
It's not about what I want.
It's what I need to do.

628
00:24:52,382 --> 00:24:54,181
Well, you know what?
It's a little late to decide that.

629
00:24:54,265 --> 00:24:55,196
Excuse me?

630
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,476
You don't get to choose
who I am in this world, April.

631
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,118
Nobody does.
Not my father,

632
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,101
not Mom... nobody.

633
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:02,163
And you don't get to choose
your career over mine.

634
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,513
That's...
I am happy.

635
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:04,835
I'm helping people.

636
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,845
I'm really helping them.

637
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,457
I am building
support systems

638
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,749
and resources for people
in rural communities,

639
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:11,906
and they need
so much,

640
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,188
and I can actually
do that for them.

641
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,515
And you can
keep doing that.

642
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,390
You can do it
on an even bigger scale.

643
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,783
You can do it
across the country.

644
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,091
I'm... You're literally
just gaining resources.

645
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:23,153
April, I am not trying
to diminish your work.

646
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,560
We have
an opportunity

647
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,365
to do something really amazing
for all of us.

648
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:28,325
Matthew will go along
with it.

649
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:30,129
He'll follow you.

650
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,356
That's why
I like him so much.

651
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,341
Oh, God.

652
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,481
You know what?

653
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:46,260
You... You didn't always
have my back.

654
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:51,381
When I found
what I needed in Jordan,

655
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,705
you didn't go
with me.

656
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,310
You left me alone.
I went alone.

657
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:57,190
April, that's not fair.
You ran away from me.

658
00:25:57,314 --> 00:26:00,060
And Samuel and the pain
and the grief,

659
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:02,717
which is understandable.

660
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,677
You know,
I was resentful at the time,

661
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,240
but I get it.

662
00:26:06,324 --> 00:26:07,404
You were surviving.

663
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,956
You had to do
what you had to do to survive.

664
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:12,537
But this isn't that,
anyway.

665
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,295
I'm not
running fromsomething.

666
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:16,119
I'm trying
to run tosomething.

667
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,792
Trying to make
something my own.

668
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,823
It's not fair,
Jackson.

669
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,697
If you had
the opportunity

670
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:33,659
to finally
make it all make sense,

671
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,122
to become
what you were meant to be,

672
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:41,049
wouldn't you try really,
really hard to get there?

673
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,315
I would.

674
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:46,581
I did.

675
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,454
That's all
I'm asking for.

676
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:57,985
I got it.

677
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:11,396
99.3.

678
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,572
- Oh, good. Alright.
- Yeah.

679
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:13,779
So she's
a little more comfortable.

680
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,554
Yeah.
She's talking in her sleep.

681
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:16,708
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

682
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,017
Anything good?

683
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:19,562
Just gibberish.

684
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,842
She said,
"Amananome."

685
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:23,950
Ah.
That is the sea anemone.

686
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,497
Oh. She's been waking
me up the last few weeks

687
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,892
with a different
sea creature fact.

688
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:30,005
Are they really "facts,"
though?

689
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,542
In her head, they are.

690
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,326
It's the best alarm clock, ever,
I'll tell you.

691
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,240
Last week,
she told me

692
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,074
that she could hear "werewoofs"
throwing up in your basement.

693
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,641
Really?
I don't even have a basement.

694
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:43,983
Oh, I'm aware.

695
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,644
There's no
convincing her otherwise.

696
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:46,958
So stubborn.

697
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,005
Which I would say comes
from her mother... - Mm.

698
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,146
...but I think
we both know...

699
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,409
- 50/50 split...
- right down the middle.

700
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:53,782
Yeah.

701
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,872
I could never give that up
going to Boston.

702
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:58,779
Sea creature alarm clocks,
holding her when she's sick.

703
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,576
But I can't walk away
from this chance

704
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,051
to make real change
in the foundation.

705
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,663
I mean,
Mom was able to do both.

706
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:06,732
And I know in my gut,
that I can, too.

707
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:09,170
I mean, I owe it to Harriet
to try, at least.

708
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,999
- I know.
- And I know I can't do it all,

709
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,965
but, April,
I am telling you,

710
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:16,290
I can take this foundation
to a whole new chapter.

711
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,998
I mean, creating real
racial equity in medicine.

712
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:19,880
Are you kidding?

713
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,382
It's a revolutionary,
lasting change.

714
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,240
I could look my daughter
in the face

715
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,709
and know that I've done
everything I possibly can

716
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,015
to give her
a better world.

717
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:30,634
I know.
I know.

718
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,117
I could do all that

719
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:35,302
and... and be the father
that mine never was.

720
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,284
And all I need to do
is turn my life upside down.

721
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:01,339
Puts a lot into perspective,
huh?

722
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:07,138
Yeah, I come out here
every morning

723
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:09,012
just to
take it all in.

724
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,560
Feel like
I got a lot more thinking done

725
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:13,750
these last few days
out here

726
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,627
than... probably
all year.

727
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:20,938
Might find it
hard to believe,

728
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,957
but I've been thinking a lot
about our last visit.

729
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,485
Everything you said.

730
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,026
And the truth is,

731
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,592
I left because
that's what I do.

732
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:33,138
I chose this place
because it's safe.

733
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:36,939
Running the restaurant,
bagging lunches,

734
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,670
none of it
requires much of me.

735
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,967
I can walk away
and not look back any time.

736
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,885
And just forget about who
you're leaving behind, yeah?

737
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:50,228
I was convinced you were
better off without me.

738
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:51,469
Without a father?

739
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:54,107
How would you think
I'm better off without...

740
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,963
my father never being there
for any birthdays,

741
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,456
any graduations?

742
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,771
That time I got beat up
by Billy Paxton?

743
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,658
At my wedding?

744
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,488
The birth of my child,
your granddaughter.

745
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,633
My divorce... maybe that
would've been a good time

746
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:12,904
for you to step in
and share some wisdom.

747
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,706
A hug,
I don't know.

748
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,469
Help me
make some decisions?

749
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:20,022
It's not like
it was a few months, man.

750
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:21,756
Or a year
or 10 years.

751
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,094
It's my entire life.

752
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:26,014
- How could you think that's better?
- In my father's eyes,

753
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:27,669
I was the screw-up
in the family,

754
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:28,889
and I absorbed
that story.

755
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:30,690
Maybe I became it.

756
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:33,178
And I didn't want
to pass that down to you.

757
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,221
I did not want
to mess you up.

758
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:39,178
Congrats.

759
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,608
I get that now.

760
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,792
I hurt
a lot of people.

761
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,962
You,
your mother.

762
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,760
And to have found out
I have a granddaughter that I...

763
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,630
may never meet...

764
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:55,738
Yeah, well, it didn't have to
be that way, did it?

765
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:57,434
You're absolutely right.

766
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:59,307
So I buy her presents.

767
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,964
An art set, a basketball,
tricycle, board games.

768
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:04,742
What are you saying?
And you didn't send them?

769
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:05,800
I don't have
the right.

770
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,690
I don't deserve...

771
00:31:08,114 --> 00:31:11,932
to take your time,
be in your space.

772
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,694
Not one day has passed

773
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:18,615
that I haven't regretted
leaving you.

774
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,953
It haunts me
in my sleep,

775
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,260
when I wake up
in the morning.

776
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,515
And I am truly,
truly sorry.

777
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,780
And yet I know an apology
will never make up for it.

778
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:31,050
And I have to live
with that.

779
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,354
I will never
get over it.

780
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,209
Oh, Jackson.

781
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:39,703
Crossroads like this,
you don't arrive at them often,

782
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:42,453
but I know
you will be okay,

783
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:45,128
no matter
what road you choose.

784
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:46,848
I'm still an Avery,
right?

785
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:48,714
I still find
some way to...

786
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,146
walk away
from it all.

787
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,932
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

788
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:53,006
Isn't that
what they say?

789
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,415
Nice.

790
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:57,286
That's great. No, I'm sorry.

791
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,071
I just thought
that was funny.

792
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:01,298
I'm the tree,
you're the apple.

793
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,162
Do you really
think that?

794
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:04,568
I'm sitting here,
aren't I?

795
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,591
Jackson, let me assure you,
you are not me.

796
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,038
The fact that you're even
questioning your choices

797
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,577
is proof of that.

798
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:12,779
And if
that's not enough,

799
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,612
you are committed,
Jackson.

800
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:16,746
Committed to your work,
to your family,

801
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,625
to people in need.

802
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,771
And I know sometimes you want
to run away from it all,

803
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,948
but anybody with any sense
does that.

804
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:26,631
It's very different

805
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:28,672
from actually
following through with it.

806
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:31,937
I was scared.

807
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:33,675
I'm scared.

808
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,948
Yeah, but you're scared
of doing the wrongthing.

809
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,784
I was too scared
to do the rightthing.

810
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:43,506
You're not a runner.

811
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,976
If you were, you would have been
long gone by now.

812
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,357
Do you know how easy
it would have been

813
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:48,708
for you to walk away
from everything

814
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,798
after it all came out
about the foundation?

815
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,025
Did you even
consider it?

816
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:56,740
Not really, no.

817
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,613
Of course not.

818
00:32:57,697 --> 00:33:00,232
'Cause you have it in your soul
to do the right thing,

819
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,806
to make things right.

820
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,657
And you didn't just
fix a disaster,

821
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:05,446
you made it better.

822
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,160
So if you don't want
to stay, don't.

823
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:11,120
But don't
blame it on me.

824
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:15,277
'Cause on
your worst day,

825
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,480
you are 10 times
the man I am.

826
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:40,327
- Jackson?
- Hey.

827
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:41,646
- Come in.
- I can't stay.

828
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,279
Honey,
it's pouring out here.

829
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:44,060
Here, Mom.

830
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:46,123
I mean, I can't stay
at Grey-Sloan in Seattle.

831
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,904
I can't keep doing
what we've always done.

832
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,297
You know how many
people of color

833
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,300
we've already lost
since the pandemic started?

834
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:53,232
The system keeps diminishing
and erasing us.

835
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:55,514
T-They're literally letting
people just die in the streets,

836
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:56,584
and we can do something
about it.

837
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,587
I got to show Harriet
that we can put our money

838
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,459
and our attention
where our mouths are.

839
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:02,288
And we can acknowledge
the connection between our work

840
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:03,726
and what's actually happening
in the streets

841
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,860
and give a sense of equity
in this world, okay?

842
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,696
It's not gonna change
after COVID.

843
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,177
We know that.

844
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:13,178
White supremacy is woven into
the fabric of this country,

845
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,946
and that
means medicine, too.

846
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,365
People that look like us

847
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,847
should not have to be
gaslit, shamed, and ignored

848
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,927
when they're
just going to the doctor,

849
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:22,257
constantly having to prove
that their lives have any value.

850
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:24,662
It's like this constant
cycle of stress

851
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:26,927
from poverty and trauma
and racism,

852
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,482
and it's definitely
impacting mental health...

853
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:31,224
It's definitely
killing us.

854
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:32,420
Where are people
supposed to turn?

855
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,771
They don't feel safe
going to the doctor.

856
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,643
They're scared
to call the cops.

857
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:37,732
This is like
a deep-seated neglect.

858
00:34:37,816 --> 00:34:40,685
And if our deaths are not
affecting their profit margin,

859
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,692
then it's not
gonna change.

860
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,629
I want to take over
the foundation.

861
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:48,052
What?

862
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,858
I want to reallocate
every penny that we have

863
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:50,982
to equity
in medicine...

864
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,146
Women's health, trans health,
racial equity.

865
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,292
I want everyone who this country
abuses to be served, okay?

866
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,537
We need to challenge
all the ways that we teach,

867
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,382
everything that
we're doing.

868
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,626
If that means dismantling
the whole medical system

869
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,585
a-and... and designing something
that actually serves everyone,

870
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:07,443
then that's
what I want to do.

871
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:08,826
I-I see that now.
I'm ready.

872
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,960
Jackson,
where have you been?

873
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:12,365
It doesn't even
matter anymore, Mom.

874
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,586
It matters that I'm back
and I know where I belong.

875
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,685
Oh!

876
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,310
- I gotta go. I love you.
- Ah!

877
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:19,271
Where on God's earth are you going now?

878
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:20,373
I got to go
talk to April.

879
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:22,176
What?!
Jackson...

880
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:31,642
Here we go.
Yummy!

881
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you gonna go with
crazy fork?

882
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,898
Pancakes
go in your belly.

883
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,247
Why do you always go
for the big ones?

884
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:40,084
<i>Hey.</i>

885
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:41,567
<i>Take all the small pieces,
alright?</i>

886
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:43,404
<i>You want to cut your own little piece?</i>

887
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,905
- A small one.
- What are you doing...

888
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:47,299
<i>A small one this time,
that's soaked up in syrup?</i>

889
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:48,545
<i>Extra syrup?</i>

890
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:50,397
Ooh.
There she is.

891
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,172
- There she is.
- Hi!

892
00:35:52,294 --> 00:35:53,582
Mommy!

893
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:55,698
Hi!

894
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:57,474
Oh!
No fever.

895
00:35:57,558 --> 00:36:00,261
Oh, good,
good, good.

896
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:01,632
I want orange juice.

897
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:03,200
Yeah, you can have
some orange juice.

898
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:04,388
You want me
to get it for you, baby?

899
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,101
No,
I get it myself.

900
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,674
- Okay.
- Okay.

901
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,050
Go ahead, baby.

902
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,026
Are you gonna unscrew the top
and pour it?

903
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,409
You are that guy,
Jackson.

904
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:22,541
I was an ass
for saying otherwise.

905
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,156
Yeah?

906
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:27,310
Pillows in every room.

907
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,483
They come in handy.

908
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,690
Hey,
are you sure about this?

909
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:33,990
I'm not sure
it's gonna work, but...

910
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:36,049
I'm sure
it's what I want, yeah.

911
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:39,263
Why is our timing always
so terrible?

912
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,444
I thought that was kind of
our thing... bad timing.

913
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:42,802
We just
never figured out

914
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,182
how to want the same thing
at the same time.

915
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:46,596
Even with Harriet.

916
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,564
Yeah, but, I mean,
it worked out pretty well.

917
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:51,276
Yeah,
but we were fighting,

918
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,462
and then we had sex

919
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,471
while our marriage
was falling apart.

920
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:56,324
That was actually
our thing...

921
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:58,703
Arguing until we were blue
in the face and then having sex.

922
00:36:58,787 --> 00:37:01,191
Yeah, I guess
we were doomed, huh?

923
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:05,517
Look, if you're really
living your dream here,

924
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,892
I'll give it up,
because you're right.

925
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,372
I'm totally
springing it on you guys.

926
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,461
No. What?

927
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,290
You do not
get to do all the speeches

928
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,376
and the convincing

929
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,206
and that thing where your face
just lights up

930
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,501
just to
take it all back again.

931
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:17,951
Don't take it
all back.

932
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,261
You deserve this.

933
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,868
Wait.
What are you saying?

934
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:23,657
I am saying...

935
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,905
...we will
make Boston work.

936
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,220
I'm saying yes.

937
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:32,384
What?
You're saying yes?

938
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:33,876
To my question,
you're saying yes? Yes.

939
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,845
I'm saying... Yeah. I thought
that's what you wanted.

940
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,887
Yeah, but... Yes?

941
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,970
Like, I didn't think
it would be that easy.

942
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:41,668
I'm sorry.
You call this night easy?

943
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,102
No, not...
Not easy like that,

944
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:45,951
but, like, I thought
you'd have to pray

945
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:49,040
or consult with Matthew,
maybe get your pastor involved,

946
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:51,735
- some additional praying...
- Yeah. Yeah. Matthew will be fine.

947
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,227
Alright, well,
when does he get back?

948
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:54,876
I can help with the pitch.
I can talk to him.

949
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,255
- What do you want me to...?
- Uh, no. No. No.

950
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:59,157
No, that's a horrible
and weird idea...

951
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,172
- Yes.
- ...obviously.

952
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:02,288
Um, but tell him that
I can help him with work.

953
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:04,296
I'll make sure everything is
arranged for him and for Ruby.

954
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,193
We split up.

955
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:11,177
Oh.

956
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,237
We kept trying to tell ourselves
that our whole winding road

957
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:25,247
was God's plan
to bring us back together.

958
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:29,966
But he was still so angry
and so hurt.

959
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:33,797
I mean, I left him at the altar,
and then his wife died.

960
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,119
You know,
you don't just stop feeling hurt

961
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:37,679
'cause it's a better story

962
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:40,950
if God brought us together
in our pain.

963
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,257
He denied it
for so long.

964
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:46,423
You know, he tried so hard
not to hate me.

965
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:49,959
I think loving me,
making us a full circle

966
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:52,353
was the story
he was writing.

967
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:54,836
I mean, I guess it was the story
we were both writing.

968
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,569
I mean, I was trying
to get past my guilt.

969
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:58,620
He was... He was
trying to forgive God

970
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,732
for the loss of Karin.

971
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,325
But, y-you know,
ultimately, we learned that...

972
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:14,659
...life just
isn't always so tidy.

973
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:21,282
And God's plan isn't always
so easy to understand.

974
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:24,100
He's always been so good
with Harriet,

975
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:25,667
and I adore Ruby,

976
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,867
but we both started
working longer hours,

977
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,106
just avoiding coming
home.

978
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,892
And then, his sister got sick.
She lives in Philadelphia.

979
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:34,156
So he and Ruby went to
Philadelphia to be with her,

980
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,682
and... now she's better,

981
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:38,865
uh, but they're
still in Philadelphia.

982
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:42,599
And...

983
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,435
they are
not coming back.

984
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,825
I had no idea.

985
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,958
Yeah, I mean,
I was gonna tell you,

986
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,896
but, you know, hundreds of
thousands of people were dying.

987
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,900
I just didn't think my marriage
counted as a casualty.

988
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:05,263
And you were maybe
a little too proud to tell me?

989
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:07,254
Yeah, fine.

990
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,565
I was a little...
A little too proud.

991
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,525
You okay?

992
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,809
It's hard to say.

993
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:22,443
But...

994
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:25,006
it looks like
I'm moving to Boston.

995
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,514
So...

996
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:32,388

for new horizons.
