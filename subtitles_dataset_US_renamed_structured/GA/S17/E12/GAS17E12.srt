27
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:28,256
He told the staff to take time

I canceled the few elective

41
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:05,376
told the blood bank to be
on high alert,

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,772
and put five vents on standby
for incoming traumas.

43
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:12,301
- We'll have the tent outsidefor walk-ups.
- Mm-hmm.

Mnh. You think
that'll be enough for us?

00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:16,735

51
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:32,002
I... I just want to be doing
something I know how to do.

52
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,662
Well, you've done everything
you could to prepare.

53
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,311
Now, look, I'll come back
if you need me.

54
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,023
It may take me some time
to get here, but I-I'll make it.

55
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,346
Wait, back...
Back from where?

56
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm protesting, Bailey.

57
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:45,480
Something important
is happening out there,

58
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,463
and I'm
not gonna miss it...

59
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,353
These moments
save lives, too.

60
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,336
You go give 'em hell.

61
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm so grateful
that you came in today.

62
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,798
Not that I would ask a Black man
not to march.

63
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,408
No, but you can text me
eight times,

64
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:07,096
asking if I'm coming in, though.

65
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,503
Mnh-mnh!

66
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,722
That was my phone
that did that.

67
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,112
- Oh, okay.
- It's new.

68
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,461
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:14,463
No, I almost called in a sub,
honestly,

70
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,807
but we're barely hanging on
with COVID,

71
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:18,206
so I figured
they'll need me.

72
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,111
Speaking of which,
did you read my proposal

73
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,713
for setting up the free
COVID testing and treatment site

74
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:23,846
for low-income patients?

75
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,729
I mean,
Ortiz's connections...

76
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,085
I think we can make
a real impact.

77
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,721
You know we're barely keeping
the lights on as it is, baby.

78
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,525
But I will revisit it
when the revenues improve.

79
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,947
You want us to wait
till COVID's over

80
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,213
before we can open
a COVID site, Mom?

81
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:37,008
Come on. Okay?
Dr. Ortiz

82
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,323
and I put a lot of really good
time and effort into this.

83
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:40,573
She's got great ideas.

84
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,270
Just let me get through
this week, okay?

85
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,736
- I'm late for my meeting.
- Ah.

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,801
- Love you.
- This week.

87
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,190
Avery.
You got a second?

88
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:51,192
Hey, everything okay?

89
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,431
I've been better, mate.

90
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,439
I don't have much time.

91
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:03,628
It's all hands on deck
here.

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,152
Probably won't even have
a chance to shower

93
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:06,165
before I see you tonight,

94
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,790
but I just wanted to see
your face.

95
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,995
Well
this is it.

96
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,780
My exhausted,
driving-for-three-days face.

97
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:15,087
I feel like we chose
the worst time ever

98
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,392
for you to make
this drive.

99
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,394
Nah. The sooner I'm with you,
the better.

100
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,701
Well, what'd you think of the
apartment listing I sent you?

101
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,008
I haven't even looked at it yet.

102
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:24,183
Maggie.

103
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,185
It's just...
I have not been able to focus

104
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,753
on anything besides work
and the news and you driving.

105
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,668
I get it, baby.
I get it.

106
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:34,009
But as far as I can tell,

107
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,022
Seattle real estate is the
Hunger Games with kitchens.

108
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:37,892
So, if

109
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:38,806
I want this place,

110
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,112
I'm gonna need to make
an offer soon.

111
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,852
Okay, I'll look at it.
I promise.

112
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,439
Alright.

113
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,161
Next time we talk,
it'll be in person.

114
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,120
Be careful. Please.

115
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,690
Extra careful.
Always.

116
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:50,854
I love you.

117
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:52,182
Love you.

118
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,956
She's still sleeping
most of the time.

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,132
She's very weak.

120
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,298
But stable.

121
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:04,001
Have Schmitt do her
hyperbaric treatment today.

122
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,963
Do we think that
Schmitt's qualified?

123
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,315
He'll be fine. I'll put
the fear of God in him.

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,409
That almost sounds fun.

125
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:12,535
<i>Dr. Scott...</i>

126
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,525

- Yeah.

127
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,373
They're in the south parking lot
right now.

128
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,847
Thanks a million, Irene.
I'll be back when I can.

129
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,022
Alright, hold still.
Hold still.

130
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,545
Cops did this?

131
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,345
Neo-Nazis did this.

132
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,646
"Counter-protesters,"
I think they're called.

133
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,606
Came at my boy
with a billy club.

134
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,292
I jumped in between them
just in time.

135
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,486
Well, he got you good.
Must've been scary.

136
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,601
I wanted to drop a bomb
on the whole lot of them.

137
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,385
If I had one,
I would have.

138
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,060
Oh, man, this rage
I'm feeling?

139
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:40,521
That's... That's why we need
stricter gun laws.

140
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,219
Alright. Well, I can get you
some Valium for the shaking.

141
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,434
No, I'm good.

142
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:48,093
ER's filling up. I just...
I just want to get back to work.

143
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,388
Am I okay, Avery?

144
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,530
Almost.

145
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,263
Next time,
make sure you guys hang

146
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:54,708
- in the back of the crowd, yeah?
- Next time?

147
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,623
When they're 18,
they can protest all they want.

148
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:57,972
Right now, they're going
straight home.

149
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,167
Jackson,

150
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,980
Her name is Nell.
That's all I got.

151
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,156
She was hit with
a tear gas canister.

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,378
Shot! Not hit... shot!
At close range!

153
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,787
Oh, shrapnel
went everywhere.

154
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:15,120
- E-Easy.
- Oh.

155
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,599
- Easy.
- Keep it stable.

156
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,294
Trauma one's open.
Let's move.Okay.

157
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,080
- Ready?
- Yeah.

158
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:20,187

Excruciating pain

00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:57,977
So I think we need a CT angio
right away.

174
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,101
Let's prep to move.

175
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,774
- Okay, I'm gonnacome with you.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

176
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,540
Y-You're not taking this thing
out of me first?

177
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,110
We want to make sure
it didn't hit

178
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,823
any major blood vessels
in your neck.

179
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,694
Then we're gonna remove it
in the operating room.

180
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,435
We're gonna move as fast
as we can, alright?

181
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,290
- Alright.
- You ready for us to move you?

182
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,251
♪ Hey, hey, ho, ho

183
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,136
♪ Come on, girl, let's go

184
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,921
- ♪ Hey, hey, ho, ho ♪

185
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,096
- ♪ Come on
- ♪ Come on, girl

186
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,401
- That's right, let's go.
- ♪ Let's go

187
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,267
Okay, keep this on
for the next 12 hours,

188
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,014
then apply
the antibiotic ointment, okay?

189
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,276
Will this bandage hold?

190
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,907
I'm going back out.

191
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:28,561
I'll get you some extra Coban
to be safe, okay?

192
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,456
Hey.
Hey.

193
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,283
Got your page.

194
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,458
Yeah, someone's en route

195
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,199
with a rubber bullet injury
to the chest.

196
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,374
Should be here
any minute.

197
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,775
Ugh, glass bricks.

198
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,333
- You get that, Pierce?
- Huh? Yes, yeah.

199
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,439
Uh, just got
a lot going on today.

200
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:42,599
Winston is driving back
as we speak.

201
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,601
Yeah, you two
aren't wasting any time.

202
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:45,845
- I'm happy for you.
- Thanks.

203
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,908
We're just trying to work out
this living situation.

204
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,823
Oh, you're worried?

205
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,216
You're wondering if he prefers
using the bathroom

206
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,681
with the door wide open?

207
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,385
Or puts ketchup
on his eggs.

208
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:55,947
Who puts ketchup on
their eggs?

209
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,353
Over 54% of Americans, actually.

210
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,722
Okay, rig's here.
Let's go.

211
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,449
Okay,
we have Guy Houston, 22.

212
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,842
Took a rubber bullet to
the chest.

213
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,830
Defibrillated in the field
for V-fib.

214
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:13,689
I think "died" is the word
you're looking for.

215
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,541
Welcome back.
Let's get you inside.

216
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:18,072
I need a chest X-ray,
cardiac enzymes,

217
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:19,830
and let's get him on
a monitor.

218
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:28,294
We're heading into
the chamber.

219
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:31,767
Breathing oxygen...

220
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,501
feeling light...

221
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:38,524
as if you're, uh,
floating on a cloud.

222
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:41,166
But not... not like a cloud
in heaven or anything.

223
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,400
Just, um, floating.
Like...

224
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,338
just not dead, you know?

225
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,515
We're healing and recovering.

226
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,665
What are you doing here?

227
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:51,735
Uh, post-op surgical wound
infection.

228
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,603
My attending ordered
hyperbaric treatment

229
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,899
- to enhance healing.
- Well, we're next.

230
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,250
And we're also VIP,
so you can go now.

231
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,423
Schedule's packed today,
so they're doubling up.

232
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,868
Crap,
is that Meredith Grey?

233
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:04,571
Maybe.
But don't talk to her.

234
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,185
I'm under strict orders
from the Chief

235
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,689
to not cause Dr. Grey
any stress.

236
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,157
Of course, no problem.

237
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:14,095
Just, uh,
floating like...

238
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,494
Are you gonna make room
or not?

239
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,705
Haven't even finished
this supply run...

240
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,844
You're already coming in
for more.

241
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,854
Yeah, well,
it's just one of those years.

242
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,204
Wait, can I fix that?

243
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,438
Because it looks like
you lost a bar fight.

244
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:42,763
Thank you.

245
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,272
Wow. Okay.

246
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,447
It's not like there's
a deadly virus going around...

247
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:49,532
Spread by droplets.

248
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:50,993
Oh, sorry.

249
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:53,344
It's
the bloody tear gas, I swear.

250
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,337
How are your sons?

251
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,993
They're alright.

252
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,330
Irene came to pick them up,
despite their complaining.

253
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:01,102
They wanted to stay out?

254
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,981
Yeah, they want to be
a part of the change,

255
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,697
not just watch it
on a screen.

256
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,447
But you wouldn't let them?

257
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:08,207
After this? No way.

258
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:12,409
You think that's
a mistake?

259
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:15,457
No, I, uh...
I see both sides.

260
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,673
You know, protesting the
policein front of the police

261
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:21,454
is scary,
and so is doing nothing.

262
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,580
Guess I've just buried
too much family

263
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,739
to see anybody else's side
but my own.

264
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,111
Right.

265
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,659
<i>Captain
Emerson, call Radiology.</i>

266
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,508
<i>Captain Emerson, call Radiology.</i>

267
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,451
Yes.

268
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:39,800
Chad Anderson, 40s,

269
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,497
no past medical history,
according to him.

270
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,610
EMTs brought him.

271
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:44,457
He evidently collapsed
while jogging.

272
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,368
I've given him O2,
but he's still experiencing

273
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,861
shortness of breath,
as well as foot irritation.

274
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,767
Look, I'm fine, okay?

275
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,564
As I was trying to
explainto your nurse here...

276
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:54,740
Dr.Tseng.

277
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,564
She's a second-year
surgical resident.

278
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:57,885
- Yeah, but...
- Pull your mask up.

279
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,024
Yeah.

280
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,344
Okay, look, I was just trying to
tell her that it's...

281
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,532
I... Sometimes, I get
shortness of breath when I run.

282
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:04,626
It's not a big deal.

283
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,498
I mean, you know, my...
My inhaler's expired,

284
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,261
so you just, you know,

285
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,611
you put me on
a nebulizer treatment

286
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,602
and you write me a new
prescription for albuterol,

287
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,039
and there'll be one less guy
in the room.

288
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,087
Mm-hmm.

289
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:18,004
Dr. Tseng, has his oxygen
saturation been above 92?

290
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,595
Hovering around 88.

291
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,468
Mr. Anderson,
is it possible

292
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,243
that you've been exposed to
COVID-19?

293
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,638
No.
Uh, it's... That's a no.

294
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,543
Hm. Mask up.

295
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,805
Hospital policy.

296
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,152
Move him to an isolated room
and give him a full workup...

297
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:35,806
Chest X-ray, lower extremity
duplex, and a COVID test.

298
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,548
Page me with the results.

299
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:41,075
Okay, hey. Doc, look,
I'll take the workup, okay,

300
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,239
but I don't care what
your little test says

301
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:43,981
'cause I know that
it's not real.

302
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:45,070
What's not real?

303
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,333
COVID.

304
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,465
Do I look like
a sheep, alright?

305
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,095
I know it's a scam.

306
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,401
How's she doing?

307
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,830
Hopefully, it's confined to
just soft tissue damage.

308
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:59,555
Well, her clavicle
felt intact.

309
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,549
We were marching
peacefully.

310
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,440
You know, she
was marching peacefully.

311
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,927
Can you imagine firing
poison gas at this woman?

312
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,816
Still marching
at her age?

313
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,336
What was it like
out there today?

314
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,954
It was beautiful.

315
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,565
At first.

316
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,918
And then it was frightening
and then messy,

317
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:22,007
but it was still beautiful.

318
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,269
I mean, there were
young people

319
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,749
handing out water
and masks.

320
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,315
It was...
It was organized.

321
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,363
There was this...
this feeling in the air.

322
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,843
It's...

323
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:36,297
You have to put yourself
on the line to be part of it,

324
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,866
but good trouble
lights you up, you know?

325
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,234
Yeah, sure.

326
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,594
Oh, scans are up.

327
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,944
Ah. Okay.

328
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,686
Oh, well, no vascular
involvement, thank God.

329
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,209
See?
It tore through

330
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,754
- the trapezius muscle.
- Yeah.

331
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,322
Well, let's book an OR
and extract the canister.

332
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,582
Yeah.

333
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,718
Don't see
any pericardial fluid.

334
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:03,962
That's a good thing.

335
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:06,878
Okay, so was it a...
A heart attack?

336
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,532
Because my dad's
had two of those.

337
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:09,620
Kind of.

338
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,231
It's called
commotio cordis.

339
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,744
Basically, the rubber bullet
must've hit you

340
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,103
at the exact right moment

341
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,009
to interrupt
your heart's normal rhythm.

342
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,403
The same thing happens
with a heart attack.

343
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,401
Yeah, you were lucky
that EMTs were nearby.

344
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,491
Everything was so chill,
you know?

345
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,845
Then there was gas and...
And screaming

346
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,028
and people running
in all directions.

347
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:30,368
We couldn't even tell which way
the cops wanted us to go.

348
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,773
But I swear,
we didn't do anything wrong.

349
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah,
I'm sure you didn't.

350
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,734
Your X-ray and your echo
both look good,

351
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,562
but I do want to admit you
for observation and bloodwork

352
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,532
just to make sure
your heart's okay.

353
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,367
I-I, uh... I s... I should
probably call my mom.

354
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:47,048
Uh, I will be right back.

355
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,354
Keep him on telemetry

356
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,506
and do cardiac enzymes
every two hours.

357
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:53,595
Hey. What happened to
not speaking

358
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,470
until we see each other
in person?

359
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,493
The landlord called,

360
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:57,799
and he said
he wants to rent to a doctor,

361
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,119
but he has a few offers

362
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:00,845
and he needs to
make a decision today.

363
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,107
Did you look
at the listing?

364
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,412
I did.

365
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,023
I'm not a fan.

366
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,678
It has glass bricks.
And only two windows.

367
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,947
And glass bricks.

368
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:10,594
Um, okay, well,

369
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,644
I told him
I'm gonna take it.

370
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:16,840
Maggie, you know
I need a better option

371
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,558
than a hotel
or a backyard tent.

372
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:19,864
It's just for now.

373
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:21,711
You know, I just want to be
in the same city.

374
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,303
Hey, Maggie.

375
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:26,392
<i>And for the record, no judgment...</i>

376
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,480
- Maggie...
<i>- Do you like glass bricks?</i>

377
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,976
Maggie, I can't...
I can't talk now.

378
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,701
- I'm being pulled...
- I'm being pulled over.

379
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,805
Wait, what? You're being
pulled over by the...

380
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,313
By the police, yes.
I got to go.

381
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,619
No, no, no, no.
Winston, don't hang up.

382
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:36,924
Turn on your camera
if you can,

383
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,665
but do not hang up
the phone.

384
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,711
I will stay on the line
with you.

385
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,446
Is she mean?

386
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,075
Dr. Grey?

387
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,289
Excuse me?

388
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,293
Uh, sorry.
It's just what I heard.

389
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,577
I also heard that
she's the best.

390
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:05,318
But she got sick before
my first day,

391
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:07,219
so I never got a chance
to see it.

392
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:12,953
I intubated a COVID patient
on the fly the other day.

393
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,616
Never could've done that
a couple years ago.

394
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,532
And my Lembert sutures,
which she taught me,

395
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,970
they're...
They're getting better.

396
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:27,061
Every win I've had,
any time I do something right,

397
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:29,648
I hear her voice
in my head.

398
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,938
She's the most influential
teacher I've ever had.

399
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,679
Even when she's asleep.

400
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:40,524
And, yes,
she can be toughsometimes.

401
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,172
There's always a reason.

402
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:49,785
I really hope I get to
operate with her one day.

403
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,673
Yeah, me too.

404
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,592
Alright.

405
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:13,852
Music off, hat off,
hands on the wheel.

406
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,168
License and registration,
sir.

407
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,385
How you doing today,
Officer?

408
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,609
Oh, just takin' 'er easy.

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,167
Can you tell me why
you pulled me over?

410
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:31,909
I saw...
Speed limit said it's 45...

411
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,606
Set the cruise to 40.

412
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,477
Winston, are you there?

413
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,432
I can't hear anything.

414
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,581
I'm gonna need you
to turn off your phone, sir.

415
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,353
Oh, it's just
my fiancée.

416
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,572
She's up in Seattle.

417
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,928
Your phone, sir.

418
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,142
She, uh, she worries about me
on the long drive.

419
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,797
Can I leave it on?

420
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:55,581
Mr. Ndugu,
are you failing to comply?

421
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,431
Winston.

422
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,329
If... If... If you're still there,

423
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:02,959
just keep me on the line.

424
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,355
I'm reaching for my phone.

425
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:12,079
Winston?

426
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,383
Winston?

427
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,303
Oh, no, no.

428
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:29,907
Army Navy, please.

429
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,275
Pick-ups, Bokhee.

430
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,118
My mom mention getting an e-mail
from me at all?

431
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,962
I sense you want me to
say yes.

432
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,806
She probably hasn't
even opened it.

433
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,398
I don't know why
I haven't learned.

434
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,487
The only ideas that
get through to her are her own.

435
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:43,054
It's hard being
a problem-solver

436
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:45,012
when the problems
are so complex.

437
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,624
I could never do her job.

438
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,583
Yeah, well, it'd be easier if
she wouldn't ignore good advice

439
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,106
from people
trying to help her.

440
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,500
Wouldn't even bother me as much
if it was just me.

441
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,372
Alma Ortiz and I worked really
hard on a lot of good ideas

442
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,896
based on
her previous experience.

443
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,854
Well, listen,
give her time.

444
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,421
We're all feeling
next-level stress.

445
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,162
Something tells me that
after a week,

446
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:06,033
she'll be
a little more open.

447
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,123
We just pulled a hunk
of metal out of this woman,

448
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:12,705
and you're seriously
being super positive right now?

449
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,738
You know, you barely missed
getting hit yourself.

450
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:16,174
Yeah, it should have never
happened.

451
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:19,056
I'm just thankful that
the damage isn't worse.

452
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,313
What got me...
Well, you saw her.

453
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,737
She wasn't fazed.

454
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:26,690
She was... She was energized.
You know what I mean?

455
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,491
There's power in gathering
like that,

456
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,674
I mean, where the truth brings
so many people together.

457
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:34,627
I mean...

458
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,791
Well, you know.

459
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,764
Actually, no, I don't.

460
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,375
Honestly, I've never
been to a real protest.

461
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,338
I mean, I've protested
plenty of things...

462
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:48,424
I've boycotted businesses,
signed petitions.

463
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,775
Done surgeries
for free, given talks.

464
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,429
It seems like every time folks
took to the streets,

465
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,127
I always had
a reason not to.

466
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,868
I had to work,
I had to study.

467
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,698
I could always see how useful
money was to the cause,

468
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,308
you know,
so I guess I always felt

469
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,050
that writing a check was
a worthwhile substitute.

470
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:07,834
And, hell, maybe it is.

471
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,972
In this country, at least.

472
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:12,709
You think that's a cop-out?

473
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:15,059
I try not to judge
the way that anyone handles

474
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,235
the traumas that come
with living here.

475
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,758
And that includes you.

476
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,238
And your mother.

477
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,476
Clamp.

478
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,916
Hi, you've
reached Dr. Winston Ndugu.

479
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:29,464
Dr. Pierce! Just... J
ust... Come on.

480
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:30,944
Dr. Pierce!

481
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,380
He's in V-fib again!

482
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,836
Let's push a
6-milligram bolus of adenosine.

483
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,211
Oh, Ortiz! I need you to
keep calling this number.

484
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,617
It's my fiancé, Winston.

485
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,110
- If he picks up, you tell me.
-  He's still in V-tach.

486
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,540
If he doesn't,
just keep calling.

487
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,055
Just do not stop.

488
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,610
- Everything okay?
- He got pulled over.

489
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:45,227
I want the officer to know that
someone is checking in on him.

490
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:46,675
Mm.

491
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,242
Let's charge to 200!

492
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,579
Mask up, Mr. Anderson.

493
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:53,876
Mm. Sorry, I forgot.

494
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,313
The whole
"coro-no-virus."

495
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:56,187
Sir...

496
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,537
...I need you to
listen to me.

497
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:01,409
Your COVID test
came back positive.

498
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,297
Additionally, you have

499
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:06,227
ground glass opacities
in your lungs.

500
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,109
That's why
you're having trouble breathing.

501
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:12,116
And your toes aren't red
because you run without socks.

502
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,814
Y-You have what's being referred
to as "COVID-toe."

503
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:15,772
"COVID-toe"?

504
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:17,556
- Yes.
- Really?

505
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,732
That's the best you got?
COVID-toe?

506
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,473
Are you guys even trying?

507
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:24,476
This ultrasound of your leg
reveals a clot

508
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,903
that we need to treat
immediately, so...

509
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,436
Okay, well,
whose leg is that?

510
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,786
I'm sorry?

511
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,961
Well, see, I'm a...
I'm a runner.

512
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,137
We don't get blood clots.
But it's a...

513
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:34,527
That's a...
That's a nice try, though.

514
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,616
Mr. Anderson, please.Okay. Look.

515
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,147
You know what
I've figured out?

516
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,751
Huh?

517
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,318
I figured out that
this little cold

518
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:42,102
that y'all are
so terrified of...

519
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,670
Biggest moneymaker
since crypto-currency.

520
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,324
And speaking of, h-how
do you get your kickbacks?

521
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:47,586
I mean,
is it like a flat fee

522
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,979
from every patient
that you diagnose,

523
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,894
or is it like a...
A percentage deal, or...?

524
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,133
My m...

525
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,769
Um, I...

526
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,858
Be back in a moment.
I need to answer a page.

527
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:00,444
- Yeah, yeah.
- Take your time.

528
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,868
What?! What?!

529
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,914
Okay.

530
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:12,698
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

531
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,265
W-What?!

532
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,546
Stop.

533
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,740
Okay, let's try this.

534
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,777
Your blood oxygen is
dangerously low.

535
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,808
Your lungs
are getting worse.

536
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,254
And if untreated,
the clot in your leg

537
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,896
could travel to your lungs
and killyou.

538
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,072
We're seeing cases like
yoursall of the ti...

539
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:41,422
Sir, this is not
just a cold.

540
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:43,163
It's not asthma.

541
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:45,687
This won't magically
go away.

542
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,039
Sir, please,
let us admit you

543
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:50,867
so that we canstart you
on steroids...

544
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:52,999
...and... and put you
on blood thinners.

545
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,829
Look, because even if
you are a little bit wrong,

546
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:59,199
it could be fatal.

547
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:01,312
You know,
I'm still waiting on

548
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:03,638
that albuterol prescription,
Doc.

549
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:09,687
Thank you.

550
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:13,802
200 joules!

551
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:15,954
200. Stand clear.

552
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:19,373
Still V-fib.
Go again.

553
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:20,461
- Charge.
- Charge.

554
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,656
Clear.

555
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:25,336
Okay, he's back to
normal sinus rhythm.

556
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,735
So, what are you thinking?

557
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,594
I think the rubber bullet
bruised his heart.

558
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,213
His troponin levels
are elevated.

559
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,519
We gotta get him to
the CCU.

560
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,041
All this from
a rubber bullet?

561
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,436
It wasn't
a "rubber" bullet.

562
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,392
It's a metal bullet
encased in rubber

563
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:41,961
fired from a gun
at a human being.

564
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,529
They're not meant to be fired
close range or directly.

565
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,768
They can bejust as
dangerous. Still no answer.

566
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,013
- Damn it.
- V-fib again?!

567
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:52,102
He's unstable. He keeps
going in and out of sinus.

568
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,059
Charge.
Yep.

569
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:54,341
Charge.
Clear!

570
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,630
He's in V-fib storm.

571
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:00,458
The myocardial contusion
is causing

572
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,808
a closed loop of misfiring
in his heart.

573
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:04,941
It's not gonna stop until
we get him ablated.

574
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:08,031
Push 100 mg of lido,
give him an amiodarone bolus,

575
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:09,510
and get him up to
the IR suite.

576
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,773
- We'll meet you up there, okay?
- Okay.

577
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,123
Still no answer.

578
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:14,559
Alright.

579
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,995
- Page Richard Webber.
- Ready? Let's move.

580
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,393
Tell him to meet me in
the IR suite,

581
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,487
and tell him it's urgent.

582
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:25,798
Ever work in a warehouse?

583
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:27,245
Not that I recall.

584
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,832
My patient does.

585
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:30,287
Forklift injury.

586
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:31,917
They're
surprisingly common.

587
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:33,728
It's good to know.

588
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:36,538
Hey, uh...
Uh... uh...

589
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:37,657
You might want to up
his sedation.

590
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:39,106
Sedation, right.
Uh...

591
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,237
Quick, before he...

592
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,543
- Oh! Oh!
- Crap!

593
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,477
That's what
I was worried about.

594
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,722
Okay.

595
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:49,048
Come on. C...

596
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,074
Maggie.

597
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:52,494
What's wrong?
Okay.

598
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,694
Winston is on his way
back here from Boston.

599
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,523
- Mm-hmm.
- He is driving, he's on the road,

600
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:57,776
and we were on the phone.

601
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,260
We were...

602
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,596
And the police
pulled him over,

603
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,737
and I told him to
keep me on the line.

604
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,940
But the police
made him hang up,

605
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:08,903
and now I can't
get a hold of him.

606
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:11,073
It's been...

607
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:12,642
It's been 20 minutes,

608
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:14,002
and I don't know
where he is.

609
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,229
And I have a patient who could
go into V-fib at any second,

610
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:17,927
so I have to get in there
and do an ablation.

611
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:20,017
But this is how it happens,
right? Just like this?

612
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,891
So, I-I-I-I need somebody
to go and find him now. Look.

613
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:24,633
Right now.
Alright, Maggie.

614
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:26,679
Alright. Okay?

615
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:29,516
What you should do now
is take care of your patient.

616
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
What if he tries to call
me and I don't pick up? - No.

617
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,334
- Or what if he doesn'tcall...
- Yeah.

618
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:34,335
...and the police
just take him... take him?

619
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,087
Look,
just give me your phone.

620
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,663
I'll give it
some more time.

621
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:40,485
If there's still no word,
I will get into my car,

622
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,399
and I will look for him
myself.

623
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,401
- Give me your phone.
- Okay.

624
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,985
Yeah?

625
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,400
Mm-hmm.

626
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:49,945
- Okay.
- Mm.

627
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:54,305
Oh, my God!

628
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:55,916
Oh, God, his intestines
are popping out!

629
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
Okay, okay, okay.
Let me think.

630
00:24:57,524 --> 00:24:59,313
What do we do?
What do we do?

631
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,055
I don't know what to do.

632
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:02,484
<i>Schmitt.
This isn't anyone's fault.</i>

633
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,741
This isn't
anyone's fault.

634
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,272
The patient nearly
extubated himself

635
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,404
- and caused an evisceration...
- and caused an evisceration.

636
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,146
It is
a horrible complication...

637
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,554
But it can be fixed.

638
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,633
What is the first step?
What is the first step?

639
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:12,764
Chee, he dehisced.

640
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:14,006
I need you to hold down
the patient

641
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,616
so he doesn't extubate
himself.

642
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,563
Paralyze him with cis
and push more Versed.

643
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,392
And then, I need you
to get on the intercom.

644
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:21,514
And say what?

645
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,126
Tell them to depressurize
the chamber

646
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,467
and call for an OR now.

647
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:27,874
No... No attending?

648
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,639
We are stuck in this chamber
until it depressurizes,

649
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:33,577
so we are on our own,
but we do not panic.

650
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:36,590
Now, we need to put him under,
so push more meds.

651
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:40,201
Now!

652
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:44,496
Okay.

653
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,475
There it is.

654
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,322
We're ready
for the needle.

655
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,542
He's stable.

656
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:55,631
Go. Do your call.

657
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:57,286
We'll page you
if he goes into V-fib.

658
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,085
- Are you sure?
- Maggie, go.

659
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,038
Winston?

660
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:09,546
Hey.
Oh, my God.

661
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,678
Are you okay?
Where are you?

662
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:11,724
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

663
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:12,960
I... They le...
They let me go.

664
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,224
Why did it take them so long
to let you go?

665
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:18,226
Um, because they... they had me
get out of the car

666
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,358
and take my mask off.

667
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:21,428
And, uh...

668
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,138
And then, uh,
they had me do a DUI test.

669
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:25,836
And then, they checked
the trunk.

670
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,108
And then,
they checked the car.

671
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,024
You know, and then I had to
unpack all my stuff,

672
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:33,419
and, uh, the police dog
sniffed it over. What?

673
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:36,659
And then the dog sniffed me,
and they let me go.

674
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,632
So, I'm g... I'm good.
Tha... That's what took so long.

675
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:40,744
W-W-W-Why did the...
I mean, I...

676
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:42,747
Were you, like,
swerving on the road?

677
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,664
No, no, no.
Uh, my... my bike rack

678
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:48,382
was obscuring
my license plate, and...

679
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:49,735
And then, they saw me.

680
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,564
So, it just turned into

681
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:53,088
one of those things,
I guess.

682
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:54,526
They can't do that.
They...

683
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,832
Maggie, I'm a little bit
shaken up right now.

684
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,357
I don't know if I'm good to
drive yet.

685
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,938
I don't know if I'm...
I don't think I'm...

686
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:04,485
♪ Starting to see me
in a new light ♪

687
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,052
Uh, Maggie, I'm not good.

688
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,271
Okay.

689
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,858
I'm... I'm not okay yet,
you know?

690
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,004
Uh...

691
