Aired on:

25
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,315
Uh, let's start
with regional updates.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,696
Uh, Hunt?

27
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:31,486
Shouldn't we start with
an update on Meredith Grey?

28
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,683
Yeah. I mean,
has her I. S. improved?

29
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:35,269
Yeah. Is she on
a proning schedule?

30
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,272
People, people.
I know we're all concerned,

31
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:39,191
but Meredith
is getting excellent care

32
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,569
from Altman and DeLuca.

33
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,214
She's stable and she's resting.

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,925
In the meantime,
we have a hospital

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,678
full of patients who need us.

36
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:46,799
Hunt?

37
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:51,346
Yesterday Seattle reported
345 more cases, 29 deaths.

38
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,974
Test positivity rate
has increased to 4.7%,

39
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,987
so we should prepare
for more patients.

40
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,030
COVID ICU?

41
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,760
Beds are at 68% capacity.

42
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:00,305
We'll likely need more
by the end of the month.

43
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:03,434
53 of the 72 ventilators
are currently in use.

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,562
Are there any cases
that warrant discussion?

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,636
Hi. Hello.

46
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,972
<i>- I've got one. Me.</i>
- K‐Koracick? How did you...

47
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:12,216
<i>I‐I've got connections.
I'm emeritus chief of chiefs.</i>

48
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,135
That is not a thing.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,152
As I'm sure Hunt
gleefully told you,

50
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,698
I tested positive for COVID.

51
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,534
But I think
the test was a dud.

52
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:20,204
Breathing's normal,
good heart rate,

53
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:21,539
singing voice unaffected...

54
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,034
That does not change
the rules.

55
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,721
A negative COVID test
or a 14‐day quarantine.

56
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,237
You're not even close.
Then send me a new test.

57
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,487
And can you adjust
my camera angle?

58
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:33,065
As lovely as
the ceiling is, I...

59
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:46,276
Did you know that there are
murder hornets now?

60
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,971
- What?
- Yeah.

61
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,916
As if the COVID outbreak
right after my husband dumped me

62
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,669
wasn't bad enough.

63
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:56,278
I'm gonna go home, crawl into
bed before my next shift.

64
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,426
Yeah, I'm done, too. Look,
if you don't want to be alone,

65
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,618
you can come hang out
at my place.

66
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:02,162
Um, let me think about the
last time I went to your place

67
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,502
and... no.

68
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:07,339
At least I don't have a resident
living on my couch, okay?

69
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,487
I got fancy beer
and a negative COVID test.

70
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,136
I guess also April switched
Harriett's days on me, but...

71
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,133
Oh, so you're lonely.

72
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,019
Will you just come over,
alright?

73
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:19,273
We can watch TV and, I don't
know, order pizza. Or sushi.

74
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:20,651
Start over.

75
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,980
Friendship reboot.

76
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,362
We're getting both
and you're paying.

77
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,531
- Fine.
- And no Kenny G!

78
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:31,485
Hey, buddy.

79
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,479
Yeah.

80
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,956
Just me and you.

81
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,964
This is called a "C" chord.

82
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:42,573
I'll teach you one day.

83
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,704
Why can't I find gauze
in a house

84
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,589
with so many surgeons
living in it?

85
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,341
Uh, who's bleeding this time?

86
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,052
Bailey lost a tooth.

87
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:51,681
The one that's been loose
for two weeks?

88
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,974
That's supposed to happen.

89
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,644
Well, not when your mom
is in the hospital with COVID.

90
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,340
Mer's gonna get better.

91
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:58,927
You don't know
that's true.

92
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,527
You don't know that it's not.

93
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:02,513
Alright, look, um,

94
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,392
let's... let's look at
the bright side of things, okay?

95
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,503
We get to introduce Bailey
to the Tooth Fairy.

96
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,548
Kids love the Tooth Fairy.

97
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,534
I'll, uh... I'll check on him.

98
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,579
The bright side?

99
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:21,105
Dr. Kuo at the Catherine Fox
Medical Center in Manhattan

100
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,526
is doing a trial with
monoclonal antibodies for COVID.

101
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:26,543
She's got room for two more patients,
but we got to jump on it.

102
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,574
I read that study.
Didn't three patients die?

103
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,008
Well, there's a strong chance
that they got the drug too late.

104
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,968
Dr. Webber,
her lungs are flooded,

105
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,096
a‐and she's sleeping
almost around the clock.

106
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,895
Richard, I would never
give this recommendation

107
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,237
if I didn't think that the good
outweighed the bad.

108
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:43,721
Thank you.
I'll... I'll think about it.

109
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,308
Okay.

110
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,004
Dr. Webber...

111
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:49,478
I said I'd think about it.

112
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,761
Mom, I can't come see you.

113
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,115
Because of the pandemic,
remember?

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,472
There's a bad virus
and no vaccine yet.

115
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,808
But I can call you later,
though, okay?

116
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:08,597
I... Mnh.

117
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,331
How you feeling, Chief?

118
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,189
I moved my parents here
from across the country

119
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,964
into an assisted‐living facility
just in time to never see them.

120
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:20,277
I meant your ankle.
But sorry to hear that.

121
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:21,635
It's fine.
Thank you.

122
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,902
Hello?
Can someone help me?

123
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,792
Hi. I'm Dr. Kim.

124
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,674
Where are you from?

125
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,481
Orthopedics. And it looks like
you just have a cut here,

126
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,024
so let's find you
another doctor

127
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:37,683
who can help
take care of this, okay?

128
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,058
Orthopedics?

129
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,703
You know that's not
what she was asking.

130
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,887
- I know.
- It doesn't bother you?

131
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,667
Her assuming
you're not from here?

132
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,659
Happens to all of us
at some point, right?

133
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:56,037
- What do we have?
- Dave Oyadomari, 37,

134
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,462
head lac and right shoulder pain

135
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,086
after falling off
of a step ladder.

136
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,704
He also complains of abdominal
pain, nausea, and vomiting

137
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:02,938
with a 102 fever.

138
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,266
He was recently treated here
by Dr. Hunt for appendicitis

139
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:07,394
then sent home
on oral antibiotics.

140
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,848
Yeah. I'll be okay.

141
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,517
Can... Can you just give me
some more antibiotics

142
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,102
and... and a sling or something?

143
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,729
<i>You were in so much pain
that you fell off a ladder.</i>

144
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:14,730
I had to call an ambulance!

145
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:15,907
Meet my wife, Tammi.

146
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,702
Okay. We'll check him out,
Tammi.

147
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:20,071
Uh, he's tachycardic
and slightly hypotensive.

148
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:21,365
Kim. Here.

149
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,625
Let's get him to trauma one
and do a COVID test,

150
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:27,701
STAT X‐rays, labs,
and a FAST exam.

151
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,157
Got it.

152
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,758
You trying to will her
into joining the trial?

153
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,430
No.

154
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,159
I'm hoping she suddenly
gets better and doesn't need it.

155
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:03,899
<i>Excuse me!</i>

156
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,391
<i>Hello?!</i>

157
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:21,805
Mer?

158
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:23,625
George?!

159
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,094
What are you doing here?

160
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:48,666
Did you ask the humans
to take you to their leader?

161
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,939
Because it's no longer me.

162
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,856
It's Dr. Helm. I'm here
to do your COVID test.

163
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,532
No, you're here to deliver it.

164
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:55,443
I don't allow residents
in my house or up my nose.

165
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:58,227
Uh, just put it down.
Right here.

166
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,914
Back up.

167
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,212
Back, back, back, back, back,
back, back, back, back, back.

168
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,047
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

169
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,993
Did you know
that I had COVID?

170
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,996
It was mild, but scary.

171
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,321
I learned how to make sourdough.

172
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,398
I couldn't taste it or smell it,
but the texture seemed right.

173
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:29,555
I also, uh, binged a docuseries
about house...

174
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,312
You can stop your "What I did
over COVID vacation" report.

175
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:33,648
I have no interest
in baking, bingeing,

176
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,649
or doing anything you did
or will ever do or...

177
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,050
What?

178
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,727
Are you plotting
something... evil?

179
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,078
No. I'm stopping
the pandemic.

180
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,977
<i>Chopped chicken salad
with homemade sweet pickles</i>

181
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,546
<i>on toasted bread.</i>

182
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,329
That's a Nana Ante special
right there.

183
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,024
<i>Ooh! Jealous!</i>

184
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,492
<i>I had stale cashews.</i>

185
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,321
<i>Well, mine's nothing compared
to hers, but it's not bad.</i>

186
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,712
<i>And I just can't wait
for you two to meet.</i>

187
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:10,963
I hope to, someday.

188
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,289
<i>Tonight too soon?
It's her birthday.</i>

189
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:16,385
And, uh, we're doing a...
a virtual dinner.

190
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:20,247
Or if it's too soon, no rush.

191
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,930
<i>No, no, I just, uh...</i>

192
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:24,687
<i>It's Meredith.</i>

193
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:27,381
<i>I‐I know there's nothing
I can do, but...</i>

194
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:29,954
Anything I do
that isn't trying to help

195
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,748
just feels selfish and wrong.

196
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,602
<i>Joy is in short supply
these days.</i>

197
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:36,376
<i>Especially our joy.</i>

198
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:37,754
It sure as hell is.

199
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,703
<i>That's why I'm grabbing it
when I can.</i>

200
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,331
<i>You know, it might be
a text from you.</i>

201
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,259
<i>It might be the fancy pencils</i>

202
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:44,961
<i>I bought for
my crossword puzzles.</i>

203
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,276
<i>It might be just
taking a few minutes</i>

204
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,549
to sit outside with
my chicken‐salad sandwich

205
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:51,595
and look at the daffodils.

206
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,354
I don't mean
to tell you how to be.

207
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,356
Uh... are you mad?

208
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,774
- No, no.
<i>- Ignore me. Ignore me.</i>

209
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:01,978
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.
I'm... a little hurt maybe.

210
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,613
You got fancy pencils
and you didn't tell me?

211
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,324
Wait. Are you
a pencil nerd, too?

212
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:11,220
Oh, I special ordered a vintage
pencil sharpener from Paris.

213
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:13,730
Oh, oh.
That's my resident.

214
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:15,362
And... joy's over.

215
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,655
Until dinner tonight.

216
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,200
Until dinner tonight.

217
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,070
My great‐grandpa
was an accountant,

218
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,240
but no one would hire him
after he came back from camp.

219
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:29,861
So he got a job
as a line cook in a diner

220
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,845
and eventually started Toyo.

221
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,790
<i>- Where was he interned?</i>
- Tule Lake.

222
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,860
<i>My great‐grandparents
were sent to Jerome.</i>

223
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,398
<i>I'm Gosei on my mom's side.</i>

224
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:39,732
Scans up yet?

225
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:41,447
Yep, just came up.

226
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,315
Dr. Hunt, I read

227
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,245
that you initially
diagnosed appendicitis,

228
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,032
but these scans show
pelvic free fluid

229
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:49,666
and a paracolonic abscess.

230
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,044
I think he might have
right‐sided diverticulitis.

231
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,525
Yep.

232
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,487
And it looks like
it's perforated.

233
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,416
Plus, his X‐rays show
a broken collarbone.

234
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,221
Okay, book an OR,
and I'll meet you up there.

235
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,785
We need to get him up there
right now.

236
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,992
Really?
We... We as in me?

237
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,783
Yeah, it's your diagnosis.

238
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,161
Good catch, Tseng.

239
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:13,850
Congratulations.

240
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,270
You just ordered Nathan Ramos
a pregnancy test.

241
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,523
What? How?!

242
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,556
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,611
Hey.

244
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,517
You already said that.

245
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,611
<i>Portable X‐ray
to the third floor.</i>

246
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,033
<i>Portable X‐ray
to the third floor.</i>

247
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:35,470
Ooh! He cute.

248
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:37,705
- No one asked you.
- Okay.

249
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,083
Wait. No, no, no. Wait.
She kicked you out of bed,

250
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,713
- so you were, like, what, naked?
- I'm naked. Naked.

251
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,690
I was naked in bed with
my boyfriend, and she just...

252
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,674
and it wasn't
just one time either.

253
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,088
I mean, it kind of says
less about him than her.

254
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:51,590
Really, though?
Does it?

255
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,095
Yeah. Mer's like
a force of nature.

256
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,921
Yeah. That's right.

257
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,563
She's a force of nature.
She, um...

258
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,752
She's gonna beat this thing.
Right?

259
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,658
Right.

260
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,345
Right. Yeah.

261
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:20,357
Derek said
the sand isn't real.

262
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,569
Yeah, no.
Neither is the ocean.

263
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,697
It is nice, though.

264
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,158
I wouldn't want to leave either.

265
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:29,845
The beach?

266
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,463
Your kids.

267
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,572
Got great kids.

268
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,008
They're the best.
You didn't meet them.

269
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,431
I check in sometimes.

270
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,345
How did you get older?

271
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,158
Sand isn't real,
the ocean isn't real.

272
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,871
The body...
it's not real.

273
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:55,267
Maybe it's just more peaceful
for you to imagine me older?

274
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,869
You sound like a fortune cookie.

275
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,103
Do I choose?

276
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:14,554
Do I get to decide
if I go back?

277
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:17,509
I don't know.
I didn't.

278
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:23,416
I would have stayed
if I could have.

279
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,235
It's different
for everyone, though.

280
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,353
She's still asleep?

281
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:40,980
She needs her rest.

282
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,207
You want to wake her
and ask her about the trial?

283
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,409
- I tried.
- How hard?

284
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,862
She needs her rest, Bailey.

285
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,843
If you think I'm struggling
with the decision,

286
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,722
how do you think she's gonna do?

287
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,803
You want to talk
pros and cons?

288
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,845
We don't know anything
about the virus,

289
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,474
so we don't know anything
about the treatment,

290
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,478
so we don't know any of the pros
or any of the cons.

291
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,338
Let's just see
if the proning helps.

292
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:21,002
<i>The boy refused
to wear anything with buttons.</i>

293
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,028
<i>Collared shirts, slacks,
even jeans.</i>

294
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,462
Look.
Buttons confine, okay?

295
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,259
Now, elastic waistbands
give you freedom.

296
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,494
<i>You better not be wearing
elastic waistbands</i>

297
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,627
when you take Maggie out.

298
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,130
I promise you he doesn't.

299
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,338
<i>Oh, is this your brother?</i>

300
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:37,590
<i>He said he had to work.</i>

301
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:38,759
<i>Happy Birthday, Momma!</i>

302
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,011
<i>Thanks, baby.</i>

303
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,351
<i>We're actually
in the middle of dinner.</i>

304
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,158
<i>Winston, I invited your dad.</i>

305
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,631
<i>And you have to get along
because it's my birthday.</i>

306
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,134
<i>So, who is this young lady?</i>

307
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,783
Um, I'm Maggie Pierce.
I'm a friend of Winston's.

308
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,088
<i>Friend? Ha.</i>

309
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,798
<i>Maggie's a genius doctor
like Winston.</i>

310
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,259
<i>She used to be his teacher.</i>

311
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,314
<i>Winston? A genius?</i>

312
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,689
Oh, stop playin'.

313
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,830
<i>You know that boy
almost failed sixth grade.</i>

314
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,416
<i>Such a pain.</i>

315
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,064
<i>Maybe I wouldn't have
missed so much class</i>

316
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:08,630
<i>if I wasn't helping Mom while
you gambled away our savings.</i>

317
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,274
<i>- Winston!</i>
- Sorry, Nana. No disrespect.

318
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,862
<i>Listen, man, I never pretended
to be a perfect man.</i>

319
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,760
<i>But I love you,
and I love my momma.</i>

320
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:23,111
<i>So, please, for her sake,
let's try to be civil.</i>

321
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,405
<i>Civil, huh?</i>

322
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,024
Okay.

323
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:33,038
<i>Happy birthday, Nana.
I love you.</i>

324
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,042
Uh...

325
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,088
So, is there cake?

326
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:46,455
Why are you up so early?

327
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,658
Front desk.
I got some breakfast delivered.

328
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:49,972
Oh, you know what?
If I was hungry,

329
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,598
I would have
just eaten the cold pizza.

330
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,697
Who said I got you any?

331
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:56,010
Can't believe I fell asleep.

332
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,729
Never should've started
a movie with two sequels.

333
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,148
Prequels.
They were prequels.

334
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,860
And I said that,
but you called me a wuss.

335
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,321
Why is your couch

336
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:05,721
more comfortable
than my bed?

337
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,416
Well, you're welcome to it
whenever you want.

338
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:13,650
Thank you
for the friendship reboot.

339
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,944
It almost made up for the last
time that I woke up here.

340
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,519
Tried to rip the Band‐Aid off
too soon.

341
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,812
It's behind us.
We're good.

342
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:21,775
Uh, but you can take
the pizza with you.

343
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,229
I'll grab it for you.

344
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:26,343
Wait.

345
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,251
Mnh, mnh, mnh.

346
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,041
I'm ripping off the Band‐Aid.

347
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:48,111
It's just a basic algorithm that
simulates the spread of COVID.

348
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:51,860
Here's what it would look like
if everyone social‐distanced.

349
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:58,891
Here... if everyone
wore face masks.

350
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,703
It's just a little
stochastic S‐I‐R model

351
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,219
that allows for
multivariable inputs...

352
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:09,156
w‐which I built by converting
a "Zombie Apocalypse" game.

353
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,538
I love that game!
How does yours end?

354
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:12,791
I‐I don't know yet.

355
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:15,055
Same. I never got past
level eight, so...

356
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,683
Yeah, Helm,
I appreciate your interest,

357
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,353
but, uh, no one's gonna know
my test is negative

358
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,021
if it never leaves
my porch, hmm?

359
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,816
Show's over.

360
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,656
Bye‐ee!

361
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,073
I was devastated
when you died.

362
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,963
You were all cracking up
at my funeral.

363
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,783
Well, we were...

364
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:37,898
No. What?

365
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,237
What? No.

366
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:43,143
It... That made me happy.

367
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,869
I was devastated.

368
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:51,338
And then
I was okay.

369
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,362
And even with Derek...

370
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,916
eventually you go on.

371
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,979
And the kids would go on.

372
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,713
They would, but...

373
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:07,229
I think maybe with them
it's different.

374
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:09,189
My mom didn't go on.

375
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:10,608
No?

376
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,198
Not really,
not like she used to.

377
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:16,385
Some grief is...

378
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:19,734
is heavier than other grief.

379
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:21,307
Sometimes it moves through you,

380
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,612
and sometimes it...
it just gets stuck.

381
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,815
And you carry it.
Like my mom.

382
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,108
My mom carries it.

383
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,752
Sometimes I try
to shake it out of her.

384
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,648
What?!

385
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,181
Like, you know...

386
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,809
Like you haunt her?

387
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:42,734
Well, I mean, if you want
to call it that, I...

388
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:48,866
I just want her to...
let it go.

389
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:50,596
I want her to know I'm still me

390
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:53,924
even though she can't touch me
and she can't see me,

391
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,916
but I am still me.

392
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,057
It's not the same.

393
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,377
No, I know.

394
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,146
You know, her sats were steady,

395
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,524
but now they're
just getting worse.

396
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,417
I made some calls,
and there's another spot open

397
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,753
in Dr. Kuo's trial,
but we have to act fast.

398
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:19,883
Is there another spot
because another patient died?

399
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:25,830
Have you seen the opacities
in her lungs?

400
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:27,329
Dr. Webber,
at this point,

401
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,980
you can either hope
that she wakes up again

402
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:32,244
or you can make the decisions
that she chose you to make!

403
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,165
I beg your pardon?

404
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:38,007
The choice is between doing
nothing and doing something.

405
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,221
Do something.

406
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,331
- You had to leave him open?
- Yes.

407
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:55,502
Once we got in,
his colon was a mess.

408
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,534
So we had to bring
up an ileostomy

409
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,120
and place an ABTHERA
for the swelling.

410
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:01,355
His clavicle's non‐displaced.

411
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,792
Fracture should
heal quite nicely.

412
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,557
- How soon?
- Till he can work again?

413
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:05,767
Maybe a month.

414
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:07,307
Tseng,
let's diurese him overnight

415
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,103
and let's put him on the
stand‐by list for the OR

416
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,276
in case we need to
do a washout tomorrow.

417
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,033
You did well today.

418
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:18,690
Can I ask you something?

419
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,818
Am I literally the only
person that can answer it?

420
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,479
Kind of.

421
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,533
Our patient's Asian‐American.

422
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,151
So right‐side diverticulitis
was a greater possibility.

423
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,768
But Dr. Hunt didn't scan
him when he first came in.

424
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,666
So, what's your question?

425
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,463
I think he should know so he
doesn't make this mistake again.

426
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,120
But I don't know how
to talk to him about it.

427
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,206
You don't know how to accuse
your attending of being a racist?

428
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,612
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, that's what he's gonna hear.

429
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,737
So your advice is...
do nothing?

430
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,167
You're a resident.
He's an attending.

431
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:52,347
My advice to you is,
if you're gonna have a conversation

432
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,463
with him,
at least know what to expect.

433
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:04,002
Hello! Dr. Koracick?

434
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,449
- No test kit?
- They wouldn't give me another one

435
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,826
because you keep
testing positive.

436
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,705
But I got to level nine
on "Zombie Apocalypse."

437
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,612
I didn't stop the virus,
but it's a start.

438
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,221
Oh, yeah, I‐I stopped that.

439
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:23,516
You found a cure?
Or a vaccine?

440
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:27,557
Wait. Did you reach
herd immunity?

441
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,518
Tell me.

442
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:31,075
I blew up the world.

443
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,355
You killed everyone?

444
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,233
Oh, we're all gonna
die anyway.

445
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:35,924
Well, yeah,
eventually.

446
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,520
Well, if by "eventually" you mean
before the year's out, then, yeah.

447
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,807
I figured
I'd cut to the chase.

448
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,635
That was not a bridge.

449
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,385
That was... What's
bigger than a bridge?

450
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,393
Mm, whatever that was,
I guess.

451
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,698
Okay. But we can't do it again.

452
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:01,300
- No?
- No. Definitely not.

453
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:02,816
Because then...
then we're a thing.

454
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:03,934
We're definitely not a thing.

455
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,130
Yeah, definitely not a thing.

456
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:06,073
- Agreed.
- Not a thing.

457
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,307
- It's just... However...
- Yeah?

458
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:11,228
If we were
to not get dressed

459
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,232
between the first
and the... goes after...

460
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,777
- Yep. Yeah, mm‐hmm.
- You know what I'm saying?

461
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,394
Then it's all really
just one experience.

462
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:19,637
It's just one experience.

463
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,257
- So it's not a thing. It's just...
- It's one whole experience.

464
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,916
So... he just bailed?

465
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:30,937
Yeah. I knew that he
had problems with his dad,

466
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:33,374
but I did not know
they were that bad.

467
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:34,961
Couldn't even be in a
virtual room with him.

468
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,515
And I haven't heard
from him since.

469
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,749
You seem exceedingly
calm about that.

470
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,918
You know,
I'm... I'm paying it forward.

471
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,671
Or... backward.

472
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,640
When we first
reconnected in L. A.,

473
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,311
I told him that I needed some time,
and he totally heard me.

474
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:52,226
Plus, our sister's in the
hospital with COVID alone.

475
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,097
It really puts things
in perspective.

476
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:58,976
I hate that we
can't be with her.

477
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,618
Me too.

478
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:06,710
Is that whistling?

479
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,587
That's Link.

480
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:11,984
He is a one‐man pep rally.

481
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,668
And I hate that, too.

482
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,827
Oh! Dr. Altman.

483
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,554
Bad time?

484
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:23,320
This virus is like a‐a
drunk uncle at a wedding.

485
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:25,024
Y‐You've got no idea
what it's gonna do

486
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,077
or when it's gonna turn on you.

487
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,913
I am reading everything
on COVID

488
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:30,125
because every 24 hours
there's something new.

489
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,118
And I have to keep up
because there could be one drug,

490
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,663
one procedure...
it could help.

491
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,227
It could help everyone.
It could help Meredith Grey.

492
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:37,577
So, yes,
it's a... it's a... it's a bad time.

493
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,395
What do you need?

494
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,788
Um, I was gonna tell you

495
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:45,875
that Dr. Koracick is
in a really dark place

496
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,878
and seems like he
could use a friend.

497
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:51,859
But, um,
Dr. Grey is kinda my whole world, so...

498
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:54,163
Never mind.
Proceed.

499
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,851
Dave's abdominal
swelling is coming down,

500
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:03,593
so we should be able to
close him in just a few days.

501
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,593
<i>Oh, that's great news.
Thank you.</i>

502
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,809
Yeah. Just doing my job.
How are things there?

503
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,706
<i>Oh, hanging on by a thread.</i>

504
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,395
<i>Dave's the one who
keeps this place running.</i>

505
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,988
Well,
we are doing everything we can here

506
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:13,955
to get him back to you, okay?

507
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,165
<i>Can I see him one more time?</i>

508
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,244
Of course.

509
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,913
<i>Rest up and come home soon,
okay?</i>

510
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,158
<i>I wish I could be
there. I love you.</i>

511
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:23,901
It's awful that
she can't visit.

512
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:25,791
It's awful this happened
in the first place.

513
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,182
Tseng, you need to step out.

514
00:24:31,573 --> 00:24:33,283
Now.

515
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:41,644
You don't have to
be so hard on her.

516
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,438
She's very attached
to this patient.

517
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,024
She's upset that
a misdiagnosis

518
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,527
cost this patient the next
four weeks of his livelihood.

519
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,907
Me too. Sometimes you have to
weigh the risks and make a decision.

520
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,201
Right‐sided diverticulitis
is extremely rare.

521
00:24:52,286 --> 00:24:54,579
But not as rare for Dave.
It's 10 times more likely

522
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,760
in patients of Asian
descent than white patients.

523
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:59,595
Which you clearly didn't know
or didn't take into consideration.

524
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,916
But either way it's on you,

525
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,533
'cause all this could've been
avoided with a simple scan.

526
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,126
You're just getting
here?

527
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,193
Is that a problem?

528
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,893
No. Just didn't see
you when I got up.

529
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,730
I figured you came in early.

530
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,900
I was exercising.

531
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:29,783
Morning.

532
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,190
Oh, my God!
You're back together.

533
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,580
- Kind of.
- Ugh!

534
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:36,460
Taryn said the Netherlands

535
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:39,404
suggested people find
a designated sex partner

536
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,549
for the pandemic.

537
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:42,143
You're having sex
with Nico

538
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:44,230
because the Dutch
government recommends it?

539
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:46,984
Their country ranks very high
on the World Happiness Index.

540
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,002
He lied, dumped you.

541
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,208
- He barely gives you the time of day.
- Okay, stop judging.

542
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:53,229
It's wartime,
but I still have needs.

543
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:55,899
It's not like I'm just
gonna find someone new.

544
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:58,158
So you're with your
emotionally unavailable ex?

545
00:25:58,243 --> 00:25:59,690
Wartime!

546
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:05,080
Ah, the sun is out,
and Scout's down.

547
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:10,307
And everyone else is watching
a PBS show about penguins.

548
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:13,532
Meredith's not improving. Uh,
they can't wake her.

549
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,526
Well,
she's getting her rest. It's good.

550
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:18,127
No, it is not good.
None of this is good, okay?

551
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,381
Do you not see that?
I am terrified for Meredith.

552
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:23,924
I am sad. I am enraged
that this is happening.

553
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,385
So, please,
stop dismissing me

554
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,048
with your bright sides
and your pep talks, okay?

555
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,744
Let me have my fear and my grief

556
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:33,291
and my anger.

557
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:37,421
Because if I don't,
if I keep shoving it down,

558
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,854
you will have a very hard time

559
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,385
finding the bright side
to the consequences.

560
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,037
What are you doing?

561
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:09,004
I'm making some
space for us to sit

562
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:13,509

all your feelings.

do you still... dance it out?

570
00:27:55,027 --> 00:27:59,902
No, not so much anymore,
not since Cristina left.

571
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,944
Cristina didn't die.

572
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,527
I know.

00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:08,988
That's what I miss
about being alive.

574

Dancing till you drop.

Laughing till you cry.

Food. Textures.

They're worried about you.

I'm trying to be

but I'll admit...
I'm struggling.

591

592
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,121
and not knowing what to do.

593
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,957

595
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,664
So many choices.

596
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:20,965
So many ways to live a life.

I live with Jo Wilson now.

617
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,910
But she, uh...

618
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,300
has not been sleeping at home.

619
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,920
I want to invite you over.

620
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:48,122
But I guess we have not
been great to each other.

621
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:51,715
And I don't know
what's really changed.

622
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,090
Levi.

623
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:57,605
There's a worldwide pandemic.

624
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,025
We literally don't know if we're
gonna live to see tomorrow.

625
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,988
A lot has changed.

626
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,980
Yeah, okay, let's go.

627
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:22,877
- Hey.
- Hey.

628
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,254
Um...

629
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:26,888
Our plan went to crap,

630
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:28,496
and now we can't
pretend

631
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,326
- it didn't happen...
- I can't be in a relationship right now.

632
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,113
- What?
- Sorry.

633
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:34,179
Let me start over.
That sounded rude.

634
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:38,142
When I'm saying is,
I‐I jumped right into something with Vic...

635
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,186
Mm‐hmm. you know,
after breaking up with Maggie,

636
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,606
who I started dating
pretty soon after April.

637
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,026
So I just probably should take
some time to sort things out.

638
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,027
I don't want to do anything
to hurt you or our friendship.

639
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:57,370
Jackson, my husband left me
the same year that we got married,

640
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:59,090
for a second time.

641
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,613
I am super broken.

642
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,817
Like "virtual therapy
three times a week" broken.

643
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:06,130
And now I have to put
myself back together

644
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,423
in a world that I no
longer recognize,

645
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:11,843
one that is sad and
lonely and depressing.

646
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:16,082
So what I need is
friendship and sex.

647
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:21,708
I am not, like really not,
looking for a relationship.

648
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:23,746
Especially with
someone like you.

649
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,273
- Someone like me? Okay.
- Mm‐hmm.

650
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:28,942
Yeah, you know,
Mr., um, Can't Be Alone

651
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,988
But Sometimes Skips Town
To Go On Nature Journeys.

652
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,856
- No thanks.
- No. Oh, okay.

653
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:36,527
But you can be friends with and
have sex with

654
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:37,755
Mr. Can't Be Alone?

655
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,301
- Got it.
- Yes.

656
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:42,433
The Netherlands
has recommended

657
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:46,377
that its residents find
a regular sex buddy

658
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,098
during the pandemic for safety.

659
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:50,879
- Sounds wise.
- Doesn't it?

660
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:54,629
You thought
I wanted to date you?!

661
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,262
Well,
how is that... Why is that so funny?

662
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,900
Hey. Uh...

663
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,801
You mind if I, uh...

664
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:11,746
Okay, well, sit over there.

665
00:33:18,274 --> 00:33:20,113
Okay. Hypothetical.

666
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:23,080
Asian‐American male
presents with fever,

667
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:26,277
high white blood cell count,
and right lower quadrant pain.

668
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,211
Oh, is this the restaurant guy?

669
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:29,671
I caught him in the ER.

670
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:32,215
Bailey, I see a dozen
presentations like that a month.

671
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,883
All appendicitis.

672
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,372
But if I'm honest,
in that moment,

673
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:37,845
I‐I didn't give it much thought.

674
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,515
I just... He was...
he was any patient.

675
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,741
Any non‐Asian patient.

676
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:44,852
I defaulted to a
standard of care.

677
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:47,452
That's centered
around white patients.

678
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:53,342
I never want to make
that mistake again.

679
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:55,507
There is no excuse.

680
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,226
You know, when you're
dealing with a high patient count,

681
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,687
you have to make judgment calls,
you know?

682
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,900
You... You have to ask,
what is the most likely problem, right?

683
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:04,655
So there's no excuses,

684
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,658
other than the excuses
you just listed off?

685
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,124
- That's not what I meant.
- Ha!

686
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:12,025
I just want to treat
everyone equally.

687
00:34:12,187 --> 00:34:15,590
Equal doesn't work for everybody,
Hunt.

688
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:18,886
I‐It's about equity... patients
getting what they need,

689
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,335
whether it fits into
a protocol or not.

690
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:24,960
Look,
I just put my parents in assisted living,

691
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:29,093
and I can't stop worrying
that they won't get enough care

692
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:32,999
because... there are
so few Black folks there.

693
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,653
Meanwhile, my dad's freaked out

694
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:38,990
because on his floor
the nurses are male.

695
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:42,436
In his mind,
good nurses are female, period.

696
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:46,561
So we all have biases,
Hunt, including you.

697
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:49,909
What matters now is
what you do about it.

698
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,506
You're the chief of trauma.

699
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,421
If the protocols don't work,

700
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:56,225
then read, learn...

701
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:59,943
question... and change them.

702
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,100
Kids are asleep.

703
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:22,913
And... it's your turn to talk.

704
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,286
I'm good.

705
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:29,436
Link, everything sucks right now.
You can talk about it.

706
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:31,631
Yeah. Yeah. I could do that.

707
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,694
If you want me to be...
miserable and resentful.

708
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:37,186
Resentful of me?

709
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:39,133
For trying to listen?

710
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:40,676
No, of making me talk

711
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,491
when clearly all I want to
do is play my damn guitar.

712
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:47,264
You can't keep
everything bottled up.

713
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,945
No, no, you can't, Amelia.

714
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,520
That's how you
process feelings.

715
00:35:50,604 --> 00:35:52,855
That's how you cope.
And I'm okay with that.

716
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:57,531
But... I've been through
"everything sucks."

717
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,639
Illness and isolation.

718
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,187
When I had cancer.
When... when my parents split.

719
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,992
I was so depressed
that I could...

720
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,406
I could barely get out of bed
for the better part of a year.

721
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,335
And I was 11.

722
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,029
Then I met a kid at cancer camp.

723
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:15,128
Morrow Willis.

724
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:16,678
Kid was probably
sicker than I was,

725
00:36:16,763 --> 00:36:19,056
but he didn't want to talk
about treatments or symptoms.

726
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:21,643
Just sports and "Mario Kart."

727
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:25,961
So I said to myself,
"What if I just focus on the good stuff?"

728
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,467
And I tried it.

729
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,430
And it turns out that's
what works for me.

730
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:33,147
That's what I need.

731
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,523
And if you're okay with that,
great,

732
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:38,413
but if you need a partner in misery,
I'm not your guy.

733
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,178
Whatcha playing?

734
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:50,992
Just a little
something I made up.

735
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:54,708
It's called, uh,
"If the Virus Doesn't End Us,

736
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:57,335
Then Climate Change
Probably Will Blues."

737
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,178
Hey.

738
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,881
<i>Hey.
Wasn't sure you'd answer.</i>

739
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,515
<i>Please. The woman who all
but ghosted you for a month</i>

740
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,163
<i>does not get to judge.</i>

741
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,860
It's just, uh... my dad.

742
00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:23,374
We don't have to talk about it

743
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,428
if you're not ready to
or if you don't want to.

744
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:30,311
It makes me crazy because
he... he seems like he's all charm,

745
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:33,053
but he has got
this temper that...

746
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:38,002
well, if you're serious about
not talking about it right now,

747
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,521
that can wait...

748
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:42,421
because the things I want
to do with you tonight...

749
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,241
they can't.

750
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:48,637
<i>Oh, well, I'm going to need
you to say more about that.</i>

751
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:49,972
Alright,
alright. Hold on. Let me, uh...

752
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,195
Let me try to share my screen.

753
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:53,788
Oh, my God. What?

754
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,085
Are we gonna watch porn?

755
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:58,606
No.

756
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,701
"Coming to America."

757
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:03,276
Mm‐hmm.

758
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,405
Yes! Please! Ahh!

759
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,449
Ugh!

760
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:09,928
Okay.

761
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:13,772
Hey, Tom?!

762
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:16,499
Tom, it's me!

763
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:23,388
I brought you soup and
I know that you're home!

764
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:26,935
It's that really excellent soup
from that little Polish place.

765
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:31,842
Tom...

766
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,619
I know... I know that
I am the last person

767
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:37,812
that you want to see.
I just... I don't know.

768
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,897
I thought maybe we
could talk through the door.

769
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:44,861
I just feel like you need some
semblance of human contact.

770
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:48,781
I don't blame you for... for
wanting to keep your distance,

771
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:50,639
I mean, pandemic or not.

772
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:59,491
I just want you to know
that you're not alone.

773
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,569
<i>Experts say

774
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:16,988

<i>I was so mad at you.</i>

778
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:30,928
What, for leaving you?

779
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,854
For choosing
someone over yourself.

780
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,245
I didn't know
I was gonna die.

781
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,217
Do you regret it?

782
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:41,208
<i>♪ Keep my head in the dirt ♪</i>

783
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,905
Does that matter?

784
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:46,233
You'd have done the same thing.
Isn't that why you're here?

785
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,049
<i>♪ Slow crash ♪</i>

786
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:51,010
<i>♪ Stumble over nothing on

787
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:52,546
So it's your fault.

788
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:55,967

00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:58,414

went all‐in for everybody.

792
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:07,567
Your friends, your family,
a woman at the bus stop.

793
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,812
You think that didn't
somehow affect me?

794
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:11,364

795
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,936

796
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,796
I didn't say it then,
but it's true.

797
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,717
And the single biggest factor
for cultivating resilience?

798
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:22,387
<i>♪ Far away from home ♪</i>

799
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,436
Positive relationships.

00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:29,108
<i>♪ Forgot my address ♪</i>

801
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,639
<i>♪ Mind is still on loan ♪</i>

802
00:40:36,723 --> 00:40:40,142
For what it's worth, I think
you made the right call,

803
00:40:40,226 --> 00:40:42,499
putting her in the trial.

804
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,975
I've known Meredith
since she was a child.

805
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:51,922
I watched her operate
on her dolls in the OR gallery.

806
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:55,866
I took her for milk and cookies
in the cafeteria.

807
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,741
I helped her get over her fear
of the film review room

808
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,405
because that's where she thought
we kept the skeletons.

809
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,319
<i>♪ I know I am anything
but uncouth ♪</i>

810
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:09,764
And then I watched her
become a surgeon, a wife...

811
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:14,421
a mother, and a chief.

812
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:21,413
You know, I knew COVID patients
had to suffer in isolation.

813
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,327
But I never gave any thought
to how helpless

814
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:28,851
and alone it feels

815
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:30,866

who care about them.

816
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:39,358
