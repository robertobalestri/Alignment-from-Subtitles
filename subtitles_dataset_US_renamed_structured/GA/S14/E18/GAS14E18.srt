You got me sober, Ollie.

56
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,340
Jimi Hendrix died.

57
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:02,887
No!

58
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,451
That happened
kind of a while ago.

59
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,831
No, Jimi Hendrix
is a liverless mouse.

60
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,620
Hmm. I thought
he was a guitar genius.

61
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:10,763
We're trying the seven different
polymers that I found

62
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,074
to see if any of them can be
used instead of Cerone's.

63
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,693
And we named the mice.
It's easier than numbers.

64
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,590
And now Jimi Hendrix is dead
and Elvis is...

65
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,910
Has left the building.

66
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,684
Anyway, Hellmouth is watching them
now.

67
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,191
You have the next shift. I mean,
we really have to come up with something

68
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,645
- if we're gonna...
- Beat Marie Cerone!

69
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,918
No. Save lives!

70
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:26,940
If we're going to save lives,
Wilson.

71
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,838
You can't give up that easily.

72
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:31,993
It's been four days.
You can call her.

73
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:33,966
It isn't easy, and Teddy doesn't
want to hear from me.

74
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,767
Can't you just trust
my judgment on this?

75
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,526
What are you...

76
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,104
No, no, no, no, no!

77
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,886
Dr. Altman!

78
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:42,715
Amelia Shepherd,
did I catch you at a good...

79
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,010
Great.

80
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,823
So I'm standing here
with Owen and...

81
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,331
Uh-huh.

82
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,728
Uh-huh.

83
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:52,299
Totally. I would just like to add...

84
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:53,694
Uh-huh.

85
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,727
Uh-huh.

86
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,716
Yeah, good talking to you.

87
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,393
- Yeah, that's not happening. Sorry.
- Hmm.

88
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,635
Hey! Oh, my God,

89
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,835
I never got to ask you

90
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,796
- how it went with Teddy.
- It went great!

91
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,046
Well, at least it didn't go badly.

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,617
<i>Okay.
I'm gonna let the ER know.</i>

93
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,861
Hey, lookin' good, Warren!

94
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,387
- Feelin' good, Dr. Webber!
- Uh-huh.

95
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,802
67-year-old female,
collapsed at an AA meeting.

96
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,356
We bagged her,
got her breathing again.

97
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:26,996
Then discovered her DNR bracelet.

98
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,995
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, she was not happy.

99
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:30,197
Anyway, she asked for you...

100
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,645
said you were her personal physician.

101
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:35,018
Hey, Richard, don't worry,
I haven't been drinking.

102
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,338
Cross my heart and
hope to die.

103
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,254
Ollie?

104
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:49,496
So, just to be clear, these
ultrasound waves,

105
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:51,807
they go right through the skull
and everything?

106
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,134
You don't cut him open
at all?

107
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,415
Exactly, right.

108
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,611
The waves meet directly on
Noah's tumor.

109
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:58,479
All the energy is focused there.

110
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:00,996
Imagine it
like using a magnifying glass

111
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,155
to burn a hole in a leaf.

112
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:03,869
Okay. And the risk?

113
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:05,513
I mean, I know
I keep asking, but...

114
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:06,881
Well, there's always a risk,
but since

115
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,635
the procedure's
completely non-invasive...

116
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,986
It's very dangerous.

117
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,174
It's difficult to control
the heat that is generated,

118
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:15,697
so the procedure is
slow and risky.

119
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,003
But it's also
his one real chance.

120
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,134
In the next few weeks,

121
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:21,707
the laughing fits are
going to increase

122
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,431
as the tumor presses
against his brain stem.

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,767
In better news,
we are excellent at what we do.

124
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:32,166
And we want this to work
almost as badly as you do.

125
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,118
That was harsh.

126
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,542
And I was thinking
it wasn't harsh enough.

127
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,558
I didn't tell her that her son
is basically a guinea pig.

128
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,048
Well, I'm gonna tell
Kimmie it's on.

129
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,025
- Don't oversell it!
- Wait, is that a yes?

130
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,801
- We're on.
- Okay, you know, important decision...

131
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:08,870
what are we calling this?

132
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,212
I'm thinking
"The Koracick Method,

133
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,511
featuring Amelia Shepherd."

134
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,009
You're distastefully cheerful.

135
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,627
Uh, because
this is the frontier!

136
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,605
I could scoop out brain tumors
like I'm balling melons,

137
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,152
which is my second favorite
kind of balling.

138
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,887
Look, we're so far out
on the edge of medicine,

139
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,174
no one's ever been there
before.

140
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:23,151
Aren't you... pumped?
This is like crack for you.

141
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,822
Or... melon balling for me.

142
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,134
Wait, where's, uh,
Bello and Blandrew? I gotta...

143
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,910
So, this is good news?

144
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,315
It's amazing news.

145
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,431
I mean, look, I-I don't want to
get anyone's hopes up too high,

146
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,808
but this procedure today
is a really big step

147
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,455
towards getting Kimmie back out
there and singing her face off.

148
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,548
Won't I just be back in here
in nine months with a new tumor?

149
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,650
I mean,
it's not a cure, right?

150
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:51,314
You know what, let's take this
one step at a time, Kimmie.

151
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,994
I'm... I'm so sick
of hospitals.

152
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:58,298
I just want to go back to
school, see my friends.

153
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,785
Do the spring musical.

154
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:00,903
Oh, sweetie.

155
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,037
Kimmie, I need you to...

156
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:03,634
Did I tell you
my friend invited me

157
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:06,275
to go with her family
to New York this summer?

158
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,267
They're getting
"Dear Evan Hansen" tickets.

159
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:14,017
I mean, maybe
I could last that long...

160
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,567
Isn't this below your pay grade?

161
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:22,048
I hope you're not
giving me special treatment

162
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:23,942
because I'm your sponsor.

163
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,274
Okay, here's the deal...

164
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:30,957
my liver has survived much
longer than it ever should have.

165
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,526
There are multiple options
for combating liver failure.

166
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:36,782
Did you see
my nice fat ankles, Richard?

167
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,470
And my lovely ghostlike
complexion?

168
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:43,423
Surely you heard it in my heart.
I have cardiomyopathy.

169
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:46,019
My dying liver is killing
my heart

170
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,284
and my heart is killing me.

171
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,822
I have reached
my expiration date.

172
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,390
When did you decide on
the DNR?

173
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,369
Eight months ago,

174
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,137
along with an advance directive.

175
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:59,420
- No intervention.
- Eight months!

176
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,058
We talk three times a week.
Sometimes three times a day!

177
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:04,207
How could you not tell me this?

178
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,769
I wanted to,
many times.

179
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,236
But you know
how this works...

180
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,384
something goes bad for you,
you call me.

181
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,236
Something goes bad for me
and I call my sponsor.

182
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,005
And here I thought
we were friends.

183
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,737
Give me a break.

184
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,464
You're acting
like a pouting teenager.

185
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,791
We're more than friends,
Richard.

186
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,322
I...

187
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,424
I didn't know how to sponsor you
through my death.

188
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,533
Good news...
you're not gonna have to.

189
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,822
Because I'm not gonna
let you die.

190

<i>Maintenance
to 4 West nurses' station.</i>

193
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,246
Peggy, Dayna, hi!

194
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:55,679
Oh, hey, Dr. Robbins. Hi.

195
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,607
Hey, what's going on?
Is the baby okay?

196
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:59,806
Oh, yeah, she's fine.
That one, not so much.

197
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:01,112
Oh, I'm a mess.

198
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:02,913
Peggy was driving and Dayna...

199
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,864
She puked all over me.
Like power-puked.

200
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:05,973
And then I swerved and...

201
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,575
You hit a tree
at 30 miles an hour.

202
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,313
All the airbags went off
except for Dayna's.

203
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,715
Ouch.
Did you hit your head?

204
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,050
No. My ribs feel a little sore.

205
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,513
It's okay.

206
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,651
It's very common to have

207
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,440
a release of emotion
after an accident.

208
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,440
Especially once the body knows
it's out of harm's way.

209
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,006
"Out of harm's way."

210
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:22,113
Babe.

211
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,019
I have stage 2 breast cancer

212
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,918
and I just had
my second round of chemo.

213
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,051
That's why I got sick.

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,323
So, the harm is most definitely
still in the way.

215
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:35,753
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

216
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:37,784
Uh, are you sure
this is your stop?

217
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,359
Well, maybe not.

218
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,770
Maybe not, huh?

219
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,552
Sorry I haven't been able to get free.

220
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,569
Harriet's, uh, teething
and, you know, April's still...

221
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:53,940
Please do not apologize

222
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:56,052
for taking care of the people you love.

223
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,341
Thank you very much.

224
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:12,653
Okay.

225
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,366
Have you talked to her yet?

226
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,302
I'm gonna try again today.

227
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,028
Koracick.

228
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,241
April. Please, we had sex.
Call me Dr. Koracick.

229
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,569
Um... Um, can I talk to you?

230
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,403
I'm... I need to say something to you,

231
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:30,980
and it is not easy for me.

232
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,927
Oh. Well, l-let's make it easy.
Just picture me naked.

233
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,350
Tom, I, um... what I was trying to say

234
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,619
is that I was horrible to you.

235
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,786
And you were kind, and you were
vulnerable and I was...

236
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,482
Just using me for sex?

237
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:46,637
Yes, I was just using you
for sex. And I am sorry.

238
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:47,866
I am sorry for that.

239
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,381
Look, no. I love being used
for sex, Dr. Kepner.

240
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,130
You can use me for sex,
uh, any time you...

241
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:55,452
No, I didn't... I... No.

242
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,705
Oh, you... you made up with God?

243
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:00,881
Well, for whatever it's worth,
uh, I'm almost certain

244
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,925
God approves of you
using me for sex.

245
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,224
I don't know why I'm so upset.

246
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:12,062
Dr. Hanson told me
I'd be nauseous.

247
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,767
Remember what else
Dr. Hanson said...

248
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,857
stay positive, because
you're gonna get through it.

249
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,185
He promised.

250
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:18,533
Promised, did he?

251
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:20,263
Yeah, he has
the proof to back it up.

252
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,028
His success rates are
amazing.

253
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,700
He cured my friend Lucille
without surgery.

254
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:27,310
You must know him...
Dr. Scott Hanson... Ow!

255
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,569
- Sore there?
- Ohh.

256
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:29,967
Uh, afraid I don't know him.

257
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,288
Oh, my God, you need to be
sending people to him!

258
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,153
He sounds amazing.

259
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,349
Let's get Dayna up for a CT.

260
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,983
And, Peggy, we have a waiting room

261
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:39,963
for you to relax
with the baby, okay?

262
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,357
Okay.

263
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,551
If I ever hear you
use the word "cure"

264
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,607
and "promise" when
speaking with a cancer patient,

265
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,584
your medical career will be
as short as you are.

266
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:50,207
- Yes, sir.
- Call Dr. Hanson's office,

267
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,903
get me her medical records,
okay?

268
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,575
So we monitor from
inside the room with him?

269
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,098
- Mm-hmm.
- This is so cool.

270
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,732
We're at the edge of
the cutting edge.

271
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:08,247
And hopefully we don't
melt Noah's brain stem.

272
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,158
This is exciting.

273
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,387
It's incredibly exciting.

274
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,951
It's why we do this, right?

275
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:35,980
Come on! You...
You know I love doing that, too.

276
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,402
"Important" isn't quite
a big enough word.

277
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,763
But, I mean, normally,
I would take care of this personally,

278
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,622
but, uh...
she's more like family to me.

279
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,239
- We get it.
- Of course.

280
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:53,616
Hey, you!

281
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Yeah, you, the old one.
Get in here.

282
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:59,094
Uh, give me a minute, will you?

283
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:00,782
Uh, how you feeling?

284
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:02,956
I need your advice
on something.

285
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:06,378
When your physician
refuses to honor your request

286
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:09,175
for "no medical intervention,"
what's the protocol?

287
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:11,319
Do I ask to speak to
his superior?

288
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,581
Well, I'm married to
the head of the hospital.

289
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,136
And I mentored the chief,
so good luck with that.

290
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:20,464
Okay, so I guess I'll have to
resort to more extreme measures.

291
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,354
Mm-hmm.
And what might those be?

292
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:26,940
How does "recovering drunk"
go over in the medical community?

293
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:28,418
Good?

294
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:32,089
Because I will
break your anonymity

295
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:35,578
to any doctor
you send in here.

296
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,018
Uh, this is Dr. Meredith Grey,
and this is Dr. Maggie Pierce.

297
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,113
- So nice to meet you.
- The famous Meredith and Maggie.

298
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:50,309
I can't tell you what it means
to meet you both.

299
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,129
I've asked them both
to come up with

300
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,901
every possible option
to take care of you.

301
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,464
And like you,

302
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:59,698
I trust and respect
these two women completely.

303
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:03,324
So, anything you have
to share with them,

304
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,573
you have my complete blessing.

305
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,323
Are those sound wave readouts?

306
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:19,707
They're microphones
inside the helmet

307
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:20,981
listening for popping sounds.

308
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,309
What would popping sounds
mean?

309
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,985
They would mean that
his brain is boiling.

310
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,268
It's getting hotter. Hold off.

311
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:29,128
- How long?
- Until it stops getting hotter!

312
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,924
Okay, we're getting awfully
close to a cavitation event.

313
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,488
If we go much longer,
he will develop hyperemia.

314
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:37,103
Yeah, but if we don't separate
the tumor from the brain stem,

315
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,489
- he may never wake up again.
- Well, what... what should we...

316
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,143
Stop! Stop! It's too hot!

317
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:43,776
Okay.

318
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:48,854
All right, th-there's nowhere
for the h-heat to disperse.

319
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,682
This... This could take a while.

320
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,888
Schmitt, when I ask you
to get Dayna's medical records,

321
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,636
it means come back
with her medical records!

322
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:03,083
I'm not sure what to do.
They just said

323
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:05,355
- they couldn't release them...
- Just... Just call... call again,

324
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:06,566
and make sure
they know it's emergent,

325
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:07,833
and also make sure
they know it's Grey-Sloan.

326
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:08,994
Ah.

327
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,089
Don't take it out
on the poor interns, Owen.

328
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,651
- Wait, what?
- I talked to Teddy.

329
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:14,941
Look at this scan.

330
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,418
I can't believe you.
What were you thinking?

331
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:18,270
You double dipped within 24 hours of...

332
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,165
- Would you just look, please?!
- Ugh!

333
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:23,554
There's no broken ribs,

334
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,177
and I don't see any internal injuries.

335
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,829
What else don't you see?

336
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:29,460
Wait, what?

337
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,552
Exactly.

338
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,829
Well, show me
the sagittal views.

339
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,488
Now, I will bet my license
this woman does not have cancer.

340
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:53,554
You know, when a person's
been sober a long time,

341
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:57,587
and they lose their sponsor,
it's hard...

342
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,790
it's hard to get a new one.

343
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,782
It's hard on the ego
to even have to ask.

344
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:05,712
And recovering drunks, as a rule,

345
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,008
we're not all that fond of change.

346
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,204
But Richard will need a new sponsor.

347
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,165
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

348
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,462
All right, we still have
a few more tests to run.

349
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,151
Don't give up hope just yet.

350
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,094
Oh, honey, I'm all hope.

351
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:23,431
Hope of moving out of this old,
broken shell of a body,

352
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,916
into whatever comes next.

353
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,807
Hope of feeling like I did
when I first got sober.

354
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,922
"Happy, joyous, and free."

355
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,547
I don't need hope.

356
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:33,482
I need acceptance.

357
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:35,749
From Richard.

358
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,275
I need to know that
he's gonna get through this

359
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:39,571
without a bottle.

360
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:42,026
Can you work that up for me?

361
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:53,091

362
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,621
Owen.

363
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,488
Hey. I saw you admitted
my rule-out appy...

364
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:57,662
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:58,755
Why? What happened?

366
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,998
I, um...

367
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:02,873
Owen, I want to apologize
for my behavior lately.

368
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,716
At trauma cert day,
and actually a lot of days.

369
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,289
I was, uh... I was going through a thing.

370
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:10,521
And I-I'm really sorry
that I worried you.

371
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:11,998
Hmm.

372
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,503
Well, I forgive you. Completely.

373
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,913
Because you're a good person,
April, a very good person,

374
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,888
and you don't deserve to be
crucified for one bad move.

375
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,958
Great. Thank you.

376
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,414
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.

377
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,507
My pleasure.

378
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,656
- Hey, April, you got a sec...
- No, I'm sorry! Busy!

379
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,710
You've got to be kidding me.

380
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,319
They said their systems are down.

381
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,380
All medical records unavailable.

382
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,882
Okay. All right.

383
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,297
I'll take it from here. Thank you.

384
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,554
<i>Dr. Ryan to the ER.
Dr. Harry Ryan to the ER.</i>

385
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,787
Hey. I talked to Dayna.

386
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:47,662
She was referred by a friend
in the exact same situation...

387
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:48,959
inconclusive mammogram,

388
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,005
and then she needed
a second opinion.

389
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,030
And did you tell her
that she is cancer free?

390
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,582
No. No. We have one scan

391
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,264
and we don't have
any of her prior records.

392
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,568
Two chemo treatments?

393
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:57,866
That really would be
a miracle cure.

394
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,209
This guy... there's something
really wrong here.

395
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,841
Well, maybe
she was just misdiagnosed.

396
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,435
Sometimes good doctors make
mistakes.

397
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:06,069
- Why are you defending this guy?
- Why are you attacking this guy?

398
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,435
You have been so angry
all day long.

399
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:10,194
Maybe it has something to do
with the fact...

400
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,153
American Society of Clinical Oncology.

401
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,450
Yeah?

402
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,442
Guess who is not a member?

403
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:28,426
I am tore up
from the floor up.

404
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,801
I mean beat up
from the feet up.

405
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,715
- Come here.
- Ohh.

406
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,743
I don't think I'm even gonna
put anything on.

407
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:39,890
Oh, here, let me get the light.

408
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,132
Oh, yeah.

409
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,381
Okay.

410
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,140
Uh, here, maybe I can, um...

411
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:50,250
help sooth some of your tore up...?

412
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,103
Ben?

413
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,390

415
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,146
Stable, but the skull
temperature is spiking again.

416
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,820
We're approaching
the upper limit.

417
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:20,125
Okay, that's it.
We're done.

418
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:21,365
No.

419
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,266
I want to let it cool off again
and then do another round,

420
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,579
- make sure the tumor's all gone.
- We have to stop now

421
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,848
before we turn the inside of
Noah's head into stew.

422
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:31,312
- No, one more round.
- Dr. Shepherd, let it go!

And, um, there are some things
that we could try,

435
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,459
- but honestly, Richard, Ollie doesn't...
- Ollie has had enough for today.

436
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,483
So, I think what we should do
is,

437
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,804
let's get her hydrated overnight,

438
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,492
and we can run some more tests
in the morning.

439
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,436
Um, okay. Right.

440
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,061
Uh, I'm gonna
keep an eye on her,

441
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,896
and don't you two go far,
either, okay?

442
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,474
Nope.
We'll be right here.

443
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,584

what's happening here.

444
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:28,416
We cannot go against
Ollie's wishes,

445
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,536
even if it upsets Richard.

446
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,028
The last time
he fell off the wagon,

447
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,693
he nearly lost everything...
his career, his marriage.

448
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:35,607
Um,
I can't even picture him drunk.

449
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,783
Trust me,
you don't want to see it.

450
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:40,239
- Where's Catherine?
- In Boston.

451
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:42,226
Maybe we can get her back
by the morning.

452
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:45,177

the great Amelia Shepherd,

478
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,065

484
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:39,925
I've... I've never
been to your place.

485
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,792
You... You...
You never talk about your place.

486
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:45,128
Uh, well, what...

487
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,861
No, no, no!
What are you doing?

488
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,557
No, no, no.
Sam, stop! Stop!

489
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:54,054
What the hell, Andrew?

490
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,429
Okay, you got me. I'm in between
places, that's all.

491
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:57,755
I was staying
with Dr. Robbins,

492
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,204
and then she started
sleeping with my sister.

493
00:21:59,272 --> 00:22:01,132
So then I moved in
with Dr. Hunt, but then...

494
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,812
he started
sleeping with my sister.

495
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,856
Now you're laughing at me.
Great.

496
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,296

the on-call room.

497
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,773
Yes.

498
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,135
Move in with me.

499
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,338
A-Are you serious?

500
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:27,904
- Hi.
- Hi.

501
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,438
Hi. Arizona Hunt.
This is my husband, O-Otis.

502
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,037
Um,
I called this morning?

503
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,229
Fill this out and we'll call you
when Dr. Hanson is ready.

504
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,104
- Great. Awesome.
- Thanks.

505
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,698
Suddenly we're a married couple?
With an appointment?

506
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,018
What happened to
"good doctors make mistakes"?

507
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:44,024
His Yelp reviews
are all five stars.

508
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:45,355
Well, that sounds like
a good thing.

509
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:47,932
No, it's too good to be true.
People go to Yelp to complain.

510
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,942
Nobody gets five stars.
I don't get five stars.

511
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:51,291
You sure don't.

512
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,363
So now this is your idea
and it all makes sense to you.

513
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,028
You... You really are
like my other wives.

514
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,555
I figure if he doesn't know
that we're doctors,

515
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,088
he's likely to
give more away.

516
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,190
Hmm.

517
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,197
Nicely done, Mrs. Hunt.

518
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,573
You know, I'm just gonna...

519
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:08,244
You get
three and a half stars.

520
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:11,292
- What?
- Same as my dry cleaner.

521
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,528
Wow.

522
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:21,484
Dr. Teller, extension 2219.
Dr. Teller, extension 2219.

523
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:25,948
Hey, you okay?

524
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:28,799
I just spoke to Catherine,
and she wanted me to...

525
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,143
Oh, so Catherine's
asking you about me.

526
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,652
You'd like it if
Ben asked me about you?

527
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:36,627
Ben Warren
can stick it in his pill box.

528
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:47,252
I've spoken to Ollie nearly
every day for the past 20 years.

529
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:50,111
More than I've spoken
to anyone else in my life.

530
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:53,318
More than my parents,
Adele, Catherine.

531
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,213
She's the keeper
of my secrets.

532
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,377
She's...

533
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,783
She's how I feel
God's presence.

534
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:06,213
You've got an awfully big
village of people here.

535
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:07,658
You know that.

536
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,942
Yeah, I know I do.

537
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,518
Dr. Kepner?

538
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,335
Can I place an art line
in Trauma 4?

539
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,791
- Yes.
- Thanks.

540
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:17,694
Also, I am sorry.

541
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:19,471
What?

542
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:24,502
Um, I was not entirely fair
to you on trauma cert day.

543
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,619
Your work was
particularly impressive,

544
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,823
and I may not have made that
clear on the day in question.

545
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,033
Thank you.

546
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,351
I just... I just thought
you might be, you know...

547
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,698
I might be what?

548
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:37,799
Um, you know, like,
having a nervous breakdown?

549
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:39,528
Oh.

550
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,229
Oh, uh,
I didn't take it personally.

551
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:43,355
Good. Great. Great.
Thanks for that.

552
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,272
- And we will not speak of this again.
- Right.

553
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:48,024
Schmitt.

554
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,525
I'm sorry!

555
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:51,135
What? For what? What?

556
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,913
I... I don't know.
I'm just really sorry.

557
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:56,024
Uh...
apology accepted.

558
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,722
The truth is
we don't have any good options.

559
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,377
We could put you on
liver dialysis,

560
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:09,057
but that would cause
a real strain on your heart.

561
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:11,158
Mm-hmm.
We could try an LVAD,

562
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,238
but the long-term prognosis
is very poor.

563
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,455
Who saw this coming?

564
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:17,604
Hey, it's better to have
a chance at a good result

565
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:19,260
than a guarantee
of a bad one.

566
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,986
By whose definition?

567
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:23,236
Do you think that
when I found out I was dying,

568
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:26,808
I was just, "Oh, well,
that's life for you"?

569
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,799
Coming to terms with this

570
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:31,617
was the second hardest thing
I have ever done in my life,

571
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,507
and now I'm at peace.

572
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:35,294
Or at least I was.

573
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,484
The one thing...
The only thing...

574
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,400
Stopping me from moving on
to whatever comes next

575
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:44,666
is one childish, stubborn,
nagging problem.

576
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:48,088
You are driving me to drink,
Richard Webber,

577
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:51,151
and I'll be damned if
I don't leave this world sober!

578
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,243
Well, if I'm the only thing
that's keeping you alive,

579
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,236
then I guess
I'm doing my job!

580
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,291
Please tell me
you have good news for me.

581
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,052
My mom's Boston patient
had post-op complications,

582
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:08,697
so she had to stay back
and see it through.

583
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,840
Dr. Ryan, call the psych unit.

584
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:15,650
Dr. Ryan, call the psych unit.

585
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,416
I'm the one who's gonna have to
tell him, aren't I?

586
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,809
How do you tell somebody something
that they already know?

587
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,260
I mean, this isn't... rational,
it's just pure emotion.

588
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,386
Hmm.

589
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,838
How can I...

590
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:34,400
What can I say that would
possibly change his mind?

591
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:39,088
Believe it or not,
I know exactly how that feels.

592
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:41,158
You do?

593
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,486
Mm-hmm.

594
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:44,845
That's how I felt
when your mother was dying.

595
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:52,697
Look, I can go with you.

596
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,963
Be there with you
when you tell him.

597
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,385
Let me help.

598
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,829
You helped.

599
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:10,924
I have to say
how refreshing it is

600
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,565
to have a couple
come in together.

601
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,706
You'd be surprised
how many husbands

602
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:16,823
don't even want to
come into the office,

603
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,027
much less the exam room.

604
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,190
- Hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.

605
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,159
It's just we're... we're really
close. Right, honey?

606
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,869
- Mm-mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:25,658
Well, right breast
looks nice and healthy.

608
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,706
- It's not...
- Oh, okay.

609
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,697
Any problem there at all.

610
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,143
Yeah,
more often than not,

611
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,150
these inconclusive mammograms
turn out to be nothing.

612
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,504
But, you know,
better safe than s...

613
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,447
Yeah, this looks
slightly less than good.

614
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:51,268
Unfortunately, I am seeing a
solid lesion in the left breast.

615
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,799
Hmm. So, I...

616
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,408
I definitely
have breast cancer, huh?

617
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,994
Hey, uh, can you show us

618
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:00,562
what that looks like
on that machine there, Doc?

619
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,424
Yeah.

620
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:07,488
You see this area
right here?

621
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,963
And that's the lesion.

622
00:28:10,032 --> 00:28:12,191
And then there's a small one
right there.

623
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:16,705
That's...
That is really there.

624
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:22,002
I have breast cancer?!

625
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:33,307
Let's go.

626
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,050
- Hey. Oh, I've been looking for you.
- I think I owe you...

627
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:38,524
Come with us. Right now.

628
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,861
Did she page you, too?
Is it bad?

629
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:18,099
You're showing up clean.

630
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,344
You're 100% sure?

631
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:21,346
Look, they look totally clean!
See for yourself.

632
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:23,892
Um, she's like...

633
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,400
Oh, we're way past that.

634
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,955
You're okay.

635
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:29,557
I'm okay.

636
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,729
He fakes
the ultrasounds.

637
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:34,951
He is poisoning
completely healthy women,

638
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,441
probably just to charge them
for the chemo.

639
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,316
- No.
- What he does to these women,

640
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,084
what he puts these families
through...

641
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,246
- We need to stop him.
- No. We need to destroy him.

642
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,440
Owen...

643
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,768
You told me not to take it out
on the interns.

644
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,692
You figured out a way
to get Ollie more time?

645
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,996
Otherwise,
it's just...

646
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,674
You know who
you remind me of?

647
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,213
Don't care.

648
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,807
Me.

649
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,565
When my mom was dying.

650
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,338
I worked so hard,

651
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:20,575
looking for anything that would
give her more time.

652
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,776
And I didn't even
think about it.

653
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:24,637
I just instinctively knew
it was what I had to do.

654
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,807
Yeah,
but she was your family.

655
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,236
More than blood.

656
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,096
She shaped me.

657
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:36,369
More than anyone else,
she made me who I am.

658
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,471
How could it be wrong

659
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,244
to do everything in my power
to save her?

660
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:45,619
<i>♪ For fifty-one reasons
not to lose our souls? ♪</i>

661
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,705
Because you weren't
doing it for her.

662
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,230
<i>♪ And it's not that
you're not the one ♪</i>

663
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,088
I'd give anything for
another chance

664
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:00,869
- <i>♪ And it's not that you're not the one ♪</i>
- to do it again.

665
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,971
Just to be there with her

666
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,658
and then give her
the ending that she wanted.

667
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,392
<i>♪ Do you feel a little broken? ♪</i>

668
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:14,229

669
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:17,176
- <i>♪ Do you feel a little broken? ♪</i>
- All that suffering...

670
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:18,469
putting her through
all that pain

671
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,721
when all she wanted
was peace...

672
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:23,627
<i>♪ Do you feel a little broken? ♪</i>

673
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,486

<i>♪ Do you feel a little broken? ♪</i>

675
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,854

678
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:47,752
Hey.

679
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,744
I, uh, assumed
I was still getting her.

680
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:52,018
- <i>♪ And I'm running out of words ♪</i>
- Yeah, I, um...

681
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:54,713

682
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:58,924
I... I...
I'd really like to.

683
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:00,724
- How you doing?
- You okay?

684
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,104
Yes, I am...
I am totally fine to take her.

685
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,212
I promise.

686
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:05,920
- I'm good.
- You? You, though?

687
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,479
You okay?

688
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,455
Um...

- Ah, I lost God.

691
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:18,621
I-I lost
Matthew's Taylor's wife.

692
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,854
I lost her
in childbirth.

693
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:22,792
And then this little boy died
for no earthly reason, and...

694
00:32:23,113 --> 00:32:25,096
God was nowhere to be found.
I lost Him.

695
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:28,414
And that's never happened to me
before, and I got scared...

696
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:32,094
and, uh, really angry.

697
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,861
And all during our marriage,
I just...

698
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,729
I wanted you to know God
the way that I did,

699
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:39,670
and you never wanted to.

700
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:41,729
And so, when I lost him,

701
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,065
it felt like, I don't know,
you've won or something.

702
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:47,971
And...

703
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:51,228
- <i>♪ Do you feel a little broken? ♪</i>
- ..I hated that.

704
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:52,627
I hated you.

705
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:54,869
Yeah, well,
I was just trying to help.

706
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,586
I know, I know, I got it.

707
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:57,846
You did.

708
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,033
Oh, my God, you did.

709
00:33:02,205 --> 00:33:04,432
Things got...

710
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:07,174
really rough,
and I just...

711
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,236
I needed to be sure
that Harriet was okay.

712
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:12,549
And of course she was
because... of you.

713
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,752
And I'm... I'm good now.

714
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,301
I, uh... I found Him again.

715
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,252
He and I are, like,
tighter than ever.

716
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,065
So you know.

717
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:27,036
But I realize that even when
it felt like He wasn't there...

725
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,495
Give Kimmie a standard
course of chemo and radiation.

726
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:50,995
Shrink the tumor enough
to get her to summer.

727
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,072
That could work.

728
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:53,409
By then, I'll be able to
take the three,

729
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:55,432
maybe four weeks of
vacation time I'm due,

730
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,630
and then I'll just take Kimmie
and her grandmother to New York

731
00:33:57,698 --> 00:33:59,604
and we'll hit every
Broadway show we can.

732
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:00,947
What's going on?

733
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:02,784
Alex...

734
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:04,066
Noah made it.
He's good.

735
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,119
Noah is doing okay,
but I cannot tell you why.

736
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,787
That procedure was like skiing
down a mountain blindfolded.

737
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,449
We should have crashed
a thousand time.

738
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:12,745
- All right, hold on, hold on. Amelia?
- No, he's... he's right.

739
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:16,110
We ran into a dozen things
that we never even saw coming.

740
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:18,206
And this was supposed to be
the easy one.

741
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,650
I mean, Kimmie's tumor
is much more dangerous.

742
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,722
Yeah, with a lot more tests,
a lot more practice,

743
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,997
we'll be able to save
more kids with Noah's tumor,

744
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,373
but Kimmie's procedure
is years away.

745
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:28,922
- Kimmie doesn't have years.
- I know.

746
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:30,775
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

747
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:33,393
I do not accept this, because
you saved Noah, so you can...

748
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:35,260
I will do everything I can
to make sure

749
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:37,221
that Kimmie treasures
the time she has left,

750
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,799
but I will not perform
that procedure on this girl.

751
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,032
All right, fine. Um,

752
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:42,533
Dr. Shepherd can do it
without you.

753
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,347
- Alex, I... I'm not gonna be able to
- No, no. No. No, listen to me.

754
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,050
- Listen to me, okay? Listen.
- The technology is not there.

755
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,748
Kimmie has only one chance
to live,

756
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,401
and you are the only doctors
that can do this in the world!

757
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,025
- We're not gonna do...
- I'm asking you as... as a colleague,

758
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:53,511
- as a friend...
- Do you have children, Karev?

759
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,496
- Please, please, please.
- I will not, I cannot

760
00:34:55,564 --> 00:34:58,124
- Alex! No, Alex! - At my hands!
- Watch her die on my table...

761
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:04,013
Do what you got to do.

762
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,418
I'm okay?
I'm really okay?

763
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:32,896
Yes.
Your scans came back clear.

764
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,255
Dayna,
you do not have cancer.

765
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:36,310
Oh, my God!

766
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,591
Oh, my God, babe.

767
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,802
Oh, my God.

768
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,707
Oh, this is a miracle.

769
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,310
I have to tell Dr. Hanson.

770
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,779
Uh, actually Dr. Hunt
is telling Dr. Hanson right now.

771
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:47,880
Oh, my God.

772
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:51,618
Oh, my God.

773
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,470
Hey, Doc.
You got a minute?

774
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,391
Mr. Hunt, um, actually,
we're closed,

775
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:02,705
if you don't mind
coming back tomorrow.

776
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:05,392
You know, I have heard such
amazing things about your chemo,

777
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:07,518
like it's smoother
and milder.

778
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,392
Almost
makes it sound good.

779
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,259
What's the secret, Doc?

780
00:36:11,365 --> 00:36:12,824
You know,
it's no secret.

781
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:16,454
It's just, uh, finding ways
to make it less... painful.

782
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,790
You know?

783
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:18,956
Do I know?

784
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,165
I guess I don't know.

785
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,272
So, walk me through it.

786
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:26,934
When you give a patient
chemotherapy,

787
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:28,274
what's the process?

788
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:31,071
- Uh, I mean, I...
- Let's see.

789
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:34,880
So,
it comes through here.

790
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,144
Right?

791
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,581
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

792
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:39,590
Wait, first...
First...

793
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:41,094
No.

794
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:42,298
No. Ah.

795
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,907
Here we go.

796
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:52,282
You know... Doc...

797
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,353
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

798
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,130
Mr. Hunt, this is making me
very uncomfortable.

799
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:00,665
I bet it does.

800
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:04,153
You as uncomfortable as your
patients and their families?

801
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,142
What's next?
What is next?

802
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:07,741
Oh, I know.

803
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:10,048
This is the fun part.

804
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:13,462
- What are you...
- Roll up your sleeve.

805
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:14,831
You're not serious?

806
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,095
Roll up your sleeve.

807
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,548
I'm not doing that.

808
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,907
Why not, hmm?

809
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,446
Why not?

810
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,024
Because you're not sick.
Hmm?

811
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,228
'Cause only a psychotic

812
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:28,681
would pump that poison
in a completely healthy person

813
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,454
just to make
a few extra bucks?

814
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,758
Come on, Doc.

815
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:34,010
That's never stopped you
before.

816
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:40,991
Don't worry.

817
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,587
They're with me.

818
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,189
What's on your mind,
Shepherd?

819
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,934
What I really need is to get

820
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,524
as far away from my mind
right now as possible.

821
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,759

that need pretty bad.

A new liver that is
60% of normal size.

856
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:35,297
So, this is Janis, right...

857
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:36,929
- Janis Joplin?
- No, no, no, she didn't make it.

858
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:38,125
This is David Bowie.

859
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,184
No, no, Bowie is the one that we
injected straight into

860
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,131
without the polymer,
so it can't possibly be Bowie,

861
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,296
because...
Yeah, exactly.

862
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:45,926
The liver cells migrated
completely by themselves.

863
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,679
We never needed
the polymer.

864
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:49,844
Are you serious?

865
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:51,273
Mm-hmm.

866
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,385
That means...

867
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:53,758
We're gonna save
a lot of lives.

868
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,327
We are gonna beat
Marie freakin' Cerone!

869
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,398
Yes!

870
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,164
Okay, stop all that.

871
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:02,133
Sometimes we win.

872
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:07,884
Oh. Oh, no.
You said it was urgent.

873
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,921
I thought I was gonna find you
lying on the floor.

874
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:12,859
God, Miranda, you can't say
it's urgent if it's not urgent.

875
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:16,182
Now, you listen to me,
Ben Warren, and you listen good.

876
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:19,884
I know I gave you a real scare,

877
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,383
but you have been scared
long enough.

878
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,254
I am not dying.

879
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:27,782
My heart is strong and powerful
just like me.

880
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:31,148
I'm very much alive,
and so are you.

881
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:32,386
And it is urgent.

882
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:34,968
It... is... urgent
that we celebrate

883
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:39,726
being alive right here,
right now, naked.

884

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,596

Hey.

Uh, I have been apologizing
for the last two days,

896
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,720
and I finally
got the hang of it.

897
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:21,863
So,
if you'll let me, I just...

898
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,596
I want to tell you
how sorry I am.

899
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:24,706
Sorry for what?

900
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,734
I was so awful to you
at your game-night thing.

901
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:31,073
Like, so awful.
And I'm really sorry.

902
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:32,352
No, please, please,

903
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:35,401
you were the least of
my problems at that party.

904
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,144
Clive was married.

905
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:39,510
I was sleeping with
a married man.

906
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:40,674
Even though I didn't know,

907
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:42,230
I still can't shake
the shame of that.

908
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,077
Oh, my God, no.
I so relate.

909
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:46,299
I slept with an intern...
The douchey one.

910
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,502
- Oh.
- Yeah.

911
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,460
And then I slept with
Tom Koracick.

912
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:51,690
What?

913
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,752
And then I jumped my ex-husband
in a closet,

914
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:56,987
so, you know, I was just,
like, a total mess.

915
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:59,301
Anyway, I got to... I got to
get this little girl home.

916
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:01,296
But, um, I'm sorry.

917
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,728
And thank you.
Mmhmm, yeah.

918
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:03,854
Sorry.

919
00:42:03,993 --> 00:42:05,902
Let's go, let's go.

920
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:09,996
<i>♪ Won't get no tears from me ♪</i>

921
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:11,674
Oh, God.

922
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,971
Ready?

923
00:42:14,538 --> 00:42:17,745
