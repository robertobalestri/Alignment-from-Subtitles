Hey. Wait, wai... wait.

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,312
I proofread the presentation,
tested the A/V equipment.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,828
David Bowie is performance-ready.

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:13,997
Excellent.

7
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:15,109
Where are you going?

8
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:16,532
I'm going to check on my post-ops.

9
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,663
- I'll be back soon.
- What?

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,957
Try to calm down.
You're gonna stress out Bowie.

16
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,531
Well, it's gonna take
as long as it's gonna take.

- This eliminates the need for a port.

19
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,785
- That allows us to... No. No.
- Hey.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,824
- Go away.
- Why?

21
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,380
I already lost sleep because
of you last night.

22
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,997
- Did you? Uh-huh.
- I'm trying to focus.

23
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:46,199
- I'm trying to win.
- Yeah? Good luck with that.

Kepner said I could be
the first to present.

27
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,379
Then I'll head
to Ollie's funeral.

28
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:55,755
Oh, I wish
I could come with you.

29

00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,993
Mom, if you wanted input,
you could have done that

35
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,126
last week instead of
being

36
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:10,391
- in Boston.
- I was busy taking care of business.

37
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,399
So was Dr. Velez.

38
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:12,595
She had emergency surgery
in I.A.

39
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,931
She still managed
to get her notes in on time.

40
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,172
- Over there.
- Thank you.

41
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,686
That's nasty.

42
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:20,561
- Hi. Cookie?
- Oh God.

43
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:22,235
Whoa. Seriously?

44
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,211

- Here.

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,008
They are lesbian gratitude cookies.

48
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,899
- What?
- Hm. Yeah.

49
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:34,766
I mean, that's what
they call them.

50
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,168
Remember my patients
who had the cancer

51
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:37,293
that turned out
not to be cancer?

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,174
Mmm. Lesbian gratitude cookies
are delicious.

53
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:41,905
I think I can say that,
but I'm not so sure about you.

54
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:42,839
- Hi. Cookie?
- Hi.

55
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:45,204
Um, one of my patients
just went into labor.

56
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:49,008
If I don't make it back,
you got this. You're magic.

The future of medicine is
in this room.

70
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,860

I'm going, too.

- Hey, cookie?
- Um, no, I can't eat when I'm nervous.

73
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,277

Morning and welcome

76
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:29,645
to Grey Sloan Surgical
Innovation Prototypes Day.

77
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:33,439
Today, we will see presentations
of the 25 proposals

78
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,173
that were chosen
in round one.

79
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,240
Five will be selected to move on
to the contest's final phase

80
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:42,354
and receive a $1 million grant

81
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:45,433
to further their
groundbreaking research.

82
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,196
Good luck to all of
today's presenters.

83
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:50,263
And we will begin
with Dr. Richard Webber.

84
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:56,848
You're on deck.

85
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,263
Hey. Want some cookies?

86
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,787
Sure. Thanks.

87
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,482
Thank you.

88
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,381
Let's begin.

00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,599
<i>Now, once we identify the cancer,</i>

90
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,662
<i>we do everything</i>

91
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,350
<i>we can...</i>
\You knew we had to present today.

92
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,256
We had
a very clear deadline.

93
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,009
Yeah, well, cleaning up
the mess you made

94
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,216
has no clear end at all.

95
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:16,833
What mess?
What are you talking about?

96
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,412
The mess you made when you
decided to waive

97
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,716
Rebecca Froy's settlement
against your grandfather,

98
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,107
thereby allowing her
to speak publicly about it,

99
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,261
which sent our foundation's
board of directors

100
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:27,474
into a massive soaking
of their collective britches,

101
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,982
which I had to sop up.
That mess.

102
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,084
What settlement are you
talking about?

103
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,748
Sexual harassment.

104
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,053
<i>To revolutionize the way that...</i>

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Close your mouth
before you catch a fly.

106
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:39,052
Dr. Orr!

107
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,209
We'll talk later.

108
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:43,388
Dr. Orr
so nice to see you, darling.

109
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:49,771
So, when you apply
the Path Pen to tissue,

110
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,099
it rapidly identifies

111
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:55,451
whether a cell is healthy...

112
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,869
or cancerous.

113
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,303
So you're showing us a mock-up?

114
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,612
No, no. It's functional.

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,742
I mean, it's still in the testing stage,

116
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:04,951
but, at this point,

117
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,748
approximately 80%
of all tumor types we sampled

118
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,157
are in the database,

119
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:11,849
and we hope for 100%
in the next few months.

120
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,177
- Wow. That is impressive.
- <i>The Pen uses a...</i>

121
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,849
Impressive? It's like
a drug-sniffing dog for cancer.

122
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,154
- We're screwed.
- Shh! Our idea's good, too.

123
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:20,629
<i>Mass spectrometer,</i>

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,614
<i>The device...</i>

127
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,007
Hey, Peggy, Dayna.

128
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:29,406
What's going on? Are you okay?
Is... Is the baby okay?

129
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:30,908
No, no, no, we're fine. Rose is fine.

130
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,374
It's the cookies.

131
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,140
I'm sorry?
You paged me 911.

132
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,605
- We're so sorry.
- We need the cookies back.

133
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:37,180
- We're so sorry.
- It was an accident.

134
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,664
Do you still have them?
Please say that you still have them.

135
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,421
The cookies? All of the cookies?

136
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,397
All the cookies,
all of the cookies.

137
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,241
<i>Current procedures use
a portion of the small intestine</i>

138
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,093
but the result can still have
some practical limitations,

139
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,171
due to its ability to secrete fluid...

140
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,647
peritoneal tissue is a good choice

141
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:55,046
- for vaginal reconstruction...
- Hi. Um.

142
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,948
- <i>Now let's look at slides.</i>
- Could you, um...

143
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,406
do you see that cookie tin up there?

144
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,820
C-Could you go get
those cookies for me?

145
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,562
I'm a little, uh,
wobbly. I can't.

146
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,246
I'm not going up there.

147
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,147
Go eat the cafeteria cookies

148
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:08,569
from the green room.

149
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,170
Okay.

150
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,171
Come here.

151
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,397
My patient accidentally
used peanut-butter cannabis

152
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:19,008
that her wife had got her when
she was going through chemo.

153
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,000
One thing led to another,
and, um, I seem to have given

154
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,140
a lot of people weed cookies,

155
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,796
um, with an unknown
and immeasurable amount

156
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,054
of weed in them.

157
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,491
<i>The peritoneum naturally
regenerates within days.</i>

158
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:33,674
She came to us with the idea...

159
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,174
Who had the cookies?

160
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,476
Who didn't?

161
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:39,727
<i>And that's when I told them,
uh, you know,</i>

162
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:43,429
<i>I said, "Hey. We can make
a better vagina, you know?"</i>

163
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:44,795
I'm gonna go back.

164
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,905
That sounds, uh...
That sounds wrong.

165
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:50,093
Vaginas are terrific
the way they are, honestly.

166
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,957
I love 'em, you know.

167
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,944
Um, I came from one, so...

168
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,944
This one, hers, actually.
Hey, Ma.

169
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,923
That's not what the script says.

170
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,702
What do we do?
What do we do?

171
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,147
What?

172
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:04,479
Oh, my God.

173
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,987
This one.

174
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:11,392
This is bad.

177
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,945
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
we are postponing

178
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:26,836
the remainder of
today's presentation.

179
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,018
Please raise your hand

180
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,789
if you ate any cookies from this tin.

181
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:36,717
Oh.

182
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,379
Unfortunately, the cookies in this tin

183
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,704
were tainted with rat poison.

184
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:45,492
So we need to treat those of you
who have ingested them

185
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,921
as soon as possible, please.

186
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,695
Okay. False alarm.

187
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,358
The cookies had marijuana
in them.

188
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,500
What?!

189
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,169
Yes. I didn't want to scare you.

190
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,500
So you went with rat poison?

191
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:01,842
You scared me to death.

192
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:03,554
- What?
- You knew they had weed in them.

193
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,359
Right. Yeah. I-I forgot.

194
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,711
Okay, so listen.

195
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,601
No one goes anywhere
until you're sober.

196
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,506
Ingesting marijuana
has a much stronger effect,

197
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:15,422
and it lasts much longer
than when you smoke it, so...

198
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:18,057
True story. We get kids
in the ER all the time...

199
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,628
They had... had...
They like the cookies

200
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:20,671
and the brownies and the candies.

201
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,271
They should really label
that stuff better.

202
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:24,285
So everyone stays here.

203
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,866
There's no medicine, no surgery,
and no patient interaction.

204
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,702
Yeah, I... Yeah, I'm just
gonna send

205
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,606
- some orders.
- No, you're not gonna send anything!

206
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,782
- Give your note to Jo.
- Wait. You're taking our phones?

207
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,180
Everyone,
give your phones to Wilson.

208
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,812
She will handle your patients,
your post-ops, and your charts.

209
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:39,879
So you're gonna do
all of our work?

210
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,131
- Yes, she's gonna reassess
- Yeah.

211
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:42,310
- And rearrange. It's gonna be great.
- Yeah.

212
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,985
You're so pretty.
You look like a cartoon.

213
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,508
- Okay, okay.
- You should look into it.

214
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:47,972
- Phones now.
- Jackson.

215
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,646
Everybody stay

216
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:50,726
- here.
- Right.

217
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,185
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

218
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:54,271
Andrew?

219
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:56,864
Andrew, you in there?

220
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,630
- Andrew?
- Who are we talking about?

221
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,083
Hey, Andrew?

222
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,950
Pierce? Oh, God, Pi...
Andrew. Pi... Pierce!

223
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:06,114
Pierce? Hey, Pierce.
Stop. Stop!

224
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,528
- Hey.
<i>- They called.</i>

225
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,950
They called, and they said
that he's coming today.

226
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,341
<i>- I'm not ready.
- Wait.</i>

227
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,505
Wait up. Who called?

228
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,806
DSHS.
They're bringing me a foster kid.

229
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:16,989
- Today?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

230
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,272
<i>I just had the home inspection,</i>

231
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,350
and they said, "We'll call you."

232
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,422
I didn't think
it would be this soon,

233
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,185
and now they're bringing me
a baby boy.

234
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:25,341
I said I could take ages zero to 17,

235
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,036
and they're bringing me zero.

236
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,350
Well, that's amazing, right?

237
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:30,344
I just got off a 36-hour shift,

238
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,223
and I came home to sleep,
and I... I don't have anything.

239
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,297
You're gonna be fine.

240
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:35,663
<i>Do you need me
to come over and help?</i>

241
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,789
No, no. No, no, no, no.

242
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,109
<i>It's... Th-This is
what I wanted, and...</i>

243
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,741
How soon can you get here?

244
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,670
- I'll be right over.
<i>- Dr. Schwartz to the ER.</i>

245
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,484
Hey. Hi. Have you seen Pierce?

246
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,562
No. What's with him?

247
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,392
A patient brought in
accidental weed cookies.

248
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,602
And he ate a lot of them.

249
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,695
And Pierce ate one, too.

250
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,204
Oh, my God. Yeah,
I will help you look.

251
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,086
Let me, uh,
call Owen and let him know

252
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,549
I will be there as soon as I can.

253
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:57,570
Is Owen okay?

254
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,711
Yeah. He, uh... He's getting
a foster kid today.

255
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:04,091
Pierce. Pierce.
Hey. Stop.

256
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:06,192
I... You...
You go. I got this.

257
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,674
- You got this.
- Stop! Let's go.

258
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,797
Oh, come along. Hey, we got to go.

259
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:11,971
Come on.

260
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,320
Come on. Got to go.

261
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,195
Hey, come on.

262
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,336
Hey, Pierce!

263
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,101
You're supposed to be
in the theater.

264
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,672
I ate marijuana.

265
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,554
I know.

266
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,070
I never had marijuana before.

267
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:24,633
Oh, that's... Really?

268
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:27,337
I've been drunk before,
and... I-I make poor choices.

269
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:28,683
Really embarrassing choices
when I'm drunk.

270
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,485
- So I just need to be alone.
- No. No, no, no, no.

271
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:31,751
You have never been high before.

272
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:33,445
You need to be with people who...

273
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,719
who can help you
and keep you safe.

274
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,961
I don't...

275
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:40,148
I don't think
I need my neck anymore.

276
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,562
Okay, just... Here. Come here.

277
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,117
Just go in here.

278
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,543
Oh, my God.

279
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,336
Can you come on?

280
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:54,240
<i>Dr. Edell to the NICU.
Dr. Edell to the NICU.</i>

281
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,852
- Alex?
- I figured out how to make

282
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,977
the ultrasound work.

283
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:59,232
It needs more water.
A waterfall.

284
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,468
Uh, hold up, Dr. Frankenstein.

285
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:03,349
Did you eat cookies this morning?

286
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,170
Oh, yeah. It was so good.
Are there more cookies?

287
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,593
Or, uh, chips?

288
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,141
- Okay.
- You got chips?

289
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,763
You're just coming with me.

290
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,616
Okay, but
why didn't you say anything?

291
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,529
Mnh. Turns out there's
no good time to tell your son

292
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,299
that his grandfather
is a sexual predator.

293
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,748
He isn't.
He was.

294
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:24,138
So... So the accusations are
accurate from Rebecca Frog?

295
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,279
Uh, Frond?

296
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,707
- Froy, Froy.
- Froy.

297
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,045
No, that's not right. It was like a...

298
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:30,944
Rebecca Froy's story was true.

299
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,701
All the stories were true.

300
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,016
Wait. What do you mean "all"?

301
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,892
You said "all."
"All the stories"? What's that?

302
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,271
There was many stories...
some ugly, some very ugly.

303
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,059
How many?
How many stories?

304
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:43,196
- 13. 13 women... all under NDAs...
- 13?

305
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,792
All secret!

306
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:45,859
Shh!

307
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,234
This is bad. This is so bad.

308
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,039
This is indispensable...
fensible... indefensible.

309
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:54,684
- What are you looking for?
- My glasses!

310
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,723
Oh.

311
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:00,426
13, Mom?

312
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,762
13.

313
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:02,973
Some attendings

314
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,510
have unexpectedly
become... unavailable.

315
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,275
You will be taking over
their services...

316
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,522
rounding, charting,
whatever needs to get done.

317
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,127
This is a chance for you
to step up.

318
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,676
Isn't that what
we normally do?

319
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,640
It is the same,

320
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,520
- but, also, more.
- This is a contest.

321
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,044
So keep track of
everything you do,

322
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,458
and whoever accomplishes
the most by the end of the day

323
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:21,969
gets to scrub in with me
on a whipple.

324
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,435
- Me! I want to do that.
- Yes. Yes, please.

325
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:24,403
- Okay. Go.
- Go.

326
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,114
- Okay.
- Oh, wait. Hold on.

327
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:27,835
Did anyone
eat cookies this morning?

328
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,668
A patient brought in cookies
that had rat poison in them.

329
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,597
They were weed cookies,
accidental weed cookies.

330
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,992
They were in a floral tin.
Did anyone eat them?

331
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,842
- No.
- No.

332
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,183
- No.
- Nope.

333
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,529
- Okay. Get to work.
- Okay. Now go.

334
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,114
Uh, yes.

335
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,597
Okay. Bailey's
paging me a 911 from the OR.

336
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,942
I got to go.

337
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,409
Dr. Bailey.

338
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:58,853
Grey. I'm feeling dizzy
and light-headed and...

339
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,216
I think something's
wrong with her.

340
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,292
I think I know what it is.

341
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,908
Can we page Jo Wilson?

342
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,533
I thought it was my heart.

343
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,911
No, this is your brain
on drugs.

344
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,009
Wait. All of them?

345
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:14,330
All of my attendings
had a cookie, Grey?

346
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,150
No, just a few and you.

347
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,900
Oh, this is bad.

348
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:20,070
This is very,
very bad.

349
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,103
I opened that man up.

350
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:24,142
I'm into his peritoneum.

351
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:25,291
I'm into him.

352
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:29,012
Dr. Bailey,
it's okay. I'm here.

353
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,637
I'm going to finish this for you.

354
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,074
- Total gastrectomy.
- Mm.

355
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,841
I got it. I called Jo Wilson.

356
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,169
- Hey.
- She's gonna come...

357
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,235
- Hey.
- She's here.

358
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,759
Wilson's here. Why?

359
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,988
Dr. Bailey had a cookie.

360
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,556
Oh, crap.

361
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,109
Why are you laughing?

362
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,439
This is not funny.

363
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:47,348
This is very not funny.
I'm the chief.

364
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,298
It's very serious.

365
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,705
Will you take the chief
up to the lecture hall, please?

366
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,159
Yes. Yes.

367
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,744
- I have this, Dr. Bailey, okay?
- Mnh.

368
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:56,656
You'll do a good job?

369
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:59,351
'Cause he's very sweet,
and his kids are very scared.

370
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,103
Dr. Bailey. I have this.

371
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,822
- I love you.
- Oh, my.

372
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,180
- Okay, okay.
- Ohh!

373
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,125
What?

374
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:10,555
- Oops.
- Go, go, go.

375
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,365
I don't think they're broken,
but they're too swollen to move.

376
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:19,961
- This is a bad idea.
- It's the only idea.

377
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:21,801
He's already open,
and this procedure

378
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,055
takes delicate suturing,
which I cannot do.

379
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:26,344
But I've never done
a gastrectomy by myself before.

380
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,747
Yeah, but you've watched a lot.

381
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,037
You can do this.
I believe in you.

382
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,266
Okay, now you sound stoned.

383
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,633
Dr. Grey, patient's BP is dropping a bit.

384
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,094
Scrub.

385
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,802
- Hey.
- Calvary's here.

386
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,771
- Oh.
- Is the baby here yet?

387
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:40,165
Not... Not yet. What...
What's he doing here?

388
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:41,391
The baby's not sick, I hope.

389
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,995
A patient accidentally
brought in pot cookies.

390
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,303
He's high.

391
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:46,946
So you brought him here?

392
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,704
Well, I wanted to get here
as fast as possible.

393
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:49,833
I didn't want you to freak out.

394
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,107
Oh, yeah. Bingo.

395
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:53,126
And I couldn't leave him
alone in my lab

396
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:54,595
full of very expensive equipment.

397
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:55,970
- Huh.
- Are you okay?

398
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,664
- Did you eat a cookie?
- No, no.

399
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,927
I am waiting for a 6-month-old,

400
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,885
and you bring a stoned guy
to my house?!

401
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,275
We'll just make him hide in the back

402
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,303
while the social worker's where.

403
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,680
Listen... you go shower.

404
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:06,079
I'm gonna take care
of cleaning the house.

405
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,274
Okay, okay. I can't believe
this is happening.

406
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,819
It is. It's good.

407
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,750
- Uh!
- Hm, hm, dude.

408
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:17,742
You're so screwed
right now.

409
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,621
- Hey.
- Hey!

410
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,625
This room is occupied.

411
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:26,898
- Oops.
- It's okay.

412
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:29,673
- Sorry, hi. I'm... sorry.
- Just... It's fine.

413
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,689
- What do we do now?
- Huh?

414
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,212
Oh, we just have to wait for it
to pass.

415
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,916
But we can... I mean, we can
hang out and talk, you know?

416
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,314
- Just say whatever comes into our heads.
- Mm.

417
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,533
Just press "play"
and... see what comes out.

418
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,912
I really want some cheese.

419
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,298
I pressed fast-forward
on Carina, I think.

420
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:56,095
It's... such a good food.

421
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:57,892
There are so many kinds.

422
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,994
I asked her to...
I asked her to stay here

423
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:01,587
instead of going back to Italy.

424
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,439
Oh. Cheddar.

425
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:05,900
String cheese.

426
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,434
Brie.

427
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:08,644
The kind with the holes
in it. It's...

428
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,620
You know, we haven't even really
been dating that long.

429
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:11,977
Swiss!

430
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,423
Oh, I probably freaked her out.

431
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,299
I mean, who... who asks a person

432
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,822
to give up their country for them?

433
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,595
Sometimes I just stand
in the cheese section

434
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,611
of the grocery store and just...

435
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,205
Mozzarella.

436
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:33,283
Gouda. Munster.

437
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:34,849
She'd be a woman
without a country.

438
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,384
Dill Havarti.

439
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,047
Whoa!

440
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,846
It goes away.

441
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:43,209
Oh, and then it comes back.

442
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,297
Goes away.

443
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,275
- No country.
- Comes back.

444
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:51,088
It goes away. Comes back.

445
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,496
What happened?

446
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,918
I heard something I think
I should not have heard.

447
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,088
Also, I've never done pot before.

448
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,992
Oh, neither have I.
I listen to Mr. T.

449
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:24,558
Mr. T said...

450
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,369
"Kid, don't do drugs."

451
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:27,464
"Stay in school."

452
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,041
"Treat your mama right."

453
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,916
I followed Mr. T to a "T."

454
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:34,690
I dared to stay off drugs.

455
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:37,166
What did you hear?

456
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:38,726
I don't hear anything.

457
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,541
No. What did you hear?

458
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:41,784
About what?

459
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:43,754
You said you heard something
you shouldn't have.

460
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,148
- What did you hear?
- Oh.

461
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,691
Oh, my God!

462
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,666
Oh, it was...
it was bad.

463
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,576
It was... really
end-of-an-era bad.

464
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,469
It's the end of an era.

465
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:59,731
I thought marijuana
made people peaceful,

466
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,312
but I don't think
I ever hated you more.

467
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,670
Okay, I just divided
the gastrocolic ligament,

468
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,638
and now I'm gonna take down
the short gastric arteries,

469
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,974
which I'll ligate with 2-0 silks.

470
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,302
Does that sound good?

471
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,170
Okay.

472
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,404
- Wait, hang on.
- Hmm.

473
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,537
Bailey said a total gastrectomy?

474
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,927
- Yes. Why?
- Well, because

475
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,802
the tumor feels smaller
and more localized

476
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,920
than it did on the scans.

477
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,747
Why wouldn't Bailey want
to save more of his stomach?

478
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:33,839
I'm not sure.

479
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,443
She doesn't want the guy
to die of cancer... I know that.

480
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:39,287
Do you think we can do
a subtotal gastrectomy?

481
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:40,802
What do <i>you</i> think?

482
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,841
Can I take a look at the pre-op scans?

483
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,123
I don't have them.

484
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:47,589
Can I see the scans?

485
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,318
Of course, Doctor.

486
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,334
Okay.

487
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:57,248
There's 13 women.
How did I not know that?

488
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,545
I mean H-How did I... How...

489
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,096
Why are you so calm?

490
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,638
The cookie might have
something to do with it.

491
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:07,717
You're messing with me.

492
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:08,860
- No, I'm not.
- Very funny.

493
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,678
You're messing with me
because I'm a little high.

494
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:13,505
- Or because <i>you're</i> a little high.
- This is not a joke, Jackson.

495
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:16,091
This is a secret
you let out of the bag.

496
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,677
How could this even be kept
a secret at all?

497
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,253
Money, honey.
Good God, don't be naive.

498
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,505
A fortune was paid
to silence those women.

499
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:25,002
No. I understand that, okay?

500
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,271
I'm saying, "Why?"
Why would anyone protect him?

501
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,682
Why didn't anybody try to stop him?
Why didn't you try to stop him?

502
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,474
Because that's not
how it worked.

503
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:36,068
And... the hope was,
for some, that,

504
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,682
if the financial hit to your
grandfather was great enough,

505
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,615
he would stop the behavior.

506
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,771
And he did.
He did stop.

507
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,834
Oh.

508
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:50,373
You did this.

509
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:55,123
You covered this up.

510
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:03,052
Oh, Mom.

511
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,817
I'm gonna need child locks and stuff.

512
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,358
Not yet. Not till they're crawling.

513
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,560
Babies are easy.

514
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,304
You just have to support
their necks like this.

515
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:15,491
You were supposed
to stay in the bedroom

516
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:16,860
until after
the social worker leaves.

517
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,443
Smells like Owen in there.

518
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,664
Oh, crap.
I just crushed chip baby.

519
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:24,224
Get back there.

520
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,943
This chip smells like Owen.

521
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,560
- They're here already.
- Okay.

522
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:34,858
- Take a deep breath.
- Didn't think it would be a baby.

523
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,311
I thought it would be a kid
who I could win over

524
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:38,334
with, you know,
conversation and ice cream,

525
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,459
but a baby?

526
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:40,569
- I just...
- Okay, Owen. Look at me.

527
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:41,876
We're just gonna take a minute.

528
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,740
I can't think of anyone who is
more prepared for parenthood...

529
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:47,607
- Hi.
- Dr. Hunt?

530
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:51,213
I'm Elaine Hodge, DSHS.

531
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:52,862
And this is Leo.

532
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,171
No, no. <i>I'm</i> Dr. Hunt. Owen.

533
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,475
And this is my friend, Amelia.

534
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,734
Oh, he's cute.
You got a cute one.

535
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,679
Sometimes, they look like
an old man.

536
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,299
- Who's this?
- He's just a... you know...

537
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:06,455
Dr. Alex Karev.

538
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,953
I'm the Chief of, uh, Pediatric
Surgery at Grey-Sloan.

539
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,132
I came by to give the baby
a quick check-up.

540
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,970
Make sure he doesn't have
signs of jaundice

541
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,713
or RSV or rickets.

542
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:20,104
That is so nice. Here you go.

543
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,573
- No.
- No, no. I-I got him.

544
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,801
I got him. I got him. I got him.

545
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,570
Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

546
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,743
Hey.

547
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,477
Would you like some chips?

548
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:34,712
<i>Engineering to 3 West.
Engineering to 3 West.</i>

549
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,220
Oh, Dr. Qadri.

550
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,681
What happened to the board?

551
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,415
Dr. Grey cancelled everything.

552
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:42,939
It looks like she postponed
the contest, too.

553
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,436
- Why?
- I don't know.

554
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:47,392
Um, there was a situation...

555
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,056
with some cookies.

556
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:52,032
Cook... Cookies?

557
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,608
Yes! I'm here. I'm here first!

558
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:57,720
Patient's in septic shock.

559
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,290
Systolic's in the 90s and falling,

560
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,220
heart rate 130s.

561
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,477
He had a bolus of LR, but...

562
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,384
Oh, man.
He needs a central line.

563
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,641
Then put one in!

564
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,117
I... You do it.

565
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,400
I can't! You're the surgeon.

566
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,798
No, I can't. I'll get someone!

567
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:12,108
Dr. Roy! I need help in here!

568
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,359
- Watch out.
- Help!

569
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:19,389
Oh. Helm, go. Take him.

570
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,842
Parker, help me with Roy.

571
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,802
My patient needs a central line!

572
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,866
- I'm on it!
- Casey, get some gloves.

573
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,115
Got it.

574
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,186
Easy, Roy. Easy.

575
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,834
I see why Bailey wanted
to remove the whole stomach.

576
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:39,029
The tumor is huge. It looks
like it's in the cardia.

577
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:41,396
I should just follow
standard of care,

578
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:42,580
a total resection, right?

579
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:43,816
Why do you keep asking me?

580
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:44,949
Because you aren't answering.

581
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:46,784
What are the considerations?

582
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:50,527
Okay, okay,
if I do a total gastrectomy,

583
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,472
it'll make sure
I remove all the cancer,

584
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,092
but he'll eat through
a feeding tube

585
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,339
for the rest of his life.

586
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:57,863
If I leave part of the stomach,

587
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,826
then he'll have
a way better quality of life

588
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,834
unless I leave behind cancer cells,

589
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:04,839
in which case, he dies
because I kill him.

590
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,153
Okay, you know what?
I'm... I'm doing a total.

591
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,379
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm a resident.

592
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:11,876
I should just follow
the surgery as planned.

593
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:14,245
You're supposed to do
what's best for the patient.

594
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,323
He's not my patient...
he's Bailey's,

595
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:17,889
and she handed him off
to you, not me,

596
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,487
- so what do I do?
- Wilson, you're a surgeon.

597
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,158
Pull up your big-girl scrubs
and make a call.

598
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,933
- There's a life in your hands.
- I know.

599
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,336
I just wish
there was some way to know

600
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,669
that I was removing
all of the cancer

601
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:29,558
and not leaving any behind...

602
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:33,136
The Pen. I need the Pen.

603
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:35,050
I have one in my lab coat.
It's not sterile.

604
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:37,386
No, no, no.
I need you to find Dr. Webber.

605
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:39,860
Okay, easy, easy.

606
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:40,948
Oh, Dr. Webber, I...

607
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:42,294
Oh, my God! What happened?!

608
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,342
Okay, it was an accident.
We need to get him to trauma.

609
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:45,952
- What do you need, Schmitt?
- I'm supposed to ask

610
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,370
to borrow your...
your Path Pen.

611
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:49,009
And Dr. Grey and Dr. Wilson
want to know

612
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,808
if it can detect
gastric adenocarcinoma.

613
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:53,739
It can, and it's in my office,
but I don't want you to go...

614
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:55,128
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

615
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:57,658
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

616
00:22:57,981 --> 00:22:59,916
Let's move. Now.

617
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,734
Does it feel right with Carina?

618
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:07,953
Boop.

619
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:09,980
'Cause, you know,
sometimes you can feel scared,

620
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:11,835
but, then,
you're lying together at night,

621
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,015
and it just feels right.

622
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,465
Yeah.

623
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:17,304
Yeah, it feels right.

624
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:21,051
Callie is fun and funny,
and the sex is really great.

625
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,720
- Carina.
- Hm? What?

626
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:23,633
You said "Callie."

627
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,890
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

628
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,086
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

629
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:29,615
- You're high!
- Yes, I am, but you said it.

630
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,577
Press the "rewind" button
on your mind.

631
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:35,832
Oh, my God. I did.

632
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,668
Why did I...
Why did I do that?

633
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:39,047
- Boop.
- They're very different people.

634
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,588
They don't laugh alike.
They don't walk alike.

635
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,713
They definitely don't talk alike.

636
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,299
- Boop.
- So that's weird.

637
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,341
Boop. I like that sound.

638
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,238
But both of them
definitely know

639
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,978
how to make me lose my mind...

640
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,580
- in bed.
- Hey, where's the liver?

641
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,096
- Then...
- I lost the liver!

642
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:55,509
Callie just went away.

643
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,540
She took my daughter and
got on a plane, and she left.

644
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,309
What? Um. Have you seen it?

645
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:01,318
It's... It's liver-shaped.

646
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,283
Maybe Eliza Minnick
took a plane, too.

647
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:06,096
I have no idea because
she ghosted me, so

648
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:07,791
- Okay, it's red.
- There's that.

649
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,728
It helped metabolize things,

650
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,057
it eliminated toxins,
and now it's gone!

651
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,519
Eventually,
everyone leaves me.

652
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,512
You know?

653
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,249
- They got on...
- I lost the liver.

654
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:19,767
Planes or ghostmobiles
or wherever...

655
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:20,960
they just disappear.

656
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:24,187
And maybe that's why I held on
so hard to Carina, you know?

657
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,398
Like I was afraid that I was
gonna lose her like I...

658
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,820
like I lose everybody else.

659
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:30,874
Maybe I'm just scared
of repeating the past.

660
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,539
- What if she dies?!
- Whoa.

661
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:34,464
Because I lost the liver!

662
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:38,953
It's not... It's not good.

663
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,771
I'm not surprised.

664
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:44,148
I met Harper Avery two times,
and he was awful.

665
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,800
Awful man.

666
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:49,416
He had a beak like an owl
and a very dry mouth.

667
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:52,554
I have a very dry mouth.
Do you have that?

668
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:56,882
Grey has a Harper Avery.
She is part of a family legacy.

669
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,859
Yang was nominated for one.

670
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,765
She was the best
in our class.

671
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:05,945
I always wanted
a Harper Avery.

672
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,173
I had a Jackson Avery.

673
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,015
It's not the same thing.

674
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:11,765
I have a secret.

675
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:13,578
I don't even need this contest,

676
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:17,273
'cause I just signed a contract
with a manufacturer.

677
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:18,864
Mm. I'm gonna be rich.

678
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,237
They cannot keep a secret.

679
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:23,187
- I know about Harper.
- Mm.

680
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,735
- And I know about Maggie.
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,648
We're going
to make the TrailBlazer.

682
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,882
Me and Midnight Pleasures, Inc.

683
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,710
I saw them pull into
the parking lot together.

684
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,851
They live on opposite sides of town.

685
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,289
There's only one reason
that they would carpool.

686
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,311
My husband said,
"You really want to go

687
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,593
into business with
a sex-toy company?"

688
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,320
But I have a secret,
too.

689
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:45,624
I've been seeing someone.

690
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:48,710
I said to him,
"I have a colonoscopy device.

691
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,007
It goes into people's rectums.

692
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:55,278
This company already has items
that function similarly.

693
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,851
Don't make it nasty."

694
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:00,164
Wait. What?

695
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,618
You're making
your colonoscopy TrailBlazer

696
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,014
with a sex-toy company?

697
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:07,359
Meredith Grey
called it the "TAILBlazer."

698
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,507
That's where I got the idea.

699
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,742
Dr. Schmitt? Is it over?

700
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,697
Dr. Bailey said
it wouldn't take this long.

701
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,107
- Is he okay?
- He's not out yet.

702
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,273
I had to get some equipment
so we can finish.

703
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,656
Oh, my God. What is that?

704
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,706
Something went wrong, didn't it?

705
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:37,093
Something unexpected?

706
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,953
Is my dad gonna die?

707
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,794
Please don't let him die,
Dr. Schmitt.

708
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,359
No. No. There's no complication.

709
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:47,078
And I will do everything I can
to make sure he's all right.

710
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,843
In fact, I'm gonna do that right now.

711
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,428
What was I thinking?

712
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:00,559
You can tell, right, that
I don't know what I'm doing?

713
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,298
"Yes, I hate you already.

714
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,589
You're the worst."

715
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:04,807
Alex, stop it.

716
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,810
"No, you're making me
high-strung and competitive

717
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:08,000
as we speak!"

718
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,947
- You are not helping.
- No, no. He's right.

719
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,792
They say all those kids tend
to have type-A personalities

720
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,485
'cause their parents are so stressed

721
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:15,605
about every little thing,

722
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,080
and then, second baby comes along

723
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:18,789
and they're more comfortable,

724
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:20,574
so that kid gets
to be more easygoing.

725
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,326
You just explained so much.

726
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,816
Yeah, I always thought Megan
was lucky that way.

727
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,656
I was thinking about me being
the youngest of five.

728
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:28,120
"Am I getting a little sister?

729
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,417
When's she coming?"

730
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,683
Alex.

731
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:33,810
Wait. This isn't the way
to the store.

732
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:36,816
Nope. This group is not ready
to be seen in public,

733
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:38,612
but I know where to get
everything you need

734
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,515
because my sister-in-law
is a pack rat.

735
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,542
"Daddy, can I have a pony?"

736
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,003
Shh, shh.

737
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,921
It really works?

738
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,519
Well, it's supposed to.
It's still in the testing stage.

739
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:56,998
We're testing it? On this guy?

740
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:58,956
He... He's got a wife and two kids.

741
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:02,066
They're very nice, and they really,
really want him to stay alive.

742
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:03,723
And I promised them
I'd make sure he gets

743
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,980
the best possible care.

744
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,410
So, maybe, Dr. Grey,

745
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,438
- if you could just tell Dr. Wilson...
- Schmitt, be quiet. She's got it.

746
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:11,876
Hey, look. The distal end...

747
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,328
Adenocarcinoma.

748
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,555
But if I go one centimeter proximally...

749
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:19,532
It works.

750
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,563
It's working.

751
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:23,388
Oh, my God.

752
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:26,805
I'm gonna save half his stomach.

753
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,243
Linear stapler.

754
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:43,524
Time of death... 16:06.

755
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:46,024
Acute liver...

756
00:28:46,296 --> 00:28:47,876
disappearance.

757
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,238
We did everything we could,
but we could not save her.

758
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,008
Our thoughts and prayers are with her,

759
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,649
her family, and her friends.

760
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,762
Good. Now you'll want
to ligate the branch.

761
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:26,149
Why are you letting them
do this?

762
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,563
Because they need to practice.

763
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:28,845
Does it have to be on me?

764
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:30,668
Roy, I'm gonna give you
a light sedation.

765
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:32,071
Thank you.

766
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,267
Mm.

767
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:38,016
Wait. Wait.

768
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:40,102
Is that diazepam?

769
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:42,962
Does that interact with...
other drugs?

770
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,422
Okay, we fed you. We changed you.

771
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,898
Everything's okay.

772
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:53,086
This is a very, very, very long scarf.

773
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:54,244
That's a Moby.

774
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:56,752
You wrap it around yourself and
the baby so you can carry him.

775
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,216
Okay, calm down.
Calm down, Leo.

776
00:29:58,283 --> 00:30:00,352
It's okay. It's okay.

777
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,486
Do you want a diaper genie?

778
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:02,891
Does he come to the house?

779
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:04,702
Uh, I guess so.

780
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,066
How do you know
what all this stuff is?

781
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,305
You'll figure it out.

782
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,669
Okay, I got you.
I got you. Shh, shh, shh.

783
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,461
Amelia?

784
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:14,246
Was this a bad idea?

785
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:17,040
What? No.
You've wanted this forever.

786
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,948
Yeah, I know what I wanted,
but what about him?

787
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,055
You know, who's to say
I was supposed to be a father?

788
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:23,644
Maybe this was all going
how it was supposed to,

789
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:24,879
- and I just forced it.
- Owen,

790
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,056
what you're doing is
beautiful.

791
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,163
You're fostering him.

792
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,917
You're...
You're being there for him

793
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:29,987
when nobody else is.

794
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:31,867
- Ha!
- My foster parents sucked.

795
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:33,391
- Alex!
- No, for real.

796
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,500
They just stuck me in a room
with some other kids

797
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,281
and then collected a check.

798
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:39,742
Except for one.
There was one guy.

799
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,752
He worked nights
in a warehouse.

800
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,962
Come home, dead tired
at the crack of dawn,

801
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:45,870
and... go straight to bed.

802
00:30:45,937 --> 00:30:47,938
But then, an hour later,
he'd wake up,

803
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:50,159
just so he could eat cereal with me

804
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,391
and tell me,
you know, "Have a good day,"

805
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:54,526
before I went to school.

806
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:55,805
Then he'd go back to sleep.

807
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:01,742
Wasn't much, but, you know,
he just gave a crap, you know?

808
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,289
He gave a crap, and you, my friend,

809
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:08,242
you are giving
so many craps right now.

810
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,266
This man's got it made.

811
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,862
He's not crying.

812
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,946
Look. I did it.

813
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,184
Mnh. Maybe not.

814
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,129
It was a very different time then.

815
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,391
It was his name.
It was his foundation.

816
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:26,510
He made the rules.

817
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:27,932
Oh, please stop talking, Mom.

818
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,203
I'm just trying to help you

819
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:30,065
- understand.
- Well, I wish

820
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,258
- you would help those women.
- Look at me.

821
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,452
You told me to step up.

822
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,681
You wanted to buy this hospital,
I wanted nothing to do with it,

823
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,735
and you said,
"Step up. Take the lead.

824
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,284
Take part in what
this family has built," right?

825
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,274
- And you did.
- You didn't tell me

826
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:42,777
- what the hell it was built on.
- No, no.

827
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:44,235
You do not get to do that.

828
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:47,321
You do not get to stand there
in judgment of me.

829
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:49,660
- That...
- 30 years ago, getting harassed at work,

830
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:52,321
getting groped at work wasn't
something we could protest.

831
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,922
It was something we had to take
with our morning coffee.

832
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:56,374
It was part of the job.

833
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,321
And if we made a noise, if we fussed,

834
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,633
we were told
we were overreacting

835
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,307
and, more often than not,
we lost the job

836
00:32:02,374 --> 00:32:04,500
and our reputation
along with it.

837
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:07,963
I was not then
who I am now.

838
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,703
I didn't have the voice then
that I have now.

839
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,068
I had choices.

840
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,159
I could stand there
and let your grandfather

841
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,625
fire those women
and drag them through the mud,

842
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:20,586
or I could make sure
they got some money,

843
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:24,391
a leg to stand on,
a path to move forward on.

844
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,836
I'm not ashamed of myself,
Jackson,

845
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:33,461
but I am ashamed
of what your grandfather did.

846
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,492
And I'm so sorry that now

847
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,477
you have to carry that burden
along with me.

848
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,407
And I'm sorry that that burden
might just bring this family,

849
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,063
this entire hospital,

850
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,203
and all of his hospitals down.

851
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:53,635
Okay. That's it.

852
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:54,821
Now what?

853
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,260
Well, now we cross
our fingers

854
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,203
and pray
we made the right decision.

855
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,117
You did.

856
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:04,508
You did exactly what I would
have done, except for The Pen.

857
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:06,281
I wouldn't have needed that.

858
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:09,772
You could have saved me a lot
of stress if you told me sooner.

859
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,250
Well, that's not how you learn.

860
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:13,110
I'm pretty sure
having an experienced surgeon

861
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,380
tell you what to do
is exactly how you learn.

862
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,121
You know exactly
what to do.

863
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:18,983
You're a highly competent surgeon.

864
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,359
You've memorized
and practiced every move,

865
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:23,719
but making tough choices
under immense pressure...

866
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,539
that's how you become
a truly great surgeon.

867
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,156
And now you get
to go tell his family that,

868
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:33,227
not only did you save his life,

869
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:35,474
you saved his quality of life.

870
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:38,735
I'm gonna go check on our stoners.

871
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,399
Nice work.

872
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,188
What's happening?

873
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:02,879
We're having a funeral.

874
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:04,293
Whose?

875
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:06,226
Mm, Harper Avery.

876
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:09,228
The Harper Averies.
The end of an era.

877
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,887
What are you talking about?

878
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,051
You were put into
a terrible position, Mom,

879
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,582
and I doubted you.

880
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,556
I forgot who you were
for a moment. I'm sorry.

881
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:32,064
It's all right, baby.

882
00:34:32,255 --> 00:34:33,883
I don't know
what's gonna happen next,

883
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,333
but it's not gonna be good.

884
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,484
Well, we just got to tell the truth

885
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:37,726
and get out ahead of this thing.

886
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:41,288
We'll get in touch with those
women and make this right.

887
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:42,895
Yeah. Yeah.

888
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,199
Tell me it isn't true.

889
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,816
I've spent my whole life
working for that award.

890
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,441
What did Harper Avery do?

891
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:59,238
Well, I guess
we might as well start now.

892
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,615
Mm-hmm.

893
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:03,824
We're gonna start with you,
Meredith.

894
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,751
So, was my mother
one of these women?

895
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:15,949
No. No, your mother
was not one of the women.

896
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,947
So, these women...
they were offered money

897
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,550
in exchange for what exactly?

898
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,973
In exchange for silence
and an agreement

899
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:24,075
that they would never
work at a Harper Avery hospital

900
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:26,285
or enter the Harper Avery Awards.

901
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:28,676
I mean,
my mother spent her career

902
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:31,146
trying to win Harper Avery Awards.

903
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,402
She lost her best friend over it.

904
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,387
His initials take up
half the space in her journals.

905
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:39,292
Oh, my God.

906
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,895
Does the name Marie Cerone
mean anything to you?

907
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,824
Yes.
She was one of the women.

908
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:48,715
So my mother had to take
her name off of the paper

909
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:51,980
or she would never be able
to win a Harper Avery.

910
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,145
Son of a bitch.

911
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:00,926
Will I be able to do surgery again?

912
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,684
No. Your tox screen
came back positive.

913
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:06,841
This morning, you were asked
if you had eaten a cookie,

914
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,145
and you said, "No."

915
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,832
Half the attendings ate those cookies!

916
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,315
And acted responsibly.

917
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,207
You lied so you could get
another surgery.

918
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,809
You put patients at risk.

919
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:17,165
So... I-I'm suspended?

920
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,645
No.

921
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:20,379
You're fired.

922
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,160

934
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,691
I heard about the cookies.

935
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:00,512
