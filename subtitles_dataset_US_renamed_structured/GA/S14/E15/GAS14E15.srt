Hey,
did you get any sleep?

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,164
I was up all night
trying to figure out

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,384
why Cerone hated Ellis.

6
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:14,181
They were friends,
respected colleagues.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,267
Listen to this...

8
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:18,165
"Marie's hepatico-J technique

9
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,656

talking and drinking."

00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:25,429
<i>On average, a healthy
heart beats 115,000 times per day.</i>

11
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,476
And she knew about Richard.

12
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:30,742
"MC says
I'm better off without RW.

13
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,820
He was just a distraction
from work."

14
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,554
Maybe she hated Richard.

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,796
Maybe
she was in love with Ellis.

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,922
Maybe there's a whole
other love triangle

17
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,415
that I don't know about.

19
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:43,821
Are you listening to me?

20
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:46,040
Um... uh, y... ah, no.

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,930
I'm just... I'm a little
distracted today.

22
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,343
I'll say.
You just buttered the kitchen towel,

23
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,359
and your shirt is
on inside out.

24
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,837
What? Mm.

25
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,007
Is this about Clive?

26
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:57,572
Because I told you
that wasn't your fault.

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,523
Yeah... Clive.

28
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,179

00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:06,391

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,937

36
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,992
Ugh.

37
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,992
Shall I whip us up
some mean frittatas

38
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,679
or do the slut-rush home?

00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,961
Second option, please?

40
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,674
Pretty sure you're hungry.

41
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,907
Can you take my robe off?

42
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh, dessert before breakfast...
I like it.

43
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,376
No, I mean, take off my robe,

44
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:43,867
put some clothes on,
and leave my home.

45
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:45,259
I have to vomit,

46
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,892

52
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:01,852
Yeah, I wanted to keep
an eye on Kimmie,

53
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,399
but I told Pierce I'd assist
on a case, so...

54
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:06,024
I'm gonna head back.

55
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,556
Oh, the Dor procedure?
I'm on that, too. Yay!

56
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,174

I haven't seen you all week.

57
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,710
<i>And scar tissue can be
very dangerous in a heart.</i>

58
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,306
<i>- It weakens it.</i>
- What's this?

59
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,407
Oh, fellowship instructions
for next year.

60
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,024
UC San Francisco?

61
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,445
I know. They're ranked
in the top 2% in the country.

62
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,665
Northwestern?

63
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,766
Ambitious,
but I'm applying everywhere.

64
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,766
It's what you do, right?
You coming?

65
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:29,040
<i>And eventually,
a heart full of scars stops working.</i>

66
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:34,148
So, basically, I excise
the scarred part of the heart,

67
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,913
and then reshape
the ventricular cavity geometry,

68
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,921
and then sew in a Dacron patch,
which sounds easy,

69
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,069
but this kid's left ventricle
is completely scarred.

70
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,204
A Dor surgery requires mastery.

71
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:46,955
You should send the interns
to the gallery to watch.

72
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:48,335
Oh, forget them.

73
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,991
I'm rearranging my meetings,
so <i>I</i> can watch.

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,981
They'll just block my view.

75
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,337
Well, the interns are away

76
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,336
taking their, uh, in-training exams.

77
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,016
- Even better.
- Their loss.

00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,641

you're headed to the O.R.

Oh, uh...

80
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:16,716
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm grood, I'm grood. I'm good.

81
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,017
I'm not grood.

82
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:21,242
That's a cross between
great and good.

83
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,024
- Hmm.
- Yeah. People say that.

84
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:24,324
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

No.

No?

89
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,781
Because I am a surgeon,

90
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,705
and I hold human hearts
in my hands,

91
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,336
and I cannot risk
buttering the wrong ventricle.

92
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,150
You're doing what to the...
ventricle?

93
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,699
I'm saying that
I need to focus today.

94
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:44,087
I have a major surgery on a kid and...

95
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,735
I... need to give that
my exclusive focus

96
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:48,994
and... you make my hands shake.

97
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,367
- Got it.
- Yes. Sorry.

98
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,780
Mm-hmm.

99
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,583
I can't drink this.
What am I carrying it for?

100
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,580
Are you watching me walk away?

101
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,646
No. No.

102
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,372
What's his BNP?

103
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:09,215
Uh, it's 750 and
that's after diuresis.

104
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,287
And his ejection fraction is
at 30%,

105
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,700
which is why
we have to do this today.

106
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,710
Do you have any questions
before the surgery?

107
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:18,577
This surgery shall
slay the dragon forevermore?

108
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,213
He means the ECMO machine.

109
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:21,613
They call it "the dragon."

110
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:23,426
Because dragons
can be slain.

111
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,701
By the right knight
at the right moment,

112
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,590
they can always be slain.

113
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,848
That makes you
his knight in shining armor.

114
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,746
And you are?

115
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,456
I'm his knight
in shining other-armor.

116
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,284
That's very poetic.

117
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:39,723
Well, it is my most fervent hope

118
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,832
that we will slay this ECMO dragon
today.

119
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,708
You don't have to play along
with their "costume play."

120
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:44,893
It just encourages them.

122
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:50,635

I didn't pretend anything.

Hey.

164
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,934
I ran a blood gas, CBC, and BMP,

So, the Dor procedure's now
a transplant.

177
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,894
Yeah.

178
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:22,134
- You...
- Which is a good thing, right?

179

a chance at love,

Love? I was promised mastery.

185
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,591
Now I have to go do paperwork.

186
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:39,239
I've been on the list for three
years without a single call,

187
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,218

the Dor, they find me a match?

for on my own heart,

The Dor procedure...
while very, very cool...

196
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,531

197

Before Henry.

202
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,713

fell in love with Henry.

What if the new heart doesn't love him?

204
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,958
That's not how it works.
Love has nothing to do with the heart.

Adrenaline, dopamine,

00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:50,556
so you have to live, and then
you have to fight for him.

350
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,268
Okay?

351
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,914
♪♪

352
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,298
Why are you still here?

353
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,382
Looking for food,
but this is just vodka,

354
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,452
baby food, and questionable cheese.

355
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,838
Do you like paella?

356
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,376
There's a great place
a few blocks away

357
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,757
that, uh, we can...

358
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,233
Are you stalling to see if
we'll have sex again?

359
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,827
No, but I... I like
the way you're thinking.

360
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,712
Except paella isn't sex food.

361
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,804
Too rich.

362
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:19,791
I'll just have this road-yogurt,
then I'll go.

363
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,372
- Oh.
- Sorry.

364
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,718
You have a daughter.

365
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,655
I'm gonna say...

366
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:32,602
Judging by the toys ruining
your decor, I'm gonna say 2-ish.

367
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,008
Please don't do that.

368
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:35,138
Do what?

369
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,751
Feign an interest in me
to get me back into bed.

370
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,082
I will probably go back to bed
with you regardless

371
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:41,540
'cause you're pretty good at sex.

372
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,758
- Hmm.
- So, conversation is not necessary.

373
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,407
Well, thank you for the
"pretty good."

374
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,921
It's an understatement,
but I'll take it.

375
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,158
And I'm not feigning anything.
This is... fascinating.

376
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,287
Yeah? What is?

377
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:53,995
Well, when I met you,
months ago,

378
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,749
Amelia Shepherd had given you
her Power of Attorney.

379
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,583
She trusted you with her life.

380
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:00,753
You remember that?

381
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:01,973
We barely spoke.

382
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:03,874
Oh, I'm incredibly observant.

383
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:04,840
- And... And...
- Oh.

384
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:07,185
Look... I look at your home, here.

385
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,160
Fun toddler detritus,
lots of light, warmth, books.

386
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,537
Your point?

387
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,385
The woman I met last night?

388
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,061
- She doesn't live here.
- Mm?

389
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,551
And she's not a person you trust
with a Power of Attorney.

390
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,491
I'm not sure I should trust you
with my... penis again.

391
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,453
That woman scares me a little.

392
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:26,595
- In a "pretty good" way, but, uh...
- But what?

393
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:30,147
How did that woman become
this woman?

394
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,889
- I'm not gonna get into this with you.
- Uh, no... No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no.

395
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,728
L... No.
Let me do it.

396
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:35,710
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,595
- Uh,
- All right. Alcoholism.

398
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,434
Drugs.

399
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:40,905
Cancer diagnosis.

400
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:43,428
No? Uh... physical trauma?

401
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,450
Uh... dead relative.

402
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,139
Dead pet.

403
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,268
Uh, dead beloved TV-show character.

404
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:50,576
- Oh, my God.
- None of these?

405
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,579
Okay, that leaves, um, metal illness,

406
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,283
acute clinical depression,
crisis of faith.

407
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:57,905
- Stop.
- Crisis of faith.

408
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,402
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:00,974
- God is dead.
- No.

410
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,198
- Ah, yes.
- No, He's not dead.

411
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,119
I just hate Him so much I wish He was.

412
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:10,437
Ah.

413
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:17,097
I don't think my heart
ever looked this healthy.

414
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,217
Even when I was born,

415
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:21,471
I think it was like a raisin
with thunderstorms inside.

416
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,227
Heart is detached.

417
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,367
Wow, it's even
worse than the studies.

418
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:27,697
There's nothing but adhesions
and an aneurysm.

419
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,073
Naming that heart before
you trash it?

420
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,593
Since you're into naming
medical waste?

421
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:31,779
Ha-ha-ha.

422
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,960
Okay, people, wrap it up.

423
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,212
Good.

424
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:38,721
Clean up and sign out when you're done.
Anatomy test tomorrow.

425
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,329
What happens to Len... the cadaver?

426
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:42,768
Like, where does he go now?

427
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,209
Crematorium. Finish by 5:00.

428
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,748
I guess this is it.

429
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:49,454
We're done.

430
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:51,652
Feels weird.

431
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:53,100
We should hang out!

432
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,463
To have a funeral for Leonard.

433
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,305
- H-He deserves that.
- You're right.

434
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:02,238
Yes. But we can't steal a cadaver body.

435
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,669
- Can we?
- Highly unlikely.

436
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,981
I'll cover you.

437
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:13,758
♪♪

438
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:22,862
Okay, wait, you stole
a dissected cadaver heart?

439
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,567
We needed something to bury,
and it was very symbolic.

440
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,604
You stole a human heart so you
could see a boy one more time.

441
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,433
- At a made-up funeral.
- You were so weird.

442
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,169
- I was young.
- You were weird and creepy.

443
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,159
You're so nice now.
What happened?

444
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:40,812
What's wrong?

445
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,127
The heart doesn't fit.

446
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:44,067
What do you mean it doesn't fit?

447
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:48,012
The new heart is too big
for Charlie's chest.

448
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,201
Why the hell didn't we get
precise measurements?

449
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,640
The measurements <i>were</i> precise.

450
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,919
This is probably swelling
from resuscitative edema.

451
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,267
Should we put him back on ECMO?

452
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,585
No, he's already been on ECMO
for far longer than he should.

453
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:07,058
Okay, what if we give him
a total artificial heart?

454
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:08,257
No. We're gonna make this one work.

455
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,159
- How? There's no space.
- Well, we'll create a space.

456
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,726
We'll do a sternal reconstruction.

457
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,068
I mean, we'll make the chest
fit the heart.

458
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:14,787
We can do that, right?

459
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,924
We'll attach the heart now,

460
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,544
and we'll leave him open
in the CCU overnight,

461
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,700
and pump him full of Lasix,
and then when the swelling goes down,

462
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:26,589
we can go back in and cover it
with a sternal muscle flap.

463
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,449
We might need to take out the sternum

464
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,480
and we'll need Avery to close,
but we can do this.

465
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,132
I'll update his mom.

466
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:38,165
What do you mean
you'll leave him open overnight?

467
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:41,746
Well, we won't close his chest
until the swelling goes down.

468
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,012
So his heart will just be unprotected?

469
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,731
We'll... We'll cover him in loban wrap.

470
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:46,720
What is that?

471
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,846
It's, uh... It's kind of like,
uh, plastic wrap

472
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,178
but, uh, medical-grade.

473
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,210
You want to cover my son's heart
in plastic wrap?

474
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,654
Just until the swelling goes down.

475
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:55,633
He'll be in the ICU. He'll be monitored.

476
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,635
We're in this world alone.

477
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,832
It's him and me.

478
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,727
It's always just been him and me,

479
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:10,092
and I will break if he doesn't
come out of this.

480
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:12,332
You understand?

481
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,060
If we broke that boy's heart

482
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,270
and sent him into a surgery
he doesn't recover from...

483
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,799
I will break.

484
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,975

- Mom! Come here. Mom.
- I can hear them.

488
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:31,300
- No, no, no! Mom!
- I can hear them. There's so many.

489
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,583

- We're not safe here!

Come here. Come here.

It's me. It's Alex.

They're all gone.

- There was one. I had to kill one of them.

and the glass right there?

592
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,833

for the first time,

593
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,137
I can do exactly what I want to do.

594
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,875
I have freedom now, I have opportunities
that I didn't have before

595
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:19,537
because I was afraid that
Paul was gonna come find me.

596
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:21,354
You know what,
I can apply anywhere now.

597
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:22,753
I don't have to hide in Seattle.

598
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,779
I thought that you,
of all people, would get that.

599
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:28,421
Look, I'm happy Paul's gone,
and I'm happy you're free.

600
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:30,993
I just didn't realize he was
the only one keeping you here.

601
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,800
- You paged.
- Hi.

602
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:48,571
Yeah, I'm sorry it's so late,
I just need a quick consult.

603
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:50,293
Uh, sure. Yeah, no problem.

604
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:51,627
It's a failed sternal closure

605
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:54,231
after a heart transplant due to edema.

606
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,627
I'm gonna go in tomorrow and
reconstruct the chest cavity,

607
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,131
but I was thinking that we could

608
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,882
cover the chest defect with a flap.

609
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:02,220
Yeah, if it's a huge defect,
I would do an omental flap.

610
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,107
Otherwise, you do
a sternal muscular flap,

611
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,649
provide some cushion for the heart.

612
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,556
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

613
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:09,719
I mean, I was kind of hoping
you'd page me

614
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,255
to go to dinner but I get it.

615
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,189
- I have to stay here.
- I know.

616
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,559
But you've also got to eat.

617
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,624
Good night.

618
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:25,540
I mean, the Bible, the Qur'an,
the Baghavad Gita,

619
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,839
they're all the same book, aren't they?

620
00:26:26,907 --> 00:26:30,319
They all just generally say
how not to be a jerk.

621
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,832
Well, I don't know those other books,

622
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,260
but I know the New Testament.

623
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:36,959
And the Sermon on the Mount,

624
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,859
Jesus gets up there and He says

625
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:41,040
how to behave and
how not to behave.

626
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,622
People flagrantly disregard
His teachings

627
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:45,221
and receive absolutely
no consequences,

628
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,021
while other people
who spend their lives

629
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:52,282
trying to emulate Him and honor
Him are brutally mistreated.

630
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,980
God's off making a bet with the devil

631
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,571
while good people
eat crap sandwiches,

632
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,104
and we're supposed to
eat those sandwiches

633
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:01,758
with a smile on our face.

634
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:03,418
We're supposed to rejoice.

635
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,189
Look, I... I mean, if you didn't
grow up in the church,

636
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,389
you wouldn't understand, so I don't...

637
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,563
Oh, please.
Please, I-I grew up Catholic.

638
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,338
Between the mean nuns,
the hard kneelers,

639
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,248
the touchy priests,
Catholicism told me

640
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:16,017
that I would go to hell
for playing with myself

641
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:18,261
after I'd been doing it
ceaselessly for two years!

642
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,494
I mean, how about a head's up, God?

643
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:22,211
I walked away, too, for a while.

644
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:24,057
- I get it.
- Why, 'cause you couldn't masturbate?

645
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,071
No, no. 'Cause my kid died.

646
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:31,016
Uh, freak accident... at school.

647
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:34,616
Took a baseball bat
to the skull, died instantly.

648
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:35,931
He was 10.

649
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:38,002
It was, uh...

650
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,202
unfair.

651
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,256
So unfair.

652
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:48,008
The priest said
talk to God, but I-I...

653
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:51,218
I wanted to find God
and choke the life out of Him.

654
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,598
I didn't want to talk to God.

655
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,303
I didn't care what He had to say.

656
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,370
I wanted to talk to my son.

657
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:03,883
I was not, um, as delightful
then in that period

658
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,912
as I am now.

659
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,720
I... I was not fit company.

660
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,733
My marriage fell apart. I was alone.

661
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:12,858
So I went to church.

662
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,313
Because in church,

663
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:19,401
you can talk out loud all by
yourself and not look crazy.

664
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,588
So I would go to Mass,

665
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,381
and I would talk to my son.

666
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,427
I still do.

667
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,941
I don't think God left me or I left God.

668
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,055
I just think we got in a fight.

669
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:38,021
That's all.

670
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,476
Your turn.

671
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,220
I thought you were here for more sex.

672
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,740
Ellis wrote about
Cerone in her journals.

673
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:04,564
They talked about Richard.
They had tequila nights.

674
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:07,067
And then one day, she just
stopped writing about her.

675
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:10,646
They went from tequila nights
three times a week to nothing.

676
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,478
I mean, I think Cerone
was my mother's Christina,

677
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:14,974
and I think my mother sharked her.

678
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,091
If Yang published work
that you two did together

679
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,935
only under her name,
would you forgive her?

680
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,114
No.

681
00:29:24,408 --> 00:29:26,993
And I think I might just make it
my life's work to get her back.

682
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:28,411
All right, so what are you gonna
do about it?

683
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,584

- Jo might leave.
- What?

686
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,601
She's applying for
fellowship outside of Seattle.

687
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:38,743
Okay, so she's pursuing her career.

688

I know.

689
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,601
So you can't take her
career ambitions personally.

690
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:45,817

811
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:06,289

818
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,610
And, uh, that kind of blew it

819

you know, cadavers.
