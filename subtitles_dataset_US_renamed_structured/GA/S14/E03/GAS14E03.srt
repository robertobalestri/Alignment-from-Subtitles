176
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:17,200
Um, why don't we all sit down?

177
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:21,122
Grown-ups only, Jackie. Take a walk.

178
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,234
Actually, I hold the
majority vote on the board,

179
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,583
so I'll be staying
to hear your concerns.

180
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,736
And it's "Jackson" or "Dr. Avery."

181
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,779
What is this... backtalk?

182
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,898
It hasn't been "backtalk"
since I was 18.

183
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,258
There's coffee and pastries.

184
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,094
Chief, could I have a minute?

185
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,912
Oh, uh, now isn't a good time.

186
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,160
I understand, but it's urgent.

187
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,308
Then please speak with Dr. Webber,
and he'll fill me in.

188
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,675
Dr. Avery, I'll be more than happy

189
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,078
to walk you through every
decision you're questioning.

190
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,602
I hope you cleared your day.

191
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,906
So, how was the birthday party?

192
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:59,148
Oh, well, there were 23 very
loud superheroes in my house,

193
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:01,636
but justice was served,
and fun was had by all.

194
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,415
It sounds like things
are going pretty well.

195
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,047
Yes, they are.

196
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,652
Except I cannot shake this mood.

197
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:09,092
Mood?

198
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,789
Hi, Dr. Carr.

199
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,312
I need to draw a blood gas
and do an EKG.

200
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:15,673
- I'll do it, Brody.
- Dr. Riggs instructed me to.

201
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,293
I said I'll do it.

202
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:21,320
♪♪

203
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:23,930
That's the mood.

204
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,256
Does Owen know?

205
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,023
What about Meredith and Maggie?

206
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:43,335
No. And I don't want them to know.

207
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,031
How long has this thing been growing?

208
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,242
I'd say close to 10 years.

209
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,801
He can remove the entire tumor.

210
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,662
I can help cover her service,
but she doesn't go near patients

211
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,516
until she's tumor-free and I clear her.

212
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:55,727
That's the only way I stay.

213
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,084
Richard, he can't just decide...

214
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:59,867
Frankly, the entire neuro community
wondered what kind of a surgeon

215
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,031
tackled the tumor in Nicole
Herman's brain, and now we know.

216
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,414
Who's Nicole Herman?

217
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,656
Nicole Herman was a fetal
surgeon who was diagnosed

218
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,887
with an <i>inoperable</i> astrocytoma,
and I saved her life.

219
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:13,348
Yes, we all read the case report,

220
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,129
but you also permanently blinded her.

221
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,178
- That was unavoidable!
- We don't know that now, do we?

222
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,107
- Honey, it'll all be over soon.
- Do not talk to me!

223
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:25,414
Okay, Marnie, you are only
4 centimeters dilated.

224
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,133
What? My water broke hours ago.

225
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:28,914
I know, but your cervix
is being stubborn.

226
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,918
I'll be back, okay?

227
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:32,422
Warren. Good.

228
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,781
I did an ablation on
Marnie's baby at 18 weeks.

229
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,486
To be safe, I want to be
there when she's born,

230
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,536
but the labor's protracted.

231
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,431
Will you monitor her closely
and keep me posted?

232
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:43,062
Uh, did we happen to skip the epidural?

233
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,906
She had one during her last delivery,

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,012
but her BP dropped so low
that she almost arrested,

235
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,420
so that's... that's not an option.

236
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,664
- And Pitocin?
- She's severely allergic.

237
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:51,897
So...

238
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,602
- So... this is your day.
- Yeah.

239
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,649
Let me know when she's 8 centimeters.

240
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:00,898

Pete Hover. 16.

256
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,675
Status... post blunt trauma
to the abdomen and left leg

257
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,523
from hot-air balloon landing
gone wrong.

258
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,039
He also has some flash burns
to the upper extremities.

259
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,363
Does anyone have my phone?!
I need to text Jamie.

260
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,046
I need to know if she saw my Ho-Co-Pro.

261
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,880
- Your what?
- My homecoming proposal!

262
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,755
I was trying to ask Jamie Hall
to the homecoming dance.

263
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,193
- Oh, like a promposal.
- Yes!

264
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,515
I passed out before
she could give me an answer.

265
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:54,038
- Ow! Ah!
- What is this?

266
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,824
The hydrogen cannisters tipped
and melted the cape onto the tux

267
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,702
- and the tux onto his skin.
- Wha... A cape?

268
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:01,254
I didn't wear a cape with my tux
to the Ho-Co-Pro!

269
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:02,910
T-That's just the stupid balloon.

270
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,562
Let's get him inside now.

271
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,333
So, I try to check up on her,
and she bites my head off.

272
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,587
I tell her about Teddy,
and she's completely unfazed,

273
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:10,801
but she still wears her wedding ring.

274
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,825
I mean, I don't know what
the hell she wants me to do.

275
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,303
You know, live miserably alone

276
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,960
and still keep her shoes in the closet?

277
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:22,830
Sorry. Did you... need this card?

278
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,507
I haven't farted naturally
in six months

279
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,319
because of a bag attached to
my side.

280
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:29,030
And I have a stranger's abs
sewn onto me.

281
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,128
I'm separated from my child
by 10 time zones.

282
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,685
And I just sent the man
that I'm in love with

283
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,780
back to the woman he fell in love
with while I was supposedly dead.

284
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,902
Oh, but let's keep discussing
your tragic life.

285
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:42,710
Gin.

286
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,882
I need to get out of this room.

287
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,827
What is going on?

288
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:52,921
Um, I-I wanted to talk about
how things ended between us.

289
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,088
Huh?!

290
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,521
You know, you and I.

291
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,967
Uh, why?

292
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,944
Well, I-I-I've been
thinking a lot about us,

293
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,138
and, you know,
things ended so poorly.

294
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:07,569
I-I wanted to try to...
ameliorate the situation

295
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:12,142
and <i>shepherd</i> in a new era.

296
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,263
I thought we were fine now.

297
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:19,089
I mean, d-define "fine."
Are we... Are we friends?

298
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,835
Are we colleagues?
Do we tell each other things?

299
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,311
- Important things?
- I mean...

300
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,444
I'm fine <i>now, but I wasn't.</i>

301
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,678
You dropped me like I was
severely burning your hand,

302
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,585
and then
never said a word about it.

303
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,692
It was kind of humiliating.

304
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,436
Right. Yeah.
I-I shouldn't have...

305
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:32,764
I shouldn't have done that.

306
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,038
And you told Richard Webber,
my biological father...

307
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,451
what I'm like in bed.

308
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,387
He knows what sex sounds
I make now because of you.

309
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,488
I'll never live that down.

310
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,150
W-Well, to be fair, I-I didn't know...

311
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,999
You know,
you <i>did owe me an apology.</i>

312
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,881
Thank you for manning up.

313
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,577
I'm good now. We're good.

314
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,733
O-kay.

315
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:05,198
And when we first out Megan
was alive, I was gracious.

316
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:09,085
I was supportive.
I mean, I was... wonderful.

317
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,131
I put him in the car to go see her,

318
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,324
and when we found out that she
needed surgery, I was there.

319
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,796
I was more than there.

320
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,788
And his thanks was to put you
in the middle of a triangle?

321
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,358
Yes! Except there's no triangle.

322
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,956
I was very clear.
I told Megan that.

323
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,624
But Megan turned down the proposal
because she felt that...

324
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,233
Because she was confused.
I don't do love triangles.

325
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,401
I was raised in one.

326
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,764
I fell in love with my husband in one.

327
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,405
I am done with triangles.

328
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,655
All I did was take your advice
to embrace not being alone.

329
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,038
So the triangle's my fault?

330
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,366
Yes. Except there is no triangle.

331
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,374
Is Nathan in love with you?

332
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,116
Dr. Carr.

333
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,241
We wanted to discuss
your procedure.

334
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,206
Dr. Grey, are you consulting, as well?

335
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,675
- No, she's not.
- She can stay.

336
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,630
We're old friends,

337
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:58,514
and, uh, she can hear whatever
it is you need to tell me.

338
00:13:58,717 --> 00:13:59,918
Okay.

339
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,428
Well, instead of opening up your chest,

340
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,999
we want to use something
called the Angio-Vac.

341
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:08,417
It's essentially a vacuum that
we attach to your blood vessels

342
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,569
so it sucks the clot out
rather than cutting.

343
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,590
- I've never heard of that.
- It is on the newer side,

344
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,191
but it would greatly reduce
your risk of complications,

345
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,296
which are potentially severe
with a clot of this size.

346
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:21,350
So, if you want to think it over,
talk to your family.

347
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:22,569
No need.

348
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,421
One son hates me. I hate the other one.

349
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,983
And my wife's been dead for 10 years.

350
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,569
I have trouble letting go of stuff.

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,225
- She's still seeing patients.
- Consults only.

352
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,405
She... tried to schedule
a surgery a couple days ago,

353
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,347
but I told her
I'd report her to the chief.

354
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,800
You should've reported her to
the chief regardless, DeLuca.

355
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,206
I understand it's complicated,

356
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,694
but the patients' safety
always comes first.

357
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:48,312
I-I don't know how you all
didn't catch this.

358
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,155
There had to be signs.
Was she erratic?

359
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:52,624
Impulsive? Obsessive?

360
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,436
Can you guys hear me in there?!

361
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,788
<i>Just waiting on the contrast.</i>

362
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,835
DeLuca, I need you
to go to medical records

363
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,366
and pull charts on Nicole Herman,

364
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,777
uh, uh, Katie Bryce, Kyle Diaz...

365
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,314
<i>You're not working right now.</i>

366
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,175
Robbie Reeves, Elsie Clatch,
Veronica Kay.

367
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,997
I need, uh... I need my notes.

368
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:14,436
I need the operative report,
imaging studies, everything.

369
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:15,941
DeLuca?

370
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,350
Wh-What?

371
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,430
<i>DeLuca is my whipping boy now,
not yours.</i>

372
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:25,311
<i>Contrast is in, and
we need you to stop moving.</i>

373
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:26,840
<i>Got it?</i>

374
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,850
Never should've called him.

375
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,668
Ow!

376
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,893
Do you have to do that?

377
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,608
I know. I'm sorry, Pete.

378
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,040
But the burns just
seem to be superficial.

379
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,044
No. I want to return the tux.

380
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:48,491
It was a rental, so now I'll owe $300.

381
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,483
I spent everything I had
on this Ho-Co-Pro.

382
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,172
I still don't know
what that is, but I hate it.

383
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:54,702
It's an elaborately staged plan
to invite someone to a dance,

384
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,460
usually accompanied by a fun pun.

385
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,725
"Jamie, you make me feel
sky-high. Go to Ho-Co with me."

386
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,210
See? Pun.

387
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,147
Pete?

388
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,222
Jamie! D-Did you see my sign?!

389
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,022
I-I asked Coach Greer to give it
to you when he was dialing 911.

390
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,354
She's the one. She was
in the middle of track practice

391
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,527
when I was landing.

392
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,870
Oh, Pete,
I think we found your sign.

393
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:16,186
- Do you think you can straighten it out?
- Ohh.

394
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,495
Is he gonna be okay?

395
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,058
- He crashed in a hot-air balloon, so...
- Jamie,

to see this tumor back then?

424
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,770
So, I looked up this Angio-Vac,

425
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,782
and it's a veno-bypass cannula.

426
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,278
It wasn't designed for a 24-inch clot.

Walter's age and blood pressure

would make an open surgery
too dangerous.

435

Now, Riggs has experience
with this technique,

436

out of here within a week.

- H-Her cervix won't budge.
- Give her oxytocin.

474
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,665
We can't. She's allergic
to Pitocin and Syntocinon.

475

- All forms of it.
- No, no, no, no.

I-I beg your pardon?

490
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:19,908
T-The patient's water is already
is broken, so I don't think that

491
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:23,004
anything should be, you know,
going... going up there.

492
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,606
Uh, okay, nothing needs
to go "up there."

493
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,548
There is a perfect
little bundle of nerves

494
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,204

Yeah, we're gonna figure
something else out.

- Thank you.
- Warren.

499
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,178
How long has this mother been laboring?

500
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,106
- Uh, 20?
- I'd say almost, uh, 20 hours.

501
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,224
And she still has 6 centimeters to go?

502
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:47,102
That's hours and hours
of more unnecessary pain

503
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,231
and risk of complications

504
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,632
when the body has a built-in mechanism

505
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,450
to speed this process along.

506
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,989
It's no mistake that God put
the G-spot in the birth canal.

507
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:59,142

ever heard those three things

baby in also gets the baby out.

It's... It's just not how I do things.

511
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,477
Warren, let's go.

512
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,700
Well, she thought
differently last night.

513
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,368
What about this
abdominal-wall transplant?

514
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,806
It cost hundreds of thousands,

515
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,440
and the patient is still

Yes, we've spent millions
in order to make more,

646

and water damage,

647
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:44,752
and we could've just repaired it,

648
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,925
but instead we improved it
because we hadn't had

649
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:49,102

650
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,744

a child from being kidnapped.

has been all over the news.

658
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,993

00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:40,977
- It's more complicated than that.
- Except that it's not.

690
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,835
Okay, all right.
You're right. Right.

691
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,600
Okay, my marriage sucks,
don't know what to do about it.

692
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,334
But just because you're right
doesn't make me wrong.

693
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,516
Please slow down.

694
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:53,071
Owen, I need to be with Farouk.

695
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:55,813
Your wound will open,
you'll get an infection,

696
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:57,794
and Farouk will lose
his mom completely

697
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,063
instead of just missing her
for a little while.

698
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:03,215
I'm right, too. Okay?
We're both right.

699
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:07,110
So, he'll be on crutches
or maybe a wheelchair,

700
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,532
but Pete should probably still
be able to go to the dance.

701
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,235
Oh.

702
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,126
Oh?

703
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:18,821
Well, I didn't want to have to
say no to his Ho-Co-Pro.

704
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,588
You were going to say no?

705
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:23,516
I might've said yes.

706
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:25,149
But then he crashed
his hot-air balloon

707
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,962
in front of the whole school,

708
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,239
and it made me
weirdly popular.

709
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:31,813
17 seniors have already friended me.

710
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,758
I may have a chance of going
to Ho-Co with Rick Hannan now.

711
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,505
Jamie, that boy worked two jobs

712
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:45,118
to rent a hot-air balloon
and an ugly tux, for you.

713
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,657
Life is too short and too hard

714
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:50,505
to care more about
your social-media status

715
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,771
than the person who did that for you!

716
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,181
I... I was proposed to with a flash mob.

717
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:59,138
A guy paid dancers to put on
a whole show for me.

718
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,990
Do you know how rare that is?

719
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,075
Guys like that do not
come along all that often,

720
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:07,102
so when they do,
you say yes!

721
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,501
You got a flash-mob proposal?

722
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:12,272
That's so sweet. Did you marry him?

723
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,391
That's... That's not the...
That's not the p... the point...

724
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:18,602
The... The point is,

725
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,465
you go to the dance
with the guy who crashed

726
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:24,462
the hot-air balloon for you,
not... Rick Hannan.

727
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:35,673
So...

728
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,790
You decided to use my technique?

729
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,046
No. No. No. No, no.

730
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:43,883
My patient and her husband just
wanted a little alone time.

731
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:46,133
- So he's using <i>his</i> technique?
- No!

732
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,313
No!

733
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,896
Maybe. I don't know.
You know what? It doesn't matter.

734
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:51,463
Because... Because it's
not gonna end up working,

735
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,578
and they're just gonna end up
getting a C-section anyways.

736
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:56,688
I don't understand
why Americans are so prude.

737
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,813
When you add pleasure to pain,

738
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:02,727
pain can become pleasurable.

739
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:06,516
In the bedroom...

740
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,016
some people even ask for pain.

741
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:13,250
A hair tug...

742
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,141
a well-timed bite on the neck...

743
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:19,136
- Dr. Robbins!
- Yeah? Mm-hmm?

744
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,462
Uh, I-I think she's crowning.

745
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,134
Oh, okay. Great!

746
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,558
Sorry. I was in surgery.

747
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,626
What's wrong? Who died?

748
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:41,818
These are mine.

749
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,910
A patient of yours?

750
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:49,320
No, um... this is my brain.

751
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,235
I have a tumor in it.

752
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:54,157
A benign meningioma.

753
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,376
I'm sorry. What?

754
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:02,391
Maggie, I have a 10-centimeter
tumor in my left frontal lobe,

755
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,485
and I'm having it surgically removed.

756
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:07,847
Maggie, don't cry.

757
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:11,180
My mother died. I am allowed to cry.

758
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:12,974
I cry all the time.

759
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,165
It's not malignant!
It's... We can fix it!

760
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,232
It... Come on. It's kind of hilarious.

761
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,662
I'm a brain surgeon,
and I got a brain tumor.

762
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,942
All these MRis and an angio...

763
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,579
How long have you known about this?

764
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,458
A little over a week.

765
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:38,290
Amelia.

766
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:42,477
Owen and Meredith don't know, either.

767
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,696
I'm gonna need your help telling Owen.

768
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:48,883
And, um, you are gonna
have to tell Meredith

769
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:51,571
because I can't do it.

770
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,102
She's been telling me
I'm crazy for years,

771
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,590
and, um...

772
00:32:57,444 --> 00:33:01,063
