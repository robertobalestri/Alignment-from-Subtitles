16
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:42,716
and I need 25 of them,
how much is that?

17
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,546
12,500.

18
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:45,683
Very good.

00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:47,748

Because if the te...

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,296
I need an adult now.

00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,406
I'm trying to figure out
how much money to allocate

23
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:54,729
toward my test materials.

24
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,020
It's very stressful.

25
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:58,225
Please.
You have $100,000.

26
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:00,629
I have a 90-year-old Spanish
doctor I have to convince

27
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,520
to give me his patent
on his cross-polymer

28
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:04,546
so April Kepner doesn't
find out that I'm a fraud

29
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:06,705
and a disgrace to medicine.
You're not a disgrace.

30
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,034
A fraud, yes.

31
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,899

00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:13,752
Sorry.

34
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,409
We'll stop now.

00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,534

Kepner didn't believe
we'd get the kids' parents

44
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,726
to let us try this
on them.

45
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,773
Who's Kepner to judge?

46
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,554
Besides, you know,
being the judge.

47
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:44,680
You're not giving up
on Kimmie though, right?

48
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:47,265
Hell no.
I'm not giving up.

49
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:50,319
But she kinda looks like
she might be.

50
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,008
Hey, ladybug!

51
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,765
Come here. Hello.

52
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,172
Hey, I just wanted to say "hi"
before I had to go to work.

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,637
Come here, ladybug.
Oh!

54
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:08,752
- What is, uh, all this?
- Hello.

55
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:10,415
- Are you sick?
- Oh, I'm just a little

56
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:11,546
ung-hay over-ay.

57
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:13,922
Partied a bit too hard
last night, so...

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,812
I'm rehydrating.

59
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:17,781
Banana bag
works like magic.

60
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,706
- Partied?
- Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,709
- All right.
- How are you, my ladybug?

62
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:23,000
You're so squishy.

63
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,172
You smell like soap.

64
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,283
Yum.

65
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,742
Okay, sweetheart.

66
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,088
Bye, Daddy.

67
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:30,039
- I'll see you later.
- Say "bye-bye."

68
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,499
Hi, booboo.

69
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:34,805
Hi.
Hi.

70
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,242
But my device
will enable

71
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,416
a smoother entry
for colonoscopies,

72
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,781
and then you won't have to
back it out and back it in

73
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,125
to get around the corners.

74
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,278
That is very cool.

75
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,961
Oh, uh,
good morning, Chief.

76
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:48,662
Uh, I-I didn't see your car
in the lot.

77
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,126
Oh, I'm taking
the train now.

78
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,080
Well, it's your first day
back on the job

79
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:53,439
and you're already
pushing yourself?

80
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,206
No, I'm...

81
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:58,320
finding a way to fit exercise
into my day.

82
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:01,336
It is 2,004 steps
to the train.

83
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,789
If I'd done this
a year ago,

84
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:04,750
maybe I'd have never
had a heart attack.

85
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,157
But you're gonna
take it easy today?

86
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,133
Not at all.
I've been trapped in my bed.

87
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,932
I've binged every
reality show ever made,

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,775
and I can physically feel
my IQ lowering.

89
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:16,702
I'm getting back
in the OR.

90
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,218
Pierce cleared me.

91
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,675
I did.

92
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,523
She's cleared.
I cleared her.

93
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,695
She's cleared,
and I'm not taking it back

94
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:27,089
no matter how sternly
you stare at me.

95
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,126
I had things to do today.

96
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,818
Now I've got to spend my day
following her.

97
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:32,427
Or you could just trust
my professional assessment.

98
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,213
No?

99
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,054
Okay.

100
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,367
Repeat it back to me
so I know you both know.

101
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:42,682
Okay. Dr. Cerone will be
calling from Madrid

102
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,752
at some point
this morning

103
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:45,726
to discuss the patent
on his cross-polymer.

104
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:47,651
They're calling on my phone,
which is fully charged

105
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:48,976
and on the loudest ring
possible.

106
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:50,649
And no matter where you are
or what you're doing

107
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,515
when the call comes in,
we find you.

108
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,557
And what are you
not going to do?

109
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,945
Not find you.

110
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,150
Or?

111
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,552
- Mention this to Kepner.
- Mention this to Kepner.

112
00:03:58,619 --> 00:03:59,705
Correct.

113
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,166
Secret club!

114
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,500
Oh, my God.

115
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:08,702
What do you got,
Warren?

116
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,692
14-year-old male,
blunt abdominal trauma

117
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,488
and a penetrating injury
in his upper thigh.

118
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:13,608
Bleeding
from a scalp lac.

119
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:15,499
I pulled him and his brother
out of a house fire...

120
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,741
Chemistry experiment
gone wrong.

121
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:18,187
Did I kill
my little brother?

122
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,415
Please.
He's gonna be okay, right?

123
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:21,665
Mom's gonna be so mad.

124
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,939
Lungs are clear,
vitals are stable,

125
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,436
saturating 95
in the mask.

126
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,868
He's been coming in and out
of consciousness.

127
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,535
I was just trying
to teach him chemistry.

128
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:28,756
Can you tell my mom?

129
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:30,186
That I wasn't doing
anything wrong?

130
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,551
- Okay, I got him.
- Trauma one?

131
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,345
Yeah. No, Kepner,
you and Grey,

132
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,852
you need to meet
the other rig.

133
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,572
His younger brother
got thrown by the blast.

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,720
He was bleeding out
from the abdomen,

135
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:38,860
and, well,
one of our team,

136
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,662
she just shoved her hand
in there.

137
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,594
Uh, 10-year-old male
with a penetrating...

138
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:49,844
Why is your hand
inside him?

139
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,577
- Because he was bleeding a lot.
- Take it out of him!

140
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:53,907
You look 12. Can you find
a grown-up to tell me that?

141
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,080
- Do not move your hand!
- Don't let go!

142
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,524
See that?
Grown-ups.

143
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,029
Nobody move.

144
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,256
Can you feel a pulse?

145
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,636
Yeah.

146
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,235
What do you think she's
got in her hand, Schmitt?

147
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,983
His abdominal aorta?

148
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,192
Yep.

149
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,584
Don't take your hand out!

150
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:08,657
What's your name?

151
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,402
Herrera.
Andy Herrera.

152
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,362
Okay, Herrera, we got to
get him up to the OR.

153
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,266
And I'm sure you're
very clear about this,

154
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,600
but you cannot move
your hand.

155
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,844
Can you hold pressure while
we bring the gurney down?

156
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,836
My hand, arm, and shoulder
are already numb,

157
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,983
but... I'm going with yes.

The models are holding up
to the ultrasound?

162
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,553
Nope.
I just melted three more.

163
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,183
What? You found a way
to dissipate the heat?

164
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,836
Not yet,
which explains the melting.

She's super hungover.

She's using the word "party"
as a verb.

You know she had a rough time.

And I think she's just...
She's coming out of it.

She's walking

She was happy.

April, I think is...

You try and be happy for her.

He's slowing us down.

What are we whispering
so loudly about?

00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,226
She brought in Koracick.

383
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:01,561
- Oh, God. The worst.
- Total ass.

384
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:02,985
And he's only here
to have sex with her.

385
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,188
He is not.

386
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,939
- It's a booty call.
- Is it a booty call?

387
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,617
You did have sex with him
the last time he was here.

388
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,053
I never should have
told you guys that.

389
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,266
It was a
shame-based confession.

390
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,914
Okay, and you don't get
to talk about booty calls.

391
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,352
You are bringing booty
into our home.

392

Clive is not just booty.
I genuinely like Clive.

393
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,520
Yes, we've all heard
how much you like him.

394
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:18,937
All night long
we hear it.

395
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,509
I'm gonna walk away now.
Unashamed.

396

- Send him home.
- No.

397
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:27,751
We didn't make it
into the contest.

398
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:28,835
We have no funding.

As much as you want
to help Kimmie,

with the physics

401
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,503

402
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,585
Koracick may be a tool,

403
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,109
but he is the kind of tool
that we need right now.

404
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,655
See how I did that?
Tool/tool?

405
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,400
He doesn't go anywhere
near Kimmie.

406
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:41,513
He doesn't even get
to meet her.

407
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,866
Oh, God, no.
Kimmie's got enough problems.

408
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,048
That was fast thinking
back there.

409
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:51,486
Thank you, Dr. Hunt.

410
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,963
I'm surprised you just
took your hijab off like that.

411
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,628
Well, I mean,
it's a symbol of my faith,

412
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,963
but my faith is about
service and compassion,

413
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,298
and he was bleeding
really fast.

414
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,032
I'll help drape.

Uh, kid from the fire,

some intra-abdominal bleeding

418

Dr. Webber as well?

421
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,433
I did not.

422
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,557
A little extra help
never killed anyone.

It depends.
Am I carrying my axe?

So hard-core.

from the rapid infuser.

I need to just get in here
and clamp the aorta,

out of here, okay?

so that one can return to work
at full strength?

520
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,443
Um, more suction here,
Qadri.

521
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,208
His ischemia time's
getting up there.

522
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,667
I'm aware.

523
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,427
You know, some vacations
are so strenuous

524
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,636
that you need a vacation
from your vacation.

525
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,214
Ben Warren,

526
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,825
as handsome as you look
in your uniform

527
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,972
and as grateful as I am that
you are still alive today,

528
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,685
you do not belong
in there.

529
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,347
Get out.
I brought your patient in.

530
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,489
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

531
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,909
And how you're doing,

532
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,084
since it's your first day back
from vacation.

533
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:54,609
Okay,
my vacation is over.

534
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,373
I went on it,
and I am back.

535
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,163
It was glorious,
but like all experiences,

536
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
it now lives on in
the cherished memories

537
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,159
that I share
with no one but myself.

538
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,745
So stop talking about
my vacation!

539
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,308
- Hey, where'd you go?
- None of your business!

540
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:17,066
Warren, um, she's right.

541
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,609
You don't belong in here.

542
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:22,331
Uh, I've got my eye
on everything in here.

543
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,793
Now his bowel is
getting dusky.

544
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,824
This kid's gonna wind up
with a stool bag.

545
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:31,724
Oh, no, sir.
Not on my watch.

546
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,839
Not on my first day back
he's not.

547
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,033
Where's Koracick?

548
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:44,464
I sent him
to see Kimmie.

549
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,277
- You did what?
- Damn it.

550
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,109
What? Why?
Was that wrong?

551
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:51,417
♪♪

552
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,033
Oh, God.
Of course that was wrong.

553
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,796
I'm just calling it
the way I see it,

554
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,147
and the sooner
you face the truth...

555
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,843
You're full of crap
and you know it!

556
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,552
"Hamilton" only made
your top three

557
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,787
because it's new and shiny.

558
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,789
And you only left it off
your list because you're bitter

559
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:06,879
that you couldn't score tickets
for the original cast.

560
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,995
It goes "Cabaret,"
"Hamilton," "Rent."

561
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:11,793
So... no Sondheim?

562
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,777
Stephen Sondheim.

563
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,035
- Damn it. Sondheim.
- Yeah, can't count him out.

564
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:18,185
Count of three. Best Sondheim.
One, two, three.

565
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:20,004
- "Into The Woods." Oh.
- "Sweeney Todd." Gross.

566
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,529
No, he wielded
a hell of a scalpel.

567
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,475
They've been at this
for 20 minutes straight.

568
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,839
Happiest I've seen her
in days.

569
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:26,913
"Into the Woods," a quarter
of the Broadway audience

570
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,334
left that show
at intermission.

571
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:30,316
'Cause they want
an easy, happy ending.

572
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,605
But, hello, that's why
it's brilliant.

573
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:35,206
Doctors. Second opinion.
Weigh in.

574
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:37,951
Uh...

575
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,162
Ah,
love me a good weirdo.

576
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,850
I can see why you're trying
to rush the process.

577
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,607
Good. Now we can make
some headway.

578
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:44,913
Oh, I have no doubt
we're gonna make

579
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,678
this ultrasound our bitch
and save a lot of lives.

580
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,756
But let's not, uh, delude
ourselves into thinking

581
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,675
Kimmie's
will be one of them.

582
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,763
There is no easy,
happy ending here.

583
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:54,964
She's
got a few months to live,

584
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,860
you know,
if she's lucky.

585
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,640
New Guy.

586
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,369
I know.
I shouldn't be here.

587
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,159
I just placed a clamp.

588
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:17,533
On an aorta.

589
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:18,991
- You did?
- Yes!

590
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:21,455
Damn. I... I gotta admit
I'm kinda jealous.

591
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:22,913
It was amazing.

592
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,611
And awful, because
as soon as I placed it,

593
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,568
the whole OR erupted,
and then...

594
00:22:27,624 --> 00:22:28,963
It's hard having
a front-row seat,

595
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,339
and then getting kicked out,
ya know?

596
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:31,533
I do.

597
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,836
I just hope he makes it.

598
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,484
You... You wanna see
for yourself?

599
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:39,594
Look, I-I can't get you
front row,

600
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,930
but... I can get you
pretty close.

601
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:43,242
Come on.

602
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,033
The patient's mother's
here.

603
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,609
She's looking
for an update.

604
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:49,430
Okay,
the graft is ready.

605
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,408
Dr. Qadri, can you go out
and update...

606
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:54,393
Oh, no,
Dr. Qadri cannot.

607
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,018
She cannot go and update this
patient's mother by herself

608
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,414
because she's an intern.

609
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:02,416
An intern who has yet to update
any patient's family

610
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,588
about anything.

611
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:06,760
And she's not going to start
by facing that mom alone

612
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:08,844
to tell her her two boys

613
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,859
might not make it
out of this alive.

614
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,484
Oh, for the love of...

615
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,069
Mm.

616
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,449
I had a heart attack!

617
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:26,172
Hmm.

618
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,166
That's what Dr. Webber has gone
out of his way not to say.

619
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:31,319
He's gone out of his way
all damn day

620
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:35,924
to not reveal my secret,
to not let me do my job,

621
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:40,315
and to make sure that I'm not
putting any extra stress

622
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:42,623
and strain on my body,
and it's not okay.

623
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,471
I know better than
to show up

624
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,112
to this hospital
before I'm ready,

625
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,819
I know better than to put
a child's life

626
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:49,489
in my hands
before I am ready,

627
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,533
and I am ready
to do my job.

628
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:57,875
Now, I would appreciate everyone
doing their own jobs, too.

629
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,643
Focusing on the field,
until the awkward goes away.

630
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,057
5-0 prolene, please.

631
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,440
Dr. Bailey, look,
all we're...

632
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:10,048
Babysitters get paid
$10 an hour.

633
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,242
You want to get paid
$10 an hour?

634
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,981
I can arrange for that.

635
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,372
Go.

636
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,129
Come on.

637
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:26,991
Clive's nice.

638
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:28,525
He's cute.
He's funny.

639
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,796
Aww.
And the sex?

640
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:31,779
Wow, you're just getting
straight to it, huh?

641
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,329
Well, Carina is...
Is only getting better.

642
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:36,452
There's, like, no slump.

643
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,790
It's the opposite
of a slump.

644
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:39,228
It's a boom.
It's a sex boom.

645
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:43,069
Ladies, what are
we laughing about?

646
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:44,337
- Sex.
- Nothing.

647
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:45,423
Sex? Really?

648
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:47,793
I was expecting
maternal mortality

649
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,018
or rechargeable hearts
or something.

650
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,793
But, no, that's...
I can talk sex.

651
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,709
Well, you know, the thing about
rechargeable hearts...

652
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:55,351
Maggie's got a date
with Clive.

653
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,252
- Is Clive still around?
- Mm-hmm.

654
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,955
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at that. That's adorable.

655
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,087
I got a date tonight,
too.

656
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:01,353
- Oh.
- Uh, Priya is her name.

657
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:02,345
Oh.
Yeah.

658
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,518
- Who? - Priya.
- Did you make that up?

659
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,655
Very cool, brilliant,

660
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:05,873
- actually. - Oh.
- Mm.

661
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,414
Very attractive.
Human rights attorney, so...

662
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:08,579
- Well, that's hot.
- That's hot.

663
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,393
- Pretty impressive, yeah.
- Yeah, that is... That's hot.

664
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,108
Interesting.

665
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,642
Um, you know,

666
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,579
I think I'm gonna...
vending machine.

667
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,609
- Really?
- Yeah.

668
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:16,833
- Oh.
- Huh.

669
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,174
I'm gonna start
double gloving.

670
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,304
My hands smelled like bedpan
when I was eating

671
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:21,447
- last night.
- Oh.

672
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:23,593
I scrubbed in on
a bowel resection yesterday.

673
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,374
Being on The Party's good
side has benefits.

674
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,853
I almost called her Dr. Party
this morning

675
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,593
instead of Dr. Kepner.

676
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,608
Is that
a fireable offense?

677
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,905
You're just gonna be
really happy for her.

678
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,584
- No, super happy, overjoyed.
- Okay. Yep.

679
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,311
I never would've pegged myself
as a guy who's into moms,

680
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:42,351
but moms make you do things
till you get 'em right.

681
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,158
Nope.

682
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:48,491
- Dr. Roy.
- Hey, buddy.

683
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,199
Um, I've got a patient,
Mr. Wilkins, in 1413,

684
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:54,499
with a large, super infected
abscess in his groin

685
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:55,749
that you're gonna
drain for me.

686
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,442
- Um...
- Now.

687
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,366
- Yes, I-I tried.
- Maybe you should try harder.

688
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:05,505
She's the mother of my kid,

689
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:06,981
- and this...
- Harder, harder.

690
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:13,410
Kepner, Grey, I'm about
to update his mother.

691
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:14,598
What can you tell me?

692
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,394
He had an injury
to his abdominal aorta

693
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:18,451
- that we're trying to repair.
- Ah, damn.

694
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,621
It's a mess.

695
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,951
We're still trying to evaluate
the extent of the injury.

696
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,292
Can I get a towel?

697
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:30,066
All right.
Okay, we're good.

698
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,152
So, you're a rule breaker?

699
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,818
Uh, n-no.

700
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,946
Only at places
I no longer work.

701
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:40,918
Mm-hmm.

702
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,472
Both your boys sustained
serious injuries

703
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,913
and are in surgery.

704
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,760
We'll let you know more
as soon as we can.

705
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,741
Both of them?

706
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,806
Are they okay?

707
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,293
They're in surgery,
but they'll be okay, right?

708
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,892
We're fighting for them.
We're doing everything we can.

709
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:01,369
I have a job.

710
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,663
I have to work.

711
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:06,386
I need to feed them
because they are 14 and 10

712
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:08,394
and they eat everything
that isn't nailed down.

713
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,279
I cannot hold onto them
every minute of the day.

714
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,033
I have to go to work.
They're 14 and 10.

715
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,872
I mean, they should be able to
be home for a morning

716
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:18,259
while I go to work
without...

717
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:20,923
Oh, my God.

718
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,884
Tyler is 14,
and Zach is 10.

719
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,712
They have to be okay.

720
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,556
They have to be okay.

721
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,029
They have to be okay.

722
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,493
Oh, my God.

723
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,126
Oh, my God!

724
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,776
- I can't believe you used to do this.
- What?

725
00:27:39,932 --> 00:27:42,838
This. That.
Y-Y-You did that.

726
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:45,276
And you were good at it?

727
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:47,409
Um, yeah.

728
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,980
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- I'm... I'm just saying.

729
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:52,814
Y-You did this
incredibly cool thing

730
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:56,213
that probably pays a hell of
a lot more than what we do,

731
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:59,674
you did it well,
but you walked away from it?

732
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,690
Why?

733
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,143
To do more.

734
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,393
I mean, yes,
I used to do that down there,

735
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,096
with the patients in the OR
where you're trying to fix them,

736
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:12,534
but I, you know...

737
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:14,831
I also cut open a guy
with a clipboard.

738
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:17,159
I mean, y-y-you know the metal
part of a clipboard?

739
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,763
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I broke it off

740
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,096
and used it as a scalpel.

741
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:23,252
Cracked his chest because
we were nowhere near an OR

742
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,736
and I... I did
what I had to do.

743
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,135
And I saved his life,
but I... got into trouble.

744
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:32,556
A lot of trouble.

745
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:36,939
You know, but I-I never felt
anything but proud.

746
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,853
So now I'm doing a job where
I'm the first one on the scene

747
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:46,181
and I get to do whatever
it takes to save that life.

748
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,244
And that's only
a good thing.

749
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,761
I was just looking for a
"because fire" kind of answer,

750
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,408
but okay.

751
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,533
Can we listen to what's
going on down there?

752
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,502
- Only if you don't let me talk anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

753
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,582
Hey!
What's going on?

754
00:29:09,737 --> 00:29:12,370
Amelia called Koracick,
and I hate him.

755
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,580
Like, I want put him in
an old-fashioned choke hold

756
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:15,895
and throw him down the stairs
hate him.

757
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,142
Okay.
You hate him because...

758
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,169
What? I need a reason?
Have you met the guy?

759
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:24,299
Did something happen?
With Kimmie?

760
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,853
It's just... some kids
get under your skin.

761
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,765
You're dropping out?
Really?

762
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,065
I'm not dropping out,
but I'm not gonna rush

763
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,721
developing this thing over
an unrealistic deadline.

764
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,892
- You don't agree.
- No, I don't.

765
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,475
You think I don't know that
this girl is dying?

766
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,698
You should have seen her
when we first met her.

767
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:58,266
She is a fraction
of who she was.

768
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,667
But she is still alive,
and she is still full of hope,

769
00:30:00,768 --> 00:30:02,713
and that means we don't
get to say, "I give up."

770
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:04,036
If doctors said,
"I give up,"

771
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,440
we would all be dead
of cholera right now.

772
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,261
We don't get to give up.
We don't get to write her off.

773
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:08,549
We don't quit.

774
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:10,205
Yeah, I know
you think you're right,

775
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:11,761
but you're used to
Brain Tumor Shepherd,

776
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:13,421
so you don't hear it
when nonsense

777
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:14,862
comes out of your mouth.

778
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,255
I am not being crazy.

779
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:17,612
Then stop being naive.

780
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,697
Stop being a ridiculous
Pollyanna

781
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:20,822
and please, please

782
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,723
stop diminishing
this little girl's life

783
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,167
by barking things at me that
belong on a refrigerator magnet.

784
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,711
It's beneath you.

785
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:29,353
She is going to die,
and any effort that you spend

786
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:31,025
that doesn't go toward
preventing that

787
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:33,320
is a supreme disservice
to her.

788
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:35,214
And this...
This is not gonna save her.

789
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:37,728
This is the only thing
that might save her.

790
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:38,966
She's not gonna have
much of a life

791
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,416
with an exploded,
flaming skull.

792
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:42,708
- Well, then, we reduce the heat.
- And you leave the tumor!

793
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:43,806
You do nothing!

794
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,668
God, you're... Then we attack
it from another angle!

795
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,511
We do something else entirely!
Maybe it's not ultrasound.

796
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,008
Maybe it's some kind of
radiation...

797
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,663
- Sh-Shut up.
- You shut up!

798
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,149
We attack it
from another angle.

799
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,141
I just said that.

800
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:55,697
And then
we reduce the heat.

801
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:57,431
Yeah, I said that, too.
Why are you...

802
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,565
No. Mnh-mnh.

803
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,534
With more beams,

804
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:03,487
we control the amount
of heat generated.

805
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:06,487
This way we have
more variables.

806
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:07,768
So two beams?

807
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,743
Or... Or... Or seven.

808
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:12,633
Or 27, or a thousand

809
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,477
that we run for
shorter periods of time.

810
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:16,908
So when they enter the skull,
they don't heat it.

811
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,399
And where the beams
come together...

812
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,869
The reinforced waves
are intense enough

813
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,852
that they heat and kill
just the tumor!

814
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:24,594
I mean, it's...
It's brilliant.

815
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:26,602
I mean...
I'm brilliant.

816
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,297
Bailey, it's been five minutes
and the bowel hasn't pinked up

817
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:36,414
and I don't hear any flow.

818
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:38,197
We're gonna have to consider
resecting this bowel.

819
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,500
Ju... Hold on.
Sometimes it takes a while.

820
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,316
Was it severe?
The MI?

821
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,985
Severely scary.

822
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:51,325
- A stent?
- CABG.

823
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:55,149
God, Bailey. I'm sorry.
I just wish that I'd...

824
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,047
Wait, wait.
That was your vacation!

825
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,832
There you go,
Dr. Sherlock.

826
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,320
Uh, can I get the
fluorescein dye, please?

827
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,641
Thank you.

828
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,352
All right.

829
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:12,175
Okay. Can I get
the lights off, please?

830
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:19,063
Dr. Qadri,
you want to run the UV?

831
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,363
All right.

832
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:24,950
It's beautiful.

833
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,664

with the blood

834
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:32,525
and clearly perfusing
the bowel.

835
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:34,680
This boy will not need
a colostomy.

00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:37,527

I don't know.
Hit the lights.

00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,461
He's tachy and his pressure's
dropping.

840
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:47,008
He's developing hives.

841
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,180
He must be allergic to the dye.
It's anaphylaxis.
