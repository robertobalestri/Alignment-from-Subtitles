00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:42,826

you clipped the vessel.

00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,866
The tissue went a little dusky.
It doesn't mean that that...

180
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,526
She's 11 hours post-op.

181
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,315
- Shouldn't she be awake by now?
- I'm not concerned yet.

182
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,338

187
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:08,287
Amelia, can you hear me?

00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,078
<i>Yes. I'm right here.</i>

189
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,027
Is she awake?

190
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,475
Or did she just
open her eyes? Amelia?

191
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,795
<i>They can't hear me.</i>

192
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,662
- I don't think she's...
- Oh, my God!

193
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,303
L-Listen. Everybody's
recovery time is different.

194
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,584

00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,623
<i>Oh, crap. Am I gorked?</i>

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,904
It's okay. She's okay.

197
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,225
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

198
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,213
- Hey.
- Hmm!

199
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:45,279
- Sorry.
- Hey.

200
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:46,354
There's no change.

201
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,115
But, uh,
it's 5:30 in case you want

202
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,342
- to get a shower or something.
- Okay. Thanks.

203
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,362
Ooh. Okay.

204
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:57,068
I'm gonna go take a shower,
okay?

205
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,422
I'll be back soon.

206
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:01,490
<i>Okay.
It's sweet you slept here.</i>

207
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,709
What?

208
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,802
I think she just squeezed my hand.

209
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,701
Amelia,
did you just squeeze my hand?

210
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,263
<i>Ow. Stop talking.</i>

211
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:11,122
<i>My head hurts, Meredith.</i>

212
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,618
<i>I'm trying to sleep.</i>

213
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,197
Maybe not.

214
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:16,377
Oh, my God.
She's breathing over the tube.

215
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,611
- Let's get her extubated.
- Okay. This is good!

216
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:19,705
This is good.

217
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:23,533
<i>Ow. God.
So much talking.</i>

218
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,001
I know that I'm younger
than most of your applicants,

219
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,104
so to answer some questions
you may have,

220
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,353
I went to high school at 12,
I went to college at 14,

221
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,166
I went to medical school at 16,

222
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,181
and I lost my virginity at 18.

223
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:40,166
You may not have asked that last one.

224
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,469
Have to keep this on
in case Mass Gen calls.

225
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:45,534
They're my number one.

226
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,126
But you guys are a solid number two.

227
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,701
You know what, though?

228
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,540
I think after being here,
I'm impressed.

229
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,197
Grey-Sloan is moving up.

230
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:59,619
Level one trauma.
The weather's <i>amazing.</i>

231
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,689
- Ahh. How was the flight?
- Fine.

232
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:10,900
- Ah. And the service?
- It was tasteful.

233
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,326
It was a bunch of kiss-asses
sniffing around for money,

234
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:14,620
telling stories
about how Harper Avery

235
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:17,372
was nice and decent
and respected women.

236
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,150
All right, so,
we'll have a family supper

237
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,679
and do our own thing and
talk about the real Harper Avery.

238
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,642
Right now I need to change.
Want to help me?

239
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:27,345
Catherine Avery?

240
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,993
Thomas Koracick?!

241
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,405
Ohh! How is it that
I'm aging and you aren't?

242
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,620
Oh, shut up.

243
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,377
Uh, you've met my husband,
Richard Webber.

244
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,842
- Oh!
- And this my son, Jackson.

245
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,854
- Oh! H-How old is he?
- Hey.

246
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,873
- Why?
- I want to make sure he's not mine.

247
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,571
You are just awful.

248
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,709
Uh, how's, uh, Shepherd?

249
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:51,087
She's, uh, responsive,
not yet verbal.

250
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,215
It's early.

251
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,455
We should catch up.

252
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,517
Anything you want to tell me?

253
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,591
I prefer to let you wonder,

254
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,232
keep the mystery alive.

255
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,545
Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:05,699
Mmm.

257
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,798
Ooh! Look at Dr. Fancypants!

258
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,689
Trying to lure
in that big facelift money?

259
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,048
I was at a funeral.

260
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,179
I am a terrible person.

261
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,705
You look very somber.

262
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:25,744
How much money
did he leave you?

263
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,787
That's not an appropriate question.

264
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,219
Well, I just want to know exactly.
I mean, do they

265
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:31,533
just back up
a truckload of silver spoons?

266
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,244
It's a fleet of limos,
not a truck.

267
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:37,150
Um, you, uh, paged me?
What's up?

268
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,322
Bad timing.
Never mind.

269
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,523
What do you mean?
Bad timing for what?

270
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,755
What?

271
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,017
I'm publishing Megan Hunt's surgery,

272
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:48,760
and it might get consideration
for a Harper Avery.

273
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,666
So you want to take my name off it.

274
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,548
No, I understand...
You can't win a Harper Avery

275
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,675
if the article says "Jackson Avery."

276
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,892
I mean, I know the timing
of the ask is unfortunate,

277
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,842
but the deadline is in a few days.

278
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:06,095
And... I really am sorry for your loss.

279
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,314
- Take my name off, then.
- Yeah?

280
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,197
Go for it. Yeah, just be grateful

281
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,595
that your mother didn't
start up a foundation.

282
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,962
Yeah, that Alzheimer's
really put a wrench

283
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,525
in her charitable giving,
but I owe you one.

284
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,525
- Thanks.
- Yes, you do.

285
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,630
Here we go.

286
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,948
Just a little bit more.

287
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,853
<i>Please stop.</i>

288
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,970
<i>No! It hurts!</i>

289
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,978
DeLuca,
what the hell are you doing?!

290
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:35,407
It's early ambulation.
Dr. Shepherd does it with all her patients.

291
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,494
This patient is post-op day one.

292
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,346
- Put her back in that bed.
- She told me to do this.

293
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:40,851
<i>I change my mind. I change my mind.</i>

294
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,869
No. The giant tumor that was
pressing on her frontal lobe

295
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,603
told you to do it.
It also made me promise

296
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,493
not to give her any opioids,
which is so incredibly stupid.

297
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,892
Put her back in this bed now!

298
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,291
<i>Agreed. DeLuca, I agree.</i>

299
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,634
- Sir, she made me promise.
<i>- Damn it!</i>

300
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:56,467
Hey. You sleeping with her?

301
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:57,683
- What?
<i>- What?!</i>

302
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,752
You heard me. You getting some extra
office hours in with Shepherd?

303
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,998
No! Okay?
Just... I-It's her protocol.

304
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,916
And her patients have
a high recovery rate...

305
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,819
higher than yours,
which she wanted me to say to you,

306
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,965
because... she knew you wouldn't like this.

307
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:10,767
<i>I am such an ass.</i>

308
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:14,689
If her intracranial pressure
increases, it's on <i>you.</i>

309
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:18,916
Okay, Dr. Shepherd.

310
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,134
You got this, okay?
Just to the chair.

311
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,509
<i>I mean, we could. It's
probably effective, but I'm...</i>

312
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,946
I just want to see my kid.

313
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,894
I'll take oral antibiotics.
It's just a low-grade fever.

314
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,095
No. Unfortunately, it's more than that.

315
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:38,132
Your white count is elevated.

316
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,245
There's some erythema.

317
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:43,039
We're gonna need to do
three days IV of cefazolin.

318
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:44,508
Three days?

319
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,259
I'm sorry.

320
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,188
Have you heard from Nathan?

321
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,527
- No. Have you?
- No.

322
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,080
For what it's worth,
I told him you were the real deal.

323
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:57,548
I sent him to you.

324
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:01,501
And I sent him to <i>you.
Pretty firmly.</i>

325
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,587
I think we broke his brain.

326
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,951
Hey, Wilson, Megan's got cellulitis,

327
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,899
so let's start her on one gram "Q,"

328
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,962
8 of cefazolin, and
increase her fluids please.

329
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,081
W-W-Wait.
This won't affect your article, will it?

330
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:28,102
No. I-I'm only asking because
I'm worried about you...

331
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:31,982
and her and... medicine.

332
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,963

I'm putting your name on the article.

00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,204
as long as you follow
the doctor's orders.

346
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,556
<i>Opioids are my drug of choice.</i>

347
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,937
What if they told you you could
<i>have "just a drink or two"</i>

348
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,582
<i>if the doctor says it's okay?</i>

349
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,697
You're sure you don't
want to reconsider?

350
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,399
<i>Please stop.</i>

351
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,113
I didn't think so.

352
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,316
But I had to ask.

353
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,667
I used to scream at her to shut up

354
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,056
all the time in my head.

355
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,584
No, no.
I heard you a couple times.

356
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,623
I mean, now I wish
she would just say <i>anything.</i>

357
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,118
How is she?
Is she talking?

358
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,456
- No.
- Did you call her mom yet?

359
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:46,204
Did you unplug her yet?

360
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,647
That's not funny. At all.

361
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,169
I mean, seriously, so,
she left a thriving practice

362
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,700
and a fiancé in L.A. to come
and live with her brother

363
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,325
- who she resented.
- Yeah?

364
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:57,592
<i>That</i> was the tumor.

365
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,720
Wow.
How did we miss this?

366
00:14:58,778 --> 00:14:59,901
Man, I just wish I had a tumor
to blame

367
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,067
- <i>my</i> stupid crap on.
- No. Guys!

368
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:04,864
"DeLuca, I'm sorry I hit you. Tumor."

369
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,641
- This is not cool.
- Riggs. Tumor.

370
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,201
- Minnick.
- Oh, tumor.

371
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,511
- No! Do not encourage them.
- What? You have to laugh, April.

372
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,425
I mean, in situations like this,
you have to laugh.

373
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:14,916
No. She trusted me with her life.

374
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,478
- Tumor!
- Stop!

375
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,689
Speak of the devil.

376
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,983
- My tumor's calling.
- Oh, are you gonna answer?

377
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,155
No. Once that's diagnosed,
you cut it right out.

378
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,588
Hey, Riggs panicked.
People panic.

379
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,611
Oh, don't defend him.

380
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,201
- It's DeLuca.
- Amelia's talking!

381
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,697
- She's talking.
- Really?!

382
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,611
- She's talking?
- Sort of.

383
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,547
It's weird, right?

384
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,746
- It's French.
- She speaks French?

385
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,339
I speak French. She speaks German.

386
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,581
What is she saying?

387
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,674
Sorry. She said she needs
a glass of water.

388
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,780
Oh.

389
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,963
You know, all the Shepherd children

390
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,658
went to French preschool.

391
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,110
And it's still in her brain somewhere?

392
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,799
<i>- Merci.
- I've seen this before.</i>

393
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,646
It reverses on its own,
but this is...

394
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,094
It's still good. It's progress.

395
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,715
Amelia.

396
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,494
What'd she say?

397
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,160
Uh, I asked her
if she could speak in English,

398
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:14,056
and she said, "Didn't even know
I could speak French."

399
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,481
Weaknesses? Uh, hmm.

400
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,714
I hate all my peers.
All of them.

401
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,108
Yeah, med school is filled
with legacy kids

402
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,299
who expect everything easy.

403
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,588
I had to work my ass off
for everything that I have.

404
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,428
I saw what I wanted,
I took dead aim,

405
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:33,611
and I earned it.

406
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,381
But if that attitude is a problem,

407
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,400
you definitely shouldn't hire me.

408
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,470
You'll get a major
signal boost from me.

409
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:42,709
When I started med school,

410
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,072
I had 47 followers on Instagram.

411
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,369
That number's over 10,000 now.

412
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,650
People are really invested
in my journey.

413
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,830

that'll become <i>our</i> journey.

414

I-I have to get this out!

420
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:23,799
No! Megan, you're in the middle

421

You can't just... Megan, stop!

What's happening?

423
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,332
Farouk's at the hospital
in Baghdad,

424
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:30,817
and I can't get him on the phone,
and my C.O. can't tell me what's going on.

425
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:32,364
- They said he was anemic.
- He's not anemic.

426
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,406
He eats dates every day,
which is plenty of iron.

427
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:35,800
Look. I have to go.

428
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:37,651
You can just write me
a prescription for the rest,

429
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:38,864
and I'll fill it on the way
to the airport.

430
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,977
Megan, you're bleeding.
Give me your arm.

431
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,359
And you have an infection,
and you know what that means.

432
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,427
- I'll sign an A.M.A. form, okay?!
- When I was adopting my daughter,

433
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,641
there was a moment where I thought
they were gonna take her from me,

434
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,843
so I stole her.

435
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,221
I kidnapped my own daughter

436
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,126
because I felt exactly
the way you feel right now.

437
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,884
All I did was make everything worse.

438
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,121
I made it worse for her,
and I made it worse for me.

439
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:58,812
So let's just take a moment,
okay?

440

Yeah. Eventually...

450
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:36,876
you have a new normal.

You miss her on the nights
that you don't have her,

but you know that she's
somewhere safe and loved,

and the ache is just less.

What's the cause of your memory loss?

494
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:35,086
It's, uh, retrograde amnesia.

495
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,332
From?

496
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,838
<i>From damage to the temporal lobe.</i>

497
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:40,204
But you were in the frontal.

498
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:42,286

<i>So we can secure his

525
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,429
Y-Yes, of course, Dr. Riggs.

526

- Of course.</i>

529

In the sample you received,
how was his MCV?

530
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:04,523
Uh, low... 68.

531

<i>Ferritin level?</i>

532
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:09,742
Uh, 111, but the sample could've
decayed during transport.

<i>Were there any Heinz bodies

536

<i>Dr. Grey, I said, "Were there

537
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,833
Yes. There were Heinz bodies

538
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:23,376
<i>Thank you, Doctor. We will let you know</i>

Why didn't you call someone else?!

547
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,518
<i>Because they are

548
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,613

Even if you give it away,

651

you have to decide who gets it

652
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,731
You could buy an island.

653

675
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:18,748
One day I caught some shrapnel,

676
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,673
and I woke up on a cot in a CSH tent.

677
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,578
I watched 3 combat surgeons
save 37 soldiers in 6 hours.

678
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:27,113
I counted. I kept score.

679
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,695
I thought, "That's not a bad way
to spend your time."

680
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:31,920
Also, I watched a lot of
"M.A.S.H." when I was a kid,

681
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,857

Me too!

683
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:41,003
I read all about the fire.
And the resident who set it?

684
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:44,542
Incredible. So smart, so brave.

685
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:47,026

686
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:48,753
She's officially my new hero.

687
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,839

you make when you rebuild.

688
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:54,065
We already rebuilt.

689
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:57,878
Right! No. Of course you did.
It's... gorgeous!

690
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,800
Who's your designer?

691
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,651
Come on, Nathan.
Come on, Nathan.

692
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:07,948
Dr. Grey, uh, if it's all right,

693
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,063
um, I need you to take
my name off the paper.

694
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,378
Why?

695
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:14,417
It's okay. I know that
Alex told you about him.

696
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,632
Oh, Wilson, when I asked you

697
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,374
for that picture,
I wasn't even thinking.

698
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,979
It's not your job to think about it.

699
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,213
- It's okay.
- Okay.

700
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:28,854
Why would you take your name
off that article?

701
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:30,902
Because if I didn't,

702
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,578
my psychopathic husband
might see my picture,

703
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,487
learn my new name,
and come kill me.

704
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:38,675
That's...

705
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:40,549
Wait. Seriously?

706
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,237
Y-You're married?

707
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:43,792
And in hiding.

708
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,698
Okay, how about you tell me
a secret about yourself

709
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:53,042
so that I'm not the only one
who feels so horribly exposed?

710
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,390
A-All right. Um...

711
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:58,545
Uh, I'm training for something,

712
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:02,518
and if my wife finds out,
she is not gonna like it.

713
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,191
Like, a lot.

714
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:08,503
Wait. What is it?

715
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,898
I once had a patient with bipolar
disorder and a malignant glioma.

716
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:18,628
I took out the tumor.
Bipolar didn't change.

717
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,878
I once had a patient
with an armpit fetish pre-op.

718
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:23,453
Tumor came out,
guy still loved him some pits.

719
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:25,008
Are you saying you think
I'm nuts?

720
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,065
I'm saying there's
nothing physically wrong

721
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:28,909
with you anymore.
Go home.

722
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:33,706
DeLuca, schedule a functional MRI,

723
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:36,253
a carotid duplex,
and another CT with contrast.

724
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:37,979
Dr. Shepherd, respectfully, I just...

725
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,136
I don't understand
what we're looking for.

726
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:41,934
I'll know when I'm looking at it.

What is the hold-up exactly
with my patient?

740
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:14,384
The individual can't be
released until DHS comes

741
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:16,457
and checks it off, and we're
waiting on some paperwork

- from INS that needs...
- He cannot wait for paperwork.

743
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:21,461
Well, he seems all right for now,
so just let me do my job,

744
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,311
and we'll get him out of here
as quick as we can.

745
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:24,994
Does he?
Does he seem okay to you?

As clearly as the yellow
in your eyes tells me

749
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:32,795
you should see a doctor
and get your liver checked soon.

750
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:34,556
And do you have a form that you fill out

751
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:36,325
for standing by while a child dies?

752
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:38,897
Because you're gonna need that

753
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,219

I never use lengthy medical terms,

I try to connect with them

764
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,801
over an anecdote
or a shared experience.

765
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:10,806
I think patient connection

766
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:14,151
is... just as important
as surgical dexterity.

767
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:17,418
Well, nobody ever bled out
from rudeness.

Right. Right, right.

Not <i>as</i> important.

After I finished undergrad,

771
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:27,528
I applied for the primary-care
rotation in Nepal.

772
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:35,208
Why did you bring a dog
to your interview?

773
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:36,430
Emotional support.

774
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,761
And, legally,
you're not allowed to ask me that.

775
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:41,385
Uh...

776
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:52,731
- Hey.
- Hey. Megan?

777
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:55,489
I want you to stay calm.

778
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,088
Don't make any sudden movements.
Don't jump out of bed.

779
00:32:58,231 --> 00:33:00,294
I don't want you to ruin my work.

780
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,525
What are you doing here?

781
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,958
I-I brought you someone.

782
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:08,864
Hi, Mama!

783
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,458
Oh, my God!

784
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,181
Farouk! Oh, my God!

785
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,029
Oh, my God!

786
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,689
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

787
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,943
I missed you!

788
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,099
I missed you, too!

789
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:23,046
Ahh!

790
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,655
Oh, my God. Are you real? Are you real?

791
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,425
Are you really here?

792
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,362
Ohh. This is your Uncle Owen.

793
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,864
- Owen, this is Farouk.
- Hey. Hey. How you doing?

794
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,478
Thank you. Thank you
for looking after her.

795
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,844
Thank you.

796
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,862
Come here. Oh, my God.

797
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:46,182
Have you eaten anything?

798
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:48,433
You must be so tired.
Are you hungry?

799
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:50,440
- I'm hungry.
- The food here's terrible.

800
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:04,546
I can't find the operative report.
Did Koracick dictate...

801
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,573
I think I figured out
what you're looking for.

802
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:10,510
It was this.

803
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,673
This is what's missing.

804
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,995
I think you've been waiting
for the other shoe to drop,

805
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:22,464
for... something to go wrong.

806
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,886
And I think it might be
because, for years now,

807
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,792
something <i>was</i> wrong.

808
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:30,023
This thing was growing inside of you,

809
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,581
and you were in constant danger.

810
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,112
But now it's gone.

811
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,244
And you're safe.

812
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:38,800
And I think, for you, that might feel...

813
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,656
like something's wrong, but, uh...

814
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:48,329
You know, I'm... I'm sorry.

Oh, Maggie,
I'm so glad you were there

to talk some sense into <i>this</i> one.

826
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:35,915
He's pretty sensible, I think.

827
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:36,993
Oh, he's like me.

828
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,482
My mom could talk to me
till she was blue in the face,

829
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,553
but if my <i>sister told me something,</i>

830
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,848
I would actually listen.

831
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,126
Let's do that again soon.

832
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,076
- Have a good night, then.
- Yeah. You too.

833
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,243
So, honey, how's it going?

834
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,440
Have you found
all your new interns yet?

835
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:01,767
Well, the older I get,
the more I dislike them.

836

Hey! Kit Cat!
You want to grab a drink?

837
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,618
Um, we have plans,
uh, my wife and... and I.

838
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:12,029
We don't want to miss our chance.

839
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,568
I-I'm not gonna be here much longer.

840
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:15,232
Well, you have to
come around more often.

841
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,306
Maybe you can do a lecture
a couple times a year, hmm?

842
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:20,516
I'm gonna
make that happen.

843
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,634

844
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:26,962

845
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,560
You're that desperate to see him again?

846
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:34,017
Oh, honey, yes.
I like what he does to you.

847
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,959
Hey, so, I stocked the fridge
with all your favorites.

848
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,318
I set the thermostat to boiling,
just how you like it.

849
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:48,626
I want you to come home, Amelia.

850
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:53,111
Yeah, I figured, um, you would
take care of your sister,

851
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:56,787
and, uh, my sisters
would take care of me,

- and then...
- And then what?

853
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:03,986
And then I don't know. And it's scary.

854
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,631
You were coming to end it,
to leave me

855
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:11,054
when I told you that I was sick.

856
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:12,986
Listen. I was upset.
But I didn't know...

857
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:14,926
You were right.
I was awful to you.

858
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,814
You were right to want to leave.

859
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:19,023
You had a tumor.

860
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:21,712
- You married a tumor.
- I married <i>you.</i>

861
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,498
We don't know who that is anymore.

862
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:24,978
