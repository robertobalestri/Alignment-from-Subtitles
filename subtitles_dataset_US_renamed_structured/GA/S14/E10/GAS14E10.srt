1
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,054
<i>In the course of one day,</i>

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,656
<i>Job received four messages,
each with separate news</i>

3
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:21,866
<i>that his livestock, servants,
and 10 children had all died.</i>

4
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>He continued to be
a faithful servant.</i>

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,929
<i>He still praised God.
He persevered.</i>

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,869
- What did you do?
- We didn't do this.

7
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:37,035
My card was in his pocket,
so they called me.

8
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,885
- But we were at home. We were in bed.
<i>- Can I get a hand in here?!</i>

9
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,718
Go to the attendant's lounge on three.
And don't talk to anybody.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,609
<i>Job's faith was tested.</i>

11
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:45,999
<i>And he passed the test.</i>

12
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,333
We've got you.
Okay.

13
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,351
- Ahh!
- Hit-and-run?

14
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:52,837
Yes.
He's just waking up now.

15
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:55,540
Dr. Stadler, calm down.
We're trying to help you, okay?

16
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:57,476
Feel a little stick here.

17
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:00,046
- Are there any suspects?
- Why would I know that?

18
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,185
- Okay. You can't lose him.
- I don't intend to.

19
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:04,581
I mean,
you <i>really can't lose him.</i>

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,982
I won't.

21
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,385
Oh.
Thanks for the help.

22
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:08,887
And the vote of confidence!

23
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:10,107
<i>And for his faith,</i>

24
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,892
<i>God rewarded Job with
twice what he had before.</i>

25
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:15,849
Hey, Helm! Get in here
and staple up this head lac

26
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:17,883
and then get him up to CT,
okay?

27
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,389
Hey. So,
what happened to Stadler?

28
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,162
Hit-and-run.
Sending him to CT.

29
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,810
Hey, uh,
Webber just gave me

30
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,795
the Grey Sloan Medical
Innovation contest.

31
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:28,498
The whole thing.
Kind of freaking out.

32
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,975
Freaking out
because you don't want it?

33
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,306
No.
Why wouldn't I want it?

34
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,935
Uhh, I just think
you'd want to compete is all.

35
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:36,272
Who wants to compete
when you can be the judge?

36
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,529
Um, everyone?

37
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,154
Ev...

38
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,701
He... He played me?

39
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,762
Is that what you're saying?
Dr. Webber played me?

40
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,504
I said
nothing of the sort.

41
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,029
But yes.

42
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,886
And now I'm gonna go over there.

43
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,044
He...

44
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,519
Thank you.

45
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,724
Hey, Kepner,
I heard that Dr. Stadler was...

46
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,145
He's gone to CT.
He should be fine.

47
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,348
- And you know what? Um,
- That's good.

48
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,931
I've been reconsidering it,

49
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,865
and... and I think
that you're fully capable

50
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,875
of running that contest
on your own.

51
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,140
I mean, I-I think...

52
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,711
I think that your "seasons"
make you the exact right man...

53
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,959
No.

54
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,599
No? You didn't even...
You didn't even think about it.

55
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,373
Finders keepers,
Kepner.

56
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,311
That's very childish,
Dr. Webber!

57
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:21,943
Finders keepers!

58
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,162
Karin Taylor. 30 years old.

59
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,414
- 37 weeks pregnant with active contract...
- Nope!

60
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,047
Very pregnant patients
go to L&D.

61
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,497
I'm not due
for another three weeks.

62
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:30,845
I can't reach my husband,
so I'm hoping that this is false labor,

63
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,493
but Dr. Robbins said
that she would meet me here.

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,460
- Dr. Robbins? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,973
She's my maternal-fetal doc.

66
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,742
My baby's got a...
a teeny heart defect.

67
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,510
Ohh! Ahh!
Here comes another one.

68
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,479
Hmm! Motherhumper!
This hurts!

69
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,974
Ah. Ah. Okay.

70
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,150
All right. Here you go.

71
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:48,287
Just breathe.

72
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:50,471
I don't like to question God,

73
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,775
but I have got to wonder
about this particular design.

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,334
I mean, the combination of
the size of the baby's head

75
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,420
and the female anatomy,

76
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,896
- it just feels like...
- <i>One, two, three!</i>

77
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:00,666
An odd act of cruelty, or, like,
maybe a little bit of a slip.

78
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,810
Like, maybe he was tipsy
when he came up with it.

79
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,546
I mean, we know God likes to drink...
the whole "water to wine" of it all.

80
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,636
It just doesn't seem like that
far of a leap to think that...

81
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,217
Ohh! Ooh!

82
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,705
- Son of a fish! This hurts!
- Okay.

83
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:13,541
These contractions are
pretty close together.

84
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,440
Do you mind
if I do a quick exam?

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,630
No? Okay. 
Here we go.

86
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,703
Uh-oh. What's wrong?
What's that face?

87
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,961
Uh, n-no, nothing's wrong.
It's just this baby's

88
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,804
not waiting for anyone,
'cause I can feel the head.

89
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,327
No, no, no. My husband is gonna
die if he doesn't make it here.

90
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:30,433
Because
I am going to kill him!

91
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:33,164
- Answer the phone!
- We've got a precipitous delivery.

92
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:35,271
Helm, get an L&D tray
and a baby warmer.

93
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,326
And somebody find me Robbins!

94
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,406
Miranda, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:41,828
- But it's a teacher work day and...
- Which is why

96
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,404
I signed him up
for Science Camp.

97
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,209
No, actually,
you asked <i>me</i> to do it,

98
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,485
and I forgot,
and I'm sorry.

99
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,248
But they changed
my ride-along to today.

100
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:52,029
Oh, so your plan now
is to leave me

101
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,740
with two tween-age boys

102
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:56,123
while you go ride around
with your friends all day

103
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:57,196
in the ambulance.

104
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:58,701
Well, I'm not joyriding,
Miranda.

105
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,051
- I'm gonna go on...
- Okay, we're not arguing

106
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,128
right now about
your questionable career choices.

107
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:06,201
We are arguing about your
failure to secure childcare.

108
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,498
Yeah, fine. Go.
I'll think of something.

109
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,232
Mnh.

110
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,428
Hmph.

111
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:16,451
Hey! Tuck is here!

112
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,287
Yes. He's supposed to be at
Science Camp,

113
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,585
- but my husband...
- Ooh,

114
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,248
Science Camp.
I loved Science Camp.

115
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:25,021
Ohh! They can't miss that.
That's cruel.

116
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:26,918
- Let me do it!
- Hmm?

117
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:28,967
Can I do a science camp?
Can I take them?

118
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm canceling a thing.

119
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,279
I'll be right back!

120
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,017
Okay.

121
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:40,175
Okay, Karin, just relax.
You're doing great.

122
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:41,989
I feel like I'm
pooping out a cantaloupe.

123
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,104
Okay.
We can help with that.

124
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,232
- Um, Dr. Helm.
- Mm-hmm?

125
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,582
See this area right here,
the perineum?

126
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,024
I want you to place
your hand right here

127
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,013
and, with your thumb
and index, form a "U."

128
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,180
That'll help relieve some of the
pressure and keep her from tearing.

129
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,245
- Tearing?
- Tearing?!

130
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:53,717
- We're preventing that.
- Ooh!

131
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,217
It's just I... Ooh.

132
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:56,282
I always, uh... Hmm.

133
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,443
I can never get over how
it just <i>stretches</i> like that.

134
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,678
This whole process defies
the laws of physics.

135
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,318
I mean, it's almost inhuman.

136
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,342
"Miraculous."
She means miraculous, Karin.

137
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,605
My whole hand fits in here!

138
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,847
It... That should <i>never</i>
<i>be able to happen!</i>

139
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,094
Dr. Helm.

140
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,769
- Okay, here we go.
- Uh-huh.

141
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,456
- I want you to push. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,904
You've got this. Breathe.
Just <i>breathe</i> through this.

143
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,499
If my husband does not
get here in five minutes,

144
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,849
I am gonna personally
shove a cantaloupe up...

145
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,858
- Oh, thank God! How we doing?
- You all right? How we doing?

146
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,529
How are we doing? You want to know
how we're doing? You seem fine.

147
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,308
I have got
two people's hands inside me,

148
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,857
one person trying to come out,
and everybody's got an opinion

149
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,703
on my vagina, and you want
to know how we're doing?

150
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,613
She's almost here!

151
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:36,894
April?

152
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:39,339
Matthew?

153
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,566
April? This is April?!

154
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,110
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!

155
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:50,844
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!

156
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,594
<font color=#FF00FF>*GREY'S ANATOMY*</font>

Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Personal Jesus"</font>

157
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,995
I'm not sure
you guys should be here,

158
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:10,495
or even in the country.

159
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:11,708
It wasn't us.

160
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:13,377
I know.
I believe you.

161
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,636
I still think you could make it
to Canada by lunchtime.

162
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:17,744
There's no acute
abnormalities on the CT.

163
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,190
It just looks like a severe concussion.

164
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,506
He's a lucky guy.

165
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,238
Thanks, Amelia.

166
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,973
So, attempted murder. Not murder.

167
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,146
We didn't do it.

168
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:27,781
I know. I believe you.

169
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,415
I'm just not sure
the police will.

170

things I knew,

00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,298

it's my fault again.

341
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,564
I'm always the one
that's wrong.

342
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:51,603
When he started hitting me,
it was just barely a surprise.

343
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,517
And he told me it was my fault,
and I actually believed him.

344
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,425
Until you talked to me yesterday,
I really believed him.

345
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,423
How did <i>I</i> believe him?

346
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:05,315
Because he was good to you
in the beginning.

347
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,978
And on the good days.

348
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,762
Jenny, we're not stupid.

349
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,634
We didn't fall for someone
who beat us.

350
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:14,978
We fell for someone
who made us laugh

351
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:18,181
and feel wanted
and loved and seen.

352
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,828
Paul is brilliant

353
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,406
and charming and
persuasive,

354
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:26,195
and the good outweighed the bad
until it didn't.

355
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,836
Okay, uh,
what do we have?

356
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,766
20-year-old tried to cut off his hand.

357
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,297
He was masturbating too much.

358
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:40,391
Oh, my.
That seems like an overreaction.

359
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,765
I was following God's Word.

360
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:43,555
Yeah,
not quite sure you heard Him right.

361
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,594
- If you don't know the Bible...
- No, I do. I do.

362
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,736
And the Bible also says
that your body's a temple

363
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,352
and you should use it
to glorify God.

364
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,494
I'm trying to,
but temptation is

365
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,081
- everywhere.
- Yeah, well, the Bible also says

366
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,049
that God doesn't tempt us
beyond our ability.

367
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,660
He doesn't give us
more than we can handle.

368
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,253
I think handling it
was his problem.

369
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,878
- Dr. Roy.
- Dr. Roy.

370
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,455
Look. "If your right hand causes
you to sin, you cut it off."

371
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:06,082
David, when God created the world,
he also created metaphors.

372
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,598
Excuse me.

373
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:17,853
I'm not seeing
any sign of bullet fragments,

374
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,445
no vertebral fractures.

375
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,065
I'd like to get a CT angio.

376
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,695
Yeah, but it's such a high burden
of radiation for a kid, though.

377
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:25,828
So our options are
to watch and wait

378
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:27,315
or to operate blind?

379
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:28,440
No, thank you.

380
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,727
Let's do the CT.
I'll call up.

381
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,573
We're looking for Eric Sterling.

382
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,422
Yeah,
come this way.

383
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:41,406
- Mom.
- What happened, baby?

384
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,516
I forgot my key, and they
think I was breaking in.

385
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:48,141
I would thank you kindly to step
away from my 12-year-old child.

386
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,001
He shouldn't be talking to you
without a guardian present!

387
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:52,469
He always forgets his keys.
Were you climbing in the window again?

388
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,538
Yes, but I did go to the
neighbor's house first,

389
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,963
just like you told me to.

390
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,041
- They weren't home.
- And for this you shot him?!

391
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:59,799
Not us, ma'am.
We weren't at the scene.

392
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:03,016
I was reaching for my phone
to call you, and they shot me.

393
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,433
How about you direct me to
the one who did the shooting?

394
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,656
Where the hell is that guy?!

395
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,664
He's at the station
answering some questions.

396
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,797
- Why don't you calm down...
- Calm down? Calm down?!

397
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:13,089
Calm down.

398
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,291
We'll have a little discussion
about it. Get your I.D...

399
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,117
You mean after they've had some
time with their kid, right?

400
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,883
He will come speak to you
when he is ready.

401
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,289
Now give him a moment, please.

402
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:30,000
♪♪

403
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,703
♪♪

404
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:34,922
Doctor, I don't tell you
how to do your job.

405
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,843
I'd appreciate you stop
telling me how to do mine.

406
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,978
Are you kidding?

407
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,836
Your co-worker just shot a kid
in the neck for no reason,

408
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:42,449
and you don't think that maybe you guys

409
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:44,711
should figure out another
way to do your job?

410
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,075
Dr. Kepner, Karin Taylor
is complaining of pain.

411
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:04,638
Karin, you're feeling pain? Uh, where?

412
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:06,598
Oh, no. I'm fine. It's fine.

413
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,724
I was just... I couldn't find
a comfortable position.

414
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,365
Okay. Your pulse is racing.
I'm just gonna page Dr. Robbins.

415
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,462
Oh, no, please don't.
Ruby's having her heart checked,

416
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,904
and I asked Dr. Robbins and
Matthew to stay with her.

417
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:17,270
Oh.

418
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,640
Okay, Karin, if you don't
tell me what's going on,

419
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,036
I can't help you.

420
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay.

421
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,503
My vagina hurts.
Like, a lot.

422
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,436
- Ah. Okay.
- Yeah.

423
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,917
Um, well,
I should have a...

424
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,568
May I have a look?

425
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,807
You've already been
all up in there, so...

426
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,737
- In for a penny, I suppose.
- All right.

427
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:41,891
So, I'm just gonna have you put
your knees straight up for me

428
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,967
with your ankles together,
and then drop your knees.

429
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:45,695
Yeah, just like that.

430
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,499
Okay,
give me just a second.

431
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,902
Okay.

432
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,484
Okay.

433
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,572
Okay. I see the problem here.

434
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,677
You have a pretty significant
vulvar hematoma.

435
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,679
"Vulvar"? No, thank you.

436
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,885
It's a blood clot.
The swelling is causing your pain.

437
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:03,038
I can drain it for you,
and you'll feel 100% better.

438
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:06,154
Okay. A blood clot?

439
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,702
Yes, caused by bleeding
directed toward the skin

440
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,026
where the loose tissue doesn't
have much resistance to...

441
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,695
I'm sorry. Can you talk about
something else? Anything else.

442
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,726
Yeah. Um...

443
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,384
So how did, uh... How did you
and... and Matthew meet?

444
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:23,234
Oh, let's, uh, let's go back
to my loose tissue.

445
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:27,531
I'm sorry. This is...
This is weird.

446
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,124
It is.

447
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,304
But God doesn't give us more
than we can handle, right?

448
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,919
I was just saying that to someone.

449
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,045
Look at him.

450
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:52,906
Protecting us from a 12-year-old
strapped into a CT.

451
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,249
That is our tax dollars hard at work.

452
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,054
- He's just doing his job.
- That's what they always say.

453
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,777
What about the cop that shot the boy?

454
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:01,119
He also just doing his job?

455
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:03,228
I have seen soldiers get
so wound up with stress,

456
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:05,464
they just shoot first before they
even know what they're shooting at.

457
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:06,945
And you think that's okay?

458
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,304
No, I don't. No. No,
that's a war zone.

459
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,186
This was an
upper-class neighborhood.

460
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,476
Yeah, those can be the
worst neighborhoods for us.

461
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,091
I grew up in those neighborhoods.

462
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,928
Just being there is suspicious.

463
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,304
Constantly stopped for
"fitting the description."

464
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,517
I remember I was walking,
carrying these speakers

465
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,299
for my friend, and these cops
pulled up on me.

466
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:25,720
Car screeches to a halt.

467
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,963
They jump out, guns drawn,

468
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,285
yelling at me to drop everything,

469
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,351
slam me into the car, handcuff me.

470
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,734
I mean, I was one block
from my front door.

471
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:37,708
You n... You never told me that.

472
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,447
Well, doesn't really come up
until it does.

473
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,316
The scans are up.

474
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,783
Yeah, there it is.

475
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,085
Can track the bullet
right by the carotid.

476
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:49,157
But the vessel wall is intact,
though, so he's gonna be okay.

477
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:53,962
Uh, we'll keep him for observation.
I V antibiotics.

478
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,804
But this could've been <i>so</i> much worse.

479
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:01,107
They took his childhood today.

480
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,676
He's never gonna be the same.

481
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,350
I have to get back.

482
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,288
I'm so sorry, Mr. Taylor.
It's out of my control.

483
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:23,418
I'm sorry. If you could just check
and see if there's a room available.

484
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,550
Why hasn't Mrs. Taylor

485
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:25,900
- been sent up to a room yet?!
- I, uh...

486
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:29,605
Call L&D, call postpartum,
call somebody and make it happen!

487
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:31,341
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:36,306
How have you been?

489
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:40,309
Good. Really good.
And you?

490
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,509
I mean, how's Ruby?

491
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,306
"Ruby." So pretty.
Um, how... how is she?

492
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:46,962
She's good.

493
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,869
Thank you. Dr. Robbins says
she's good.

494
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,337
Karin is terrific.

495
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,147
Yeah, she is.

496
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,566
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

497
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:04,517
And I guess I have you to thank for that.

498
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,267
I mean, it hurt, being left
on my wedding day.

499
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:10,618
Matthew, I'm so sorry...

500
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,220
At my wedding in front of
everyone I knew and loved.

501
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,853
It hurt.

502
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:19,546
And I wasn't open to
being hurt again like that,

503
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:21,129
so Karin and I...

504
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,684
we had a long friendship

505
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:28,016
before I let myself realize
that she was...

506
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,728
She's the love of my life,
you know?

507
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,042
Of course you know.

508
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,173
You...
You have that with Jackson.

509
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,478
And I h-heard from the pastor
that you were pregnant,

510
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:45,169
so you have, what, a 3-year-old now?

511
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,840
I had a... I have...

512
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,025
We have Harriet.

513
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:53,676
We have a beautiful daughter
named Harriet.

514
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:57,514
She's 1. And she's the light of my life.

00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,368

for both of us, then.

00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:09,533

523
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,393
My injuries are stable.
I'm fine to go.

524
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,454
Dr. Stadler, you should
stay for observation

525
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,566
for at least 24 hours.

526
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,603
You know, let him go.
He's a doctor.

527
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:44,941
If he wants to walk around

528
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,064
with fractured ribs and
a concussion, let him.

529
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,290
He's alert and oriented.

530
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:51,665
Are you the fiancée?

531
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,816
Maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

532
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,812
This is not a good idea. Wha...

Why are you with Brooke?

534
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,020
'Cause she doesn't want
to be alone with you.

535
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:05,087
Oh, why am I not surprised
that you tried to poison her

536
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:07,384

to defend myself?

537
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,625

You are way closer to that

00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,314
We have a wedding to plan.

be gone for a few days.

00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:48,862

I'm gonna tell them every time
you ever hurt me.

Every kick, every slap.

553
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,368
You put your hands around
my throat last night,

554
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:56,368
so that's not just domestic violence.
That's attempted murder.

555

- Not at all.

I'm the well-known physician,

She's bleeding out.
Why didn't you call me sooner?!

684
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:49,375
I called you as soon
as she was in distress.

685
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:51,153
She was sitting in your ER for hours!

686
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,345
How many times did you check her?

687
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:54,578
- Every 20 minutes.
- One BP was mildly elevated.

688
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:57,090
- What is it?
- It's DIC and HELLP syndrome.

689
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:58,837
Her liver's failing, and the other
organs are trying to follow.

00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,588
Okay. What can I do to help?
I can scrub in...

God! I can't stop this bleeding!

692
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,321
All right. We're gonna
have to do a hysterectomy.

No, April!

if we leave him plugged in?

He won't last for long.

723

I wanted to stand up and

724

I wanted to stand up in court

and humiliate him
the way he humiliated me.

726
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:02,146
When I was with him,
he didn't smoke or drink.

727
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:04,077
Is that still true?

728
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:08,733
Yeah. He jogs five miles a day.
No red meat. Why?

729
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,050
Because I know what to do.

730
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:21,638
Did you know that Seattle is
a city built on top of a city?

731
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:23,363
Um, have you been to...

732
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,063
Ah, what's its name?
The... The... The Underground?

733
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:28,634
- Her baseline pressure was low.
- Sorry?

734
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:29,865
My patient, Karin Taylor.

735
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:32,069
A high BP for her is a normal BP
for anyone else,

736
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:34,505
so when she was showing signs
of preeclampsia, she...

737
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:37,771
Her blood pressure seemed to
be normal, so no one saw it.

738
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,044
Yeah.

739
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,946
Dr. Robbins, she's in PEA.
I just lost her pulse.

740
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:42,981
Matthew, I need you
to get out of here, honey.

741
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,884
Don't take her away.
I'm begging you.

742
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,318
Okay, stop.

743
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:48,692
Please. Just put your
wisdom in these doctors' hands.

744
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,357
Okay. Hey, somebody's got to
get him out of here, please!

745
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,950
- Don't take her away from me.
- Matthew, you got to go!

746
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,727
We're maxed out on pressors
and had to stop dialysis

747
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:55,765
before she started coding.

748
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,262
Okay.
Let's get ECMO set up.

749
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,529
As soon as we get her back,
I want it ready. One of epi.

750
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:22,189
Oh, my God! No!

751
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:26,795
Oh, my God! No!

752
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,299
No!

753
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,570
Jackson. Jackson.

754
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,070
It was a high-pressure situation.

755
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:39,907
- An officer made a judgment call.
- No.

756
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,526
There's no judgment in that call.
That was just a reaction.

757
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,505
You see skin color. We all do.

758
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,878
But the reaction that
you give to a white kid

759
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:48,685
versus a brown kid in that split second?

760
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:51,224
That's the measurable,
fixable difference.

761
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,717
Bias is human.

762
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:54,607
You have guns.

763
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:57,953
You're using guns. So yours is lethal.

764
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,307
We aren't racist.

765
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:02,228
We just never know who has a gun.

766
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:04,697
I didn't say anything about racist.
I said biased.

767
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,911
And lucky for us, bias is fixable.

768
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,200
You have protocols in place.

769
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,238
Those can be adjusted.
You can fix it.

770
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:15,148
Or you can keep pretending
that it doesn't exist at all.

771
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:16,419
Kids are dying.

772
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:19,645
This kid is dead. For what?

773
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:24,279
So many people that look
just like him are dying.

774
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,920
For what?

775
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:35,107
Doctor. I'm sorry, but
we still need a statement.

776
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,257
My statement is that
a little boy was at home

777
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:41,802
when your fellow officer
shot and killed him.

778
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:45,255
You can't just be out there
shooting people

779
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,471
'cause you're afraid.

780
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,505
How am I supposed to have any
faith in a system like that?

781
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,741
12 years old.
In his own house.

782
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,729
It's time to give Tuck the talk.

783
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:11,156
I know.

784
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,367
- You paged?
- Uh, yes.

785
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:27,744
Well, I just telling David

786
00:35:27,812 --> 00:35:30,737
with a little rehab he should
make a complete recovery.

787
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:31,806
Okay.

788
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:35,006
And he, uh, had a few questions
I couldn't answer.

789
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,396
You know scripture, right?

790
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:41,103
We'll leave you to it.

791
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:42,971
Yeah.

792
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:44,471
A or B...

793
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,830
God created the Earth in seven
days, or evolution happened?

794
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,159
Both. 2 Peter says that with the Lord,

795
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:52,932
a day is like a thousand years,
so He measures time differently,

796
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,537
which means he could have used
evolution to create the world.

797
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:59,282
Do you think that Jonah really survived
three days in the belly of a great fish?

798
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,823
The Bible is... is a book, David.

799
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,779
It's full of beautiful stories
and metaphors and... and poems

800
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:06,037
that shouldn't be taken literally.

801
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:09,150
But 2 Timothy says all scripture
is inspired by God.

802
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:11,151
Yeah, inspired by, not dictated by.

803
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:12,521
What about "thou shalt not kill"?

804
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,580
Well, come on.
That one is definitely literal.

805
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:17,778
Aren't they all?
Luke says "Blessed are those

806
00:36:17,861 --> 00:36:19,760
who hear
the word of God and obey it."

807
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:21,644
- I know. I know He...
- James says, "Do not merely

808
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:22,911
listen to the word.

809
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:25,326
- Do what it says."
- Within reason!

810
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:28,143
You have to do what it says
within reason, okay?!

811
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:30,780
We don't chop off our limps!
We don't cut our babies in half!

812
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,729
Then tell me what to do if this won't!

813
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,185
If I can't trust this,
if it's not the truth,

814
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:37,088
if the Word of God is just
a bunch of stories,

815
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:38,584
what does anything mean?

816
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,161
What is any of this even for?

817
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,337
I am William George Bailey Jones.

818
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:50,317
I'm 13 years old.

819
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:52,360
And I have nothing to harm you.

820
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:53,472
That's good, baby.

821
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:56,737
You always have to show the
police where your hands are.

822
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:59,815
And always say what you're doing
before you do it.

823
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,936
Be in control of your emotions.

824
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,987
Be polite and... and respectful.

825
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:06,770
Yeah, don't fight back.
Don't talk back.

826
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:08,276
Do not make any sudden movements.

827
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:11,247
Remember, your only goal
is to get home safely.

828
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,614
If you get detained, don't sign anything

829
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:16,512
or... or write anything.

830
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,286
Wait for a parent before you talk.

831
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,981
And if your white friends

832
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,890
are saying things or mouthing off,

833
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:23,917
know that you <i>cannot.</i>

834
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,913
You can't go climbing through windows,

835
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:29,582
play with toy guns, throw rocks.

836
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:32,619
And you cannot ever run away from them,

837
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:34,786
no matter how afraid you are.

838
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,369
Never, never...

839
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,425
never run.

840

Everything that we're saying to you

841
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:49,737
we're saying because we want you
to come home again.

842
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,255
We want you to grow up

843
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:56,049
to be anything and everything
that you want to be.

844
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,657
Do you hear me?

845
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:02,131
You... are amazing.

846
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,090
You are perfect.

847
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:09,374

His kidney's going to
a little girl in Billings.

857
00:38:41,547 --> 00:38:43,476
Do you think he's evil?

858
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:47,061
I mean, I'm a scientist,

859
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:49,453
and I think I'm an atheist.

860
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:51,773
But there's a little part of me
that's worried

861
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:54,367
that the girl in Billings
is getting an evil kidney.

862
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:55,799
Hmm.

863
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:59,629
I don't believe that anyone
is <i>just</i> evil.

00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:03,231
If people were just one thing,
life would be so much simpler.

865
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,543
Paul was awful in this life,

866
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:10,416
but now, in death,
he gets to do all this good.

867
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:14,196
So there's light and darkness,

868
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:16,214
and they both coexist.

869
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:21,108

it's really beautiful.
