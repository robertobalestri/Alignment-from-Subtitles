- Oh, from Cedars?
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,801
Of course, yes.
I've read your work

140
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,252
on stem-cell clone engraftment.

141
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,029
I'm actually pulling together a research
project kind of similar right now.

142
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,193
I'd love to tell you about it
sometime.

143
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,528
Jackson, she's not here
to work on your project.

144
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,045
She's here
to pitch us one of her own.

145
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,994
- Exactly.
- Okay.

146
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:56,364
Catherine, I know you've taken
part in several successful

147
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:59,231
gender-affirmation surgeries
for trans women.

148
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,486
- As has Jackson.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,387
Which is why
I need you two.

150
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,064
To do what exactly?

151
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,587
A traditional vaginoplasty...

152
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,559
using ileum or
the sigmoid colon...

153
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:09,510
gives you the feel of a vagina,

154
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,807
but it's been shown
to be at high risk

155
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,924
for prolapse and narrowing
or obstruction.

156
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:18,403
So, the goal is to find
a tissue that's smooth,

157
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,338
with good elasticity,
that secretes moisture

158
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:22,971
and repairs itself.

159
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,213
And I believe

160
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,627
that tissue
is the peritoneum.

161
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,080
But the peritoneum protects
the internal organs.

162
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,385
Yes, but we'd only take
a small portion.

163
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,791
And it regenerates itself.

164
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,482
Have you thought about
how you'd harvest it?

165
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:38,955
Laparoscopically,
minimally invasive.

166
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,830
This technique
could be life-changing,

167
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,770
and not just for trans women,

168
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,356
but women who were born
with congenital defects,

169
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:51,361
potentially cis women who have lost
their vaginal canals to cancer.

170
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,143
And it would allow
for an even better orgasm.

171
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:56,473
Ooh! Now you're talking <i>my</i> language.

172
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,314
Thank you, Mom. Great.

173
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,833

you and I don't work together
on genitalia

190

in the backyard

556

that I used to pretend
was a magic wand.

And, um...

558
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,876
when I would feel like this,
I would go my room

559
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:42,268
and I would wave it and,
for a second, it would all go away.

560

I wished I had that wand.

that has nothing to do with me,

575
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,471

688
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,365

- We'll see.

689

696

697
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:55,843

- Yep.

707
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,349
- I'd stay in bed today.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,696
So, um,
I need you to go to the closet

709
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:22,607

710
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,147
And in the bathroom,

711
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:26,016
there should be
a pair of latex gloves.

712
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,110
And in the kitchen,

713
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:28,933
- there's a turkey baster.
- No!

714
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,860
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.

715
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:34,474

716
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,930

717

719
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,009

720
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:44,185

and secrecy in your bedroom.

721
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:46,876

722

723
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:50,853
Oh... No, I...

724
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,568

725
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,490
For the contest entry!

726
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:58,217
Look. Okay.

727
00:30:58,373 --> 00:30:59,720
See?

728
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,814
It goes in your rectum.

729
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:09,156
So, my spleen planted seeds
and grew more?

730
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:10,623
Something like that, yes.

731
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,196
Your spleen inspired Dr. Grey

732
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:16,349
to come up with something that might
help save thousands of people.

733
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:18,357
Wow. Really?

734
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,864
Can we put that on
a certificate or something?

735
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:25,554
- We need good news.
- DeLuca, go.

736
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:29,180
Right. So, I looked at gamma
knives and proton-beam therapy.

737
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:30,797
Nothing there. We checked out

738
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:33,156
high-frequency ultrasound
applications in neurosurgery.

739
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,959
It was utilized for thalamic
stimulation in comatose patients.

740
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,368
There was a study that was done in...

741
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:39,680
There was no mention in
the literature of its usefulness

742
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:42,545
as a surgical modality
in the brain. I...

743
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:44,867
- I think it's a dead end.
- So...

744
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:47,042
So, we got nothing.
I'm sorry.

745
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,084
"Notes that would shatter glass."

746
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,170
High frequencies.

747
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,133
They shatter the glass
because the note

748
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,428
has the same resonance frequency
as the glass itself.

749
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,779
So, an ultrasound wave,

750
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:59,053
if it was at the same frequency
as the tumor tissue...

751
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:01,060
It would shatter it without cutting.

752
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,521
But I-It's never been done in the brain.

753
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:05,185
Not yet.

754
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:10,734
With ultra-precise targeting
of the cancer cells,

755
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:12,698
we think we'll be able
to use it as an alternative

756
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,937
- to invasive brain surgery.
- Has this ever been done before?

757
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:18,766
Well, not on brain tissue,
but if we experiment on models first,

758
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,302
we think we could use it
on tumors.

759
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:22,238
So, you want to use my kid
as a lab rat?

760
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,849
No, ma'am, not as a lab rat.
She's the goal.

761
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:28,117
- I'm the lab rat's cheese.
- We're really close.

762
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:31,576
We just need a little more time to get
funding and do some more research.

763
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,529
How much time are we talking?

764
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:35,857

Kimmie, there will be more
auditions in the fall.

We're really close to figuring
out a way to help you, Kimmie.

769
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,701
- I believe it.
- Well, we both do.

770
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:56,339
So, in the meantime...
Radiation, chemo, rinse, repeat.

Dr. Avery.

772
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:03,956
I finished the paper for
your spray-on-skin proposal,

773
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,341
but the other Dr. Avery asked me
to type up a proposal

774

775
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,784

Both of them.
