00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:13,141

Circadian rhythms.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:23,037
We know something's wrong
when the cycle is broken.

6
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:24,991
Our duty is to fix it.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,639
To force the cogs
back in line.

8
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:31,683
Sorry, sir!
Morning, sir!

9
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:36,974
But that break can also be
useful, like a warning shot.

10
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,938
Beth, please. I know.

11
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:51,194
Y-Yeah, my leave
was canceled. I...

12
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,912
Don't cry. I will make this
up to you, I promise.

13
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,456
She's got that vice grip
so tight,

14
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,912

are about to pop off.

15

How you holding up?

16
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,022
Well, considering
that today decides

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,506
my entire military future?
Medium.

18
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,873
You're a shoo-in.

19
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,721
I think I'd rather focus on
my brother's pathetic love life.

20
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:09,026
- Hey, that was an endearing conversation.
- How's everything at home?

21
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,702
All right. Let's focus on
getting this stuff loaded.

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,318
We need to be in Fallujah
at 0700.

23
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,985
I'd like to be
less uptight by 0700.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,337
Okay. Save it. The colonel's
coming. Where the hell is Riggs?

25
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:20,501
He was on call last night.
I'll get him.

26
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:27,322
Owen. Owen.

27
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:29,673
Owen!

28
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,000
Are you okay?

29
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:33,563
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,955

It's not really goodbye.

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,298
I mean, Los Angeles
is a two-hour flight,

32
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:45,618
so you can see her
whenever you want.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,118
Yeah.

34
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,142
How 'bout I make us
dinner tonight?

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,278
Well, that
would be... nice.

36
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,397
Hey! I'm getting
on the road now.

37
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,845
How long till you're here?

38
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,524
Uh, it's...
It's a long drive.

39
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,485
Well, if you drive faster,
will you get here sooner?

40
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,321
Just help Nathan
get everything ready,

41
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,669
and you won't even
notice the time.

42
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,290
Aah! Son of a...

43
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:15,696
Doubt it.

44
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:16,810
Kisses, my sweet boy.

45
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,470
Hey, will you give Nate
the phone?

46
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,267
Oh. Thanks, buddy.

47
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,470
- Hey, baby, how's it going?
- How's he doing?

48
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,457
God. This has got to
be totally overwhelming for him.

49
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,445
- No, no, no.
- We're... We're having a blast.

50
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:29,820
And you got
his fan, right?

51
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:31,274
I mean, he cannot sleep
without his fan.

52
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,463
Uh, fan. Fan. Uh...

53
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,338
Well, I'm not sure if...

54
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,049
Oh, yeah.

55
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,932
- We got it.
- Okay.

56
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,893
Now we just got to figure out
how to put it together.

57
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,331
What was that?

58
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,674
Uh, uh, I don't know.

59
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,942
I didn't...
I didn't hear anything.

60
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,182
Did you hear anything,
Farouk?

61
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,659
The door falling!

62
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:58,068
Shh. No. No, he didn't...
He didn't hear anything, either.

63
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,099
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:06,445
- Incoming!
- Aah!

65
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,823
You're gonna kill me
one of these days.

66
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:13,515
Oh, you love it.

67
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,595
So, are we done fighting?

68
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,260
You tell me.

69
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,248
Come here.

70
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,245
- We're going to Fallujah.
- Hmm?

71
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,175
We're going to Fallujah!

No. No. I can't be late.
I can't be late. Not today.

ranked number one,

goodbye, so...

find that.

82

but, as I recall,

83

you... you lost your class ring
in the surgical sink, so...

84
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:15,696
Not a ring?

85
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:20,278
Don't you dare do the thing,
unless you are doing the thing.

86

- What?!
- Aah!

93
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,053
And I asked her
to marry me!

94
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,890
- Aah! Congratulations!
- About time!

95

Mwah!

Wow! An engagement
necklace?

Wow.
That's interesting.

99
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,456
Yeah, well, she loses everything
that's not tied to her, so...

104

He will.

I could find some pole work.

106

And you'll come
visit me a lot,

108
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,398

but I can't feel my arm.

175
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,314
What happened out there?
Two of the Iraqi allies

176
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,434
went rogue. Opened fire.

177
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:39,856
Tyler pushed people
out of the way.

178
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,318
You're looking at a
freakin' American hero, sir.

179
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,543
I really do need
my arm, sir.

180
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,965
We're gonna do
everything we can.

181
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,383
Hang two grams of cefazolin
and get him prepped for the O.R.

182
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,465
Stop! Stop! She doesn't...
Wait! Stop!

183
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,504
Don't touch her! She doesn't
want to be touched by men!

184
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,371
Hey, listen.
I got this. You go.

185
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,957
Hey, hey, I got it. Here.
Get out of the way.

186
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:00,206
"GSW upper right chest.
Diminished breathing sounds."

187
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:01,407
She needs a chest tube.

188
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:07,994
All right.
Let me take a look.

189
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:11,166
- Where do you want him?
- Shrapnel wound. Pre-op.

190
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,743
What do we have?

191
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,705
Nadir al-Jabouri.
Multiple GSWs to the torso.

192
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,376
Perp believed to be
the second shooter.

193
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,307
- And he's still alive?
- Unfortunately.

194
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,541
You treat that woman well.

195
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,987
'Cause she saved
everyone's ass!

196
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,041
Tried to wrestle
his gun from him.

197
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:27,276
He needs an ex lap.
O.R. ASAP. Let's go.

198
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:29,729
- Nathan, scrub in with me?
- You got it.

199
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,430
Let's go! Let's go!

200
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,698
We'll make your bed
a racecar,

201
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,666
so you can go really fast
in your dreams.

202
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:37,916
A race car?

203
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,510
Yeah, you know,
like NASCAR or Formula 1?

204
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,807
It's a car that goes
really, really fast.

205
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,065
- My bed?
- Trust me, it's cool.

206
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,080
Then where will
Mama sleep?

207
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:50,213
Well, in her room. Our room.
It's just across the hall.

208
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,151
But back home, we used to
sleep in the same room.

209
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:54,948
It's safer that way.

210
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,588
This is home now,
buddy.

211
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:01,073
Hey, I know
it's an adjustment, okay?

212
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,933
But once you start school,
you're gonna feel settled.

213
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,393
Mama has always been
my teacher

214
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:05,713
Well, now she
won't need to be.

215
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,202
You're gonna get to go to school
with a bunch of kids your own age.

216
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,776
You're gonna make
lots of friends.

217
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,987
Maybe join the band, you know?
You can play sports.

218
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,143
Soccer, baseball.
You're gonna love it.

219
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,174
I'm sorry! So sorry!

220
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,484
It's okay. It's okay.
But you got bare feet. Hang on.

221
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,718
There you go.
You're all right.

222
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,804
See? Not a problem.

223
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,859
That really is

224
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,416
a beautiful necklace
that you got for Megan.

225
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:45,171
Where'd you find
emeralds in Baghdad?

226
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,702
You want one
for yourself?

227
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,883
You seem awfully stuck
on it.

228
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,650
It just reminds me
so much of the necklace

229
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,226
that Sergeant Philips got
from her boyfriend back home.

230
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,424
You know...

231
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,343
Felicia Philips?

232
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:59,634
Well, but hers in engraved
with her initials on the back.

233
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,045
It's engraved?

234
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,117
Yep.

235
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,160

00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,275
Yeah.
You used to love this place.

Uh, that was before
it was haunted.

262
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,548
You know, I just thought
you'd want a ring-toss rematch,

263
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:13,039
since you used to always lose
and cry and say that I cheated.

264

Uh, you did cheat.

Okay.

268
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:19,810
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

269
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,181
This brings back

270
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,337
Okay, it's over here.

271
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,837
Oh, remember this?
No? Okay.

272
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:36,693
No. I don't want
to undress.

273
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,690
I hate to be naked
in front of strangers, too,

274
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,701
but I can't help you
if you don't let me.

275
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,892
My name is Megan.
What's yours?

276
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:52,462
Sana.
It's... It's Sana.

277
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,236
Sana.

278
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,844
It doesn't look too bad.
Go ahead and place a chest tube.

279
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,306
Hey, you were...
You were great with her.

280
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,368
Yeah, right? It's almost like
I know how to do my job.

281
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,095
Hey, uh...

282
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,004
How about you scrub in
on my mangled arm?

283
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,278
Oh, God. Don't.

284
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,474
Don't what?
My dream was just crushed.

285
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,710
A pity party
isn't going to fix it.

286
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,198
I-I just figured
it'd be nice to talk,

287
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,854
you know, celebrate
the good things in life,

288
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,728
which still exist,
despite the strat.

289
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,906
Like, how Mom's head's gonna
explode planning two weddings.

290
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,157
- Two weddings?
- Come on.

291
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:29,946
Maybe Mom can plan your divorce
while she's at it.

292
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,384
You're gonna need more
packing in the left upper quadrant.

293
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,767
This spleen is shattered.
More lap pads!

294
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,259
Of all the stupid,
selfish, moronic,

295
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,618
and completely
preventable...

296
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,618
Okay, this is not our place to
judge, Dr. Altman, just repair.

297
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,181
I'm not talking about him.

298
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,098
You don't know
the whole story.

299
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:51,735
He opened fire on the
people he loved, who loved him.

300
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,126
That's betrayal.
And no amount of

301
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,223
rationalization
makes it okay.

302
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,634
Suction!

303
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,849
No, that's an...

304
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,470
No, that's an
entry-level position.

305
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:04,282
I have both field experience
and NGO lead work.

306
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,157
Excuse me. I need this one.
I'm not sure what you call it.

307
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,466
Okay, that's
a screwdriver, buddy.

308
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:09,885
Well, you're gonna
have to do better.

309
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,665
I can't find this
in the tools.

310
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:13,010
Yeah? Well, uh-huh.

311
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:14,174
Well, that can't be
all the local hospitals.

312
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,875
And I'm not gonna take
less than what I'm worth.

313
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,085
Why am I paying you a commission
if you're not getting me

314
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,481
what it is that
I'm expecting you to get?

315
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:21,785
- But...
- Yes.

316
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,636
- Ah, lucky shot. Lucky.
- Boom!

317
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,391
I just hooked
a tetanus-riddled ring

318
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,591
around the last bottle
standing.

319
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:30,222
- That's not luck.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

320
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,370
Uh, I get this,

321
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,410
and I control the music
for the rest of the trip.

322
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,061
Uh, that's a lot
of Kenny Loggins.

323
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,403
Miss, miss, miss, miss!

324
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,458
- Ugh!
- Oh!

325
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:40,292
Okay, um,
if I make this,

326
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,266
you have to wear ugly sweaters
for all of Christmas.

327
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:44,449
Okay.

328
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:46,011
- Ugh!
- Phew.

329
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,941
Uh, okay.
I get this and...

330
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,824
you stay in Seattle.

331
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:52,433
Yeah.

332
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:56,816
Yes! Mm!

333
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,035
Okay, looks like we
have to turn around now.

334
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,440
Unbelievable.

335
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,800
- Megan, I'm kidding.
- You're not kidding.

336
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,456
This is the whole reason
you came.

337
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:06,668
You're blowing this
out of proportion.

338
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,125
You think you know
what's best for me,

339
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:10,495
ever since we were kids,
whether it's what I want or not.

340
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,308
- Lifeguarding?
- You're not a good swimmer.

341
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,402
Serving. Excuse me for

342
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,637
not wanting
my sister to get shot at.

343
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,558
- My strat!
- Your strat?!

344
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,753
You still playing dumb
about it?

345
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:19,948
That was 10 years ago,
Megan!

346
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:22,850
And I got kidnapped before
we could fight about it!

347
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:32,698
2-0 silk tie.

348
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,847
So it's settled.

349
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,074
Tonight you'll call Beth
and tell her that you're done.

350
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,734
One less wedding
for Mom to worry about.

351
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,620
It's not that simple, Megan.

352
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,358
Okay, maybe
it's that simple.

353
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,964
You know I'm right.

354
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:46,089
We'll see. Scissors.

355
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,472
You know, I was gonna miss
this... working together.

356
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,118
Your flight-surgeon training
was gonna tie you up for months.

357
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,206
And for what?

358
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,589
Tying tourniquets
with Special Forces

359
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,933
somewhere three times
as dangerous as here.

360
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,495
Ask me,
you dodged a bullet.

361
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,655
You recommended me,
didn't you?

362
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,456
He's lost more blood than we thought.
Let's get him stabilized.

363
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:17,144
You know
it wasn't my decision.

364
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:22,001
Carnival?
That sounds fun.

365
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,823
Or maybe not.

366
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,667
All right, well, we'll be here
with the lights on, babe.

367
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,683
Drive safe.

368
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,120
Hey, Farouk, Megan's
gonna be a little late,

369
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,825
but I got good news!

370
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,641
Found your screwdriver.

371
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:37,909
Farouk?

372
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:41,873
Hey, buddy?

373
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:45,022
Farouk!

374
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,879
Hey! Farouk!

375
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:55,832
Farouk!

376
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,738
Hey, hey! Have you guys seen a little
boy go by? About 10 years old?

377
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,510
We need to pack, shunt,
and get out of here.

378
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,442
No. I want to do a reversed
saphenous vein graft.

379
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,861
Not with these vitals.
The best we can do

380
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,982
is get the limb perfused
and get him stabilized.

381
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,074
The graft will take too long,
and it's too risky.

382
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:12,273
I know you don't think
that I'm qualified.

383
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,884
But this is the right call.
He wants to save the arm.

384
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,215
Not at the expense
of his life.

385
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,671
I am more experienced.
I outrank you.

386
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,413
So, we're gonna do things my...
Megan, what the hell?!

387
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,733
Betadine!

388
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,843
Well, you have to stop for food
at some point.

389
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,429
Not hungry.

390
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,171
Hey.

391
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,780
Yeah. It's fine.
Uh, what's up?

392
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,788
<i>Just checking what time
you'll be home for dinner.</i>

393
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,058
I'm sorry.
I-I decided to drive with Megan,

394
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:51,108
and I completely forgot to call.

395
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,569
I-I didn't want her
driving alone.

396
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,405
So...

397
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,069
We're having a blast.

398
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,968
Yeah.

399
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:02,913
Okay. Bye.

400
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:08,359
Are there any women in your life
you don't lie to?

401
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,894
♪ You've
got to know when to hold 'em ♪

402
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,538
♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪

403
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:20,179
♪ Know when to walk away
and know... ♪

404
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,318
Excuse me.

405
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,851
Farouk. Buddy.

406
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,694
You can't just
run off like that.

407
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,741
You had me terrified.

408
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,341
Is everything okay?

409
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:50,952
You were very busy.
I thought I could help.

410
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,375
I thought I could
get us some food,

411
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,246
but there's
just so many choices!

412
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:08,881
Yeah.

413
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:12,461
Okay. Bleeding's
controlled over here. Clip.

414
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,429
Yep, same here.
Irrigation.

415
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,687
- Say he regrets it.
- Pardon?

416
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,015
He made a huge mistake. He hurt
the people he cares about most.

417
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,426
But say he regrets it.

418
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,095
He was scared,
stupid, and wrong,

419
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,991
and now he can feel
everything slipping away

420
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:31,797
and he'll do anything he can
to make it right again.

421
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,468
I'd say too bad
he didn't think about that

422
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,218
before pulling the trigger.

423
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,171
He's still hypotensive. We need to
cut our losses and get out of here!

424
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:44,550
Start the pressors. Would you stop
being so dramatic and help me sew?

425
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,567
Well, stop being so pig-headed
and listen to me sometimes!

426
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,185
Shut up! Please. Sir.

427
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,013
I'm almost there.

428
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,307
Clamps off.

429
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,185
He gets to keep his arm
and his life.

430
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,270
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

431
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,583
That was... impressive.

432
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,591
I wish it didn't come
as such a surprise.

433
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,474
You can finish the rest.

434
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:29,411
I put thousands of hours in
to become the best.

435
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,739
The best at central lines.
The best at one-handed ties.

436
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,106
The best military officer.
I had my entire career planned.

437
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:37,536
I was gonna attach to Special
Forces and become a general.

438
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,032
Your qualifications
were not up for debate.

439
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,141
So you had to convince them
that I was wrong for the job?

440
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,913
All I had to do was tell them
the truth. That you're a child.

441
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,507
That you make
rash, reckless decisions,

442
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:49,133
and you never learn better because
I'm always there to bail you out!

443
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,454
If you'd gone
with Special Forces,

444
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:51,618
you wouldn't have made general.
You'd have been

445
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,279
dead in under a month!

446
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:55,554
And 10 years later,
what have you learned? Nothing.

447
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:56,788
You're running
from your family.

448
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,375
You're running from
your support system.

449
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:59,661
And why?
Because you like the beach?!

450
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,163
That's not a plan, Megan.
That's a whim.

451
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,132
So, yes,
I tanked your strat.

452
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:07,445
If I had to do it over,
I would do the same damn thing!

453
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,492
So... So, you're just gonna
punish me like you always do

454
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,594
when I tell you
something you don't like.

455
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,468
Fine.

456
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,089
But you can't think of
anything to say

457
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,742
because you know
that I'm right.

458
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,051
And, for the record,
this is the childish behavior

459
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,867
I was talking about.

460
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,719
- Diamond.
- Excuse me?

461
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,703
Your nickname.
In Baghdad. Remember?

462
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,344
Major Diamond.

463
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,729
Yes.

464
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,824
Know why they
called you that?

465
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:51,739
Well, they told me...
Sharp, clear, focused.

466
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:54,324
Anal-retentive.
High-strung.

467
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,465
So uptight that if you
put coal in your ass,

468
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,559
a diamond would pop out.

469
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,645
You thought
it was a compliment.

470
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:04,997
Which only
made it funnier.

471
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,512
Like I said. A child.

472
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:11,098
And, for the record,
I came up with it.

473
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,926
Sorry I never told you,

474
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,333
but, you know,
since we're coming clean.

475
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:24,056
- More choices!
- Yeah, but it's not always a bad thing.

476
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,145
I mean, just try
a little of each

477
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,360
and see which ones
you like.

478
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:38,653
You dig?
Yeah.

479
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,689
Can you keep a secret?

480
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:48,775
I'm a little terrified
about starting over down here.

481
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:51,543
In a new town.
New family.

482
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:54,418
I don't even have a job, and I want
everything to be perfect for Megan,

483
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:56,403
but it took me half a day
to put a door on.

484
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:01,380
So... what will you do?

485
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:02,934
Well...

486
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,903
I guess I'm gonna
have to be okay

487
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:08,036
with not knowing
all the answers.

488
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:09,888
You know,
count on the fact

489
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:12,629
that we love Megan
and she loves us

490
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:15,473
and just trust that together,
the three of us,

491
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:18,156
we can figure
this thing out.

492
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:25,857
Can you teach me
baseball?

493
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:28,004
Yeah, sure.
I can teach you baseball.

494
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,481
As soon as I learn
how to play.

495
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,759
That's all
we can do for now.

496
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,044
He'll make transport.

497
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:40,842
And if he's lucky,
they'll fly him to Baghdad.

498
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,341
Yeah. If he's lucky.

499
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,466
How could you
do this to her?

500
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:50,872
I don't know.
We were fighting...

501
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,606
You were fighting,
so you proposed to her

502
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,708
with your side piece's
stolen property?

503
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:56,872
No. Look.
Felicia's not...

504
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,888
It was a one-time thing.

505
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:01,598
What am I gonna do,
Teddy?

506
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,825
Did you mean it?
The proposal?

507
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,567
Of course.
Look. Megan...

508
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,472
Okay, we fight.
But she's the one.

509
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,106
Okay? I was gonna tell her
about Felicia.

510
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:13,849
I was gonna come clean.
And then she found the necklace.

511
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,673
And I... I panicked.

512
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:17,201
- Well, she's gonna find out.
- I know.

513
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,654
And if it comes from
anyone but you...

514
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,821
I know.

515
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:21,245
Well, so...

516
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:22,888
you have your answer.

517
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:25,971
Well, you think
there's a chance?

518
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,323
Well, she's got a temper,

519
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,596
and she has every right
to be angry.

520
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,721
And when Owen finds out, he is
gonna snap your neck.

521
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,502
- Yeah.
- But...

522
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,463
people mess up.

523
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:41,643
And people forgive.

524
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,666
It's what most pop songs and
most modern literature is about,

525
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,448
so, yes, Nathan...

526
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,979
tell her the truth,
and there's a chance.

527
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,284
It was wrong of me to get in
the way of your career.

528
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,690
It was none of my business.
I was out of line.

529
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,263
It was just... just wrong.
And I'm sorry.

530
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:20,182
Thank you.

531
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,718
But it doesn't change the fact that
Seattle schools are excellent.

532
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:26,798
Oh, my God!
Give it a rest!

533
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:29,764
Nathan already has a job there,
plus it's safer, familiar.

534
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:30,920
Closer to family.

535
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,795
Whoa. What are you doing?

536
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,208
Get out!
Get out of my car, Owen!

537
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,734
Stop being ridiculous.

538
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,707
- No! Get out!
- Stop it!

539
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:41,691
What do you mean,
Megan's not coming?

540
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,772
Well, she thinks you tanked
her strat. She's mad.

541
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,473
Well, I hope you told her
she was crazy.

542
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:48,465
- Is she?
- Oh, great. Not you, too?

543
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:50,375
I'm just asking.
I'm not accusing.

544
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,652
You know what?
She got engaged.

545
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,926
You'd think she'd want to
live a safe, happy life.

546
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:56,097
Plan a wedding, maybe.
Is that such a crazy thought?

547
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,878
God! She wanted
that strat, Owen.

548
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:01,121
It's all she thinks about.
And she was so close.

549
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:02,714
Do you know how hard it is
to stand by

550
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:04,855
and watch someone else
live the life that you want?

551
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,723
The life that you're willing
to give up everything for?

552
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:09,249
You're an idiot!

553
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,527
Major,
we need to head out!

554
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:15,245
Well, make sure Megan
rides back with you guys.

555
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,406
I can only tolerate
so many tantrums.

556
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:36,493
Get out!

557
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,645
Get out! I mean it!

558
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,075
- Stop this.
- No.

559
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,716
If you can't support me,
then you can hitchhike.

560
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,193
- Because I am done. Get out!
- Stop it!

561
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,669
I'm not leaving you again!

562
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,145
You have to stop
doing this.

563
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,778
You... You can't keep making
decisions for me, Owen.

564
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:55,138
'Cause you are making
a bad decision.

565
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,682
You are the only one
who thinks that.

566
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,318
Nathan's the reason
we lost you in the first place.

567
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,863
You don't know what
you're talking about!

568
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,513
He cheated on you and now you're
starting a family with him?

569
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,372
And you cheated
on your first wife.

570
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,426
Mom told me all about it.

571
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:07,926
And don't even get me started
on you and Teddy.

572
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,340
So spare me
the "holier than thou" crap.

573
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,527
You cheated, Nathan cheated.
It happens.

574
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:15,731
Life happens.
People are imperfect.

575
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,842
We fail and we fall, and some of
us get kidnapped for a decade,

576
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,880
and when we get a second chance
at life and happiness,

577
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:24,223
we seize it,
regardless of who cheated!

578
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:25,934
Because now we know
what matters.

579
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,028
Because now we know
what's precious.

580
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,253
Because now we know that

581
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,036
any tiny little moment
of happiness

582
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:32,762
that we can grab onto
in this lifetime

583
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,807
is a moment worth having,

584
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:36,872
regardless of what
anyone else thinks.

585
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:39,340
And just for the record,
you judgmental jackass,

586
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,020
I cheated on Nathan first!

587
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:10,932
Hey.

588
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,369
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry. I, um...

589
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:26,562
I need
that necklace back.

590
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:31,703
Damn it. Damn it!

591
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:33,560
- Just hear me out.
- Okay, what did he say?

592
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:35,531
No. You know what?
It doesn't matter.

593
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,086
It was a drunken mistake.

594
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:38,969
You and I were fighting,
and I was gonna tell you...

595
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:41,109
Whoa, whoa. Hang on a second.
What are you saying?

596
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:43,085
W-What do you think
I'm saying?

597
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:44,438
Well, it sounds like
you slept with someone.

598
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,071
Isn't that why you want
the necklace back?

599
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:47,554
No! It...

600
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:51,351
Then what?

601
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,430
W-Wasn't mine to give.

602
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:05,984
You proposed to me with
some other chick's necklace?!

603
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:09,749
God, Nathan!
What is wrong with you?!

604
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,492
Okay, you're not the only one that
gets to be mad right now, okay?

605
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,171
You cheated, too.
You just said.

606
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:15,523
I know what I said.

607
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:18,718
I have been showing
that thing off all day.

608
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:21,039
This is so humiliating.

609
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,484
Did you even mean it?

610
00:29:22,582 --> 00:29:24,890
Of course. Did you?

611
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,156
Lieutenant Hunt, we're having
a problem with your patient.

612
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,610
On my way.

613
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,583
The chest tube started coming out
when we were transferring her.

614
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,825
All I have to do
is reposition it,

615
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,419
but if we give her any more
morphine for the pain,

616
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,480
we're gonna
have to intubate.

617
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,199
Got it. I got it.
Sana, you can get through this.

618
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:51,406
Okay? Listen to me.
I need you to breathe.

619
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,867
It hurts. I can't.

620
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:55,296
Focus on
something else, okay?

621
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,743
I want you to tell me about your
neighborhood, your family, job, kids.

622
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,499
- Do you have any kids?
- Aah!

623
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:01,330
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
about my family.

624
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:03,273
The tall, red-headed guy
yelling at everybody?

625
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,749
That's my brother. He drives me
crazy most of the time.

626
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,671
No, all of the time.

627
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:11,695
That sounds like my brother.
Yeah?

628
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:14,476
He is my heart.
He means well.

629
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,031
Yeah.

630
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,398
Yeah. Mine too.

631
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,732
Let's get her
on the next chopper!

632
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,504
I'm on it!

633
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,012
- Major Hunt.
- Hi. It's me.

634
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,123
I need to ride back
on the medical chopper.

635
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:37,426
My patient's
freaking out.

636
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,819
Well, you know
that's against protocol.

637
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,129
And...

638
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,606
Nathan cheated on me.

639
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,153
He what?

640
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:46,278
So I really don't want
to have to ride back with him,

641
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,551
but if I-it's
against protocol...

642
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,450
Screw protocol.
Get on the chopper.

643
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,450
- Are you sure?
- It's my call, and I'm sure.

644
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:52,708
That son of a bitch.

645
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,962
Okay.
Thanks, Owen.

646
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,472
How you feeling?

647
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,284
Like a truck hit me.

648
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,544
But happy to be alive,
ma'am.

649
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:09,106
I wonder if they'll electrocute
him here or fly him back home.

650
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:10,973
Why are they
talking that way?

651
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:13,629
He was the second shooter.
They're pretty upset.

652
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:16,075
No, he wasn't. Second shooter
was an Iraqi woman.

653
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,762
This guy was trying
to stop her.

654
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:33,161
It's all good.
You're gonna be okay.

655
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:42,448
Megan! Megan!

656
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:44,871
Megan! Stop!

657
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,677
Stop! Megan!!

658
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:49,443
Stop it!

659
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:52,386
♪♪

660
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,562
♪♪

661
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,810
Eagle 2, return... base.

662
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,509
Repeat!

663
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,293
Eagle 2,
return to base immediately!

664
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,338
Riggs never said anything.
All this time.

665
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:25,963
Yeah. Well...

666
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,111
he's a good guy.

667
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,278
Yeah.

668
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,010
You remember
that family trip we took,

669
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,611
somewhere in California,

670
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,168
when I left the map
at the rest-stop bathroom?

671
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:41,111
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How could I forget?

672
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,424
Dad was furious.

673
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:45,096
And he refused to pull over
and ask for directions.

674
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:46,166
Yep.

675
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,964
And after him and Mom arguing
for hours and us complaining,

676
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,538
he finally said,
"Screw it!"

677
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,785
And he just,
like, pulled over.

678
00:32:54,897 --> 00:32:58,378
And we played in the water for
hours until the sun went down.

679
00:32:58,436 --> 00:32:59,833
I don't even remember
where we were going,

680
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,464
but... I just...

681
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:04,808
I've never forgotten
that beach.

682
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:11,445
On my hardest days,
I would lose myself in that memory.

683
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:15,930
Pretend that the desert sand
was the beach,

684
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:20,828
that the screams and yelling were
laughter and sea gulls.

685
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,953
And I could fake everything
but the water.

686
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:27,632
And I promised myself,
if I ever get out...

687
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:33,964
I am going to live
by the ocean, in California,

688
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:37,320
and I'm gonna feel
that water every day.

689
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:46,875
I always imagined us raising our
families together, you know?

690
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:52,211
Next door, or a few blocks,
near Mom and Dad.

691
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,863
Camping trips
and cookouts.

692
00:33:57,788 --> 00:33:59,680
Dad's gone, Owen.

693
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:03,156
And you don't have
any kids.

694
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:06,445
How exactly would
that dream work out?

695
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:12,336
You are the most loyal person
I have ever known.

696
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,889
But you're loyal
to ideas, too.

697
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,351
Ideas and ideals.

698
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,859
My beach plan
makes me happy.

699
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,383
Like, "I can feel it
in my fingers" happy.

700
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:27,828
I want that for you.
I want to see you happy.

701
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,311
And that might mean that
you're gonna have to break up

702
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,859
