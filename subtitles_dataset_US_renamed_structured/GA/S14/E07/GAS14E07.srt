00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,888
<i>Surgeons are scientists
trained to believe</i>

2
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:18,752
<i>only in that which we can see and touch.</i>

3
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,730
<i>But that training doesn't always take.</i>

4
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,624
How was it? Was he happy for you?

5
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:54,061
No. He was jealous.

6
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,735
It's the Harper Averys.
We're all jealous.

7
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:15,749
Oh, good.

8
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,889
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

9
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:23,891
I left some things here,

10
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,793
and I thought that you were
at the hospital.

11
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,494
It's no problem, Dr. Shepherd.

12
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,163
I'll just go put some panties on, si?

13
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:31,832
Probably a good idea, yeah. Yeah.

14
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:32,866
Si.

15
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,307
Yeah, I should probably
give these keys back, huh?

16
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,418
Mm.

17
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,445
Phew!

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,825
Wow. That French toast smells good.

19
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:48,982
You know, it's really good.

20
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,220
Yeah.

21
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,465
- Right?
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it to go.

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,560
I'll get the plate later.

23
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,492
- You can finish that first.
- Okay.

24
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:00,994
It's good. It's good.

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,268
See? See? You're mad.

26
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,837
I am not mad.

27
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,939
Then why are you taking the train...

28
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:13,273
I support public transit.

29
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:14,518
...when you can just ride with me?!

30
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,976
Because I can't count on you

31
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,945
- giving me a ride home, that's why.
- Ohh!

32
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,013
Look, I need to depend
on something in this world.

33
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,949
Miranda, just get in the car.

34
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,517
No, you do your thing.

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,621
I'm gonna take care of myself.

36
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,990
Wh... Wh... Wh...

37
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,720
As long as you're not mad.

38
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,201
I don't even know what day it is.

39
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,937
I don't know the last time
I changed my underwear.

40
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,249
Use the panty liners in the women's room.

41
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:19,306
They help.

42
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,410
The other day, I almost peed
in a supply closet.

43
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,078
Like, just for fun?

44
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:26,446
I couldn't find the bathroom.

45
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:28,315
Been here two weeks,

46
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,250
and I still don't know my way around.

47
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,688
Oh, God, I want to die.

48
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,830
You're welcome!

49
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,871
It's a private jet.

50
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,440
But private jets are bumpier
than regular planes.

51
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,286
All right, so pretend like
it's a roller coaster.

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,543
Or take a pill if you have to,

53
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,788
but you're going to that ceremony.

54
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,112
You're very bossy.

55
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,447
It seems like five seconds ago,

56
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,149
we were the interns
hiding in the tunnels.

57
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,151
Now you're about to win a Harper Avery.

58
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:05,586
What if I don't win a Harper Avery?

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,097
Then you're no better than the interns.

60
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,221
- Don't say that.
- Hey!

61
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,057
W... Slow down!

62
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,726
Sorry! Big trauma incoming!

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,094
Ooh. Trauma in the pit.

64
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,329
No, you have a plane to catch.

65
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,396
Aren't you curious?

66
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,632
Mer! Stop! Come on!
You're going to the awards!

67
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,617
How long do you think
you can pretend I'm invisible?

68
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,751
Well, it worked for you for years.

69
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,742
Blocked me on social media.

70
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:29,987
Yeah, because you moved
across the country,

71
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:30,844
and you didn't say goodbye.

72
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:31,612
Because you broke into my apartment.

73
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,479
Because you kidnapped my dog.

74
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:34,348
Because you wouldn't return my calls.

75
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,506
Look, Sam, we wreck each
other every time.

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,863
- I know.
- So what are you doing here?

77
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,788
You think I followed you here?

78
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,590
God. You give yourself a lot of credit.

79
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,427
Dean Parson, 40s male.

80
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:50,030
Status post blunt trauma
to the chest and abdomen,

81
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,699
shielded some kids when
a roller-coaster car came loose.

82
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,202
GCS of 10,
follows commands but nonverbal.

83
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:56,406
Pulse 120s, stable pressure.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,681
Roller coaster? How are the kids?

85
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,139
Not a scratch. This guy's a hero.

86
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,375
Threw himself
between the kids and the car.

87
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,120
Okay, let's get him inside.
You two, come with me.

88
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:04,211
Hang in there, Dean.

89
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:07,214
Go, go, go.

90
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,215
What happened?

91
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,283
Rusty roller-coaster car
broke off the ride,

92
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:11,885
flew into a crowd at a county fair.

93
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,287
There's multiple injuries en route.

94
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:17,691
"Pretend the plane is like
a roller coaster," you said!

95
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:18,959
That's what you said to me!

96
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:24,331
Gregory Williams and Cleo Kim, both 26,

97
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,066
stuck in a crushed roller-coaster car.

98
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,534
Tried to extricate in the field,

99
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:30,337
but we suspect Greg has some
unstable crush injuries,

100
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,216
so we opted to do it in a more
controlled environment.

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,007
I told you
I didn't want to ride that ride.

102
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,575
I told you it was a rusty death trap.

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,678
Yes, Cleo. You were right, okay?

104
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,545
You're always right.

105
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,313
Now you're just stating the obvious.

106
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,748
I think I'm hallucinating.

107
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,183
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

108
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,184
Seeing what?

109
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,086
George and Cristina.

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,487
What?

111
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:49,222
Are you seeing this?

112
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:51,224
How are you? Are you okay?

113
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,159
Get me out of this!

114
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,837
Get me out of this thing
so I can kill her!

115
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,195
I did not make you ride, Cleo.

116
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,596
"Ride for me. I'm too pregnant.

117
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,231
Let me live vicariously through you."

118
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,167
Seriously?
You're gonna blame me for this?

119
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,668
Seriously?

00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,221
Oh, why are you gowning?

122
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,722
A major trauma just came in.

123
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,201
No, no, no. We have plenty of surgeons

124
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:29,402
that don't need
to be in Boston, Meredith.

125
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:30,860
What... O'Malley and Yang.

126
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:31,861
What's that?

127
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,029
Baby O'Malley and Baby Yang.

128
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,865
And there's a baby Izzie Stevens,

129
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:36,966
who's having a baby.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,068
I mean, I definitely cannot
go anywhere right now.

131
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,593
What's the deal? She's afraid to fly?

132
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,271
Yeah, and afraid to lose.

133
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:44,707
I called your parents. They're flying in.

134
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,152
They wouldn't take, "We don't
know yet," for an answer,

135
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,183
so I made up some medicine.

136
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,397
What did you go with?

137
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,323
Minor blunt-force trauma
with no L.O.C. on the scene.

138
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:51,981
That's good. Sounds cool. Means nothing.

139
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,015
Are you guys doctors?

140
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,416
We're interns at Seattle Pres.

141
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,751
We are no longer interns

142
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,286
and haven't been for two weeks, Greg.

143
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,787
We are second years. Try to keep up.

144
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:01,257
I see another one of me, I'm leaving.

145
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:06,629
See, she seems stable.
Can't we get her out first?

146
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:07,751
No, not without jarring him.

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,899
I think we can open up his side
of the car

148
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,901
and just be ready
for crush syndrome symptoms.

149
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,135
All right, assess the damage

150
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,515
- and get me a timeline for extrication.
- All right, Doctor.

151
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,440
All right,
let's, uh, set up a crash cart,

152
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:19,975
get another I.V. going,

153
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,510
get him hooked up to our monitors.

154
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,946
Let's be prepared
when he comes out of this thing.

155
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,915
Okay.

156
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,783
Uh, wh-what are you seeing
so far, Kepner?

157
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,919
Uh, cuts and bruises,
couple broken bones,

158
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,121
some burns from the oil that went flying

159
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,000
when the roller-coaster car
hit the funnel-cake booth,

160
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,334
which perfectly describes
a recurring nightmare

161
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,558
I used to have as a child.

162
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,762
Uh, all right, let's re-route
everything minor to the clinic.

163
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,096
- Supervise the interns.
- Okay.

164
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:43,365
Make yourself available for quest...

165
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,934
- Ah...
- What?

166
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:47,136
Actually, Kepner, you stay here.

167
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,648
- We might need you on this.
- Okay, who's gonna...

168
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:49,571
Is that a roller-coaster car?

169
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,974
Yeah, it is,
but we need you in the clinic.

170
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,609
Uh, there were multiple injuries

171
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:55,277
when the car flew off the track.

172
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,679
Interns can't handle all that.

173
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,681
There is a major trauma in here,

174
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,026
and you want me to go
stitch up a clown's face?

175
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,618
Uh, clowns bring joy to children.

176
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,486
Scarred clowns lead
to traumatized children.

177
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,422
Go.

178
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,659
Dr. Bailey, how's that contest coming?

179
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,328
Hmm?

180
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,562
You know, I gave you over
$100 million about a week ago.

181
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,565
I don't know if you maybe got a name,

182
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,734
some judges, anything?

183
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,502
- Did you know?
- Know what?

184
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:22,471
When you handed me $100 million

185
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:25,174
and asked me to organize a contest

186
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,642
so that you could play, too?

187
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:28,477
- I know.
- Did you know that my husband

188
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,579
had secretly started training

189
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:33,248
to intentionally put his body
inside of burning buildings?

190
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,220
Right. So, uh, we'll talk this
over later, then.

191
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:39,748
Thanks.

192
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,699
You see that?

193
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,334
Free fluid in his left upper quadrant.

194
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,335
Splenic laceration?

195
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,436
Seems likely. Shepherd?

196
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,340
Pupils are equal and reactive.
He follows commands.

197
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,075
Okay, call the OR.
Tell them we're coming.

198
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,222
I want a head CT.

199
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,212
You just said
there are no focal deficits.

200
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,346
Probably just in shock.

201
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,849
We need to deal with his
life-threatening problem first.

202
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,418
Dr. Shepherd, I need a consult
on a head injury in the clinic.

203
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,620
Dean, I know that you're scared.

204
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:13,933
I know you want to talk, and you
can't, but we've got you.

205
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,891
He saved kids. He's a hero.

206
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,960
Get me that head CT.
Run ahead and book it.

207
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,496
Prep him to move! Let's go!

208
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,967
No. I'm fine.

209
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,069
Greg and Cleo are hurt.

210
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:29,238
No, Mom, the roller coaster
did not hit me.

211
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:32,354
Hey, um, would you let an intern
set a dislocated patella?

212
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,447
It's Izzie.

213
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,910
What?

214
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,622
You always ask about Izzie,
what she was like.

215
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:37,990
Well, that... that girl right there.

216
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:39,325
That... That's what Izzie was like.

217
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,616
Seriously?

218
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,117
Please don't say that word.

219
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,919
Oh, um, she's pretty.

220
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:44,920
Yeah.

221
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:45,988
And perky.

222
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,156
Yep.

223
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,157
Are you okay?

224
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,907
Yeah, it's just... weird.

225
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:51,586
Hey. Hi.

226
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,139
You were taking care
of my friends, right?

227
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:54,797
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,899
N-No, I mean, we just...

229
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,569
Your friends are okay.

230
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,171
They are? Like, okay okay?

231
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:04,139
No, I mean, they're...

232
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:05,908
they'll... they're like they were.

233
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,509
The same.

234
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,744
Oh, okay.

235
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:11,346
Well... I'm...

236
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:13,179
Ooh.

237
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,085
I just... I don't, um...

238
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,986
- Wait, do you need to sit down?
- Yes, please.

239
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:20,022
Oh, my gosh. Uh, we need a gurney!

240
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,257
Page Robbins!

241
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,525
Sorry I'm late.

242
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,461
I have Mer's dress and my dress

243
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,995
and Zola's dress and Zola.

244
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,330
Where's my mom?

245
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,199
That is an excellent question.

246
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,410
- Hey.
- Hi.

247
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:35,704
Well, the party is all here,
except the guest of honor.

248
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,473
Yes, there's a trauma in the pit.

249
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,007
And?

250
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,543
And Meredith felt
the need to get involved.

251
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,212
Wow. You totally called it.

252
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,881
My mom doesn't like to fly.

253
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,952
Right. I will go get her.

254
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:55,057
Crush syndrome can cause

255
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,358
arrhythmias and renal failure,

256
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:59,194
so we need calcium, bicarb,
and albuterol.

257
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,330
Look at them.
The way they're looking at you.

258
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:02,675
That's the "You're gonna die" face.

259
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:03,642
Shut up, Cleo.

260
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,733
That really isn't helpful.

261
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,502
We know that face. We use that face.

262
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,613
It's perfectly composed,
gives nothing away.

263
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:09,705
You should call your mom,

264
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:11,016
let her hear your voice one last time.

265
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,142
- I hate you.
- Hate won't get you into heaven.

266
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,576
You don't believe in heaven.

267
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,246
I'm not the one they're
looking at like that.

268
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,548
I-I can't... I can't breathe.

269
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:20,527
We need to get him out of there.

270
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,660
He's turning blue! Somebody do something!

271
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:24,253
His muscles are reperfusing.
Get ready to intubate and code.

272
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,220
Open up the airway kit.

273
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,156
No, no, wait, wait. It's not reperfusion.

274
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,524
It's his neck. He needs traction.

275
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:29,925
I got it. Got it.

276
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,269
Yeah, it's his neck.

277
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,398
Oh, God.

278
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,899
They really are all staring at me.

279
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,668
Am I gonna die?

280
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:53,504
It's not... unlikely.

281
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:54,738
They're staring at you, too!

282
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:55,773
Yeah, but I'm not the one

283
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,675
who has a lady doctor
attached to my cranium.

284
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:58,819
You're not gonna die
unless you keep talking

285
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,877
and moving unnecessarily.

286
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:00,878
Now, hold still.

287
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,713
Why are they all staring at us like that?

288
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:05,215
Because you look
exactly like our friends...

289
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,217
people we were interns with.

290
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,886
You look exactly like them.

291
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,088
- Both of us?
- Both of you.

292
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,489
Well, this is creepy,
and now I'm uncomfortable.

293
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,101
Even more uncomfortable,
if that's possible.

294
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,468
What's he like?

295
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:18,729
The... The guy that...
that I remind you of?

296
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,664
His name was George. He was a hero.

297
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,732
Was?!

298
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,001
Stop, Greg. What are you doing?

299
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,875
I don't want to be a trigger
for your memories.

300
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:29,039
I want to be me and him to
be him, so let's do that.

301
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:31,241
Stop looking at us!

302
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,027
We are not your friends!

303
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,279
It is uncanny, though.

304
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:36,739
Right?

305
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,087
I'm almost 30 weeks. It's a boy.

306
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,888
His name's Jasper, and he's perfect.

307
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,690
He was perfect at his 20-week ultrasound.

308
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,393
So I think I just passed out,
like, maybe from stress.

309
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:51,462
- You see that?
- Yeah.

310
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,397
What? Oh, my God, what is it?

311
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,899
So, Liza, you have a
chorioangioma, which is a...

312
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,302
A tumor. On my placenta?

313
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,570
Exactly. Are you a doctor?

314
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,604
A resident.

315
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,439
I've gone to every prenatal appointment.

316
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,808
I've had every ultrasound.
I've taken every vitamin.

317
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:05,809
They grow really quickly.

318
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:08,146
And at this size,
they can be very dangerous.

319
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:09,780
I think that you passed out

320
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,125
because you're having mirror syndrome.

321
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,150
So I'm mirroring the symptoms of my baby.

322
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,651
Yes.

323
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,263
So, he's... he's what? He's in distress?

324
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,289
He has hydrops.
His, uh, heart is struggling.

325
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,595
- Oh, my God.
- I think that we can remove the tumor

326
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,004
without delivering the baby,
but we need to do it right away.

327
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,829
And the good news is
if I do have to deliver,

328
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:26,930
you're at 29 1/2 weeks,

329
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,799
so the survival rate's really high.

330
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,167
Do you want us to call anyone?

331
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,803
No. I'm having this baby alone.

332
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,938
And my mom would just freak out.

333
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,917
And my birthing partner's
trapped in a roller coaster

334
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,275
that I made him ride.

335
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:39,777
So...

336
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:41,712
Will you stay?

337
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,916
Will you stay with me?

338
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:49,395
Little weird, but I'm gonna roll with it.

339
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:53,857
Hmm.

340
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,167
Grey, come on.

341
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,835
I'm a little busy here, Avery.

342
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:05,980
She can't move,
or my friend's spinal cord

343
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,047
will get severed by the fracture.

344
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,039
- Cleo! Shut up!
- Thank you!

345
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:11,675
I'm not your friend, remember?
You can't talk to me like that.

346
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,478
Except I can because I'm holding
his head in my hands,

347
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:16,947
and, by extension, the air in his lungs.

348
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,016
It's hard. I'm hot. It hurts.

349
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,618
So please shut up so I can
be still and concentrate.

350
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,864
Hold on a second. I'm gonna come
up there and help, all right?

351
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,889
I'm just gonna relieve
some of this pressure.

352
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:27,791
Okay, lean back into me.

353
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,520
Rest your arms. Okay? There we go.

354
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,564
Are we gonna miss the awards?

355
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,599
- Yeah, it's looking that way.
- What awards?

356
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,801
Wait, are you going to Harper Averys?

357
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,169
Wait. Oh, my God.

358
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,371
Grey? Is she Meredith Grey?

359
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:43,307
Yeah, and that's Jackson Avery.

360
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,508
Oh, my God, Greg!

361
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,754
You have surgical royalty
tractioning your head right now.

362
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,148
- Really?
- Bottom third of his class.

363
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:49,479
Whatever. Ignore him.

364
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,848
You're gods to me.

365
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,900
Dr. Warren, I have a patient

366
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,273
with intermediate partial thickness burns

367
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:07,908
from the funnel-cake oil
that flew when...

368
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,276
I don't need all the details, Dr. Bello.

369
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,268
Right. Um, we're out of xeroform.

370
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:12,952
Well, it's in the supply closet.

371
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:13,971
It's not. I checked.

372
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,382
Then you have to go to central supply.

373
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,673
Which is where?

374
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,942
He's trying not to scar my face!

375
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,539
Could you kindly support him in that?!

376
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,448
DeLuca.

377
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:25,883
Show Bello where central supply is?

378
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:35,425
How'd you get the idea for
the abdominal wall transplant?

379
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,028
From a hole in my bedroom wall.

380
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,098
You should not say that
in your speech if you win.

381
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,400
People, if we're not wheels up
in 20 minutes,

382
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:45,769
we will miss the show,
and we <i>are</i> the show.

383
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,371
We're almost there, Catherine.

384
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,972
Oh, my God, is that Catherine Avery?!

385
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,107
Oh, please.

386
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,141
Dr. Webber, we're good.

387
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,109
Okay.

388
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:53,686
Okay?

389
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:56,079
Okay, people, listen up.

390
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:58,982
We've got the traction tongs
and the pins ready to go.

391
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:01,218
We have access to remove this patient.

392
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,288
We are gonna lift him slowly
onto the gurney

393
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:07,090
while Dr. Grey continues
to secure his neck.

394
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,492
Once he is down,

395
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:11,161
I am going to start
to add on the weights.

396
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:12,462
Do we understand?

397
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:13,730
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

398
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,458
Now, on my count.

399
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:21,138
One, two, three.

400
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:22,973
Easy. Easy.

401
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,241
Okay. Easy.

402
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,153
I'm out of the roller coaster.
I'm out of the roller coaster!

403
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:28,979
Shh, shh, shh.

404
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,515
Tightening the screws now.

405
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,977
Adding the weights now.

406
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:37,955
Meredith, you can release your hands.

407
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,591
All right. He's breathing.

408
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,326
Thank God.

409
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,327
Okay, let's roll him for the CT.

410
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:44,761
Let's go, people!

411
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,197
Okay, I need a second.
I can't feel my arms.

412
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,700
I need a minute. Cleo, how are you doing?

413
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,145
All right. Removing the lap bar now.

414
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:52,803
Oh, my God, a puncture wound.

415
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,272
I need some gauze and
a non-rebreather now, please!

416
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,107
I didn't even know that was there.

417
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
My BP's plummeting. I'm losing volume.

418
00:16:58,843 --> 00:16:59,843
Dr. Grey.

419
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,378
Call the OR! Let's hang some O-neg

420
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:02,968
while we check for type and cross.

421
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,058
Tell them she got penetrating
trauma to the right flank.

422
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:04,948
Okay, go. I have this.

423
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,393
No, no, no. You're the one nominated.

424
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,962
- You should go.
- I'm not gonna go anywhere.

425
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,229
If I win, just make a nice speech.

426
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,513
Where is that blood?!

427
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:17,898
Dr. Shepherd?

428
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:18,766
How's our guy?

429
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,735
Um, his wife is here with their kids,

430
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,603
and I-I don't know what to tell her.

431
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:23,904
Uh, well, was the CT clear?

432
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,236
Uh...

433
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:26,902
Um...

434
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:28,949
"Um," what?

435
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,431
- You skipped his CT?
- He was bleeding out.

436
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,787
If you were gonna skip a CT,
you should have paged me.

437
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,856
I made a call, Amelia,
and it was the right call.

438
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,934
His liver was actively bleeding.

439
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,102
I threw his spleen in the trash,
and he's still...

440
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,004
- Dr. Hunt?
- What?

441
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,174
She left.

442
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:52,767
It's a trauma.

443
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,769
I can page Owen if I need some help.

444
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:57,038
I'm saying you can still go win
your Harper Avery.

445
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,105
Pretend I'm your friend.

446
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,240
What?

447
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:00,741
I have too much promise to die.

448
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:02,943
I've got you. You're not Meredith Grey.

449
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:06,113
I want to grow up to be you,
so pretend I'm your friend,

450
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,281
the one I remind you of,

451
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,250
because you know her and you love her,

452
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,119
and I'm just the girl who's been
annoying you all day.

453
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:15,089
Please, Dr. Grey.
Save me like I'm your friend.

454
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:21,462
All right, let's go. She's not coming.

455
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,464
What do you mean she's not coming?

456
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,009
Well, she wants to stay here
and save lives.

457
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,033
Of course she does.

458
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,337
Zola, sweetie,

459
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,006
you tell your brilliant mama

460
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,476
that she's a big pain
in Dr. Catherine's behind.

461
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,589
How about you? Are you coming or staying?

462
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:41,282
Zola and I have work to do here.

463
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:43,117
Say hi to Boston for me.

464
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,585
Are you ready

465
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,821
for your first coronary bypass,
Dr. Grey-Shepherd?

466
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,955
Yes, I am.

467
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,428
We've almost got this, Liza.

468
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,264
You're doing great.

469
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,033
This is kind of a miracle.

470
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,414
What is?

471
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:03,003
That I was here when I passed out.

472
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:04,182
If this had happened anywhere else,

473
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,974
I might have just thought
I was overheated or overtired

474
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,476
and ignored it.

475
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,388
Then I might have died
or the baby might have died,

476
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,813
so it's like my own little miracle.

477
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,183
It's your own little miracle
that a roller-coaster car

478
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,186
flew off its rails and crashed
into a group of people

479
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,732
and crushed your friends inside of it?

480
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:23,557
When you put it like that,
I sound like an ass.

481
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:25,760
Yeah. A little bit.

482
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,031
See that? Small subcapsular hematoma.

483
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,696
We can keep an eye on that.

484
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:34,735
Dr. Hunt?

485
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,037
Nurse Linda? Amelia, what the hell?

486
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:38,139
Put this on.

487
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:39,484
You'll need it to protect you
from the radiation.

488
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,708
What radiation?

489
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,086
Skipping a head CT is not your call.

490
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,210
It is mine.

491
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:45,913
So you've left me no choice
but to bring the CT in here.

492
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:47,548
- Is this about this morning?
- What?

493
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:48,826
You seemed fine.
You ate the French toast.

494
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,950
Stop talking.

495
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,754
Amelia, there is no indication
that there's a head injury.

496
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,765
Zero.

497
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,056
I heard she had a brain tumor.

498
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,825
You think they didn't get it all?

499
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,223
I heard that.

500
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:04,365
Uh, CT shows
beading of a mesenteric vessel,

501
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,734
which means something's bleeding.

502
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,959
We'll find out exactly what
when we get in there.

503
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:10,070
And my neck?

504
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,273
You have a C5 fracture dislocation.

505
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,542
Now, as soon as we take care
of that abdominal bleeding,

506
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,343
Dr. Shepherd will do a spinal fusion.

507
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:17,344
And my friends?

508
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,576
They're both in surgery.

509
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,383
It was my idea to go to that carnival.

510
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,785
"Let's do something stupid," I said.

511
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,088
"We can't just work
every day of our lives," I said.

512
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,925
I pushed them, and now Cleo could die.

513
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:35,095
And Liza could die,
and, God, Liza's baby.

514
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,864
And I could die, too,

515
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:38,242
which no one probably cares about, but...

516
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:40,306
No one's dying today, Greg.

517
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,058
We'll take you up in a minute.

518
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,223
- I know.
- Sir.

519
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,391
I know how you felt about O'Malley.

520
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,260
Oh, these are not O'Malley tears.

521
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:09,296
I cried all of my O'Malley tears
over the real O'Malley.

522
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,300
I cried every day
for the better part of a year

523
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,269
silently in the shower.

524
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:21,909
No, these are
tears of rage... marital rage.

525
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:27,448
Okay, um, do you want to talk about it?

526
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:30,668
What is that?!

527
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:34,855
Uh, I think we both know what that is.

528
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,779
In the skills lab?

529
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,627
Th-This door doesn't even lock.

530
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:43,163
Hi.

531
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:46,087
I, uh, was just, um...

532
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,869
uh, g-g-getting a, um...

533
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,669
so I could... so I could
practice... things.

534
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,201
Okay, back to the pit.

535
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,403
Yeah, you need a plastic skull
in the pit?!

536
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,872
Do you, Dr. Bello?!

537
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,683
Don't you have a job to do, DeLuca?!

538
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,379
Uh, uh...

539
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:06,413
What the...?

540
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:11,185
I really hope there's not
a third one in there.

541
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,726
Almost done.

542
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:21,695
You see how easy that is?

543
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:24,097
He would have bled out
if we had waited for the CT.

544
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:27,100
And you're reading too much
into this man because...

545
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,248
It's okay. You can say it.

546
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,072
Dr. Hunt thinks
my decision-making is clouded

547
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,408
because my brother died
under similar circumstances.

548
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,143
But he's wrong.

549
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,312
- Am I?
- You are.

550
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:40,914
He has an expanding epidural hematoma.

551
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:42,483
Wait. What?

552
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,055
Wow.

553
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,500
Okay, let's get this thing out of here!

554
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,158
Prep for a craniotomy!

555
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,191
Monitors are on.

556
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,228
Pit's clear.

557
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,453
You need an extra hand in here?
I could scrub in.

558
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:05,422
Uh, if you want to be helpful,
you can go find Shepherd

559
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:07,024
and tell her we need her in here

560
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,560
to make sure this patient's
not permanently paralyzed.

561
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,729
I'm a general surgeon,
not a neurosurgeon.

562
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:13,764
And sometimes it's a good idea

563
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,433
to just do the job you're trained for.

564
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,278
- I know.
- Right.

565
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:36,378
You came into my flat

566
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,065
and didn't get up off the sofa
for three weeks.

567
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,057
I know.

568
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:44,261
You still love her?

569
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:49,733
How did she find you?

570
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:53,504
She got matched here.
It's a... coincidence.

571
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:57,608
Oh, Andrea, you're still
such an innocent bambino.

572
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:01,812
See there?

573
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:03,414
It's a simple procedure,

574
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:07,284
but not doing it would have killed him.

575
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,758
All this fuss for something
as little as one, two, three.

576
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,777
Okay.

577
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:15,426
"I told you so" is unbecoming on you.

578
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,971
Also, he'd be dead
if I'd done it your way.

579
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,039
Fair enough.

580
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:19,663
He's alive. That's what matters.

581
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:22,110
Go tell his wife and kids. Thank you.

582
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,896
Shepherd, uh, you're needed in OR Three.

583
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,990
Mm.

584
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:30,656
Amelia, I'm sorry if I implied that...

585
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,454
No. It's okay. You were right.

586
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,027
I mean, not about this morning.

587
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:36,917
French toast was excellent this morning.

588
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,378
But about Derek.

589
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,235
He <i>was</i> in my head.

590
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,092
He saved this guy.

591
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,594
He was that good.

592
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,113
You know, one could argue

593
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:57,483
I'm kind of saving him, too,
but I'm gonna let it go.

594
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:59,852
Yeah. I'm letting it go.

595
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:01,921
Suction.

596
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,155
I said suction, not retract.

597
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,956
I-I'm sorry. Here?

598
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,725
Where the blood is coming from.

599
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,792
R-Right. Got it.

600
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,195
Do we ligate or primary repair?
What do you think?

601
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:10,863
I think you should have gone to Boston.

602
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:11,731
What?

603
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:13,332
We're gonna ligate 'cause it's safer,

604
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,711
and it's a thing I could have done myself

605
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:15,768
while you went to Boston.

606
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:16,769
Kepner.

607
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:18,371
God, you're like Jackson.

608
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:19,482
He grew up with so much money

609
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:21,707
he never had to balance a budget
or check a price tag,

610
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:23,119
and he just takes it all for granted.

611
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,877
And you're like that with your talent.

612
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:27,380
You're... You're missing
the Harper Avery Awards

613
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:28,948
'cause you take for granted

614
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:30,542
that there's just gonna be another one.

615
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,752
You take your talent for granted,

616
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,854
and, you know,
some of us work really hard,

617
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:36,722
and we're just average.

618
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,772
You think I'm taking it for granted?

619
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:43,229
I'm not taking anything for granted.

620
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:44,296
I want that award so bad

621
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:46,732
I could pick you up
and throw you out a window,

622
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,801
especially right now because
my best friend's image

623
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:50,403
is splayed out in front of me.

624
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,104
Cristina Yang is the only one

625
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:55,207
who gets just how badly
I want that award.

626
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:00,880
And, Kepner, you're not average.

627
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:09,699
- Baby's having prolonged bradycardia.
- All right. Damn it.

628
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:11,123
Liza, we tried, but baby says

629
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:12,825
he wants to come out today, okay,

630
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:13,870
so I'm gonna convert to a C-section,

631
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:15,995
and I need Dr. Karev
to get his NICU team ready.

632
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,096
It's gonna be okay.

633
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,330
Oh, I'm scared. I'm scared.

634
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:19,131
Wilson, hold her hand.

635
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,166
I'm way past that.

636
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,101
I need someone to talk to me.
Please talk to me.

637
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:23,513
Okay, uh, what do you want to talk about?

638
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,171
Anything. Have you done this before?

639
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:27,006
- Are you a mom?
- Oh, God, no.

640
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,340
I mean, um...

641
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,642
Liza, I am. I'm a mom.

642
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:31,110
I have a... I have a daughter.

643
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,679
She's 7 years old,
and she's on a plane right now

644
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:34,914
coming back to live with me.

645
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:35,781
So she lives with her dad sometimes?

646
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:37,683
Uh, she's with her other mom sometimes.

647
00:26:37,717 --> 00:26:38,951
Her dad, um...

648
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:39,996
What... What about her dad?

649
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
He died.

650
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,023
And I miss him all the time,

651
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,268
which is actually kind of unexpected

652
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:49,628
because I didn't
really like him in the beginning.

653
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:54,967
I resented him because
he was perpetually relaxed.

654
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:56,168
But he could make me laugh.

655
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:57,870
He could make me laugh when I was afraid

656
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:00,005
or freaked out or annoyed,

657
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,141
which actually is really,
really annoying.

658
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,714
If he was here right now,
he would say, "Relax, Robbins.

659
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,778
Your kid's coming here.

660
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,189
It's gonna be the greatest thing ever,

661
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,386
and you're freaking out
about paint colors.

662
00:27:14,421 --> 00:27:16,622
You're gonna... You're gonna
take her to ice cream

663
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,468
and you're gonna let her pick
three different flavors,

664
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:20,580
and it'll be the best thing ever."

665
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:24,126
And he would be right.

666
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:25,998
Okay.

667
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:29,201
- Jasper is out, Liza.
- Aah.

668
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:42,408
Okay, good.

669
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:46,085
Now show me the inferior vena cava...

670
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,087
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and the aorta.

671
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:51,924
Wow. You are a natural.

672
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,425
You must get it from your mom.

673
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,094
My daddy, too.

674
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:57,062
I'm gonna be a brain surgeon like him.

675
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,163
You are?

676
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:03,235
I miss him.

677
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,542
Do you miss your mom?

678
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:11,631
Every day.

679
00:28:12,712 --> 00:28:14,880
Want to know what my mom would say?

680
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:16,682
She would say,

681
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:18,784
"Even though your mom's not here,

682
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,019
she's always with you."

683
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:37,770
O'Malley's got a long road ahead.

684
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:40,105
- This isn't O'Malley, sir.
- I know.

685
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,809
And call me sentimental,
but it's nice to think of him.

686
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,811
Most of the interns

687
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:48,043
just blur together over the years,

688
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,863
but O'Malley... I can't forget.

689
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,633
And it'll be good to be able to save him,

690
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,157
to save this O'Malley.

691
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,132
Is he okay?

692
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,400
How you doing over there?

693
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:10,069
He's doing well on 50% O2.

694
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,525
So he's okay?

695
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:13,973
Yeah, he's gonna need some oxygen

696
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,975
and spend some time up in the NICU,

697
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,110
but you can hold him
for a minute if you want

698
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:20,179
before I take him up.

699
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,827
You ready?

700
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:23,787
Here he comes.

701
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:54,651
Thanks.

702
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:03,364
You think he's gonna make it?

703
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,699
I do.

704
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,247
I think <i>he</i> is going to make it.

705
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:11,172
Oh, no. So, you're threatening me now?

706
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,907
Is... Is that how you're gonna do this?

707
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:13,975
You turned away

708
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,643
from a career in anesthesiology

709
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,422
because you were bored
and you wanted to be a surgeon.

710
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:18,546
Now you're bored again.

711
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:21,082
Starting to sound like
a man with commitment issues.

712
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:25,253
Can't you just... Look.

713
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,889
Can't you just think of it like
I'm taking a fellowship year,

714
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,835
learning something new,
something that makes me happy?

715
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,493
You were my front runner
for Chief Resident!

716
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,828
Can't that make you happy?

717
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,530
I want a job where all this adrenaline

718
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,242
that's coursing through me
is a good thing.

719
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,534
I-I'm not saying I don't love surgery,

720
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:41,903
and I'm not saying that I won't
come back to it someday.

721
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:43,148
I'm saying that while I'm young enough,

722
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:46,841
I want to try this because I
don't want to live with a ghost,

723
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,776
- and neither do you.
- A ghost?

724
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:49,878
Yeah, the ghost of who I might have been

725
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:51,446
if I'd been brave enough to try.

726
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,081
Miranda?

727
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:55,383
Jackson called. Do you have a minute?

728
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,796
I do.

729
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:15,603
Alex, if you want to know how she is,

730
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:17,359
you should just call her.

731
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:18,973
You should call Izzie.

732
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:19,941
No.

733
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:21,488
No, it's okay.

734
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,115
No.

735
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,980
I mean, I-I-I don't need to call her.

736
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,619
I know how she is.

737
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,163
I mean, she's, uh...

738
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:33,121
she's married with three kids,

739
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:38,993
and she lives somewhere,
I think, uh, kind of woodsy?

740
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,964
And she's a surgeon
and she goes to work every day,

741
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:47,472
so she refuses to hire help,
so her house is always a mess.

742
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:51,806
And it has Christmas decorations
all over it

743
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,313
because she won't let
her husband take them down.

744
00:31:57,479 --> 00:32:02,817
It smells like muffins,
and she's... she's smiling.

745
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:07,409
When I picture her, she's always smiling.

746
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:11,538
I don't need to call her because
I want it to stay that way.

747
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:17,899
I picture her as happy as I am with you.

748
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,868
You imagined a whole life for her?

749
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:23,371
Oh, yeah. It's way better than wondering.

750
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:24,439
Mm-hmm.

751
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,103
All right, well, how is she?

752
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:44,792
She's good. She lost a lot of blood,

753
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:47,462
but we had to ligate
her transected IVC...

754
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:49,230
They were superheroes. Both of them.

755
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:50,665
I've never seen anything like it.

756
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,400
- Nobody asked you to talk.
- Right.

757
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:55,003
We're done here.
You can take her to recovery.

758
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,040
Hey, how's Baby George?

759
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:01,009
He's in recovery.

760
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,043
And Baby Izzie?

761
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:03,678
Oh, Baby Izzie has a baby.

762
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:04,712
Oh, that's so good!

763
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:08,583
Um, the Harper Averys
are about now, Dr. Grey.

764
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:09,826
I know. I know.

765
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,515
Well, we thought you might like
to be there.

766
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:19,894
What is going on?

767
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,875
<i>Please welcome Dr. Catherine Avery.</i>

768
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:37,011
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

769
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:39,013
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

770
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:42,216
<i>It is my distinct privilege
and honor to award</i>

771
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:46,521
<i>this year's Harper Avery
for Surgical Innovation.</i>

772
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:49,957
This award is named for my dear friend,

773
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,093
who we lost this year

774
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:55,096
which makes this award
ever more meaningful.

775
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,800
Harper Avery was a very complicated man.

776
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:04,138
But his love
for medical innovation was pure,

777
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:07,308
<i>and that describes this year's winner.</i>

778
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,377
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

779
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,946
<i>the Harper Avery for Surgical Innovation</i>

780
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,081
<i>goes to...</i>

781
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:15,116
Dr. Meredith Grey!

782
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,409
Here to accept on her behalf...

783
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,606
Dr. Jackson Avery.

784
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:45,146
Thank you.

785
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,182
Incredible.

786
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:50,351
Knowing very well
that she might win tonight,

787
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:52,787
Dr. Grey opted to stay in Seattle.

788
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:53,988
A trauma came in,

789
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,357
and she knew that she was
the right doctor for the job.

790
00:34:56,391 --> 00:35:00,761
That's one of the many reasons
that I'm so very, very proud

791
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:03,264
<i>to call her my colleague and my friend.</i>

792
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:07,101
Now, Dr. Grey has experienced
more loss in her life

793
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,304
than I think most of us would deem fair.

794
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,640
She lost her little sister, Lexie Grey,

795
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:16,010
who I know would love
to be here tonight with us.

796
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:19,147
<i>She lost her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd,</i>

797
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:22,116
<i>who knew with total certainty
that this night would happen.</i>

798
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:25,453
<i>And she also lost her mother,
Dr. Ellis Grey,</i>

799
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:28,656
who won this award twice...
once as a resident...

800
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,801
<i>and probably would have won a few more</i>

801
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,193
<i>if she hadn't been taken
from all of us so young.</i>

802
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:34,662
The most amazing thing
about Meredith, though,

803
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:37,331
is that she takes all that pain,
all that loss,

804
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:39,634
and she turns it into drive...

805
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:43,171
<i>drive to save lives,
to make things better,</i>

806
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,839
<i>and despite all that she's lost,</i>

807
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:47,875
<i>she continued to find joy in her work</i>

808
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,011
<i>as a surgeon, as a teacher, as a mother.</i>

809
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:52,747
And she managed to share that joy

810
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:56,817
through her spirit of discovery
and of possibility and of hope

811
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:59,086
<i>right in the face of darkness.</i>

812
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:01,601
I am profoundly grateful...

813
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:05,092
for the lessons that I have
learned from Meredith Grey,

814
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:06,928
and it is my distinct honor

815
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,173
<i>to accept this award on her behalf.</i>

816
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:10,064
<i>Congrats, Meredith!</i>

817
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:55,109
Listen, I know that you said green,

818
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,955
but I couldn't... I couldn't
pick out which green.

819
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:58,879
So I think that you should pick it out,

820
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:02,817
and then we can paint it together, okay?

821
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,221
Okay?

822
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,290
I miss Mama.

823
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:12,159
Oh, I know.

824
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:13,923
I do, too.

825
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,233
But I am so, so happy that you are home.

826
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:20,968
- And you know what I got?
- What?

827
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:24,238
Three different flavors of ice cream.

828
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:26,407
Come on.

829
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:30,648
Okay. Stand there.

830
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:36,017
All right. One, two...

831
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:37,362
The third one... It's all for me.

832
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:38,319
This one's all for me.

833
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:39,420
That one's not for you.

834
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,290
We're good.

835
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:56,337
Oh, my God, you're everywhere.

836
00:37:56,371 --> 00:38:01,709
Fine, Andrew.
I'll... I'll go somewhere else.

837
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:04,599
No, no, no, stop. Just, Sam...

838
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,125
You swear you didn't follow me here?

839
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:08,686
Andrew.

840
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,319
We're bad for each other.

841
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:13,316
We both know that.

842
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:33,174
- Really?
- No.

843
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,375
You don't see the similarity?

844
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:36,310
No.

845
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:37,745
You're just being stubborn.

846
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:40,648
Maybe I should text Burke
and send him her picture.

847
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:44,051
Meredith, there's no one like Cristina.

848
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,486
No one.

849
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,854
Fair enough.

850
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,189
<i>Scientist or not,</i>

851
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:49,890
<i>most of us who've been at this a while</i>

852
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,526
<i>are forced to acknowledge
the mysteries of life.</i>

853
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,037
You're driving?

854
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:04,505
I'm driving myself.

855
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:08,175
You can take the fire truck.

856
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:17,451
This day was epic.

857
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:20,521
I'm so tired I can't feel my teeth.

858
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:23,257
I almost stitched my finger to a person.

859
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,292
Scram.

860
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,194
Yeah. You heard her. Scram.

861
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:28,462
This is our beach.

862
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:29,930
<i>We are forced to acknowledge</i>

863
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:32,233
<i>that certain kinds of magic exist.</i>

864
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,734
Someone's calling.

865
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,663
- Ooh! Look who's calling!
- Uh-oh.

866
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:40,207
Hey, you're just in time
for the champagne.

867
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,308
Ready? Wait for it.

868
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,643
Whoo!

869
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:45,980
Yes! Yes!

870
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:47,248
What did she say?

871
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:48,983
Yes. She asked me if I feel different.

872
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:50,284
Damn straight, she does!

873
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:52,319
<i>And that history and memory</i>

874
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,588
<i>and the ghosts of our past</i>

875
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,825
<i>are sometimes just as tangible</i>

876
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:00,628
<i>as anything we can hold in our hands.</i>
