1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:07,873
Zola!

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,778
In your first year
as an attending surgeon...

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,415
...you're told to take baby steps.

4
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,456
Look for the easy cases, the sure wins.

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,725
Hey. Come on.

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,794
Is it hard to learn to play guitar?

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,095
Apparently, yes.

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,640
No sense of making an ass of yourself.

9
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,265
I can't understand what he's singing.

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,967
And let's be thankful for that.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,702
Better to rack up some easy victories.

12
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,270
Mom, your trophies.

13
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,348
Are you bringing them for show and tell?

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,150
No. Show and tell is when
you're proud of something.

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,860
This is more like...

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,150
if Mommy bought milk, and it was spoiled,

17
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,655
and I have to return it.

18
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,389
Andrew, I'm going to work.

19
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:58,657
At the hospital.

20
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,159
Remember, the big building with
a lot of sick people inside?

21
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,005
- Would you like to come?
- I already called in sick.

22
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,047
You know you're not sick.

23
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:05,797
My whole body just... it hurts, okay?

24
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,065
I'm sick.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,220
How come Maggie's friend never
has to take a bath and we do?

26
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,072
Because he's European.

27
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,308
Would you go get your brother
and sister, please?

28
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,346
You can't avoid bad outcomes
for your whole career,

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,348
but you can sure try.

30
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,544
Excuse me. Do you work here?

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,545
Yes, I do.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,680
Oh, great.

33
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,458
Can you respond to this
morning's harassment allegations

34
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,983
by the radiologist in Phoenix?

35
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,018
She claims Harper Avery
shoved her up against a...

36
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,497
How does it feel to be working
under the name

37
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,322
of an alleged sexual predator?

38
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,823
Are those Harper Avery Awards?

39
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,868
What are you doing with them?

40
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,059
I'm returning them.

41
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,293
Excuse me.

42
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,495
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,997
'Cause getting a bad reputation...

44
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,231
Excuse me.

45
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,033
...can finish you before you start.

46
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,236
Hey, I'm pulling the plug
on your contest.

47
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,271
I'm killing it.

48
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,716
What do you want me to do
with the $100 million?

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,977
No, no. If word gets out
that Harper Avery's grandson

51
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,713
secretly funded a competition
that he entered himself?

52
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,425
Well, that's just gonna mean
more nasty headlines

53
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,049
that we do not need right now.

54
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,277
Dr. Bai...

55
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,587
You funded the contest?

56
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,359
You knew, didn't you?

57
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,226
I beg your pardon?

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,504
Of course you knew. You had to know.

59
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,062
You made up the rules.

60
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,197
"Rules." What a crock.

61
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,233
Look, I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

62
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,234
I am not a cheater.

63
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,437
I have never cheated
on anything in my life.

64
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,406
Um, why are you telling me this?

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,075
I know Jackson
put up the money for the contest

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,443
and asked you to judge.

67
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,611
Wait. Wait.

68
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,547
Jackson put up the money for the contest?

69
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,982
Who asked you to judge?

70
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,686
Slimy!

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,589
That's what it was. It was slimy.

72
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,720
Come again, now?

73
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,526
You set me up to make it
look like I'm in cahoots

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,694
with my ex-husband?

75
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,429
That is... That is low.

76
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,064
What the hell are you talking about?

77
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,766
I'm talking about you duping me

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,567
into a phony director position

79
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,104
where I unwittingly decide
who wins the prize money

80
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,106
that my ex-husband put up

81
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,474
so that I look slimy.

82
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,377
Because you are! Slimy!

83
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,512
All due respect!

84
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,459
Mom, we need to talk about this contest.

85
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,555
Honey, come in. I want you to meet...

86
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,495
Erin Mason, crisis management.

87
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,607
You're just the man I was looking for.

88
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,832
And he sure is camera-friendly.
That doesn't hurt us.

89
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,845
You assured me you and I could
handle this together.

90
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,171
Dr. Avery, if I had an aggressive cancer,

91
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,806
would you recommend I operate on myself

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,174
or hire a professional?

93
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,242
Sweetheart, this is what Erin does.

94
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,231
Let's hear her out.

95
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,279
That lawsuit brought by the 13 women

96
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,514
who signed and then violated their NDAs?

97
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,816
It's tip of the iceberg.

98
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,517
This is a developing situation,

99
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,986
and it's getting worse by the minute.

100
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,522
So, this is how you get out
from under the bad name

101
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,157
of Harper Avery?

102
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,193
With a surgical innovation contest

103
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,261
secretly funded by his damn grandson?

104
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,330
- What?
- And that's out. Okay.

105
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,199
Wait. Jackson,
you're the anonymous donor?

106
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,366
What's this now?

107
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,446
You put up the money, and then
you entered the contest?

108
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,471
You entered your own contest?

109
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh, God. Is this some kind
of tax-evasion scheme?

110
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,719
What? No. It's just me
trying to do some good.

111
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,709
Anonymously. That's it.

112
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,010
Well, that didn't work.

113
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,612
Public perception is everything,

114
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:43,281
and they're going to destroy you
if this gets out.

115
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,883
Then, let's not let it get out.

116
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,720
Agreed. And to that end,
I have some good news.

117
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,523
You are welcome.

118
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,943
What's this?

119
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,527
It is a distraction for the press.

120
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,896
I've been in touch with
the various medical charities,

121
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,501
and Angels of Humanity has a very
high-profile surgery for you.

122
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,503
You want me to operate on
a child as a PR stunt?

123
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,405
- Are you kidding?
- No. I want you to heal a child.

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,474
This patient is arriving this morning,

125
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,320
and we would like you to work
with Meredith Grey.

126
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,489
Of course you would. Maybe because
she just won a Harper Avery?

127
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,715
No, because she's giving
hers back... and her mother's.

128
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,884
We're in a Category Five storm, here.

129
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,219
We need good press, yesterday.

130
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,088
Then, we are going to
go after these women.

131
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,362
We are going to attack their...

132
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,323
No, no, no, no, no.

133
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,902
You will not go after any
of these wom... no.

134
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,561
Listen, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,

135
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,898
someone is going down for this.

136
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,434
I have spent most of my adult
life building up the Avery name,

137
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,870
and now it's gonna take me down.

138
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,274
I guess I could just go back
to being Catherine Fox.

139
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,441
Oh, that's great, Mom.

140
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,944
Thanks, from your Avery son
and granddaughter.

141
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,079
Look, if it's a scapegoat they want,

142
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,525
I'm the one that signed the settlements.

143
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,448
Catherine.

144
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,584
- I could live with that.
- Absolutely not.

145
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,596
There's no way a powerful black
woman is gonna take the fall

146
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
for a rich old white guy

147
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,432
that couldn't keep
his damn hands to himself. No.

148
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:01,293
Jackson, I love your passion,
but this is not up to you.

149
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,061
I'm still in charge of this foundation.

150
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,629
It's not your decision.

151
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,531
Now go. Meet your patient.

152
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,702
Hey. You returned the awards?

153
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,803
Is that really necessary?

154
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,205
Yes, it was.

155
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,983
You didn't want to give us
a heads up, Meredith?

156
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,075
Did you really think
you were gonna get away

157
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,443
with rigging the contest?

158
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,879
No. How does the news travel so fast?

159
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,447
I didn't rig any contest.

160
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,449
It's pretty ballsy.

161
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,384
Were you gonna act like
you weren't gonna win,

162
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,753
and then, at the minute,
just pull ahead and be like,

163
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,455
"Hey, look, I won"?

164
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,489
Right. Are you joking,

165
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,968
or do you really think
that's something I would do?

166
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,459
I mean, I don't know what to think.

167
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,727
Do you care to explain?

168
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,862
I don't, no.

169
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,931
I do need your help on a
craniofacial dysplasia excision.

170
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,466
- What do you say?
- A PR stunt?

171
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,567
No, thanks.

172
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,236
Whoa.

173
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,270
Is that...

174
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,613
I think that is our patient.

175
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,087
Are you sure you don't want to help?

176
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,119
What. Is there something on my face?

00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:14,743
Okay, Grassy Lane Farm? Too pricey?

No. I mean, if you like it, let's do it.

180
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,806
Okay, the Old Piano Factory.

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,375
There's this 3-tiered pricing thingy.

182
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,344
Old Piano Factory is gorgeous,

183
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,579
but you would...
you'd need a time machine.

184
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,815
'Cause you'd have to go back
like six months

185
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,560
to even think about booking it
for this year.

186
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,995
But have you thought about Magnolia's?

187
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,386
Or Cloudland Inn?

188
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,365
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Green Shutters. Look that one up.

189
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,923
Karev, Wilson, what are you doing?

190
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,892
Well, my surgery got cancelled
'cause of Handsy Avery.

191
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,038
So, we are trying to plan
a wedding, but we suck at it.

192
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,930
Yes! That's good. Plan your wedding.

193
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,275
Set the date. Put it on the calendar.

194
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,733
This place needs morale.

195
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,837
This place needs some things
to feel good about

196
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,105
and look forward to.

197
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,999
Yeah, yeah, lock that down.

198
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,388
Great, now it's a work thing.

199
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:57,590
I'll do it.

200
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:58,835
I mean, I just lost my contest.

201
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:01,760
I know I left my own wedding
at a pretty inopportune time,

202
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,796
but prior to that,
I planned the hell out of it.

203
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,754
If you need help, I can do it.

204
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,012
I just need a date and a budget.

205
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,069
Okay, we're doing that.

206
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,605
- Really?
- Yeah. We hate party planning.

207
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,050
And if I promise not to
leave you at the altar,

208
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:15,044
can we just let her do it?

209
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,252
I feel like I just won the lottery.

210
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,476
Okay.

211
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:18,711
So, budget.

212
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,713
Okay, this...

213
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,381
This is what I can kick in.

214
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,916
Now you check your account.

215
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,758
What's wrong? Are you broke?

216
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,128
Do I have to tell Beyoncé
that we can't afford her?

217
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:37,196
Seriously, what's wrong?

218
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,432
Did it just turn into,
like, a BYOB kind of thing?

219
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,634
Can't do this right now.

220
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,689
Are you sure you don't want to
take him somewhere else?

221
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,414
I mean, it's only his 6-month checkup.

222
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,850
No. Karev said he'd do it.
It's a perk, so I'm taking it.

223
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,186
Plus, the birth mom's coming here.

224
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Right.

225
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,765
And I still think it's weird
that she has the right

226
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,857
to just show up at
his doctor's appointments.

227
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,869
Owen, you're fostering. You
might not get to adopt him.

228
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:09,295
I know.

229
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,830
I keep trying to think of it as,
like, a practice baby.

230
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,666
But he is such a cute practice baby.

231
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,134
Okay.

232
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,102
Now, protect him like
a football. Let's go.

233
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,437
Okay.

234
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,278
No comment! No comment!

235
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,013
Ooh! Hey!

236
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,515
Oh, hey.

237
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:30,583
You're so late.

238
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,484
Did you get stopped by those reporters?

239
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,021
No. I was dealing with a very
sad Sofia. Sobbing again.

240
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,228
Refusing to go to school.

241
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,070
I mean, I just... I had to
bribe her with snuggle time.

242
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,562
And I promised her I would
stay home with her tomorrow.

243
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,232
Poor thing, she just hates school.
And I don't...

244
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,033
I don't know what to do.

245
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,115
That's too bad.

246
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,705
Maybe you can bribe me with some
snuggle time after my consult.

247
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,093
His parents are loving people.

248
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:12,758
They took him for a surgery in Caracas,

249
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,760
but no one would touch it.

250
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,683
And it kept growing.

251
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,398
He's a great kid.

252
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:20,833
Do you think you can help him?

253
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,268
We certainly hope so.

254
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:26,939
- Will you excuse me?
- Yeah, of course.

255
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,007
Hello?

256
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,709
In these old scans,
it's extending into the orbit

257
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,188
and putting pressure on his optic nerve

258
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,579
Yeah. That's definitely a concern.

259
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,581
I'm also worried about his airway.

260
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:38,060
Helm, his head's tilted a bit. Can you
get in there and readjust, please?

261
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,222
Copy that.

262
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,211
Just need another angle...

263
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,760
Oh, good. This is my good side.

264
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:48,961
Totally.

265
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:52,931
I know what you're thinking...

266
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,733
good-looking and funny.

267
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,168
Some people just have all the luck.

268
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,515
Thank you.

269
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,943
It's growing deep into the retropharynx

270
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,490
Which is why I'm worried about him
losing his ability to speak...

271
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,982
asphyxiating in his sleep.
I mean, look at this.

272
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,584
It would be impossible
to excise that entire thing.

273
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:13,829
I'm gonna have to just contour it down

274
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,888
to get the best
cosmetic outcome possible,

275
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,790
preserving his breathing and his sight.

276
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,758
No. We have to do a total resection,

277
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,941
pull the whole thing out.

278
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:22,995
I mean, your way avoids a bad outcome,

279
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,563
but it doesn't solve our problem.

280
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,465
Yeah, well, neither does killing him.

281
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,694
Okay, sure, you're right,

282
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,145
he's gonna have to come back
for further resection.

283
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,402
He lives in Venezuela.

284
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,974
Which is why they sent him here.

285
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,840
We pull this off, he gets a
chance at having his life back.

286
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,675
Plus, you and I know
we really can't afford

287
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,598
a bad outcome right now.

288
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,612
Oh. Okay.

289
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:41,857
Well, at least our motives are clear.

290
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:42,848
Come on, Mer.

291
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:43,782
No, I get it...

292
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:47,206
safe option, solid odds,
and glowing press.

293
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,485
I'm sorry, Doctors, we have a problem.

294
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,921
I'm afraid we have to
cancel this surgery.

295
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,997
We're a religious charity.

296
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,867
Our donors are very concerned
by the disturbing accounts

297
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,435
of the Harper Avery abuse.

298
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,448
I don't get it... so, they just
take it out on the boy?

299
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:08,173
- I mean, seriously?
- Angels of Humanity, my ass.

300
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,008
- I beg your pardon?
- It's not our decision.

301
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,444
This came from the executive
director and our board.

302
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,023
They want us to take him
to another hospital.

303
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,481
Harper Avery is not even here!

304
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,882
He's not even alive.

305
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,217
And we completely understand

306
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,395
that you don't want to be associated

307
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,887
with the Avery name... neither do we...

308
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,456
but you won't find a better
surgeon than Jackson Avery

309
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,691
to help Diego.

310
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,060
He's stuck with the name, and so are you.

311
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,995
Our organization
won't pay for the surgery.

312
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:30,896
There's nothing we can do.

313
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,232
There is. Because we can do it pro bono.

314
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,447
And at least Diego
has a shot at survival.

315
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,866
We'll book an O.R.

316
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:41,740
Thank you.

317
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:44,643
I think Harper Avery's
caused enough casualties.

318
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:46,374
This is such a fun day!

319
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:50,826
- Excuse me. Can you tell me...
- No comment.

320
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,317
No comment? Aren't you a doctor?

321
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,752
No comment at all.

322
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:54,920
This is an E.R., right?

323
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,922
I need someone to look at my son. Milo!

324
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,524
- Hi.
- Hi, how can I help?

325
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,325
We think we might have
swallowed a chew toy.

326
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,427
Say hi, Milo.

327
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,197
Good diagnosis. Yeah.

328
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,099
I think it might be lodged
in the epiglotis.

329
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,434
Should we go to trauma one?

330
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:09,935
Which is where?

331
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,070
I'm so turned around.
It all looks different now.

332
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,372
I used to be a nurse here.

333
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,007
Another lifetime.

334
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,108
Olivia Jankovic.

335
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,253
Oh, okay. Well, welcome back.

336
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,610
Trauma one is right here.

337
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,049
Yeah, we're gonna see Dr. Karev.

338
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,117
That's right.

339
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,122
Hi.

340
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,352
We're here to see Dr. Karev.

341
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:28,687
Wellness baby check?

342
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,788
Hunt.

343
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:30,722
Fill out the first page.

344
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:33,129
Yeah, I work here.
I'm the head of trauma?

345
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,340
Well, that baby doesn't.

346
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:40,265
Fill out the form, and have
a seat until we call you.

347
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,366
Mm.

348
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:46,538
Did you like her?

349
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:48,407
I didn't.

350
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,375
Okay.

351
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:58,150
You mind covering your mouth,

352
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:01,653
or get a mask from the nurse?

353
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,789
Oh, they said...
they said I could be here.

354
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,080
I'm Betty.

355
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,095
I'm Leo's mom.

356
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,600
Do you know how long
it's been down there?

357
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,634
About an hour.

358
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,314
We were having dinner at my parents',

359
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:21,073
and my dad started
talking politics, so...

360
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:23,008
maybe he was looking for an easy way out.

361
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,243
Uh...

362
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,144
It's a joke, Skippy.

363
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,815
I see we're still getting
the interns straight from Mensa.

364
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,952
Okay, so, the whistle
isn't compromising his airway,

365
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:36,298
but I'd still like to get some
X-rays to pinpoint the location.

366
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,023
Okay. I swear to God,

367
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,825
this kid will stick
anything in his mouth.

368
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,593
Dude, careful.

369
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,028
Times have changed.

370
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,863
No whistlin' at the ladies.

371
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,347
So, this Harper Avery stuff...

372
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:49,868
Ugh, nightmare.

373
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,036
I can't say I'm surprised.

374
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,982
When I was here, you wouldn't
believe the pig doctors

375
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,840
we had to put up with.

376
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,420
So...

377
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,590
what are we looking at?

378
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,849
Alex Karev.

379
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:06,952
Perfect.

380
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,020
Olivia.

381
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,684
You two know each other?

382
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:11,857
Is he still giving nurses syphilis,

383
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:13,191
or has he moved on to gonorrhea?

384
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,736
Do you want to hold him?

385
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,937
No. I better not.

386
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:34,109
Why are we in a hospital?

387
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,911
- Is he really sick?
- No, no, no. No, no.

388
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:38,180
I work here, and these doctors
are my friends,

389
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,196
and I trust them.

390
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,349
Oh. That's cool.

391
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,416
That's...

392
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:44,453
Hey.

393
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,530
I thought you'd be done by now.

394
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah, Karev's tied up in the E.R.
and we're just sitting here...

395
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,157
Is this how we treat patients?

396
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,492
'Cause it is horrible.

397
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,461
Well, I guess the mom flaked.

398
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:53,935
You didn't have to worry about that.

399
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,033
Dr. Shepherd, this is Betty,
uh, Leo's mom.

400
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,269
Oh! Betty, goodness. Hi.

401
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:01,637
It's nice to meet you.

402
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,105
Hi.

403
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,206
Ahh.

404
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,446
So... peds surgery?

405
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:12,948
What happened to plastics?

406
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:14,650
Lucky for you, I dropped it.

407
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:16,718
Okay, bud, when you breathe or swallow,

408
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:17,913
does that feel uncomfortable?

409
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,956
So, you still in Seattle?

410
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,224
God, no. Got the hell out.

411
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:24,059
Sacramento. Met my husband.

412
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,395
He's intelligent, kind, faithful...

413
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,262
not your crowd at all.

414
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,500
Okay. Well, it looks like
it's lodged in his bronchus.

415
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:32,634
Go ahead with X-rays.

416
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,639
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

417
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,241
Get chest and abdominal films.

418
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,409
Keep an eye on his pulse-ox.

419
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:41,443
Alex, wait.

420
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:43,845
If you want to do
a cheaper place, that's fine.

421
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,647
We can give Kepner
whatever budget we want.

422
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:46,718
Jo, can we just drop it?

423
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,483
Alex, it's a stupid wedding budget.

424
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,919
How hard is it to give me a number?

425
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,155
So, is someone gonna come get us, or...?

426
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,424
Yeah. We're gonna bring him up right now.

427
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,392
Okay.

428
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,428
Are you and Karev engaged?

429
00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:01,163
Yeah.

430
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:02,838
Best of luck with that.

431
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:08,937
Thank you for doing this.

432
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,049
Oh, my gosh, it is a treat.

433
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:13,075
I rarely get to treat healthy
babies, and this is one.

434
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,509
Doesn't that bother him?

435
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,278
No, no, no.
He's just reacting to the light.

436
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:17,561
It's a good thing.

437
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,083
You can come in closer
if you want. He's your...

438
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:25,187
All right. Let's flex and rotate
to check for hip dysplasia.

439
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,856
Oh, yeah!

440
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,191
He's super strong and limber.

441
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:31,688
He's a future Olympian!

442
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:34,412
Look at those strong, powerful legs.

443
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:36,398
He gets those from me.

444
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,400
I was the fastest kid on my soccer team.

445
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,469
Coach called me "Lightning Bolt Betty."

446
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:44,373
Okay, this is my least favorite part,

447
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,275
but Leo needs this, and I
promise I'll be super fast.

448
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,292
You know, I get really squeamish
around needles, too.

449
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:55,224
You want to step outside with me?

450
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,386
Hi.

451
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,401
All right, let's make it really quick,

452
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:00,122
really quick, really quick, really quick.

453
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:01,156
A-a-and...

454
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,291
So stupid.

455
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:04,391
What is?

456
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:05,894
I got a dress.

457
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:09,231
Like, I went out and got
a new dress for this.

458
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:12,234
Like Leo would know if I'm
wearing a dress or not.

459
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:13,669
This guy's a friggin' doctor.

460
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,203
What can I do for him?

461
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,341
You hungry?

462
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,309
I skipped breakfast. I'm dying.

463
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,344
Come on. It's on me.

464
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,790
Syph Nurse.

465
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,158
Sorry?

466
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,627
That's what they called me...

467
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,196
"Syph Nurse."

468
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,272
It was all over the hospital.

469
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,134
A lot of laughs.

470
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,970
And I got it from Karev, but
nobody was calling him "Syph Doc."

471
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,706
I'm sorry. That's awful.

472
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,274
Oh, please. I'm over it.

473
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:56,945
I should shut up, but you
seem pretty great and, just...

474
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:58,290
You know he cheated on his first wife?

475
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:00,148
Um...

476
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,683
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

477
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:02,784
He cheated with me.

478
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,387
So, I kind of lost the moral
high ground on that one.

479
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:08,056
And to be fair, they weren't married yet,

480
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:11,026
so it's slightly less horrible
on his part.

481
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,729
Well, I appreciate that, I guess.

482
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:17,232
But that was a long time ago.
People change.

483
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,367
You're right. Absolutely.

484
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:21,477
Of course, it couldn't hurt
to get tested.

485
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,372
Okay. I reviewed his X-rays.

486
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,742
The whistle is lodged
in his right mainstem bronchus.

487
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:29,377
I'd like to get it out of there
before it causes a bronchospasm.

488
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,879
You good with that?

489
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:32,113
You're the doctor.

490
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:40,188
And after we dissect
the internal maxillary artery,

491
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,324
we'll continue to remove the tumor burden

492
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:45,360
and prevent compromise
to the orbital floor.

493
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,362
I still think we should take
the whole tumor out.

494
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,563
We're past that.

495
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:49,765
But why?

496
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,435
Diego is going to have to come
back here time and time again,

497
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,171
and risk bleeding out every single time.

498
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,240
We could just do a bone graft right now.

499
00:19:58,274 --> 00:19:59,508
- It's too risky.
- "Risky"?

500
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,176
Jackson, everything is risky.

501
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,611
Surgery is risky.

502
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:05,447
Not too long ago,
you did a throat transplant.

503
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:06,681
Where's that guy?

504
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:08,683
That's the guy Diego needs today.

505
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:09,762
Yeah, well, it's not that simple.

506
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:11,853
Yeah, it is that simple.
It should be that simple...

507
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,732
if you weren't so concerned
with getting bad press.

508
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:14,756
I'm not!

509
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,239
Fine. Maybe I am, all right?

510
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,464
That's only 'cause I'm concerned
about the foundation.

511
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:25,233
But why are you even thinking
about that right now?

512
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:28,303
I'm sure Katie Simmons
isn't thinking about that.

513
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,780
- Who?
- Katie Simmons.

514
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,250
She was all over the news this morning.

515
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,974
She was a 3rd-year neuro.

516
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,544
She was harassed, assaulted, paid off.

517
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,145
She dropped out of the program.

518
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,346
She's a waitress now.

519
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,749
Do you think she's thinking
about the foundation, Hellmouth?

520
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:41,817
Preach.

521
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,219
All right, I'm not trying
to diminish the trauma

522
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:45,921
experienced by these victims, all right?

523
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,322
If you take the foundation down,

524
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,591
that's 72 hospitals that go down with it.

525
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,894
Every single person in this
hospital... multiply that by 72.

526
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:57,265
We're talking about thousands
of jobs, thousands of families.

527
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,511
You know, of all people, I really
thought you would understand.

528
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,603
Understand what?

529
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,105
We're not exactly raised
by people who were easy.

530
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,250
No. You don't get to do that.

531
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:08,143
You don't get to compare your
grandfather and my mother.

532
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:10,345
My mother had to fight tooth and nail

533
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,447
for every inch of ground she gained.

534
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,715
Harper Avery had everything...

535
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:17,635
except decency.

536
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:20,014
We're ready. Let me know
when the O.R. is prepped.

537
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,968
Turn the scope to the right.

538
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:31,203
Nope, your other right.

539
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,204
Yes...

540
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:35,407
Just looking for the whistle.

541
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:36,575
And I see it.

542
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,577
Secure the object with your forceps.

543
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:40,746
Do me a favor... try not to
perforate the airway.

544
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,058
His mom hates me enough as it is.

545
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,749
Well, you did give her syphilis.

546
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:45,551
Olivia has a right to be pissed.

547
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:46,682
I was an idiot back then.

548
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:47,997
They used to call me "Evilspawn."

549
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,255
Evilspawn?

550
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,557
Okay, last time I complain
about "Glasses."

551
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:53,859
Shut up, Schmitt. All right.

552
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,830
Angle the tip down and rotate
your wrist 90 degrees clockwise.

553
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,666
If anything, I think I was
more troubled by the cheating

554
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,102
on your first wife.

555
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,603
We've known each other forever.

556
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:06,105
Do you really think I'm like that?

557
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,040
No. But I think you're being really weird

558
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:09,508
about setting a date.

559
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:11,610
Bingo! I got the whistle.

560
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,712
How cool is that?

561
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:15,581
Okay.

562
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,194
Bye.

563
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,020
Thanks for earlier. I know you're busy.

564
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:22,133
No, no, I'm not.

565
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,089
Actually, I was home
with Sofia all morning.

566
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:25,090
I had to push some things.

567
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,426
- Is Sofia okay?
- Yeah.

568
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,894
No. No.

569
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,296
She's sad, all the time.

570
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,797
Do you want to bring her over?

571
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:33,543
She might get a kick out of
playing with Leo.

572
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,600
Kids love babies.

573
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,213
Yes! Thank you!

574
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:38,604
That is a normal human reaction!

575
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:40,172
Thank you! Thank you!

576
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:49,548
You seriously can't beat this truck.

577
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,646
It's so much better than the food inside.

578
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,399
Yeah. It's pretty good.

579
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,856
So...

580
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:02,740
...how long have you been using?

581
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,831
I don't know where you got that idea.

582
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:10,636
I guess from the itching
and the bruising on your arms,

583
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,833
the constricted pupils.

584
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,507
I have allergies.

585
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,676
Ah. Yeah.

586
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,078
I had "allergies," too.

587
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:22,968
For a long time.

588
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,932
I was never into drugs.

589
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,824
I never smoked weed.

590
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,627
I didn't hang out with the stoners.

591
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,862
I thought they were losers.

592
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:38,664
Whoops.

593
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:39,698
You were a jock?

594
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:41,600
Soccer.

595
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:46,241
AYSO, high school, two club teams.

596
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,777
I tore my ACL in the playoffs,
and the operation sucked,

597
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,879
so they wrote me a prescription.

598
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,614
Painkillers.

599
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,253
10 days' worth, that's all.

600
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:00,589
That's all it takes.

601
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:03,155
That was two years ago.

602
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:10,262
And now I have a baby whose
father is some dealer and...

603
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:14,833
And I'm on the streets.

604
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,566
It's so stupid.

605
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,237
I guess the question is...

606
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:25,736
where do you want to be
two years from now?

607
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,548
So, that was awkward.

608
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:30,916
Not now.

609
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,519
Can I run something up the flagpole?

610
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:35,487
- No.
- I mean, I'm not gonna lie...

611
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:38,190
Flu-like symptoms, sore throat,
headaches, fatigue?

612
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:39,558
I've not not had them.

613
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:40,726
Stop talking.

614
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,698
Now, no sores, thank God,
no moist wart-like patches.

615
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:47,333
Ew. Seriously, stop talking.

616
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,734
It's just, you know how they say,

617
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:49,844
if you sleep with a partner,

618
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,904
you sleep with all
your partner's partners?

619
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:55,341
And, obviously, I love what we had.

620
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,577
It's just, I keep thinking
about Karev to you to...

621
00:24:58,611 --> 00:24:59,712
Schmitt!

622
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:00,913
It was a billion years ago.

623
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:02,247
You don't have syphilis.

624
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:03,882
Okay, great.

625
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,964
We're good. That's all I needed to hear.

626
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,194
I think I need a meeting.

627
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:16,729
I met someone.

628
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,731
And I don't know, I...

629
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:20,432
I think we made a real connection,

630
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,634
and I think I'm about to do
something completely crazy.

631
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:25,270
Well, I'm happy for you, Shepherd.

632
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:27,426
She's 15.

633
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:30,609
Okay, you need to talk to
a professional... now.

634
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,911
No. No, listen, this is a kid.

635
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:37,883
This is a young mom.
She's Owen's foster kid's mom.

636
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,819
And she's a junkie
partly because some surgeon

637
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:44,193
prescribed opioids she probably
could've done without.

638
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,821
I'm thinking about taking her in.

639
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:51,074
Do you think I can do that?

640
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:56,902
I wasn't sober when I met Ollie,
and I wasn't ready to get sober.

641
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,338
But she saw something in me,

642
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:02,544
practically dragged me off
a barstool to a meeting.

643
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:06,131
Whatever is was, it stuck.

644
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,218
You see something in this girl,

645
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:11,683
you go ahead and drag her.

646
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,305
Now, it might now work,

647
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:17,589
but if it does, you've saved a life.

648
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,536
Hey.

649
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,981
- Hey.
- How's the pleasure business?

650
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,772
Always learning.

651
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,374
What's up?

652
00:26:35,408 --> 00:26:36,409
Do you like kids?

653
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:38,043
- What?
- I just... I mean, in general.

654
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,789
You know, some people,
they don't like kids.

655
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:41,280
Have I done something wrong?

656
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,815
It's just, when I talk about Sofia,

657
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,950
you don't seem particularly interested.

658
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:46,785
I don't really know Sofia.

659
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,888
I only know what you tell me
of her, and how you treat her.

660
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:51,260
And I...

661
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:54,293
I just don't believe in
coddling the children so much.

662
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,243
- That's all.
- Coddling?

663
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,995
I don't coddle the children... the child.

664
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,331
If Sofia stayed home for part of today,

665
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,976
why should she want to go
to school the next day?

666
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,900
It's very complicated.

667
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,702
I mean, her parents split up,
and she's...

668
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,370
My parents split up, too.

669
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:08,707
I stayed in Italy with Papa,
baby Andrew goes with our mom.

670
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,576
I had my first job at 9,

671
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,077
sweeping up in the cafe.

672
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,413
Meanwhile, Andrew is sobbing
on the couch because

673
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:15,848
his girlfriend left him.

674
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:16,892
She was basically deported.

675
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,851
It's because he was coddled.

676
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,207
Food for thought?

677
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:24,923
Okay, kiddo, you're good to go.

678
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,435
And don't let me
catch you in here next week

679
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,727
with a skateboard or an Xbox down there.

680
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,429
Deal?

681
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:31,897
I know it was dumb.

682
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:34,533
Well, we all do dumb things.

683
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,513
Then, we, uh, outgrow them.

684
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:39,738
Thanks...

685
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:41,573
Dr. Karev.

686
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:42,774
You got a good kid.

687
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,104
I'm happy for you.

688
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:48,747
She's too good for you.

689
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:51,016
You think I don't know that?

690
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,951
I know it's a lot...

691
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:55,521
"Unconventional" was
the social worker's response...

692
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:56,855
but I think I can help her.

693
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,624
What did Meredith say?

694
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,726
That's the part I haven't figured out.

695
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,961
Tell Meredith to blow up
the air mattress,

696
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:05,130
a teenage drug addict
is moving in with her kid.

697
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:06,899
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna fly.

698
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,033
I'll figure something out.

699
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,801
She bought a dress...

700
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:11,105
just to see her baby.

701
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,815
Or maybe she stole it.
I don't know. Either way...

702
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,640
She cares about him.

703
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:15,974
She cares about him.

704
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,145
She should be with Leo.

705
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:18,944
It will give her something
real to fight for.

706
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,579
Wait. No, that's not what I'm saying.

707
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:21,780
You are great with Leo.

708
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:23,061
That's your thing. I don't want
to mess that up for you.

709
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,917
No, no, you're not. She's his mother.

710
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,898
If there's a shot that Leo can
have his mother in his life...

711
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:30,589
I want to give him that.

712
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:32,090
Really?

713
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,487
Really.

714
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:37,229
So, you guys should stay with us.

715
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:40,499
But Leo's mine, she's yours, okay?

716
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,811
Okay, but I don't want to feel
like I'm stealing your thunder.

717
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:45,971
Okay, Amelia, how about we don't
make this all about you?

718
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,686
You know, I wasn't comparing Ellis Grey

719
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,820
to Harper Avery earlier.

720
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,215
I was talking about our moms.

721
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:05,357
They've both been through
a ton of obstacles,

722
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:07,359
they both made sure
we had an amazing future,

723
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:09,828
and now I have to take hers away.

724
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,181
Well, how does your mother...

725
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,942
Well, she's trying to take
the fall for this whole thing.

726
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,968
I mean, Harper Avery's name's
all over it, but she built it.

727
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:17,803
It's her heart and soul
that went into it.

728
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,606
I mean, it's not as easy as just
giving back an award, you know?

729
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
You think that was easy?

730
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:23,536
I worked my whole life for that award.

731
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,677
I'm pissed! You know,
I'm mainly pissed at my mother

732
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,045
for selling out Marie Cerone.

733
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,444
And then, when I think back on it,

734
00:29:28,478 --> 00:29:31,283
it was all due to the behavior
of one awful man.

735
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:33,885
And then, I get mad at myself
for blaming the women.

736
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,050
Why do we do that?

737
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,889
Why is it so easy to blame the women?

738
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:40,373
A couple thousand years of patriarchy.

739
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,228
Okay, so, now do you care to explain

740
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:46,031
why you threw $100 million
at a contest that you could win?

741
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:47,977
Look, I created the contest
because I'm not allowed

742
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,115
to compete for Harper Avery.

743
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,245
I want to compete with the best...

744
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,837
an even playing field.

745
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,415
So, maybe it wasn't
the smartest thing in the world

746
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:56,074
to pay for the playing field,
but look what it created...

747
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:57,234
Webber's cancer pens.

748
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,544
You got Pierce's rechargeable hearts,

749
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,413
your mini livers, Robbin's crash cart,

750
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,849
Bailey's butt... thing.

751
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:05,020
But I lit that fire.

752
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,085
I created something
where there was nothing.

753
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,854
And even if they try to
take that from me...

754
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:10,032
if they shut down the contest...

755
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:11,266
I'm not gonna be ashamed of that.

756
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,026
Yeah, you could've just bought
a "World's Best Surgeon" trophy

757
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,627
and had your name engraved on it.

758
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,031
Are you ready to do this?

759
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,066
Not even a little bit.

760
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:42,314
You really didn't know?

761
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,549
About the contest?

762
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,183
No. No idea.

763
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,352
I'm just a wedding planner now.

764
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,921
Ugh, I could strangle him.

765
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:49,922
Right?

766
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:51,757
I mean, I just can't believe
that he did it.

767
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,425
I mean, everything I know about him,

768
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:54,426
it just doesn't seem like...

769
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,028
Wait, wait, wait. Jackson?

770
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,230
No. No, no, no,
Jackson has an explanation.

771
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,423
What? What is it?

772
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,426
Oh, I don't know what it is,
but he has one.

773
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:07,573
Maggie, I've known him for a long time.

774
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,276
He can be complicated but not morally,

775
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:12,771
not like that.

776
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,232
He's a good man.

777
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,943
He deserves the benefit of your doubt.

778
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:21,787
Webber, on the other hand...

779
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:24,389
that guy played me like a bassoon.

780
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,031
Bovie to me, please.

781
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,866
Finishing marking incision.

782
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,468
10 blade.

783
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,957
That... Mer, watch it. Watch it.

784
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,235
Kelly clamp.

785
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:04,322
Helm, suction.

786
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:06,431
Liga clamp.

787
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,906
Crap, he's bleeding from everywhere.

788
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,035
Bovie!

789
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,772
You know what?
We should reach out to them.

790
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,952
- Who? The women?
- Yeah.

791
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:16,452
And not just the ones
in the lawsuit, either.

792
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,976
I mean everybody who comes forward.

793
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:18,990
I don't care how many there are.

794
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:21,013
37, as of lunchtime today.

795
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,848
I get alerts on my phone.

796
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:25,017
And do what? Apologize, or write checks?

797
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:26,785
For starters. We can do more than that.

798
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,286
We can rebuild the foundation.

799
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,988
The foundation bears the name of the man

800
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:31,356
who sexually assaulted them.

801
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,025
Their lives and careers were destroyed.

802
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,794
And now they have to see
the name of their abuser

803
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,696
on hospitals all over the world?

804
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,631
He's been lauded and celebrated

805
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,266
while they suffered in silence.

806
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,969
If you want to rebuild,
you have to tear it down first.

807
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,222
You're right. I'm not putting
him through this ever again.

808
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:54,456
I'm taking the whole thing out right now.

809
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,881
Prepare the saw.

810
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,627
Tumor comes out... here we go.

811
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:11,157
It's good. Says what we want to
and sets the record straight.

812
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,060
Well, hopefully, it'll get the job done.

813
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,428
Oh, I think it will.

814
00:34:16,462 --> 00:34:18,063
Places enough blame on you

815
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,932
that people will feel like
a real change was made.

816
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,934
I'll call a press conference.

817
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,184
This can't wait till the morning.

818
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,981
Okay, you know what?
Let's just take a breather

819
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:27,372
and think this thing through.

820
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:28,907
Honey, look...

821
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,176
Hey, Mom!

822
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:33,111
I think we found a solution
that all of us can live with.

823
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,356
Uh, well, we beat you to the punch.

824
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,082
But we would love to have you
on camera next to your mother...

825
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,784
You know what? Let's hold it.

826
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:39,828
I-I want to hear what they have to say.

827
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:41,953
Sweetheart, I've already
written my statement.

828
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,089
Erin wants me to read this to the press.

829
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,490
Yeah, no. We're not doing this.

830
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:47,225
Well, you're too late.

831
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,460
You're fired. You can go now.

832
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:50,061
Now wait just a minute. I...

833
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:51,673
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let my grandfather do to you

834
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,131
what he did to all these women.

835
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,577
Just read it.

836
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,974
"The time has come for new
vision, new light, and new hope.

837
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:06,678
We know that a culture can't
change with a single statement.

838
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:09,614
Comprehensive,
systemic change is required.

839
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,150
But let that change begin now...

840
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:14,619
with the dissolution of
the Harper Avery Foundation,

841
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,754
effective immediately."

842
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:17,088
Darling, this is insane.

843
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:20,258
- Thank you.
- Keep reading, please.

844
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:22,460
"In its place, a new foundation,

845
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,996
dedicated to the preservation
and nurturing

846
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:26,631
of all 72 hospitals..."...

847
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,866
If I am not buying this,

848
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,378
I don't know how you think
the public will.

849
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:30,802
Why are you still here?

850
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,537
Because I am trying to save you

851
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:34,139
from committing financial suicide.

852
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,951
Will you please just read
the underlined part?

853
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:40,011
"We also make a solemn promise...

854
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:43,381
To give voice to those who were silenced.

855
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:47,619
To listen to, and to learn from,
every woman's story.

856
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:50,889
To repay, retrain, and rehire

857
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:53,959
every victim of Harper Avery's abuse.

858
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:58,056
We hope you'll join us in
supporting, with enthusiasm...

859
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:02,936
...the Catherine Fox Foundation.

860
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:07,239
Sincerely yours, Catherine Fox."

861
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:11,243
Ugh. What a lovely moment this is.

862
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:14,145
A billion-dollar moment, one might say.

863
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,148
Honestly, the name idea was Meredith's.

864
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,084
It was all him.

865
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,495
But can we please get this re-engraved,

866
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,999
because I worked way too hard for it.

867
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:34,467
"Meet me at my house?

868
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:35,776
Come through the back door?"

869
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,402
It's all so mysterious.

870
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:38,603
Shh. DeLuca.

871
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,472
Oh. Oh.

872
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:49,781
I get why you did it.

873
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:51,651
You wanted to compete. I get it.

874
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,153
Thank you.

875
00:36:58,157 --> 00:37:00,692
You were very impressive today.

876
00:37:00,726 --> 00:37:02,027
- Was I?
- It was hot.

877
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:04,529
Still gonna be hot if I go broke?

878
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:06,531
Are you going broke for noble reasons?

879
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:07,599
Maybe.

880
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,667
Yep, still hot.

881
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,640
Cooking?

882
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:17,008
Oh, I'm full of surprises.

883
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,221
Risotto.

884
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:22,348
Salmon.

885
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,322
It was a stupid idea, anyway.

886
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:32,891
She probably thought
I was some nut job...

887
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,029
"Hey, we just met.
Why don't you move in with me?"

888
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:38,430
Amelia...

889
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,067
...she's here.

890
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:43,134
She showed.

891
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:48,207
Oh, God. Um...

892
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,675
I'm her Ollie.

893
00:37:58,624 --> 00:37:59,634
Okay.

894
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:05,590
Well, if this is gonna work,
there need to be ground rules.

895
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,692
First off,
you text your family... tonight.

896
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,361
You let them know that you're safe

897
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:11,229
and that you're off the streets.

898
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,898
You cannot do drugs at all, okay?

899
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,166
That is a non-starter.

900
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,311
I can give you a prescription

901
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,670
to take the edge off your
withdrawal, but that's all.

902
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:20,772
And you have to come with me to meetings.

903
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:22,867
She's so bossy.

904
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:25,910
Oh, yeah.

905
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:29,040
We define ourselves by our actions.

906
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,282
Who's ready to go home?

907
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:34,285
But it doesn't mean we have
to live by that definition.

908
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:39,958
We can change our own story.

909
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:45,797
Robbins?

910
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:47,399
I'm glad I caught you.

911
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,650
You're close with DeLuca, right?

912
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:51,903
Close? Well, we were roommates,
so, yeah, okay.

913
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:54,773
Okay. So, I'm worried about him.

914
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:56,284
Maggie brought him home about a week ago,

915
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,243
and he hasn't gotten off the couch since.

916
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,222
I mean, I'm literally gonna have
to put it out on the sidewalk

917
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,746
- when he leaves.
- Ooh, yikes.

918
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:04,149
Yeah. So, I was hoping you could
talk to him, maybe.

919
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:06,551
We can refuse to accept the way
people define us.

920
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,286
I don't that I'm the person for the job,

921
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,622
but I think I do know
the person you should talk to.

922
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,295
We can work like hell
to escape a bad reputation...

923
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,398
...only to wonder if we succeeded.

924
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:23,168
Okay, we're having it out right now.

925
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:25,236
Oh, come on. You're seriously
gonna listen to

926
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:27,839
some nurse I slept with
when I was a stupid intern?

927
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:30,508
No! I'm talking about
your psycho mood swings

928
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,010
and treating me like crap all day.

929
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:35,079
I won't do weirdness
and silence and anger, Alex.

930
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:36,247
I can't do that again.

931
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:37,382
It's not what you think.

932
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,818
It started when I asked you
to check your bank account.

933
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:41,352
Is it money?

934
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:42,664
Are we really fighting about money?

935
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,155
Because that is such a cliché.

936
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,957
I grew up in my fricking car, Alex.

937
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,626
Do you think I care if
you're having money problems?

938
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:49,794
It's not.

939
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,463
I have money...

940
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:53,291
way too much money.

941
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,343
I haven't checked this account
in over a year,

942
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,136
and all of a sudden,
my balance is crazy high.

943
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,137
Okay.

944
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,972
It's my mom.

945
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:02,841
I send her money for rent and food,

946
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,043
and she hasn't been cashing the checks.

947
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:06,478
Which means she's dead

948
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:08,813
or walking the streets half-naked

949
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:10,641
or throwing garbage at people.

950
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:14,963
I'm out here living my life,
and I'm just throwing money

951
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,855
at a problem without paying attention.

952
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:19,891
I don't know.

953
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:22,660
Maybe I haven't really changed that much.

954
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:23,962
No. That's not true.

955
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:26,365
You know that that's not true.

956
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,563
It can be hard to shake
the mistakes of the past.

957
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:34,582
They'll always come back to haunt us.

958
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:36,875
Dr. Miranda Bailey?

959
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,743
I told y'all, I have no comment

960
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:39,968
about the ongoing Harper Avery...

961
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,723
Sanjay Roy. I'm representing a client

962
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:44,048
in a wrongful-termination suit.

963
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,129
Wrongful...

964
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,719
Well, who was wrongfully terminated?

965
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:50,722
My client is Dr. Vikram Roy.

966
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:52,190
Roy?

967
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,224
Is this your brother?

968
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:55,860
Dr. Roy was under your employ
when he was fed

969
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:57,996
psychotropic marijuana cookies

970
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,164
by a superior in the workplace.

971
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,000
This is just a courtesy visit,
to inform you

972
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:04,502
we'll we suing for restitution
of employment

973
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:07,405
as well as unspecified damages
for pain and suffering.

974
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:10,842
I have weekend plans, but I'm
happy to start back on Monday.

975
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:21,504
But one thing we never do...

976
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:25,890
we don't stop. We don't quit.

977
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,295
Hey, Garfunkel...

978
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:32,130
Leave me alone.

979
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:33,698
I have something for you.

980
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,567
We get up and rejoin the fight.

981
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:36,968
Andrew, this is disgusting.

982
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:37,923
Oh, no, no, no. Why did...

983
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:39,237
No, no, no, no. Why did...

984
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:40,471
No, come on.

985
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:46,277
Please, God, don't let him
forget his guitar.

986
