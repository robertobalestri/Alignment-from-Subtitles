Ah. I'm sorry.

Ah, here you are.
Okay.

49
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:11,320
You were here a week ago
with diverticulitis.

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,727
- Yeah.
- You saw Dr. Bailey.

51
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,110
Yeah, it's the third time
it happened to me,

52
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:16,123
and she gave me antibiotics...
each time.

53
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,240
She didn't suggest surgery?

54
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,022
Well, she said that
antibiotics would be

55
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,447
the less-invasive option,
and I really wanted to go

56
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,117
on my synagogue's youth trip.

57
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,006
You a little old for that?

58
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,529
I'm a rabbi,
and I've been around long enough

59
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,122
to know you don't stick a junior rabbi

60
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,865
with a bunch of hormonal teens
on a weekend trip.

61
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,897
Anyway, I started feeling like
I was coming down with something,

62
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,436
and... and then I got this rash.

63
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,398
Which I thought it would get
better in a few days,

64
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:45,745
but... it got worse...
a lot... a lot worse.

65
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,014
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah.

66
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,519
Here we go.

67
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:54,620
Yeah.

68
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:56,326
Okay.

69
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,014
- O... kay.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,600
All right.

71
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,350
Page Dr. Avery, and tell
the burn unit we're on our way.

72
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,951
So, tell me.

73
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,252
Tell you what?

74
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,710
Whatever it is that
you wanted to say,

75
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,622
but you couldn't say
in an e-mail or over the phone,

76
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,694
that you had to show up at my
door in the middle of the night.

77
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,095
I mean, it must be...

78
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:21,592
Is it Amelia's tumor?

79
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:23,053
No, no, it's nothing like that.

80
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,990
Oh, I... Is she pregnant?

81
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,141
Owen, are you going back to Iraq?

82
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,851
Will you just tell me what it is?
I can't take it.

83
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,287
Amelia and I are done.

84
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,186
We're done, Teddy.

85
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:40,725
So, for the first time,
you and me...

86
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,170
there's nothing standing in our way.

87
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,823
Okay. So, I said something,

88
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:53,873
so you gotta say
something, so...

89
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,404
Go ahead... ask.

90
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,584
I wasn't going to.

91
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,013
You want to know
why I was operating

92
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,389
not six weeks
post-kidney-transplant.

93
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,865
You're dying to know,
but you're too polite to ask, so ask.

94
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:30,608
I'm not polite.

95
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,490
- It's none of my business.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,139
The thought did cross
my mind.

97
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,369
Well, you know what they say...

98
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,011
doctors make the worst patients.

99
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,021
I'm rejecting it, aren't I?

100
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,300
That's what's happening...

101
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,077
I'm rejecting my kidney,
or I formed a clot.

102
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,234
Have you had any other symptoms...

103
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,729
oliguria, nausea, vomiting?

104
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,990
Nothing. Up until
a few hours ago, I was fine.

105
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,999
A few hours ago, you were
supposed to be on medical leave.

106
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,529
I was, but my pain's
been at a consistent 3,

107
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:56,312
and I've been off narcotics
for weeks.

108
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,029
What's your
immunosuppressive regimen?

109
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,381
Tacro, azathioprine,

110
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:01,427
and I stopped prednisone
post-op day 4.

111
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,670
Any mTOR inhibitors?

112
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:05,140
No. I'm keeping that bullet
in the chamber.

113
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,022
For the next time
you defy doctors' orders

114
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,553
and perform an organ recovery
that someone else could've done?

115
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,546
I mean, come on.
You cannot expect surgeons

116
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,317
to just sit on the sidelines
watching surgeries go by.

117
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,912
It's not gonna happen.

118
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,912
I donated half of my liver.
I spent the month in a bed.

119
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,318
Yeah, and I bet you hated
every second of it.

120
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:28,412
Vicki Greenberg.

121
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:32,744
59 years old, fantastic mom,
even better grandmother.

122
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:34,693
She can decoupage like
a rock star

123
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:36,757
and makes a ridiculously
good salmon.

124
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:37,850
Your favorite patient.

125
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,461
Six years she's been
waiting for that liver.

126
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,021
Me? I was on dialysis for
a month when I got my kidney.

127
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,723
A month is hell, but it's nothing.

128
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,127
For six years, Vicki's been
miserable, dying.

129
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:48,864
You think I was gonna leave that
in anyone else's hands but mine?

130
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:50,122
- No.
- No.

131
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:53,208
So I came back a week early, and
I was fine until I wasn't.

132
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,615
Just... tell me I didn't screw
this up, Dr. Grey.

133
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,333
Tell me I'm not gonna lose
this kidney.

134
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:00,327
Well, we have to wait
for your labs to come back.

135
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,763
I'll do an ultrasound,
and let's just not get ahead of ourselves.

136
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:06,949
Too late.

137
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:13,708
Oh. Hey.
What's the good word, Doc?

138
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,804
I'm not making
my synagogue trip, am I?

139
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,115
Which means someone's
gonna get pregnant, or drunk...

140
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,272
probably both.

141
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,896
- Rabbi...
- Oh, no, please... Eli.

142
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:27,318
I mean, you're shellacking
half my body in Vaseline.

143
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,068
I think we can dispense
with the formalities.

144
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,701
Eli, you have
Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,

145
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,188
also known as TEN.

146
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,776
It's a reaction to the
antibiotics you were prescribed.

147
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,786
It's what's causing your skin
to separate from itself.

148
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:45,497
That sounds... about as
disgusting as it looks.

149
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:50,177
I-I thought I took the
antibiotics as prescribed.

150
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:53,640
You did. TEN is something that
just happens to some patients.

151
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,243
Nobody's really sure why.

152
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,130
Hard to believe
that something this disgusting

153
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,067
just... happens.

154
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,153
Dr. Kepner and I are gonna do
our very best

155
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,272
to keep you comfortable

156
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,833
and prevent this thing
from progressing any further.

157
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,372
Oh, good.
'Cause I gotta be honest...

158
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,521
this is not my best look.

159
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,757
You sure there's no one
we can call?

160
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:18,576
- A family member...
- Oh, my wife, Elyse. She's on a train.

161
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,044
She's on her way back
from visiting her mother.

162
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:23,927
I don't really...
want to worry her.

163
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,704
Eli...

164
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,062
You're saying worry her.

165
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:31,974
Couldn't hurt
to have her company is all.

166
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,779
How is he?

167
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,685
You know the expression
"makes his flesh crawl"?

168
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,064
Yeah, he's kind of like that,

169
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,740
except in a hundred times more pain.

170
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:53,476
Oh.
He had diverticulitis.

171
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,063
I gave him antibiotics...

172
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,101
For the third time. You didn't want to...

173
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,859
I don't know...
try something different?

174
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,946
I made a judgment call
based on the standard of care.

175
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,650
You can take antibiotics
a dozen times and no reaction.

176
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,914
It's random. It's awful, but it's random.

177
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,643
You didn't do anything wrong.

178
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,109
Look, I-I can take over from here.

179
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,976
- He was my patient.
- No, no. No way.

180
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:16,087
No, I'm not gonna let you go in
there and tell him you screwed up

181
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,894
and then sit by his bedside
and make it all about you.

182
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,641
- April.
- April, you know that's not fair.

183
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,587
All right? Any one of us
could've done the same thing.

184
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,359
Yeah, but we didn't,
and she did,

185
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,067
and I'm not about to let her sit vigil

186
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,374
while he circles the drain.

187
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:27,601
I know you're going
through something.

188
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,398
I want to help. I truly do.

189
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,462
- But that doesn't mean you...
- This has nothing to do with me, Jackson.

190
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,196
I am just trying to
clean up her mess.

191
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,953
We've all seen his labs.
He has a SCORTEN of 5.

192
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,764
We can give him as much care as
we want,

193
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,790
but he'll be lucky if
he makes it through the night.

194
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,987
And if he doesn't,
that's on her.

195
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,796
Fair or not.

196
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:02,085
No thrombosis in the renal
artery. That's good.

197
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,424
No hydronephrosis.

198
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:06,494
No fluid collections, no obstructions,

199
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,690
- cysts, abscesses...
- Yeah.

200
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,927
Looks good.

201
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,184
One hurdle down, one more to go.

202
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,717
Oh, and Mayo called and said
that Vicki's transplant surgery

203
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,286
is going off without a hitch.

204
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,856
She's gonna give me so much crap
for bailing on her surgery.

205
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:23,820
Well, she'll live... quite literally.

206
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,606
So when do I get my labs back?

207
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,200
Soon.

208
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,654
Well, you don't suppose
slipping a cool $20

209
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,833
to the boys down at the lab
would help speed this up,

210
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,497
- do you?
- I'm afraid not.

211
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,872
How 'bout a $50?

212
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,910
How's your pain?

213
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,427
Me? I'm all good. Perfect,
painless, Marathon ready,

214
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,967
or at least a strong 1OK.

215
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,434
Mm-hmm.
How'd it work out for you

216
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,859
last time you pretended
you were fine?

217
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,427
That's, uh...
That's a good point.

218
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,748
I'd say I'm about a 3, 3 1/2,

219
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,348
but I'm gonna muscle through.

220
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,709
Is this you playing it tough?

221
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:56,091
Because you just did
a liver recovery

222
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,490
5 weeks post-op
from your own surgery.

223
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,826
No, no, no, no.
This is me

224
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:01,505
trying to avoid
an unnecessary addiction

225
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,948
to opioids, if I can help it.

226
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,630
Slippery slope and all.

227
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:07,701
Great. As soon as those labs
come in, I'm gonna let you know.

228
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,208
This is the part where you
leave me, sad and alone,

229
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,006
leaving me no choice
but to contemplate

230
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:16,106
my dark, miserable, kidney-less
future, so sad and so alone?

231
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,304
You're the one who said you
didn't want to call any family.

232
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:21,131
That is true. That's because
Charlotte is a 16-year-old

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,921
who'll fail calculus
if she misses her mid-term,

234
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,778
and I am way too math-dumb to
pull her out of that hole.

235
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:29,258
And yet you're a transplant surgeon.

236
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,059
Oh, yeah. World class.

237
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:32,755
You felt the need to add that?

238
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:36,184
When I'm talking to Harper Avery-winning
Meredith Grey, yeah, I do.

239
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,100
See? You don't even need
any visitors.

240
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,264
You have so much Internet

241
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,615
stalking to do.

242
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,404
I really do need
to go check on my patients.

243
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,036
W-Well, uh, tell me about them.

244
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,114
Traditional stuff or another
abdominal-wall transplant?

245
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,175
I am doing two lap choles

246
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,238
and repairing a transected biliary duct.

247
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,317
Mm. How thin is the duct?

248
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:55,475
2 millimeters.

249
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,036
- Damn.
- Right?

250
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,075
So, is, uh... is Charlotte
your daughter, or...?

251
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,717
Uh, my niece. Uh, Erica, my sister,

252
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,887
she's a... she's a limited person.

253
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,779
She's got a gig heart
and good intentions,

254
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:13,065
just zero follow-through.

255
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,327
Well, that's polite of you.

256
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:15,428
Oh, you want the truth?

257
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:16,770
Always.

258
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,181
Uh...

259
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,919
My selfish little sister
did one thing right

260
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:22,475
in her selfish little life,

261
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,490
and then she crapped all over that,

262
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,911
so I stepped up.

263
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,866
I took Charlotte in, and...

264
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,068
it's the best thing I ever did.

265
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,598
What about you? You got kids,
nieces, pets, stowaways?

266
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,990
What are we talking about here?

267
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,177
- I do. I have three kids.
- Wow.

268
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,748
And an occasional stowaway.

269
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:39,998
- I...
- What's the matter?

270
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,621
I'm just looking for your
superhero cape is all.

271
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,623
- I'm not seeing it.
- I have a lot of help.

272
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,281
Oh, do you? What's that like?

273
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,721
Your kids have a dad?

274
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,229
They did.

275
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,599
All right, million-dollar question...

276
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,827
what would you do
if you weren't a doctor?

277
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:58,951
I... There is nothing I would rather be.

278
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,718
No, I mean, what if
you couldn't be a doctor?

279
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,006
What then? What's your Plan B?

280
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,264
There's no Plan B.

281
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,662
There really hasn't ever

282
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:05,913
- been a Plan B.
- So, wait, wait.

283
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,928
You had visions
of cutting people's bowels open

284
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:10,182
straight out of the womb, and it's
been smooth sailing ever since?

285
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,718
- Really?
- Yes. Well, there was, like,

286
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,246
a switch from neuro to general,

287
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,963
- but pretty much, yeah.
- Wow. That is...

288
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,443
Crazy.

289
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,826
Well, I was gonna say amazing,
but, yeah, "crazy" will do.

290
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,098
So, what about you?
You just woke up one morning

291
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,066
and couldn't decide whether you
wanted to make French toast

292
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,418
or become a transplant surgeon?

293
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:28,074
I wasn't exactly a legacy,
if that's what you mean.

294
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,276
First one in my family to go
to college, actually.

295
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,590
And you work at one of the best
hospitals in the world.

296
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,589
Your mother must be
so disappointed.

297
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,650
Well, I'd like to think
she'd be a little proud, yeah.

298
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:40,636
When did she pass?

299
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:42,315
- I was 15.
- Oh.

300
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:45,550
- Tough age.
- Yeah, she was... she was kind.

301
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,126
And strange.

302
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,047
And a terrible dresser.

303
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,697
Impossibly smart.

304
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,597
She had heart failure.

305
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,453
She was on a list a long time.

306
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,245
Hearts are hard to come by.

307
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,567
Kidneys aren't as easy
as you'd think, either.

308
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:02,903
No, they're not.

309
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:05,711
So she's why you decided to
became a transplant surgeon?

310
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,434
No, I-I loved cardio, I loved neuro,

311
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,505
I loved all of it, really.

312
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,183
I just... I just couldn't sit still.

313
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,784
Transplant surgeons, you're
always in another city...

314
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,681
in another country, if you're lucky.

315
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,088
- Plus, I like to fly.
- Mnh.

316
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,925
- What? Not a fan?
- No.

317
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,391
So, where do you keep it?

318
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,567
Keep what?

319
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,003
Your Harper Avery.

320
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,438
Okay, I just... I really...

321
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:31,863
Nick, I have patients.

322
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,465
Is it dead center on the mantel?
Fancy glass case in the study?

323
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,668
What, did you just chuck it
in some closet somewhere?

324
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,965
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
What, is it a hat rack?

325
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,057
As soon as your labs come in,

326
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,465
I will come down
and let you know.

327
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,683
- Okay.
- Okay?

328
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,260
Just one last question.

329
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,483
Just answer me this, Dr. Grey...

330
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:51,667
Meredith.

331
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,008
Meredith.

332
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,104
Do you think I'm gonna lose this kidney?

333
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,276
Your ultrasound looked great,

334
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,254
but until your other labs come back,

335
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:01,561
there's no way
to definitively know...

336
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,729
Yeah. Well, I'm asking what you think.

337
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,765
I don't know.

338
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,471
Are you good there?

339
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,489
You know, it's possible
I imagined this moment once...

340
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,568
okay, a hundred times... but it
didn't ever involve laughing.

341
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,496
You're in my bed, in Germany.

342
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,668
I mean, you are in my bed,
in Germany.

343
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,795
Owen Hunt, naked, in my bed.

344
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:41,527
- Yeah, yeah. I don't even like Germany.
- Yeah, me neither!

345
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,567
I know I should ask you why
you're here, but...

346
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,508
- I told you.
- It's just...

347
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,433
You imagined this, too?

348
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:01,030
I imagined this, too.

349
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:17,871
No, absolutely not.

350
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,028
When are you gonna admit
that you're wrong?

351
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,488
- It was a CABG.
- It was a coronary artery dissection.

352
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,230
CABG.
It was a freakin' CABG.

353
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,713
I said that I would take the
coronary artery dissection.

354
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:27,024
What was that guy?

355
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,536
He was that annoying guy
with the...

356
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:29,681
Ratliff, with the...

357
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,471
Tattoo of Jim Morrison
on his shoulder.

358
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,263
Right, I was prepping him,
and then you walked in

359
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,411
and started barking
like some crazed sea lion,

360
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,616
and you told Sergeant Teller
to take the dissection,

361
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:38,901
and I ended up with the CABG.

362
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,435
Oh, oh, oh! And then, um...

363
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,413
you made me assist
because you said

364
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,186
that I put you in the minors when
you should've been in the majors.

365
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:47,047
Okay, I have never used a
baseball metaphor in my life.

366
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,724
Ooh! You were pissed,
but you were excellent.

367
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,142
I was.

368
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:52,750
And you were
a sufficient assist.

369
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,092
- Sufficient.
- Yeah.

370
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,279
What do you want me to say?
That you were flawless and brilliant

371
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:57,715
and you anticipated
my every move

372
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:01,013
and I knew the moment that we
shared that O.R...

373
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,099
that I wanted to do that
the rest of my life?

374
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:05,841
I did.

375
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,330
I mean,
with you assisting me,

376
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,091
but, you know,
it's the same thing.

377
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,661
You are such a slob.

378
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,254
And you're beautiful.

379
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,151
Oh, my God.

380
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:22,997
This, right here,
when it snows, this is...

381
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,231
this is the one time
I really love this place.

382
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,973
You remember when you made it
snow in the desert

383
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,981
for our guys in the 54th?

384
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:37,888
You blindfolded them,
and you put their face

385
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,957
up to the machine so they could
feel it before it melted?

386
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,960
It made them happy.

387
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,575
You were so good at that.

388
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,551
All the grand gestures,

389
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:51,028
you did it better
than anyone else I know.

390
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,043
Owen, what are you doing here?

391
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:01,036
I told you.

392
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,629
No, I mean...

393
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,332
I mean, is... is this it?

394
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,309
Right here, this? Is this...

395
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:11,301
I mean...

396
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,832
Are you getting on a plane
tomorrow, and... and... and...

397
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,086
and we have this...

398
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:19,313
As amazing as this is, this isn't...

399
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:20,657
What?

400
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,047
- This isn't real.
- Why can't it be?

401
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,860
Because I live a million miles
and time zones away,

402
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,831
and I have a big life here, Owen.

403
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,657
Yeah, but you hate Germany, so...

404
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,384
Yeah, but I love my job,
and I love my friends.

405
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,259
And there's this restaurant
on the corner, and they know me,

406
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,093
and they make this roast chicken...

407
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,929
I mean, the best roasted chicken
that I've ever tasted before.

408
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,546
And I'm opening up
a clinic for refugees,

409
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,166
and I have the finances
and the resources,

410
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,588
and it's finally,
finally happening.

411
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:49,649
And I... I have made a life here
for myself, and...

412
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,901
And why can't I be part of that?

413
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,674
Do you want to be a part of it?

414
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,337
I mean,
you would move to Germany?

415
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,189
Why not? I mean,
I'm a trauma surgeon.

416
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,478
I could work with you...

417
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:01,961
- For me.
- For you.

418
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,391
Or... Or I could find a job
at a different hospital,

419
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,488
if that's not what you want.

420
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:12,532
I can move here
and be with you, and...

421
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:16,269
And you'd be leaving Megan
behind and your mom.

422
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,091
Or you could come back to Seattle.

423
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:22,199
Pierce is unreal,
and the two of you together...

424
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,168
Or we could half and half
or go to Canada.

425
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,399
- Canada.
- Or I don't know. I don't know.

426
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:30,188
I haven't figured that
all out yet, but I just know...

427
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,750
I just know that
I want to be with you.

428
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,477
I just know that I want you.

429
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:38,438
This is not some grand gesture
or some... some whimsical...

430
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:40,424
Yeah. Yeah, it is fast,

431
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,174
and I haven't figured out
all the moves,

432
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:44,719
but that doesn't make this
any less...

433
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:49,024
I am in love with you... Teddy.

434
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,129
I realized I loved you
and how long I've loved you.

435
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,450
So I got on a plane.

436
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,670
You got on a plane.

437
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,016
Yeah.

438
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,993
I got on a plane.

439
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:26,476
Stay a few days.

440
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:29,733
I'll show you around the hospital, and...

441
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,344
we can go hiking
around Bismarck Tower.

442
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,579
You can show me
your roasted chicken place.

443
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:37,767
Yeah, back off.
That place is all mine.

444
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,346
So, can you? Stay?

445
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:44,516
Sure. I'll make a couple calls.
Kepner can take my shifts.

446
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,336
Sure. I mean, just like that, sure.

447
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:49,141
Teddy, I told you.

448
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,457
Tell me this doesn't scare you.

449
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:55,993
Why should it?

450
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:58,544
You know me. I know you.

451
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,500
This has been...

452
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,211
We know we work.

453
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,102
What if it doesn't?

454
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,201
Can't think like that.

455
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,564
Yeah, but I do.
You know I do.

456
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,313
You know everything
about me.

457
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:13,952
You're my first call in a crisis,

458
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,481
or when I've just done the most
perfect LIMA to LAD anastomosis,

459
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:21,878
and you just...
you make things real and better,

460
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:25,814
and... you tell me
when I'm being an ass.

461
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,167
Yeah, I know.
You're my best friend, Owen.

462
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:31,652
Isn't that what they say?

463
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,369
You should marry
your best friend?

464
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,189
Oh, really?
So now we're getting married?

465
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,541
No, I... What I...

466
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,899
You just got out of a marriage.

467
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,313
That led me to you.

468
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,308
Teddy, I get that you're scared,

469
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,072
but there's no... that's not a reason...

470
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,852
Wait. What do you mean,
"led me to you"?

471
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:49,212
Well, I just mean, Amelia, she...

472
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:50,853
Listen...

473
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,022
marrying Amelia was a mistake.

474
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,317
You said it yourself.

475
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,472
It was not a marriage, and
she and I, we can both admit that.

476
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,181
She's... Amelia's a gambler.

477
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:02,463
Or she was a gambler.

478
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:05,017
It's hard to tell the difference
between Tumor Amelia

479
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:07,072
and Amelia Amelia,
but we took a gamble,

480
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,137
and it fell apart because
it wasn't meant...

481
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,322
My point is, she was right.

482
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:16,119
Being here with you, it makes
all the sense in the world.

483
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,478
Wait. She said that?

484
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,367
Well, not in so many... She just...

485
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:25,760
Listen, she knows me, and she
knows how much you mean to me,

486
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,818
so when she said it, it...
it... it just made sense.

487
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,160
All I'm trying to say is,

488
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:32,418
she is the one who pointed out

489
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:34,424
that there's always been
something between us,

490
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,517
and she was right, so I...

491
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,385
So you got on a plane to me.

492
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:40,898
Yes.

493
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,814
Teddy...

494
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,921
Teddy, there's no reason to make this...

495
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,031
Wait.

496
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,197
What were you... What were you
doing when she said this?

497
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,642
- Uh...
- Owen?

498
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,329
Owen.

499
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,448
You were sleeping with her.

500
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,152
Teddy...

501
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:02,012
When? When did she say this?

502
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,017
Last night.

503
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:23,892
I was a near-impossible match,
you know.

504
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,692
I took the one kidney in
my world someone could offer...

505
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,350
my best friend.

506
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,483
If I have to look him in the eye
and tell him I blew it...

507
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,559
But you can't think like that.

508
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:35,862
I can't help it.

509
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,292
We won't know until we know.

510
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,249
I used to think shoe salesman...
for my Plan B.

511
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:46,578
You have a thing for feet?

512
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,624
- What, deal-breaker?
- I mean, kind of, yeah.

513
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,577
There's no world
in which a shoe salesman

514
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,616
comes home at night
and thinks about shoes.

515
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,741
He goes to work, he deals with feet

516
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:57,007
and weird people all day,
but, hell, so do we.

517
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,624
Except what's the worst thing
he can cause?

518
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:01,733
Blisters? Bad arch support?

519
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,091
That job is the epitome
of "No Harm, No Foul."

520
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,194
Plus, actual vacation time.

521
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,164
- "Used to think."
- What's that?

522
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,670
You said you used to think

523
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,274
that's what
you would do for a living.

524
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,460
That's just what I consider when
a patient's lung craps out on me

525
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,209
or the plane lands five minutes
too late to recover an organ.

526
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,406
But that's not the fantasy.

527
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,581
- No.
- So what is?

528
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,768
Your turn.

529
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:25,351
My turn? I'm just here to listen.

530
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:26,577
No, you're not.

531
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,233
- I'm not?
- No.

532
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:31,531
Okay. Well, there was one time

533
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,561
when I thought I would be
working at the multiplex

534
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:36,602
with my best friend Cristina,
but that was just...

535
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,148
Your version of shoe salesman.

536
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,398
More like hospital-mandated
therapy, but...

537
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,522
Ooh! Now we're getting
to the good stuff.

538
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,507
But you don't have an answer,
do you?

539
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,499
You don't know what you would do
if you weren't a doctor.

540
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:51,945
My dad took us
out to the Boundary Waters.

541
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,477
- You know them?
- No.

542
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:56,132
Right on the edge,
between Minnesota and Canada.

543
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:59,185
These huge stretches of lake.

544
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:02,449
You have to portage your canoes
on your shoulders for miles.

545
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:05,624
Every morning, my dad would
take me out in a canoe.

546
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,742
We'd be up so early,

547
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:10,423
you could see the cobwebs
reflecting off the reeds.

548
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:15,046
And just dead, eerie,
incredible silence.

549
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,871
My dad would get this look
on his face.

550
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:24,077
If I couldn't be a doctor,
I'd go sit in that canoe

551
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:25,734
until I felt... even for a second...

552
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:27,382
what he was feeling.

553
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,100
Or you know what? Screw it.

554
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,013
I'll be a shoe salesman.
That's where it's at.

555
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,686
Fewer mosquitoes, too.

556
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,602
Hey, it's your turn.

557
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,686
I just got way too personal
on our first date,

558
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:41,530
- so your turn.
- Excuse me?

559
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:44,171
Joking. That was me making a joke.

560
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:45,832
I am your doctor.

561
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,427
Hey, thank God for that, right?

562
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,038
Listen, the reality is, as soon
as I'm good to go here,

563
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:51,921
I'm on a plane back to Minnesota.

564
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,656
Mayo's got my back.
You never have to see me again.

565
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,776
Mm. Whew.

566
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:00,665
So what's a little deep, dark
confession amongst friends?

567
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:03,949
Okay.

568
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,419
Um...

569
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,480
Have you ever been to Sardinia?

570
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,052
- Sardinia.
- Mm.

571
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,689
Nude beach and a bottle of wine.

572
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,286
Helluva party.
Excellent choice.

573
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:14,553
So, when I was young,

574
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,325
my girlfriend and I stayed
in this tiny village.

575
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,700
And I think we paid this woman like $2

576
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,411
to crash at her house
and drink all of her wine.

577
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,270
And she was 97.

578
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,153
Her sister was 101.

579
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,974
The neighbor was 99.

580
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:32,178
And they grew their own food,
and they wandered

581
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:35,724
these little cobblestone streets
with chickens to the beaches.

582
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,201
Wait. I'm sorry. Did the
chickens wander on the beach,

583
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,030
- or how does that work?
- No, the people...

584
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,794
these incredible people...

585
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:45,522
who were laughing and fighting
with the people they loved,

586
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,091
and no one was in any rush.

587
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,555
No one had anywhere to go.

588
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:50,013
And they were happy.

589
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,770
So you want to go live
with the chickens

590
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,057
and the happy people?

591
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:54,394
- Yes.
- Okay.

592
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:55,661
Me and my kids.

593
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,724
And my sisters can come
because they can do the cooking

594
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,959
and the growing because,
I mean, please.

595
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:03,701
And everyone's already living

596
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,474
till they were
a hundred years old, right?

597
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,345
There's no cancer or Alzheimer's,

598
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:09,716
so there's no lives for me
to save, and...

599
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:13,130
no one will die on my watch.

600
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,560
Sounds pretty good.

601
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:17,497
Just... me and my kids and a hammock

602
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:19,177
and a stack of books
that I'll buy

603
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,907
with no intention of ever reading.

604
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:24,090
Mm. In this scenario, I don't
suppose there's any room

605
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:26,444
on that hammock for someone
about your age?

606
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:28,258
Brilliant but not too brilliant,

607
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:31,070
with one...
debatably functioning kidney?

608
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,766
I mean, unless you wanna lug
a canoe over your head with me?

609
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,476
'Cause I'm game either way.

610
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,565
Your labs.

611
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,585
They're what?

612
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:47,147
- Dr. Grey?
- Damn it.

613
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:48,226
Tell me.

614
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,429
They're inconclusive.

615
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,227
- Meredith...
- Um... okay.

616
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:52,483
Wait.

617
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,522
The biopsy is normal.

618
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,343
Your bloodwork is showing
a normal white count.

619
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,210
- What about my GFR?
- It's down.

620
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,640
- Creatinine?
- It's doubled.

621
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,187
But you also have proteinuria.

622
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,804
Something isn't making sense.

623
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:06,030
I can't lose my kidney,
Meredith, please.

624
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:15,997
There it is. You have a clot
in your renal vein.

625
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,403
We need to get him
up to the O.R. right now.

626
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:22,740
Nothing showed up on
the ultrasound before. Why not?

627
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,345
Because the flow to the vein
is so low, but it makes sense.

628
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,428
You were on that plane.
You were standing in that O.R.

629
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,083
Any one of these could've caused a DVT

630
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,781
to lodge itself in your renal vein.

631
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,593
Let's go, come on!
We gotta go, guys!

632
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,889
- Meredith...
- Nick, listen,

633
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,265
you need an embolectomy right now

634
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,390
if I'm gonna save this kidney.

635
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,577
Third drawer, green cabinet.

636
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:40,673
- Nick, I got this.
- No, no, no, no.

637
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,780
Third drawer, green cabinet.

638
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:43,287
That's where
the deed to the house is

639
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,057
and the passcodes for
Charlotte's college fund.

640
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,325
She's got to go to college.

641
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:47,809
I don't care for what,
but she's gotta go.

642
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:49,693
She's kind and
strong and beautiful,

643
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:50,765
and none of that will matter

644
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,460
if she can't string together
a decent sentence.

645
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,069
And tell her to stay the hell
away from drugs.

646
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:55,523
Her mother never could,
and it ruined her.

647
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,584
If she wants to drink, drink,

648
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:58,193
but there's an A.A. book
in her college folder, too,

649
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,114
just in case. Tell her, Meredith.

650
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:01,827
Stay with me, Nick.

651
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,436
Tell her for me, Meredith, please.

652
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:05,232
You'll tell her yourself.

653
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,215
Let's go!

654
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:13,785
Elyse.

655
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,072
W... Elyse?

656
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:17,754
- Eli.
- Elyse?

657
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:19,559
Your wife, Elyse, is on her way.

658
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,652
- Just hang in there, Eli.
- Okay.

659
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:24,679
I'm gonna turn up the bed warmer
to encourage wound healing.

660
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,208
Huh? You're gonna make it hotter?

661
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:27,796
I'm sorry. Um...

662
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:29,083
I can draw up some morphine.

663
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,724
- No, no, no, no!
- I don't want any pain meds.

664
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,089
I don't want to be loopy.

665
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,751
You couldn't just pretend?

666
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,026
I'm sorry?

667
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,278
I think you're my wife for two seconds.

668
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:41,738
You couldn't just, you know,
roll with it?

669
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,489
Eli, I can tell you're in
a great deal of pain...

670
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,620
- You worry too much.
- Anybody ever tell you that?

671
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,488
Look, I'll sign whatever
papers you want.

672
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:53,044
No morphine, no more tubes.
Just... Okay?

673
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:54,801
Until my wife, Elyse,
gets here, all right?

674
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,652
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, good.

675
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:58,279
Dr. Bailey's hovering.

676
00:28:58,441 --> 00:28:59,848
Unless I'm imagining that, too.

677
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,872
- I'm sorry about that.
- She can come in if she wants.

678
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,330
She's fine where she is.

679
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,945
You don't like her.

680
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:07,518
She's my boss.

681
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,488
She's a good one, I can tell.

682
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,245
She was a good doctor to me, too.

683
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:14,696
You don't think so?

684
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,800
Well, she prescribed the antibiotics,

685
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,219
- and now the antibiotics...
- Yeah, she was trying to save me

686
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:19,674
from an unnecessary surgery.

687
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,472
She made a mistake.

688
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:26,487
Is that what you're saying?

689
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:28,069
Had you had the surgery...

690
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:31,166
I wouldn't be
raw hamburger right now?

691
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:36,932
Okay. So you're mad at her,

692
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,705
- hmm?
- Okay, I'm sorry, I...

693
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:44,121
I didn't mean for you...
That was unprofessional of me.

694
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,440
- I apologize.
- Okay. So...

695
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,506
Spill.

696
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,830
Come on. Give me the goods.

697
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,010
Tell me the dirt,
tell me the skinny.

698
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:55,088
Dr. Kepner.

699
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,604
You really think I can't tell
when someone's in pain, too?

700
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:02,729
That's not...

701
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:04,873
You don't have to worry
about that...

702
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,642
So, what, I should worry
about my wife not getting here

703
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,494
before I pass out?
Or the fact that my skin

704
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:12,206
is... giving up being actual,
you know, skin?

705
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,346
I can give you morphine

706
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,682
- and...
- No, no, listen, listen, the Talmud says

707
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:18,213
if someone is sick or in need

708
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:20,962
and you can take away
1/60th of their pain,

709
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,325
then that's goodness.
That's God.

710
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:27,706
You can't take away
a 60th of something

711
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,531
if you don't know what it is.

712
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:30,729
That's not your job.

713
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,822
It is exactly my job,

714
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:35,143
and I prefer to do it
till the bitter end.

715
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:38,699
Come on. You're not gonna deny
a dying man's wish?

716
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,236
- You're not...
- Aren't I?

717
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:46,041
Dr. Kepner, I've held enough
dying men's hands in my career.

718
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:48,876
I know it's mine this time.

719
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:51,948
I am sorry, Eli.

720
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,582
Don't be sorry.
You're doing your job.

721
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:55,236
Just let me do mine.

722
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,232
I'm not...

723
00:30:58,299 --> 00:30:59,567
I...

724
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:01,302
I'm fine.

725
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,098
I don't... I don't need anything.

726
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,927
- What?
- You're a terrible liar. I like that.

727
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:11,894
All right, fine.

728
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:13,081
What's that saying?

729
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:15,941
"If... If I'm not for myself,
who will be for me?"

730
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,522
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I am

731
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,721
taking care of myself, for once.
That's all.

732
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,047
Oh, and you realize that
that phrase

733
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,174
is not an invitation
for narcissism, right?

734
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:25,236
You're calling me a narcissist?

735
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:26,872
Sure you don't want more pain meds?

736
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,390
- It'll knock you right out.
- I don't blame you.

737
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:29,524
You know, it's human nature.

738
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:32,700
You face enough hardship,
then you can't help but think

739
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,129
that you're being punished,

740
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:36,355
that
you did something to deserve it.

741
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:38,158
I did nothing to deserve...

742
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:46,701
Okay. My whole life,
I followed His rules.

743
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,410
I studied, I believed,

744
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,779
I practiced what I preached.

745
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,783
I did every single thing
He asked of me.

746
00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:57,180
And that guarantees you...
what?

747
00:31:57,788 --> 00:31:58,860
Excuse me?

748
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,783
Well, where... where...
where is the guarantee?

749
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,738
In the sequel? 'Cause, I have to admit,

750
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:03,894
I'm not as up on that
as I used to be.

751
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,205
If by the sequel,
you mean the

752
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:06,747
- New Testament, that's pretty funny.
- No, no, where... where is it written

753
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:08,663
exactly that
if you do this or that,

754
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,083
that everything in your life's
gonna be good, hmm?

755
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,447
Nowhere, in any faith,
is there a guarantee.

756
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,486
I'm not asking for everything
to be good all the time.

757
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:19,174
- But fair... I think that I...
- Fair?

758
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,948
Was it fair when Isaac went blind

759
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:22,450
and then his child betrayed him?

760
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:25,057
And where was the fairness
when Sara had to wait 99 years

761
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:27,515
before she had a child,
and God said, "Sacrifice him"?

762
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,651
And Moses couldn't even get
past the bouncer

763
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:30,816
to the Promised Land.

764
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:32,231
And like I said,
I'm not up on the sequel,

765
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,440
but from what I hear,
Jesus got a raw deal.

766
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:36,778
- Oh, I...
- Nobody in the Bible

767
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:40,628
lived a life free of suffering
or injustice,

768
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,153
or it wouldn't have been a best seller.

769
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,932
And if they lived lives like that,

770
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:47,194
why should ours be diff...
different?

771
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,965
Here we go.

772
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,286
Now, if people only believed
in God when things were good,

773
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:59,654
I guarantee you,
after the Holocaust,

774
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,793
not a single Jew
would be a believer.

775
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:03,693
Okay. Well, see,

776
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,066
now you mention
the Holocaust,

777
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:06,958
and anything
I say after that makes me...

778
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,711
- A narcissist?
- I was gonna say jackass, but...

779
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,831
Okay, come on.

780
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,613
Deep breath. Please, deep breath.

781
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:15,082
There you go.

782
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,258
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

783
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,291
Faith wouldn't be real faith...

784
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:26,660
if you only believe when things are good.

785
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,879
Well, so, what?

786
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:36,341
The world is just
cruel and random,

787
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,356
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it?

788
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,614
Look, I don't have a lot of time here.
Do you mind if I just skip to the part

789
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,356
where I pretend I don't know
what to tell you?

790
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:43,895
I'm just gonna tell you, okay?

791
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,597
- Okay.
- You sound like a child.

792
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,630
- What?
- Terrible things happen.

793
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:51,139
Terrible, wonderful,
devastating things happen.

794
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:53,083
Who the hell are you
to know why?

795
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,380
Who are you to know
why some people live

796
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:58,582
- and some people die?
- Children die.

797
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:00,817
Children who didn't do
anything wrong,

798
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:02,861
children... who were broken

799
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,798
before they had a chance to be whole,

800
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,762
who were climbing
in their own front windows.

801
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,800
Right. And you don't get to know
why any more than...

802
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,985
than I get to know why I'm dying

803
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:15,016
from taking a pill that saves lives,

804
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:18,863
that saves... nearly everyone's life...

805
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,662
but it's killing me.

806
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:24,402
So you can either
believe in God and goodness,

807
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,601
or you can believe
it's pointless, it's cruel,

808
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:28,121
and it's random...

809
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:32,773
whatever makes you happier.

810
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:34,847
Are you?

811
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,916
Happy?

812
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,592
It's not narcissism.

813
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,918
Then what is it?

814
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:49,103
- I don't know.
- Pain.

815
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,199
Unimaginable pain.

816
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:57,813
Yeah, I know the feeling.

817
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:07,543
God's not indifferent to our pain.

818
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:12,410
Listen, tikkun olam.

819
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,706
Tikkun olam means...

820
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,880
that the world
is full of brokenness...

821
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:23,216
and it's our job to put it
back together again.

822
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,349
It assumes...

823
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,122
that the world...

824
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:35,125
is, uh, broken
and in need and in pain.

825
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,836
And it's our job...

826
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:43,389
to fix... f-fix it.

827
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:47,850
Eli, let me... let me
give you some more morphine.

828
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:51,186
I can... I can take away the pain.

829
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,028
1/60th of your pain. I can do that.

830
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:56,191
Please... let me.

831
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,952
You already did.

832
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,866
Oh, and listen... tell...

833
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,850
Will you tell Dr. Bailey I forgive her?

834
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,523
Okay? You'll... You'll tell.

835
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:09,733
You'll tell her, right?

836
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:12,038
Eli... Eli, no.

837
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:14,367
You have to hang on
just a little bit longer.

838
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,428
Elyse is on her way.
She's on her way.

839
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:17,545
Elyse? Elyse is here?

840
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,439
She'll be here any minute.

841
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,552
Elyse.

842
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:26,790
I... I love you...

843
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:28,046
Okay.

844
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,744
Okay, Eli.

845
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:30,946
Okay.

846
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:33,367
Oh, Elyse.

847
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,224
Eli, I'm here.

848
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,116
I love you.

849
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,975
I'm right here.

850
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,163
I love... I love...

851
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:53,182
Oh.

852
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:00,292
Oh.

853
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:25,694
What's the word, Dr. Grey?

854
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,914
You taking the front of the
canoe or you taking the back?

855
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,277
You making room for me
in that hammock of yours?

856
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,453
Sorry, Nick.

857
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,235
Plan B is... is never gonna happen.

858
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:45,962
Because I saved your kidney.

859
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,454
Pbht! You are...

860
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:49,626
Oh, my God. You are evil.

861
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,482
An evil, twisted...

862
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:53,693
Genius.

863
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,216
Genius.

864
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,500
You are.

865
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,193
You saved my life.

866
00:37:58,397 --> 00:37:59,615
I did.

867
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:03,279
Saved my whole damn life.

868
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:11,449
Teddy... Teddy, you're blowing
this way out of proportion!

869
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,126
I came here because I love you!

870
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:14,950
You came here because
your marriage is over,

871
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,448
and you're terrified of being alone!

872
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:18,020
- I'm not terrified...
- Oh, please!

873
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,456
You leave Beth for Cristina,

874
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:22,661
and then Cristina
for some random woman in a bar,

875
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,230
and then you go back to Cristina,

876
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:27,191
and then you go to Amelia
to soothe your pathological need

877
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:28,880
to be coupled up
so that no one sees

878
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:31,154
- how sad and empty you are!
- You're the one who's scared.

879
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:33,568
- I'm not scared!
- You always have been.

880
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:35,933
Deep down, you're terrified
to be... be happy.

881
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:37,693
I mean, sure, you're fine
to marry the dead guy,

882
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:39,236
but when you have love...
real love...

883
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:40,731
staring you in the face,
you run!

884
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,327
You don't ever get
to talk about Henry.

885
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:43,854
Do you understand me?

886
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,919
I am not scared.

887
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:49,263
Please, it's what you do.
It's what you've always done.

888
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:51,630
It's the reason you can't make
a real relationship work.

889
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:54,914
You'd rather burn it all to
the ground than risk being hurt!

890
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:57,371
Maybe because all you ever do
is hurt me, Owen!

891
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:59,839
You string me along for years

892
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,668
with these
half-baked declarations,

893
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,825
and then you marry other women.

894
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:05,543
And then you fly halfway across
the world to my doorstep,

895
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,488
and you convince me
that this is real,

896
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:08,884
that you're in this with me,

897
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:10,982
that you love me,
that you want <i>me!</i>

898
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,775
And it has never, ever,
ever been about me!

899
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,201
I do love you!

900
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:17,352
I want you.

901
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,669
And then, when you have me,
when you really have me,

902
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:21,441
and you have me believing
that you mean it,

903
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,816
I find out that 24 hours earlier,

904
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:26,846
your ex-wife, who you just
screwed, told you to!

905
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:29,396
I am done
being your fallback.

906
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:31,755
I am done being
your damn sloppy seconds.

907
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:33,832
I'm not your consolation prize!

908
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,692
Teddy, please. Please, Teddy,

909
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,138
just look at me...
look at me. Please.

910
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:41,870
Don't do this.

911
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,732
You know, the snow?

912
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,331
It wasn't for the soldiers.
It was for you.

913
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:53,958
I did it for you.

914
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,337
I just knew you loved Christmas,

915
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:58,066
and I, uh... I just wanted, uh...

916
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,652
I did it for you.

917
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,623
I'm done, Owen. We're done.

I do not.

00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:13,277
Long day?

945
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:15,796
I saved a transplant surgeon today.

946
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:17,284
Mm.

947
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:23,136
He was smart and funny.

948
00:42:23,205 --> 00:42:24,212
And?

949
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,383
Hot.

950
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:27,089
And, so, what? He's married?

951
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,180
Nope.

952
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,373
- Gay?
- Lives in a foreign country?

953
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,738
Minnesota.

954
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,081
Same difference.

955
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,069
So what's the problem?

956
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:38,768
No problem.
He was just my patient.

957
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,972
So he's smart, funny, and hot, and...

958
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,508
My patient.

959
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:46,464
I really like the way my life is now.

960
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:47,773
I just...

961
00:42:48,726 --> 00:42:52,123
He made me feel something that
I haven't felt since Derek.

962
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:55,738
But... you're his doctor.

963
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,527
Is it really the worst thing

964
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:03,597
knowing it's out there
if you want it?

965
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:05,831
No, it's not the worst thing.
