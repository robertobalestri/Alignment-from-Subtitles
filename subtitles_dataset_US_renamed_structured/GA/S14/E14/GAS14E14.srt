00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,448
I miss sex.
Don't you?

36
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,496
My sex drive has become
my work drive.

excellent back massager.

Clive is nice. You know?
Like, it's more than sex.

I think I really like him.
I'm seeing him again tonight.

You're already at two nights in a row,
and you <i>think you like him?</i>

41
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:39,497
Well, my mom was the one
who always told me

42
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:40,949
whether
a guy was a keeper or...

43
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,040
A serial killer.

44
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,880
He's not a serial killer. He's too nice.

45
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,040
You know who says that?

46
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,909
Neighbors of serial killers.

47
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,518
We should meet him.

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,375
Judging boyfriends is
the number-one perk

49
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,147
- of having sisters with no sex lives.
- Tonight?

50
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:56,226
Sure. My thing with
Dr. Cerone doesn't go well,

51
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:57,703
I may just stay home

52
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:59,795
and get drunk
with my back massager.

53
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,957
I like this idea of a sister panel.

54
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:03,456
So, what? Dinner?

55
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,297
No, more casual.

56
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,303
- Game night.
- Game night?

57
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,010
And he'll have no idea
that the real game

58
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,281
is us judging him.

59
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:11,609
I'll spread the word.

60
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:18,314
Game night at Grey's place.
Sweet.

61
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,242
Pretty sure we weren't invited.

62
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,049
She's been like this a while.

63
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:27,361
Uh, I had some bad chicken salad
from the cafeteria.

64
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,392
- No, you didn't.
- Snitch.

65
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,954
I know you don't want it, but we
need to put in an NG tube.

66
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,133
- You need the nutrients.
- No, please. I-I hate that thing.

67
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,820
It hurts so bad, and I can't sing.

68
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:42,164
I'm sorry, but the anti-nausea
meds aren't working.

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,953
That's the only option.

70
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,469
I need you to get me some weed.

71
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,953
- Excuse me?
- I think she means marijuana.

72
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,955
Yeah, I know what she meant,
and the answer is no.

73
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,406
- But it's legal in Washington.
- When you're 18.

74
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,669
I'm talking about
medical marijuana.

75
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,013
- You've been Googling.
- There's an oil. It won't get me high.

76
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,548
All I need is authorization
from the hospital

77
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,406
and my primary physician.

78
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,219
It eases the pain, nausea.

79
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,367
It's been shown to
help patients on chemo.

80
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,644
With PTSD.

81
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,215
Look, it's not regulated
or approved by the FDA.

82
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,830
- Was this your idea?
- No, it was my grandma's.

83
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,087
- Is he still alive?
- He's not just alive.

84
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,025
He's freaking celebrating
that he's alive!

85
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,562
Don't anthropomorphize the mouse.

86
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,781
Okay, well, <i>I</i> am celebrating
that he is alive.

87
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:34,987
He should've been dead three days ago.
He has no liver!

88
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:37,601
- Why are you screaming at me?
- B-Because this is big.

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
I mean, we injected him with hepatocytes.

90
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,964
He grew mini livers,
and they're working,

91
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:42,578
and you are being way too calm.

92
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:45,184
Because it's only a big deal
if Cerone gives us the patent.

93
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:46,729
And we can't show him the mouse.

94
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,536
Because we used his polymer
without his permission?

95
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,667
Yeah, and if he sees
how well this is working,

96
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,942
he'll drive the price up
into the millions.

97
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,905
Okay, she is really peeing
on my parade today.

98
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,199
Cerone is dead.

99
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:00,011
And the parade is canceled.

100
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,450
- He's dead?
- Yeah. He, uh, died last week.

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,972
That's why they've been stalling.

102
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:05,760
So who's in charge of the patent?

103
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,830
His daughter.

104
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,407
That's who
you're meeting with today.

105
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:09,987
You couldn't have
led with that, Hellmouth?

106
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,053
What do we know about
the daughter?

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,962
Nothing.
I can't find anything online,

108
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,812
but you look amazing
in that dress.

109
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,142
Excuse me?

110
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,521
Nothing. Sorry. Nothing.

111
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,996
- Will this affect my hearing?
- Nope.

112
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,831
There's just a collection of blood in
your outer ear that needs draining.

113
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,844
I've never heard of coed rugby.

114
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,224
How long have you been playing?

115
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,324
Sarah doesn't play.
She's the manager.

116
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,535
Yeah, you're glad I don't.

117
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,262
- I'd crush you, Duran.
- Ha!

118

119
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,385
Oh, hey, no throwing
that ball in here, okay?

120
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,925
I, uh, have this heart thing
since I was a kid.

121
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,495
So, I was on the sidelines
when a ruck got out of control.

122
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,004
I don't need surgery, do I?

123
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:47,744
Nope, I'm gonna do this
right here.

124
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,425
I just gave you a field block
to numb your ear.

125
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:50,581
You shouldn't feel a thing.

126
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,081

152
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,207

For me to reattach the ear, yes.

164
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:36,333
Can it even be reattached?
That guy smooshed it.

165
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,425
That's fine.
Most ears are smooshed, anyway.

166
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,058
And once it's healed up,
you'll barely notice it.

167

00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,644
Sarah, this is Dr. Pierce.

She is our chief of cardio.

172
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,863
Sarah tells me she has
ventricular septal defect, so...

- Ooh, Dr. Lackman.

193
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,985

- Yeah. Yes. Yes.

Oh, no, no, not...
not an investigation... a study.

197

- It's a study.
- That's what I said.

198

Well, I know, but you also called

you know, sometimes, uh...

200
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,011
Um, it's a study.
It's a maternal mortality study

other developed countries.

There's your someone else.

221
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:40,008
Uh, pass. I'd like a doctor
who's older than me.

222
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:41,860
Well, we're a little short
on doctors today

223
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,227
'cause someone threw a ball.

224
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,766
So we're just gonna call this

Uh, now I need you to get a solid base

before you reduce that fracture.

230
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,749
I already lost an ear.
Hate to lose a foot.

231
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,326

- Hold up, Schmitt.

232

Kepner, can I, uh,

Um, so, I'm gonna take over, and
you can head home for the day.

234
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,921
- What?
- Chief's orders.

235
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,844
She's talking to legal, and they
said that you should stand down.

236
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,280
Wait. S... I'm...

237
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm getting suspended? Why?

238
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,719
Well, you cut a girl's ear off,
for starters.

239
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,788
It's only for the day.

240
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,477
Yeah, because a kid was throwing a ball

241
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,923
after I repeatedly told him to stop.

242
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,462
Yes, everybody knows that, and the
security video will affirm that.

243
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,306
- Okay, what's the problem, then?
- The problem is I heard it from Bailey,

244
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:27,529
she heard it from Webber,
and you never reported it?

245
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,336
- I...
- An accident in your ER...

246
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,999
resulting in a mangled patient

247
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:33,983
and an injured surgeon
could mean major lawsuits.

248
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,603
- And there's no incident report?
- No, I was gonna do it later.

249
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:36,950
- You don't mention it to me?
- I was working. I...

250
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:39,071
- What is going on, Kepner?
- You know, wh-what's going on

251
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,727
is that somebody broke the rules

252
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,290
and somebody else
is getting punished for it.

253
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,796
That's what's going on.

254
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,350
Okay, see that color there?

255
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,913
That's where your blood
is flowing through your VSD.

256
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,374
Still there.

257
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,595
They found it when I was 8.

258
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,555
But they said having a big surgery

259
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:00,174
would be riskier than just keeping it.

260
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:01,477
Well, it was back then.

261
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,524
Now I could use a catheter

262
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,264
to place a patch on the hole.

263
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:08,602
It's way less invasive,
which means way less risky.

264
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,664
Wait. What?

265
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,773
Just like that?
No open-heart surgery?

266
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,285
Nope.

267
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:16,016
Then my dad would let me play rugby?

268
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,594
Well, is your dad anti-rugby?

269
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,296
He's anti-me dying.

270
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:23,577
He made me quit because of my
heart, so I'm team manager.

271
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:24,821
But, I mean, after this,

272
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,054
I could totally get off the sidelines.

273
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,603
Could you fix it while you fix my ear?

274
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,579
No, it would have to be
two separate surgeries...

275
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:33,374
your ear first, and then your heart.

276
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,274
But I will assist Dr. Avery

277
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,352
with the vascular reconnections
on your ear,

278
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,772

while I'm there.

279
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,382
Hmm.

Th-The rates are climbing, you know,

708

and t-the procedures look like they're...

709
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:37,726
they're done out of convenience
more than medical necessity,

710
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:40,553

that some unnecessary C-sections

711
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:42,632
cause unnecessary complications.

712
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:45,304

broken down by doctor.

00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:26,924

- Yep!

874
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,526
- The, uh... it's, uh... the... the...
- Ee!

875
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:29,251

876
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,547
- Time!
- Yes!

877
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,969
No! No!

878
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,509
It's Heimlich <i>maneuver.</i>

879
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,736
And he didn't say it.

880
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,166
He didn't say it
when the timer went out.

881
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:37,970
Okay. I think he got it.
We can let that go.

882
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,078
No. No, no. No. No, no, no.

883

884
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,898
No. The card says "Heimlich
<i>maneuver,"</i> guys.

00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:45,017
See?

886
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:47,095
- "Heimlich maneuver."
- April.

887
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:50,336
No, don't...
don't "April" me.

888
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,048
There are rules, and the rules say

889
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,276
you have to finish before the timer.

890
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:54,761
Just like the rules to charades say

891
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:56,329
that you can't point to props.

892
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,962
You know, games have rules,
or they're not worth playing.

893
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,501
We can't have everything
just be chaos.

894
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,266
We can't have
everything be like a void.

895
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,962
You know, can we just, like, as people

896
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:08,447
agree on a code of conduct
and follow it?

897
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:09,680
Can we do that?

898
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,734
So that everything
isn't just meaningless?

899
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,924
So that we're not just like
a race of carnivorous viruses

900
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:15,244
just eating each other
and being eaten

901

Yeah, hi. I'm Maggie. I'm his girlfriend.

Um, we haven't really

00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,805

- I tracked your phone.

- You track my phone!
- 'Cause I know your M.O...

- Of course not.

921
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:13,283
- He's an excellent liar.
- Ah, come on.

922
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,565
All right, clearly this is something

923

her phone number.

No, you're not a homewrecker.

00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:34,462
