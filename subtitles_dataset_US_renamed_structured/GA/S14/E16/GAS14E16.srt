- Yeah.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,292
Hats off to you, too.

no-strings-attached thing...

10
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:27,398
it is like hidden treasure.

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,490
All of the fun,
none of the emotional baggage.

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,942
We should write a book.

13
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:33,690
We would make millions.

14
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:36,618

Okay.

00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:07,557
What do you mean,
the other shoe?

33
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,193
You know, like you saying
you wanted to have kids

34
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:10,376
and then
you don't want to have kids.

35
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,267
That was more like a boot
than a shoe.

36
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:13,981
Actually, it was more like
an ass kicking.

39
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,554
No strings.
No shoes.

40
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,061
We can
start work on that book.

41
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:28,192

42
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:34,959
Hey, Sofia?
Sofia!

43
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,505
I've got three fluffy pancakes
patiently waiting for you.

44
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:39,820
What...
Hey, why aren't you dressed?

45
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,244
- I put out your red shoes.
- I don't want my red shoes.

46
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,898
Okay, well, at this point, I'll
settle for any shoes at all,

47
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,604
so let's just put on...
let's put on shoes.

48
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,211
What's wrong? Hey. What?

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,726
What, are you sick?
Does your tummy hurt?

50
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:49,880
- No.
- Okay, great.

51
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,105
Then let's get up
and get dressed, okay?

52
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:52,726
'Cause I have a huge day
at work, and you have school.

53
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,373
So, what do you want first?
You want the shirt?

54
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,381
You want pants?
You want... Hey.

55
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,892
Whoa.

56
00:01:58,362 --> 00:01:59,429
Hey.

57
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,481
What's the matter?

58
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,174
You can tell me.

59
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,964
I want to go to New York.

60
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:10,446
With my friends
and my other teacher

61
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,625
who lets us draw
in our notebooks.

62
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,936
- And...
- And you miss your mommy, too.

63
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:19,500
Sweetheart,
hey,

64
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,045
why don't you come
to work with me today?

65
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,630
Okay? All right,
come on.

66
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,893
All right.

67
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:31,466
You paged.

68
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,319
I paged.

69
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,116
Do you need help
looking for something?

70
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,748
You know what? I did.
But I think I see it now.

71
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:41,601
Mmm.

72
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,211
Does this door have a lock?

73
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,636
Mnh-mnh. I don't think so.

74
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:48,163
Maybe we should find a room
with a door with a lock.

75
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,606
I don't have time for that.
I got a vagina to build.

76
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,463
- My vaginoplasty for the contest.
- Right.

77
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,235
That surgery's today
with my mom and Richard.

78
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,598
Wow.
Some families do puzzles.

79
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,753
It's okay. Tonight.

80
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,758
Tonight I say
we cancel the reservation

81
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,119
and have dinner at my place.

82
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:08,080
I got a lot of doors
and a lot of locks.

83
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:10,177
- That sounds perfect.
- Oh, good.

84
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,155
Yes.

85
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,588
Hey!

86
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

87
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:18,863
Hello.

88
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,535
- We should...
- Uh...

89
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:22,717
Yep.

90
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,048
Um, good luck
with your vagina.

91
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,213
Don't...

92
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,983
I'm just gonna...
Excuse me.

What are you doing?

96
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,096
All this stuff has
to get cleared out.

97
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,043
That centrifuge that we stole
from oncology...

98
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:46,254
that should go back.
And do you and Alex want a mouse?

99
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,741
No. No, no, no, no, no.

100
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,158
The mouse stays.
I have news.

101
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,482
I have great news.

102
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:52,560
Oh. You got engaged, right?
Congratulations.

103
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:56,103
No. No, no, no, it's...
I mean, yes. Thank you. But...

104
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,766
No, no, no, no.
I was up all night.

105
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,342
I found seven polymers that could replace

106
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,399
the one that hag Marie Cerone
stole from us.

107
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,207
And I know she's your aunt or
whatever, but she's still a hag.

108
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,783
Jo, let it go.

109
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,358
We're outsmarted, outgunned, outfunded.

110
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:12,726
Even if we won the stupid contest,
she's way ahead of us.

111
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:16,224
No. Okay, if you could just
look at any of these...

112
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:17,645
Hey, you,
where are all the interns?

113
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:18,979
Trauma Certification with Hunt.

114
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,074
Ugh.

115
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,995
I have a massive crush injury being
helicoptered in from Spokane

116
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,936
and no one to teach about
massive crush injuries.

117
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,661
- Take her, please.
- No!

118
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,807
Yeah, you'll do.
With me.

119
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,357
Meh!

120
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,308
<i>Dr. Boraff to the cap lab.</i>

121
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,659
<i>Dr. Boraff to the cap lab.</i>

122
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,158
Ah, good for you.

123
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,117
I always said you should
find more friends.

124
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,948
Uh, these are for...

125
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,582
I know. So, speaking of dummies,

126
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,009
you know that thing
you said earlier

127
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,961
about wanting and then not wanting kids?

128
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,492
You realize I had a brain tumor
at the time, right?

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,928
Yeah, okay. That's true,

130
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,230
but... you can't blame everything
on the tumor.

131
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,829
No, I sort of can because of

132
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,420
the massive, heaping ball
that was pressed on my cerebrum.

133
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:01,696
Okay, I thought you said
we were cool.

134
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:03,914
Oh, I'm cool.
No. I am the coolest.

135
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,264
But, you know, even with the tumor,

136
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,961
I still never cheated
on anyone.

137
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,754
- Whoa. Wait.
- Good luck with your show.

138
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,310
Hey.

139
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,992
Please let me run this thing
with you.

140
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,446
Or... Or I could run it
for you.

141
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,547
Without you. Just...
Just please let me run it.

142
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,773
DeLuca's on board to help.
We're good.

143
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,255
I said please!

144
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,002
Fine. Breezeway in 10 minutes.

145
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,213
Okay.

146
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,765
Wow.

147
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:30,600
And it turns out this woman
had an ax to grind with Ellis Grey.

148
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,335
So, Dr. Grey's dropping out
of the contest?

149
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,570
She's not giving us her patent,
so Dr. Grey is just quitting.

150
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,915
- It sucks.
- It does.

151
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:39,728
But it does improve the odds
for my "AnalGlide."

152
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,443
- Hmm?
- I'm trying out names

153
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,904
for my colonoscopy device.

154
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,242
Anal... No?

155
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,463
Mnh. Mnh.

156
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,586
Hello.

157
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,096
I'm Chief Miranda Bailey.

158
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,887
This is Dr. Jo Wilson.

159
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,652
Please, uh, present.

160
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,721
Marjorie Kersey. 66.

161
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,733
Sustained blunt trauma
to the abdomen and chest

162
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:59,164
four days ago when
a 22-foot test apparatus...

163
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,755
Electromagnet.
Big-ass electromagnet.

164
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,164
Fell onto her.

165
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,066
Hospitalized
at a community center,

166
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,743
where her clinical course was complicated

167
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:09,083
by rhabdo and
acute kidney injury,

168
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,003
all resolving, but...

169
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,367
- Marge Kersey?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,175
Has recurrent abdominal pain.

171
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,030
Transferred here
for consultation.

172
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,422
"Bargin' Marge" Kersey?
The astronaut?

173
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,127
- Okay. Here we go.
- Oh, my God.

174
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:24,385
This woman has clocked
over 1,000 hours in space.

175
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:27,866
- In space!
- Oh, my Lord, we have a nerd!

176
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,190
Oh, I'm a huge fan.

177
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,728
But y-you won the Fundamental
Physics Prize twice.

178
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:35,617
I know, hon. I was there.

179
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:38,224
Oh, oh, is that like
the Nobel Prize?

180
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,361
Ahh! The Nobel Prize wishes.

181
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:44,169
Oh, Dr. Kersey, well,
it is an honor to meet you

182
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,007
and a privilege to treat you.

183
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,226
Are you rhyming on purpose?

184
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,108
I... What?
No.

185
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:53,021
I... I've followed you
since I was a little girl.

186
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,882
You are a trailblazer.

187
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,810
Oh, my gosh,
thank you, hon.

188
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,384
I hope you're prepared to blaze
a trail

189
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,552
through my intestine or whatnot.

190
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,890
Of course.

191
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,937
Hey, um, what were you
working on, if I can ask?

192
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,274
- Can you say?
- I can say.

193
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:13,496
Um, it's a temporal variance
spectrometer.

194
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:18,346
It'll detect time-space changes
in the Higgs Boson field

195
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,842
and will eventually
control it.

196
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:26,808
It sounds like...
Are you building a time machine?

197
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,010
Wow. You really are a nerd.
I'm impressed.

198
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,245
A-A time machine?
Are you serious?

199
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:34,422
You're building a time machine
for... for NASA.

200
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:37,091
Oh, no, I parted ways with NASA
years ago.

201
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,312
I'm building it for me,
so I can travel to the future.

202
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,367
Yeah!

203
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:47,259
- So cool.
- Uh-huh.

204
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,997
So, your temporal variance spectrometer,

205
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,757
what, creates a wormhole?

206
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,189
No, no, that's a guy
in South Africa.

207
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,860
He wants to send
little "beep-boop" signals

208
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,578
through time dilation.

209
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,312
I want to send people.

210
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,681
Sending people through time?
That seems, uh...

211
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,867
- Bananas?
- Yeah.

212
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,102
Apparently, NASA thought so, too.

213
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,196
Stop.

214
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,212
Uh, hey, uh, why do you have me
set up for a head CT, anyway?

215
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,329
You looking for a tumor?

216
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:17,726
Yeah, uh...

217
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:19,929
Okay. No. Hold still.

218
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,603
Just covering our bases.

219
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,228
It's fine.
You're not the first ones

220
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,165
who've looked at me
like I'm bat-crap crazy.

221
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,968
- You won't be the last.
- See? I told you.

222
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,244
- Shh!
- I'm not the only one.

223
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,526
You're fine.

224
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,008
Big day, Mother.

225
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,562
You ready?
Anything, uh, bothering you?

226
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:37,735
I haven't said a word.

227
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,220
You don't have to.
Your face did.

228
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,978
My face isn't saying anything.

229
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,493
Richard,
is my face saying something?

230
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,281
It's like reading
Hemingway, dear.

231
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,039
Ahh.

232
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,523
Good morning.

233
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,485
- Mwah!
- Good morning, doctors.

234
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:53,892
- Ah, good morning.
- Morning.

235
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,188
You opening a flower shop?

236
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,079
Yeah.
They're from my boyfriend.

237
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,757
He thinks he's hilarious.

238
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,523
Sent me a book of
Georgia O'Keefe prints, too.

239
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,640
I never dreamed
this day would come.

240
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,431
And I certainly never dreamed

241
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,884
that a mother and son
would build my vagina.

242
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,134
And father.

243
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:11,002
Stepfather, about a...
about a year and a half.

244
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,203
- So... no offense.
- Mm.

245
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,571
Uh, none taken.

246
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:17,039
Well,
family is family is family.

247
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:18,797
Like the saying goes.

248
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,735
That's not a saying,
but okay.

249
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,612
- Not to you, it's not.
- No one's ever said it.

250
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,859
Is everything okay?

251
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,204
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

252
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:31,181
Because part of me feels like a
little kid on Christmas morning.

253
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,914
But the other part is
a world-class physician

254
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,313
who knows you're dealing with

255
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:36,999
the most sensitive organ
in the body.

256
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,696
I can't afford any distractions.

257
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,048
Michelle, I hear you.

258
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,617
Let me assure you
that my mind is not

259
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:43,836
anywhere but right here,
in this surgery.

260
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,375
Shall we do this?

261
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:47,718
Yes.

262
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,284
Let's do this.

263
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah.
Oh, all right, bring it in. Nice.

264
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:55,820
- Ohh.
- Hey.

265
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,915
Oh, wow,
this is where the party is.

266
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,172
Dr. Robbins.
Who is the new intern?

267
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:01,759
This is my daughter, Sofia.

268
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,712
And this must be
the infamous Noah.

269
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,228
It sure is. Noah, honey, say hi.

270
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,539
- Hi.
- Hi.

271
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,275
Liz, when did the pain
start and where?

272
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,798
I was on my way to his school.
It's here in my lower back.

273
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:11,900
Is it stabbing or shooting?

274
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:13,339
- No. More like pressure.
- All right.

275
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,532
Um, hey, Noah,
can you come over here

276
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,088
and sit on the chairs
while I give your mom an exam?

277
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:19,313
- Want to see my robot monster?
- 'Kay.

278
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,290
He's a full-blown prodigy,
and I'm definitely not biased.

279
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,579
Well, it has been a while

280
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,182
since I've heard Sofia
laugh like that.

281
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,478
Noah seems to laugh a lot.

282
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,718
Yeah, he's always been
a happy kid.

283
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:33,389
Good.

284
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,156
All righty.

285
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,398
Let's see...

286
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:39,326
- Okay.
- What we got going on.

287
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:40,924
You're gonna feel a little bit
of pressure.

288
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,298
Okay.

289
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,679
You said I could carry to term.

290
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,657
Liz, you have
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,

291
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,525
so I said that we would try
to get you to term.

292
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,103
But I'm a... I'm a little worried

293
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,447
that you have
an incompetent cervix.

294
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,235
Well, that sounds... rude.

295
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:58,462
Well your uterus
is putting pressure

296
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,893
on your cervix, causing it to open.

297
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,376
And then your amniotic sac
is bulging through.

298
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,260
And the monitor shows that you
might be having contractions,

299
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,196
so let's admit you and let's try
and stop them.

300
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,446
Contractions?
But she's only 23 weeks.

301
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,994
Right. That's why I'm gonna do
everything I can

302
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,877
to make sure that she stays
exactly where she is.

303
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,899
Hey, should I start
freaking out now?

304
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,900
No, because that would be
neither helpful nor necessary.

305
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,262
Hey, Noah,
can you come, um,

306
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,130
hang out with your mom for a second?

307
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,711
Hey, honey.

308
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,235
Um, okay, uh,
I will see you soon.

309
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:28,306
- Okay.
- All right.

310
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,914
Yeah. See you.

311
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:35,570
Oh, hey. Hey.

312
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,791
There you are.
What are you doing?

313
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,195
Packing it in. You okay?

314
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,696
No. Something happened.

315
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,917
What's wrong?

316
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,172
Are you quitting the contest, too?

317
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,626
Uh, no.
I was making out with Jackson,

318
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:50,093
and we got caught by his mother
and my... and Richard.

319
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,273
I mean, we're all fine.
We're all adults.

320
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,713
And Richard isn't even really my dad,

321
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,673
but I suddenly feel like
he is my father.

322
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,626
And I... I feel like I felt
when I was 15,

323
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:00,929
and when I was 15, I was 12.

324
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:02,874
Jackson?

325
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:05,079
Oh, crap, I didn't tell you about that.

326
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:07,057
Wait a second. You're dropping
out of the contest?

327
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,632
Marie Cerone wanted me to
rename the Grey Method

328
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,398
the Grey-Cerone Method and...

329
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,134
That's crazy.

330
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:15,079
Yeah. I couldn't do it.
That would kill Ellis.

331
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,938
And I've already watched her die
once, so...

332
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:20,062
Uh, well, you can't let her
take this away from you.

333
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,149
I won't let you.

334
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,979
No, Maggie. Stop. It's fine.
Listen, you've never

335
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,729
had your hopes and dreams
crushed by our mother,

336
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,024
but for me it was an annual
occurrence, so, really.

337
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,874
I'm pissed, but I'll get over it.

338
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,078
Ugh. I got to go.
Consult.

339
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,922
But Jackson... You're...
You're... Jackson?

340
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:38,023
Oh, yes, I'm seeing Jackson,
and it's wonderful.

341
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,041
We haven't had sex yet,
but I hope we will tonight,

342
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,283
so... Oh, I won't need a ride home.

343
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,384
Okay, bye.

344
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:44,476
Wow. Okay.

345
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:47,398
Welcome to Trauma Certification.

346
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:52,556
Moments ago, a Cessna has
crashed into a Greyhound bus.

347
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,492
The EVAC helicopter is on its way.

348
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,744
Yeah, yeah, maybe somewhere else.

349
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,985
No, not here. What happened here is that

350
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,103
the EVAC helicopter also crashed
and is up in flames right now.

351
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,252
All right, people are dying.

352
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,440
It is your job to their lives.

353
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:05,735
What are the rules?

354
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,968
This is real life, Bloodbank.

355
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,757
In a harsh and
uncaring world,

356
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,976
the only rule is
there are no rules.

357
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,609
People are bleeding!
People are dying!

358
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:17,987
Go! Go! Go!

359
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,220
Why aren't you moving?

360
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:21,570
Let's go. Hustle.

361
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:22,860
Grab a body.

362
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,423
Work on your patient.

363
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,888
Get to work.

364
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,796
I want to see hustle.

365
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:37,405
There's air in the biliary system.

366
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:38,781
Wilson, thoughts?

367
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,374
Probably a fistula from
the liver to the duodenum.

368
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,555
We'll have to ligate.

369
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,374
Good. Uh,
do we need to open the chest?

370
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:49,703
No. I can treat the abscess
by infusing TPA and DNase

371
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,048
through the chest tube
while you're in there.

372
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:52,850
Well, her brain scan is clear.

373
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:54,742
And it's a sexy brain.
She's 66?

374
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,023
Oh, well, if you believe her,

375
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,008
then she's 166
'cause she's a time-traveler.

376
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,219
Time travel?
Like wormholes?

377
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:02,728
Exactly!

378
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,492
- What are we looking at here?
- Oh, wait. "Wormhole"...

379
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,468
that's a great name for your device!

380
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,758
Bailey is looking for names
for her... colon thingy.

381
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:11,836
No, I'm not.

382
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:13,265
"Ass Gasket"... that's a good one.

383
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,141
God, if I could
go back in time.

384
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,523
No, you can't.
Time doesn't go backwards.

385
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,023
Read your Einstein, Einstein.

386
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,486
The men I would not have
slept with.

387
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,147
- And the one woman I would have.
- "Crack Jack"?

388
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,324
I would go back
and undo this morning.

389
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,992
Well, I would... I would
kill Hitler and end slavery,

390
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,842
and then I would go
straight to this morning.

391
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,141
Oh, no, wait. I would go back

392
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,648
and see what happened between
Ellis Grey and Marie Cerone.

393
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:35,836
"Fanny Spanner."

394
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,162
Karev, stop.

395
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:40,430
Hey, your patient's hypotensive,
hypoxic, and tachycardic.

396
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,751
- What did you do?
- So, we did bilateral chest tubes first.

397
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,564
There was no improvement,
so we checked for a JVD,

398
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,040
muffled heart sounds,
and pulsus paradoxus.

399
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,539
Good. Your patient's gonna survive

400
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,540
and fight for another five minutes.

401
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,867
Schmitt, your patient just
aspirated in his own blood.

402
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:53,326
Dead.

403
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,602
Hellmouth, your patient's pregnant.

404
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,969
He's a dude with a beard.

405
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:59,780
She's a bearded lady
and she's a mom

406
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,754
and her baby's just gone into
fetal distress.

407
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,756
- What do you do?
- Uh, I-I cut the... No, I use that...

408
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:05,895
Too late. Both dead.

409
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,375
- Kepner, Kepner.
- What?

410
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,444
They're not gonna learn
anything

411
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,860
if you keep killing their patients.

412
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,654
Pow! Piece of shrapnel
from the plane wing

413
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:14,710
just fell out of the sky
and into your boyfriend's body.

414
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:15,787
What now, Bello?

415
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:16,858
T-The plane wing hit me?

416
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,457
Oh, yeah!
Another plane is crashing.

417
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,801
- Who saw that coming?
- C-Can she do that to a doctor?

418
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,870
It feels like cheating.

419
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:23,715
You're hurt and bleeding,
DeLuca. Get down.

420
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,168
Ahh.

421
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:27,295
I said hurt and bleeding,
not hot and bothered.

422
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:28,373
Aaaaaah!

423
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,554
All right,
what are you gonna do, Bello?

424
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:30,631
Is she cheating?

425
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,748
Uh, Kepner, you got this?

426
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,249
- I need to step out for a few secs.
- Yep.

427
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:34,444
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Y-You're leaving us?

428
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:35,577
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I am.
- Hey, you can't talk.

429
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,193
You're bleeding from your femoral artery.

430
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:38,852
What's it gonna be...
him or the patient, huh?

431
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
Don't let lust cloud
your judgment.

432
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:42,076
What's it gonna be?
Hey, more pain!

433
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,452
- Aaaaah!
- More!

434
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,694
Aaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaah!

435
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:46,061
There you go.

436
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,114
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!
- There you go.

437
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,943
First I have to ask Dr. Shepherd
and Dr. Karev

438
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,232
some important questions, okay?

439
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,161
- How's it going, Rugrat?
- Hey, Dr. Alex.

440
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,325
I have a patient whose son
laughs all the time.

441
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:57,676
Is that bad? Because then
I've been doing this all wrong.

442
00:15:57,745 --> 00:15:59,980
No,
II had a case back in peds.

443
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,428
It's... It's uncontrollable laughing.

444
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,129
It sounds sort of hollow, peculiar.

445
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,026
- You're thinking H.H.?
- Gelastic seizures?

446
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,919
- What's a seizure?
- Oh, it's when...

447
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,706
It's when something's hurt
inside your brain.

448
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,149
Is Noah sick?

449
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,949
I thought his mommy was sick.

450
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,809
Hey, you got a sec?

451
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:17,098
Yeah.

452
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,676
- Um, so, can you see him today?
- Now?

453
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,370
Okay.

454
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,645
- I'm not a cheater.
- I never said you were.

455
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:27,201
You implied it.
I mean, I have cheated,

456
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,840
but that doesn't make me
a "cheater."

457
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:31,676
Ah, tomato, "tomahto," potato, adulterer.

458
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,785
Listen, you were the one
who told me to go to Teddy.

459
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:34,895
And you listened.

460
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:39,481
- What was I supposed to say?
- "Hey, Amelia. That sounds crazy.

461
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,270
Hey, Amelia.
Teddy and I aren't like that.

462
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,684
Hey, Amelia. I'm gonna be a good husband

463
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,020
and not cheat on you with
this woman I have history with."

464
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,431
You had options
because you, unlike me,

465
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,828
did not have a brain tumor.

466
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,200
Okay, that is not fair.

467
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,364
Isn't it?

468
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:56,520
Okay.

469
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,989
Teddy is my...

470
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,003
She's Teddy. She knows me.

471
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,642
And she's always been there
for me if I've needed her.

472
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:07,028
And tumor or not, you weren't.

473
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,614
So I didn't feel like
I was cheating on you.

474
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,142
When you told me to go to her,
it felt right.

475
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,458
And I'm sorry if that hurts,
but it is the truth.

476
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,095
Wow.

477
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:20,715
Our marriage didn't stand
a chance.

478
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:22,879
- What?
- Teddy.

479
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:24,848
She's your tumor.

480
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:29,403
What?

481
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,755
The Party is now
the world's worst hangover.

482
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:40,110
I, um... I pre-oxygenated the
patient, rapid-sequenced him.

483
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,907
And then I inserted an ET tube,

484
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,080
and then I checked the position
with a CO2 indicator.

485
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:45,985
I right,
Hellmouth's team is winning.

486
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:47,946
- The rest of you are losers.
- Hey!

487
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,948
Kepner,
is the hose really necessary?

488
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:52,666
Oh, you know what?
Whining doesn't save dying people.

489
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:56,369
Speaking of dying people,
your boyfriend's bleeding out, Bello.

490
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,752
Okay,
I apply a tourniquet

491
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:59,152
- onto his...
- No, no, no. ABCs, remember?

492
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,244
No. You're bleeding out.

493
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,910
- You can't help me.
- Well, I don't want to die.

494
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:04,978
You don't think
I understand you?

495
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,438
Spanish is pretty close to
Italian.

496
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:14,603
Kepner, what are you doing?

497
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:15,994
What? Oh.

498
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,025
I got rained on when
I did my Trauma Cert.

499
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,013
Yeah, because it was raining.

500
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:25,306
I don't like this game.
I don't like this game!

501
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:26,926
You're breaking them, Kepner.
Look, they're losing

502
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,644
- their minds.
- Hey, keep up those compressions,

503
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,681
Bloodbank!
You're losing her!

504
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,801
Damn it.
I got to go the ICU.

505
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,245
This was getting so fun.

506
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:38,115
Hey, make sure he doesn't
stop compressions.

507
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,294
There's no crying
in Trauma Cert!

508
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,587
Here you go.

509
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,315
It's okay. It's okay.

510
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:50,080
Just... Just breathe.
Just breathe.

511
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,248
She's gone. She's gone.

512
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:56,009
It's okay.
Just... Just breathe it out.

513
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:58,393
Then Dr. Webber
will use a laparoscope

514
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:00,361
to extract
a piece of the peritoneum.

515
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,837
Minimally invasive,
minimal scarring.

516
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:03,978
Thanks for
letting me know.

517
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:07,010
- Thanks for not hiding it from me...
- Mom, come on.

518
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,362
Like you've been hiding
Maggie Pierce.

519
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,399
Yeah, I get it.

520
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,393
Uh, let's talk about this later.

521
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:12,838
- Over pie.
- You know what? Yes,

522
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,043
I am seeing Maggie Pierce.

523
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,978
- And, no, it's none of your business.
- None of my business?

524
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,885
My love life isn't
any of your concern, no.

525
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,862
- It never was and never will be.
- What about your wife... April?

526
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,572
- You all work together all the time.
- Guys... - Ex-wife.

527
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,805
Of all the places on earth
for you to dip your wick,

528
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:24,916
- you chose...
- Out of line, all right?

529
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:26,330
- Come on. Oh, child, please.
- Guys!

530
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,774
- What?
- What?

531
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:31,273
Oh, now look
what you did.

532
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,622
- What I did?
- Yeah. You just did.

533
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,347
Michelle, stop.

534
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,936
Michelle, it's not what
it looks like, all right?

535
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,289
It isn't?

536
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:42,130
'Cause it looks like
my doctors

537
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,366
don't have their heads
in the game.

538
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,960
My mother's upset about
a personal matter.

539
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,872
- It's nothing, really.
- It's not nothing.

540
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,950
- Mom, come on.
- No.

541
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,301
Whatever happens in there,
I'm gonna leave here,

542
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,381
for better or worse,

543
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,052
with my life and body
permanently altered.

544
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,192
And I would rather it not
be for the worse.

545
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,771
So, whatever
this "nothing" is...

546
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,106
figure it out

547
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:01,938
because you're not
cutting into me

548
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,177
until I have your full attention.

549
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:08,161
♪♪

550
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:17,304
So, as your liver was healing,
a fistula developed,

551
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,581
uh, sort of
an accidental bridge

552
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,677
between the liver
and the small bowel.

553
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,882
- Sounds like a design flaw.
- It is.

554
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,511
We'll have to go in
and dissect it out.

555
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,242
Mm. Almost poetic, right?

556
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:31,195
I'm searching for ways
to make time bridges in space,

557
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,976
and one forms inside me.

558
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,398
Too bad I hate poetry.

559
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,593
See, I-I respect what you're doing,

560
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,843
but I worry about you
being out there all alone,

561
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,041
working with all that
heavy equipment...

562
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,172
- On a lunatic's errand.
- No...

563
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,539
Yeah. I get it.

564
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,015
I may never crack it.

565
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,312
But I never want to be
a person who says, "No."

566
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,251
Like, you say, "No,"
and you stop the future cold.

567
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,882
All you have is your past,
your mistakes, your regrets.

568
00:20:56,101 --> 00:21:00,226
But you say, "Maybe,"
and the whole world opens up.

569
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,172
The past is gone,

570
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:05,835
and there are a million futures
you can have.

571
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:08,479
Okay, Liz, I need you to

572
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:09,668
take deep breaths, okay?

573
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,437
Deep breaths slowly, slowly.

574
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,761
- She's scared, Mommy.
- I know, honey. I know.

575
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:17,531
I know you're scared.
I know you're...

576
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,054
It's just his laugh.

577
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,995
It's just a laugh. This is so stupid.

578
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,348
I shouldn't have
let them take him.

579
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,479
It's just an MRI.

580
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,323
There's no radiation.
He's not gonna get hurt,

581
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:26,808
and it's better to be
safe than sorry, right?

582
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:27,941
You couldn't wait?

583
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,245
You couldn't wait till I'm not
t-till my baby's not...

584
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,027
to tell me that
my son's laughter might be...

585
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:35,332
Liz, I really couldn't wait, okay?

586
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,362
I'm... I am so sorry,
but Noah's laughs...

587
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,284
if they are seizures,
every time that they happen,

588
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:42,473
they are doing damage
to his brain,

589
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,457
and I need those doctors to do
everything that they can

590
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,719
to make them stop them
immediately.

591
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,761
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I'm such a crybaby.

592
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,770
This mus
t be pretty scary for you, huh?

593
00:21:54,837 --> 00:21:57,079
All this grown-up stuff.

594
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,659
I just hope that
Noah's okay.

595
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:04,078
Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
I know... I know that it's really hard.

596
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,188
I know that it's really hard,
but if you move,

597
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,769
you could rupture the amniotic sac.
And if it ruptures,

598
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:09,101
- then I can't help your baby.
- Okay.

599
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,477
- Mommy.
- Stay still. I know, honey.

600
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:11,902
You know what, Ella,
can you please take her?

601
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,310
Ella, I need you to take Sofia.

602
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,806
Hey, book an O.R.
and get me some orderlies, okay?

603
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:16,248
Mommy, I want to stay with you.

604
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:17,546
Sofia, I need you to get out of here now!

605
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:19,003
- All right, Liz...
- Yeah?

606
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,996
I'm gonna lower your head, and
we're gonna take you to the O.R.

607
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:22,834
W-Wait. O.R.?
I need to see Noah first.

608
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,284
We don't have time.

609
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:27,846
It's gonna be okay, okay?

610
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,878
We got to move.
We got to move. Let's go!

611
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,971
Stop it.

612
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,137
If we can't get him to stay
still, we can't get a good scan.

613
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:41,315
Hey, Noah, what's orange
and sounds like a parrot?

614
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:42,995
A carrot!

615
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,167
You are zero help.

616
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:48,667
Noah, how do you get
a tissue to dance?

617
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,112
You put a little boogie in it.

618
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,167
I'm just trying to
hear his real laugh.

619
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:01,908
Okay, Noah, you and Dr. Karev

620
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,760
are gonna play
a game called Statue.

621
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:07,581
Whichever one of you moves first
loses.

622
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,042
Okay, Statue game.

623
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:13,454
Ready? One, two, three.

624
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:17,839
They're seizures, right?

625
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,003
Yeah.

626
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:22,362
Yeah, they are.

627
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,596
Did I win?

628
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,581
I don't know what was wrong
with that lawyer woman.

629
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,726
She was accomplished,
and she was attractive.

630
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:35,929
So is Maggie, Mom.

631
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,143
This is not a contest.

632
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,760
Oh, really? What is it?

633
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,315
Don't look at me.
I can't answer that for you.

634
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:44,392
Why not?

635
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:47,339
I don't understand why you're
not more upset over this mess.

636
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:48,849
Oh, I'm plenty upset.

637
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,385
- Thank you.
- You are?

638
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:52,167
Not with them, Catherine.

639
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:53,393
With you.

640
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,079
Excuse me?

641
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,034
Nothing's ever good enough
for your child.

642
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:58,774
I get it, that you have strong feelings

643
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,198
about who Jackson dates.

644
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:01,397
Any parent would.

645
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:03,159
This is not about Maggie.

646
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,657
No, it's not about Maggie...
because she's brilliant.

647
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:08,815
She's skilled, and she's kind.

648
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,245
And any mother in her right mind
would be elated

649
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,315
that she'd deign
to date their son.

650
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,440
- Damn!
- Don't "damn" me.

651
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,682
You have my blessing, son,

652
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,339
but if I hear that
you've hurt Maggie in any way,

653
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:21,536
I'm gonna come after you.

654
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:22,901
Damn.

655
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:25,525
Now, you two let me know if

656
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,324
we're doing this groundbreaking
surgery today or not.

657
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,119
In the meantime, I got patients.

658
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,018
Michelle.

659
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:43,923
Michelle, we want to apologize.

660
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,617
Michelle, we were out of line earlier.

661
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,771
We've settled our differences.

662
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,238
We're ready to get back to work
if you'll have us.

663
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,159
That's a load of crap.

664
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,379
What's it about?

665
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,104
No.

666
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:56,823
It's about a woman
he's seeing.

667
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:58,353
No, that's not Michelle's concern.

668
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,477
It's not even yours.

669
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:00,777
Is he dating garbage?

670
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,260
No. She's brilliant.

671
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,862
She's lovely. She's...

672
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,237
- And Mom thinks she's my stepsister.
- Oh.

673
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,270
- But it's not like
- we grew up together, okay?

674
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:10,065
We're... Didn't even meet
until we were adults. It's...

675
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,700
It's not that.
That's not even the main thing.

676
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,408
It's not about her.

677
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,518
Great. So it's about me.

678
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,448
It's about Richard.

679
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,849
When your father left,

680
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,557
I just closed off a part of my heart,

681
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,495
slammed the door, nailed shut...

682
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:27,581
until Richard Webber came along

683
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,495
and shook me like
I didn't know I could shake.

684
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,628
And when I saw you and Maggie today, I...

685
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:38,721
All I could think was,

686
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,207
"Richard is gonna take her side,
like I would take yours,"

687
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,792
like he just did.

688
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,612
Then what if
we can't reconcile that?

689
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:53,315
Jackson,
I want you to have love.

690
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:56,378
I just don't want it
to cost me mine.

691
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,247
Richard's not my father, Mom.

692
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:03,112
I know. He's my husband.

693
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:04,428
No. I'm saying

694
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,559
you should give him
a little more credit than that.

695
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:08,824
I've met my father.

696
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,096
Richard ain't him.

697
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:12,518
He's a lot better than that.

698
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,878
Okay. Good.

699
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,776
Now hug it out. Come on.

700
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,612
It's a shortcut between
two points in space.

701
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,151
You enter the wormhole,
space folds like a taco,

702
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,504
and then you come out
the other side.

703
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:32,647
And the other side is the past?

704
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:35,667
No, you can't travel
to the past, but...

705
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:38,871
"Yester-me" can come
meet "now-me,"

706
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,275
but "future-me" can't go back.

707
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:42,024
Okay, now-me has a headache.

708
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,574
Now-me wishes I could talk to
future-me about tonight.

709
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:45,753
Clamp.

710
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:46,917
What's happening tonight?

711
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:49,151
Oh, uh, n-n... Uh, nothing.

712
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:50,907
Funny story.

713
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,708
When I was little, I used to wish

714
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,167
I could go back in time
and meet my birth mother.

715
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,544
- Not me.
- Really? Never?

716
00:26:57,692 --> 00:26:59,008
Well, you were put up
for adoption.

717
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,432
I was left outside a firehouse.

718
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:02,300
- Fair enough.
- I'd meet your mom, though.

719
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,159
Ellis Grey was
this world-renowned,

720
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:05,923
award-winning surgeon
and...

721
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:10,011
Wait. What if
Cerone was an Ellis stalker?

722
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,112
Like... Like... Like a groupie,
like "Single White Female"?

723
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:14,933
Oh, no, no, no, no.

724
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,346
There's blood in her N.G. tube.

725
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:17,488
She's actively bleeding.

726
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:18,995
From where?
A ruptured vessel?

727
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,917
Or an ulcer or varices.

728
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:23,503
Oh, man.

729
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,035
Okay, I'm gonna need
to scope her.

730
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:31,143
Bring in the C-arm for an angio
and order 10 units!

731
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:42,191
Okay, the peritoneum is ready.

732
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:48,230
This tissue looks perfect.

733
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,495
Need a six-oh
on a driver, please.

734
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,423
That was beautiful work, dear.

735
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,864
Thank you.

736
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,823
You know, I really like her, Mom.

737
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,231
I know.

738
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,878
I like her, too.

739
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,472
And I want it to work between us.

740
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:13,457
But if it does all go to hell
with me and Maggie,

741
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,519
then you do have my blessing
to take her side.

742
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,612
Deal?

743
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:21,922
Deal.

744
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,194
So much bleeding.
I-I can't find the source.

745
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,556
Okay, Bokhee, contrast.

746
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,338
Good, good, good.

747
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:37,739
Oh, where are you? Where are you?

748
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,771
I wish I could go back in time
to before this happened.

749
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,012
- You can't go backwards...
- I know. I know.

750
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:43,373
There it is. There it is. See it?

751
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:46,387
Ah, yes, I will advance the catheter

752
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,464
and try to embolize the bleed.

753
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,214
I think Cerone was
telling the truth about Ellis.

754
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:52,649
We can't know for sure.

755
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:53,855
There's proof.

756
00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:55,206
I'm the proof.

757
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,294
Ellis didn't leave me
outside a firehouse,

758
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,668
but she did keep me a secret.

759
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,620
She lied to Richard.
She lied to Meredith.

760
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,942
If she's capable of doing that
to the people she loves the most,

761
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,339
you don't think she's capable of
screwing over a friend?

762
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:08,608
Oh, damn it.

763
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:10,683
Her B.P.'s bottoming out.

764
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:13,457
Okay, I can't
isolate this bleeder. Pierce?

765
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:14,802
No, there is still too much blood.

766
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,521
Okay, Wilson,
you have to help me out here.

767
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,575
Get in there and open up her stomach.

768
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:19,839
Okay. 10 blade.

769
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,308
Come on, Marge.

770
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,648
You want to see the future.

771
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,901
- Help me understand your logic, please.
- Owen, our marriage is over.

772
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,673
- There's no point in just hashing it...
- Amelia.

773
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:36,868
Okay. Fine.

774
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:38,946
You see this tumor?

775
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,602
Officially, it's benign.

776
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:42,930
No cancer.

777
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,917
But if we leave it in, it's
gonna kill this kid, anyway.

778
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:47,204
So, really, "benign"
is neither here nor there.

779
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,174
- I don't how this is...
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

780
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,247
So, you were never with Teddy.

781
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,932
You never played it out.
She was your friend.

782
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,712
She was your person.

783
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,164
Benign.

784
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,049
But always there,
quietly growing.

785
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:04,438
So, when you marry other women
and she's still there...

786
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,938
She's not benign.

787
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,444
She rejected me.

788
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:17,352
Because you were married, dummy.

789
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,636
And she's not as flawed as we are.

790
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,704
Wait. You are single now.
You're free.

791
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,308
And you can't get it together
to tell her how you feel?

792
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,720
What is stopping you?

793
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,815
Well, I kind of feel like
all we talk about

794
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,056
since our "no feelings" rule
is, uh, feelings.

795
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,347
Maybe it started
when we were breaking up.

796
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:38,589
Maybe that's why
I didn't notice.

797
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:40,251
- What?
- The baby's dad.

798
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:41,735
This baby's dad.

799
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,235
Mike.

800
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,688
We were gonna get married.

801
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,860
Noah was so happy
to have a dad.

802
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:50,579
He was so excited
to be a big brother.

803
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:55,220
But, uh, Mike would always
call Noah "your son"

804
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,391
and this one "our baby,"

805
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:00,463
like Noah was just
some piece of furniture

806
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:01,979
that I moved into his house.

807
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,384
"Our baby will be raised like this,"

808
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:07,477
and, "Your son should know
better than that."

809
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:09,290
I loved him.

810
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,735
But I knew that if I stayed,

811
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:16,250
I would have a husband,
but Noah would never have a dad.

812
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,712
So I left him.

813
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:22,118
And I cried every day for months.

814
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:27,470
And maybe
that's why I didn't notice...

815
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:31,727
when Noah's laugh changed.

816
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:37,173
- Liz...
- I just want to go back and notice.

817
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:42,792
Oh, God.

818
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,205
Checked back for wound,
placed pelvic binder,

819
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,852
transfused two units,

820
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,609
and ruled out
intra-abdominal bleeding.

821
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,838
She should be stable now.
Nice work, guys.

822
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,803
I'm back! I'm here!

823
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,884
Dr. Kepner, our patient with
the facial trauma survived.

824
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:58,886
How do you know that?

825
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:00,587
Oh, we tried nasal intubation,

826
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:02,955
but that was impossible in
the... weather conditions,

827
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,799
so we criked him,
and it worked.

828
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,696
- We established an airway.
- Who says?

829
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:08,430
Um... I say?

830
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,175
All right, well, I guess
I'll have to give it to you

831
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:14,738
since I was just paged
on a freaking goose chase.

832
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:17,423
No fair. He's the one who paged you.

833
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,383
What?

834
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,088
I realized that the thing that

835
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,190
was most endangering
our patients was you.

836
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,330
I figured, if I took you
out of the equation,

837
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,657
I neutralized the threat.

838
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,576
You tried to cheat the system.

839
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,161
No offense, Dr. Kepner,

840
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,026
but you did something similar
in your Cert.

841
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:38,924
The ambulance story is legendary.

842
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,652
No, I mean, I-I know.
That's why it's funny...

843
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,268
because...
because three months after

844
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,697
I cheated to get my Trauma Cert,

845
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:45,690
a car-crash victim
came in to this E.R.,

846
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,816
and guess what.

847
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,986
I-I couldn't save him.

848
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:51,595
Oh, my God.

849
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,753
He died right in front of me.

850
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:56,666
Dr. Kepner, do we need to
pause the exercise?

851
00:32:56,735 --> 00:32:58,352
No, no, no, no, no,
you can't pause

852
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:01,259
because in real life,
the trauma doesn't just stop!

853
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:02,872
God doesn't work that way.

854
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,635
Because you can do
every single thing right,

855
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,735
and still, people die.

856
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,033
Like, look, look.

857
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:10,342
This guy right here... this guy...

858
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,005
he was just, you know,
living his life, right?

859
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,052
He was applying to colleges,
and then one day...

860
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:17,215
bam! shot in the neck.

861
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:21,645
And then he's dead because,

Her husband was so happy.

866
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:31,020

And one second, she was fine,

867
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,590
