for choosing me today.

157
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,066
Well, I chose you because
you were the only one

158
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,100
who didn't suck up,
so don't ruin it now.

159
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:33,974
It's hard when your
reputation precedes you

160
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,138
and people only see you
in terms of "the legend."

161
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,606
Schmitt!

162
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,134

163
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,723

and you hand me things.

164
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,700
You don't get to talk

165
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,391
No, no! Not y-yours.
I meant mine.

166
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,983

glasses in a person.

168

Thick blood disease.

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,111
I'm the only kid in my class
who's had a stroke.

177
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,471
Frankie's pre-admitted
to reverse his anticoagulation

178
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,403
with vitamin K before surgery.

179
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,038
That means my blood is like Kool-Aid.

180
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,626
You gotta make it like Jell-O.

181
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,292
Okay, that was a nice job.

182
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:29,616
Um, just wait until his mom's
in the room next time,

183
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:30,793
'cause she'll have questions.

184
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,848
My mom's in the bathroom
putting on lipstick and stuff

185
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:33,996
for Dr. Alex.

186
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,989
- Oh.
- Is that right?

187
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,995
She talks about him
all the time.

188
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,898
She told my aunt
you're "stupid hot,"

189
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,565
but I said "stupid's" not nice.

190
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,442
Oh! You're all, um...

191
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:50,105
Sorry. I was just, um...

192
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,392
Hi, there.

193
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:58,120
♪♪

194
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:01,401
You are candy to
the scared single mom.

195
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,859
Why do you think
I got into peds surgery?

196
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,293
How's the new gig?

197
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,897
Oh, so good.
They're so scared of me.

198
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,348
- Really?
- No.

199
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,125
What do you think
their deal is?

200
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,280
I know.
It's like watching a deer

201
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,210
trying not to scare
another deer.

202
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,163
Or like a really bad
first date.

203
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:22,218
He's got like 25 years
on her, doesn't he?

204
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:24,370
Love is love is love.

205
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:26,272
No, you're right.
It's gross.

206
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,061
Dr. Avery?!
Uh, my father can't breathe!

207
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,835
Father!
That makes more sense.

208
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,936
Bilateral rales.
He's not moving any air.

209
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:38,838
- Get me an intubation kit!
- He's flatlining.

210
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,332
- Is he dead?! Did he die?!
- No, no, no. He's alive.

211
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,122
He's just having a little
trouble breathing. That's all.

212
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,710
That monitor's not working
right! Get him air!

213
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:49,915
Okay, ma'am!

214
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,908
I swear that poor lady
didn't hear a word I said.

215
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,511
- Bolus her with 250 of NS?
- On it.

216
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:59,305
So, Carina DeLuca, huh? That was fast.

217
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,851
I am newly single, Kepner. It's just fun.

218
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,722
- Kepner, she's coding!
- Crash cart!

219
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,858
- Got it!
- Come on! Charge to 200!

220
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:13,686
Need a crash cart!

221
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,965
- Wait. Owen!
- Go, go! You go! Go!

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,102
Why is everybody dying?!

223
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:24,739
What's going on?!

224
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,243
- Uh, ma'am... ma'am, you're okay.
- I'm what?!

225
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,311
- Sir? Clear!
- Wait!

226
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,078
Oh, God! I'm so... I'm so sorry!

227
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,251
- I was asleep!
- So sorry!

228
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,195
What the hell is happening?

All of them?!

231
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,445
All of the monitors are out?

232
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,023
Will you try and calm
these people down?

233
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,976
Uh, um, folks!

234
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,554
Everything's fine!

235
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:10,789
Just a little technical snafu
with the monitors!

236
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,024
But you have nothing to worry about!

237
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:15,007
Un-Unless, uh, you do.

238
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,328
You came to the ER,
so some of you probably

239
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,820
- do have genuine concerns, obviously...
- We will have this rectified A.S.A.P.!

240
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,207
Thank you.

241
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,085
We have two incoming
MVC patients.

242
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,945
Great timing. They can
join the walking dead.

243
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,518
Is this just us?
Or is it anyone else?

244
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,781
- That is what I'm trying to find out.
- Okay.

245
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,529
How are we doing?

246
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:39,374
Y-You've done
this a few times, right?

247
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,801
Many times. Are you nervous?

248
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:44,479
Never been in a hospital...
never even broke a bone.

249
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:48,822
- So... yeah. I've never been this nervous.
- It's okay.

250
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,700
I am gonna go in through here,

251
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,645
I'm gonna take out your spleen.

252
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:55,214
You'll be left with an incision
about that big.

253
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,492
You won't miss it.
Like it never happened.

254
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:58,693
- Okay.
- Okay?

255
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,018
Okay. Thanks.

256
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,615
This one's being weird.

257
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,210
I'll have another one brought in.

258
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,974
When did his headache start?

259
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,636
About 10 minutes ago.
Could it be another stroke?

260
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,317
Page Shepherd and get a head CT.

261
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,878
Did he get his vitamin K last night

262
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,324
to reverse the blood thinner?

263
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,410
I-I-I don't know what the... the...

264
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,543
He's asking you
what he was given last...

265
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,392
something to thin his blood
or make it clot?

266
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:32,442
I know.
I-I can't open his chart.

267
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,000
The screen is locked.

268
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:44,746
Bailey, OB is short-staffed,

269
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:46,565
and they keep paging me, so, uh...

270
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,516
Dr. DeLuca's an OB, right?

271
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,869
Yeah, but she doesn't have privileges.

272
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,880
Uh, by the power vested in me,
blah, blah, blah.

273
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:54,676
Now go find her and tell her
she has temporary privileges

274
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:56,430
to stop watching ladies masturbate

275
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,180
and to help pull babies out of people.

276
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,699
Okay, in all fairness, she doesn't
actually watch them masturbate.

277
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,228
- It's like...
- Are you having this problem?

278
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,602
I can't get to the medical records.

279
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,813
Well, let me see if I can help.

280
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,686
I mean, I got it. It... This... And...

281
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,901
Well, why is it... Can I help you?

282
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,541
Uh, yeah, I'm Tim.

283
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,063
Tim Ruggles from I.T.
You called me?

284
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,265
T... Uh, why can't I get
into the medical records?

285
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,763
Oh, have you tried turning it

286
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:19,144
- off and turning it...
- Don't finish that sentence, Tim.

287
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,776
Look. This problem's on every computer.

288
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:23,936
Oh. Man. Oh, no.

289
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,272
- "Oh, no"?!
- I mean, 'cause...

290
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:28,850
Plus the cardiac monitors
malfunctioning...

291
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,620
Cardiac monitors are malfunctioning?

292
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,822
W... I have to...

293
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,023
Yeah, go.

294
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,916
Oh, man. Okay.

295
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:39,652
All right, um, so,
when you remodeled the hospital,

296
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,363
the computer systems were all networked.

297
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,844
So these malfunctions
might be related...

298
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:45,665
I don't care if they're related or not.

299
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,500
Just make it stop. I can't run a hospital

300
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,838
without medical records and cardiac...

301
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:51,983
What did...

302
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,996
- Hold on.
- What?

303
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,292
"Hello, Grey-Sloan Memorial."

304
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:01,241
"Currently, we control your hospital.

305
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:05,110
We own your servers.
We own your..."

306
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,055
Tim, are you seeing this?!

307
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, man.

308
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,584
"We own your systems.

309
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,768
We own your patients' medical records."

310
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,035
This is so creepy.

311
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,817
"To regain access
to your medical records,

312
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,134
you need an encryption key..."

313
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,821
"which only we have."

314
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,998
"You will need to pay us
exactly 4,932... Bitcoin...

315
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,499
to retrieve the key"?

316
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:29,744
"Failure to pay this
ransom in a timely manner

317
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:32,480

and your systems to..."

319
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,236
Let's keep our voices down.

320
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,547
When do we get the records back?

321
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,705
Look. I've got kids up there. I don't
even know what meds they're on!

322
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:47,662
We can't even order meds!

323
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,497
And we can't monitor our patients, so...

324
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,056
Okay, everyone stop!

325
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,825
I thought we were prepared for this.

326
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,236
We were supposed to have the
whole cybersecurity seminar...

327
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,529
We are. It's this Friday.

328
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,148
Bailey, what
the hell are we gonna do?

329
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,636
- Ohh!
- Unh!

330
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:05,905
All right. See, that.

331
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,073
That right there is what
we're not going to do.

332
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,270
We're not gonna go running around

333
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,244
flapping our arms like the sky
is falling, all right?

334
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,413
Just because we've lost our computers,

335
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,291
we don't have to lose our minds, okay?

336
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,083
Hmmm.

337
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,462
We need to take a deep breath.

338
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,521
We need to calm down

339
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:24,723
because we don't want
to panic our patients!

340
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,034
We will solve this problem,

341
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,727
and we will solve it calmly and quietly.

342
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,139
So none of
our very vulnerable patients

343
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:34,090
needs to know that anything
out of the ordinary

344
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,738
is happening, okay?

345
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,628
Uh...

Stop using the phones.
Turn off your phones!

00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,818
I need to speak with
whoever's in charge.

350
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,798
Back away from that computer!

I'll need every computer

We need all employee cellphones

We're going to paper charts?

00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,946
Well, it's worked pretty well
for two centuries, Kepner.

364
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:50,923
Okay, everything
gets written down, people.

365

anything that is not
already attached to a patient.

then the ICU, and then the ER.

Is his CT back? Let me see.

382

Can't. It's in his records.
So you can't see it.

383
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,635
I know. I just really want
to throw something right now.

It won't hurt anyone.

Uh, your father has
a condition called ARDS.

391
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,525
It's causing his lungs
to fill up with fluid,

392
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,018
and now they're failing.

393
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:03,930
- Okay. So he's dying?
- I'd like to put him on ECMO.

394
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,947
That's cardiorespiratory bypass.

395
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,600
It'll oxygenate his blood for him

396
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,809
so that
his lungs can rest and heal.

397
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,070
So he's <i>not</i> dying?

398
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,330
No. No. He is not dying.

399
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,508
We would need you
to sign this consent form

400
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,137
for the procedure, okay?

401
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,666
That... That makes no sense.

402
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:24,783
I-I can't consent to anything.
I <i>barely</i> know him.

403
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:26,008
I thought he was your father.

404
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,283
Oh, no, my mother left him

405
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,689
when she was pregnant with me.

406
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,072
And my whole life,

407
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,835
she just talked about
how bad he was in bed,

408
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:33,100
which, if you're wondering,

409
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,752
was not really excellent
parenting on her part.

410
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,853
And then, last month,
at her funeral, he showed up.

411
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,294
And he's... he seems...

412
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,736
I mean, he seems
like a pretty good guy.

413
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:46,706
And he is the first and only
father I have ever known.

414
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,853
And I just met him.

415
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,879
I just met him.

416
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,621
I don't want him to die.

417
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,648
Is it weird that now I'm crying

418
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:58,470
to two strangers
over a man I just met?

419
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,649
It is, right? Yeah.

420
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:03,502
- No.
- Sign the consent form.

421
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,564
Let us help him so that
you can get to know him.

422
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,292
We're okay without the portable

423
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,303
because the anesthesia's
monitor is working.

424
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,296
Okay, good, 'cause the computers,

425
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,531
- the phones, the labs...
- The labs are down?

426
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah. I guess, uh, most of these hacks

427
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,036
are just, like, viruses
to get access to patient files.

428
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,967
But this is a full-on attack,
which is, you know...

429
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,580
We're all just trying not to panic!!

430
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,151
Try a little harder, Dr. Bello.

431
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,755
Yeah. On it.

432
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,218
Hold the camera steady, please?

433
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,689
Isn't it wild?

434
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,549
Technology has made it
one of the best, safest times

435
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,641
in human history to get sick.

436
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,983
But if the computer catches a bug,

437
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,981
we're all completely screwed.

438
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:55,944
I-Is something...?

439
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,677
I'm thinking about converting
to an open procedure.

440
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,314
- Why? Why would y...
- Because of everything you just said.

441
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,639
Oh, God. Don't listen to me!

442
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:03,923
I'm operating on this woman

443
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:07,455
with nothing but a tiny
electronic camera to guide me.

444
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:11,023
No, it's fine. The scope is working.

445
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:13,817
It would take too long
to convert to an open procedure,

446
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:15,314
so I can get the spleen from here.

447
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:16,796
Let's just hurry up and get this done.

448
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,377
Sorry.

449
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:22,998
Hey. You came. Thanks.

450
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:24,781
Ohh. We're slammed.

451
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,154
On top of the... the hacking,

452
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,951
we have a bunch of OBs
that are out with the flu,

453
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,328
so Bailey's gonna give you OB privileges

454
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,564
and asked if you could help.

455
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,203
- What hacking?
- Well, the computers are down.

456
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,337
We've been hacked.

457
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,287
Oh! I thought my last patient

458
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,873
had the saddest climax I've ever seen,

459
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,822
but it's just the screen was frozen.

460
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,203
Can you help?

461
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:43,033
Of course, Arizona.

462
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:45,377
Hey. How we doing here?

463
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:48,485
Uh, I-I keep telling them
that we can't take patients.

464
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,120
But I'm super having a baby right now!

465
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:51,551
We were having a home birth...
a water birth...

466
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,732
and she panicked a little.

467
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,791
Um, let's get a gurney.

468
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,529
Hey. How are
the babies in the NICU?

469
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:58,038
Well, the NICU monitors aren't networked,

470
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,788
- so they haven't been affected.
- Thank God.

471
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,827
Um, hey, will you tell them
to stop paging me for births?

472
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,320
'Cause I'm not an OB. Dr. DeLuca is.

473
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,311
So they should just page her.

474
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,169
- Right. Yep.
- Okay.

475
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,837
- You're the OB?
- Yes, I am.

476
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,959
I want an epidural. Okay?

477
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:12,008
And I want monitoring and
painkillers.

478
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,286
And I want all your drugs.

479
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:14,957
And m...
And machines and robots.

480
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,610
Who does this in a kiddie pool
in their kitchen?

481
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:20,400
Just breathe. Just breathe.

482
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,119
My first patient!

483
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,396
I'm your first patient?!

484
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,744
No, no, no, no. In...
In <i>this</i> hospital.

485
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,330
Move, please!
We need to get a CT!

486
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,470
Oh, no. This <i>is</i> the CT line.

487
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,630
Everybody had the same idea.

488
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,045
Hey! I need priority.

489
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,481
My guy needs a head CT stat.

490
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:43,783
Yeah, so does mine.

491
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,444
Listen. My guy's an MVC,
and he has two kids.

492
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,131
So? My guy's in kindergarten.

493
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:50,767
So, if you want to play human poker,

494
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,916
my hand beats yours. No cuts.

495
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,794
It's not "cuts," Karev.
This not high school.

496
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:57,705
Well, you're lucky, 'cause I was
a wrestler in high school.

497
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:07,197
- This is big.
- It is. It's big.

498
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:08,899
It's a real-time intrusion

499
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,768
into our VolP switches,
DCs, and Active Directory.

500
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:14,347
Tim, I didn't understand
anything after "big."

501
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,640
Just tell me how to stop it.

502
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,185
Okay, Denver Medical said
they stopped the hackers.

503
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:21,878
But I know the chief. It was just PR.

504
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,322
They stopped them with money.

505
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,423
They paid the ransom.

506
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,136
That is not true.

507
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:27,984
Officially.

508
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,419
But, yes, you are correct.

509
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,306
- Well, they only want 5,000.
- Bitcoin.

510
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,409
Well, if that's all they want,

511
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:33,718
hell, I'll write them a check right now.

512
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,382
- Bitcoin!
- And why does he keep saying that?

513
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:38,337
They want 5,000 Bitcoin.
It's virtual money.

514
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:41,974
Right now that translates
to roughly $20 million!

515
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,609
20 w...

516
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,569
Well?

517
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:47,823
You gonna get your checkbook?

518
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,736
Normally, they hit you for an amount

519
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,198
they think you can easily hand over.

520
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,049
I don't know why
they'd ask for this much.

521
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:06,271
Because we announced the contest!

522
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:09,536
Oh, they came after us
because they think we have it.

523
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:10,992
Can we get our hands on that much cash?

524
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,068
You paged?

525
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:14,754
- I need $20 million.
- You need what now?

526
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,694
From the Avery Foundation.

527
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,679
Or from your grandfather's inheritance.

528
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,772
The "I'm buying a boat" money.

529
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,564
Look, patients are in danger.

530
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:27,952
And if we need to pay off
some Cheeto-stained pirate nerd

531
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,913
so he can move out
of his mother's basement,

532
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:31,694
then that's what we need to do.

533
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,602
Now, we could try to
use the contest money,

534
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,496
but I would prefer not to have
to contact the anonymous donor.

535
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,856
Uh, can you help us out with a loan?

536
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,476
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Thank you.

537
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,741
It's not that simple.

538
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:48,138
Oh, but it <i>is that simple.</i>

539
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:49,563
It's the simplest math there is.

540
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:51,421
Y-Y-You look at the value of money,

541
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,914
and you compare that
to the value of a human life,

542
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,564
and unless you are a soulless monster

543
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,335
who lives in a cave and eats children,

544
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:01,888
you would see that
there's no amount of money

545
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,578
that should stand in the way
of saving that life.

546
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:06,852
Now, um, how do I get
some of that, uh, chipcoin?

547
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,188
- Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin.

548
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:09,648
We're not gonna let you pay this!

549
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,367
- Did you not hear
- What?

550
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:12,265
What I just said?

551
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,304
This is an unprecedented ransom.

552
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,400
If they go after this kind
of money and get it?

553
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,810
Everybody will know.

554
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,557
People will pull this at every
hospital in the country.

555
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,263
Worldwide.

556
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,874
If they win here,

557
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,418
you're endangering
thousands of patients' lives.

558
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:29,971
Give my guys time to work.

559
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:31,872
I'm with Dr. Bailey on this. All right?

560
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,600
This hospital's in chaos right now.

561
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,070
Our patients are in real trouble,

562
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,771
and we have the means to fix that.

563
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,950
Dr. Bailey, you say the word,
I'll transfer the funds.

564
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,331
Hmm.

565
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:47,148
Uh, I don't know what it is
that you're doing,

566
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,785
but I bet you could do it faster.

567
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,324
Hey, how's Claude?

568
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,460
I put him on ECMO. He's stable for now.

569
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,327
Can he be moved?
Is he safe for transport?

570
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,612
It's that bad?

571
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,526
Yeah, anybody who's
dependent on a machine,

572
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,116
we should really move them right away.

573
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,760
Okay, yeah, we can transport him
on ECMO. Let's do it.

574
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,316
Hey! Hey! Will you tell them
to stop paging me to OB?

575
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:15,405
I can deliver babies, but I am not an OB.

576
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:16,774
I used to be a pediatric surgeon,

577
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,582
and now I work on fetuses and moms.

578
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,028
And I did not go into ladies' vaginas

579
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,802
because I do not like to mix
business with pleasure.

580
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,450
That was me. I sent for you.

581
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:25,465
- W-Why?
- My patient is terrified.

582
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,129
She wants drugs that I can't access,

583
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,054
and she's too far along
to go somewhere else.

584
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,301
So, uh... What do you
want me to do about it?

585
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,416
She won't listen to me.

586
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:35,012
Since I suggested that her
partner initiate an orgasm...

587
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,564
Yeah. See...

588
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,929
You got to be real choosy
about when you bust that out.

589
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,103
You are the kindest person here.

590
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,134
You work with mothers. You <i>are</i> a mother.

591
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,618
I thought you could calm her down, no?

592
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,019
No.

593
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,169
I mean, yes.

594
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:56,270
- Thank you.
- Okay.

595
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:03,037
Her abdomen's distended,
but I can't see any free fluid.

596
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:04,956
All right. Let's roll her up to CT

597
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:07,099
to rule out a hemoperitoneum, okay?

598
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,255
Oh. CT's backed up.

599
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,105
It'll be an hour before she's scanned.

600
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:12,763
Damn it! She doesn't have that long!

601
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,813
I think there's blood in her belly.

602
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,816
I need a newspaper.

603
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:20,954
A wh...

604
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,701
- A damn newspaper!
- Oh, o-okay. Okay.

605
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,677
Uh...

606
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,079
Ohh!

607
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,466
I need this! Emergency!

608
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:33,082
- Hey!
- Sorry!

609
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,372
Okay. It's a little pinkish.

610
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,343
But the real test is...

611
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,451
if you can read the paper through it,

612
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,466
there's not a clinically
significant amount

613
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,079
of blood in the belly, okay?

614
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,162
Ooh! 10 down is "Jacuzzi." She's okay.

615
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,943
That is... really cool.

616
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:58,232
That's how we did it... in the Stone Age.

617
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,182
Frankie's CT looks clear,

618
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,979
but it could be too early
to see a new clot or a bleed.

619
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,658
So we're gonna watch him very closely.

620
00:26:06,716 --> 00:26:08,510
Okay. How, uh, worried should I be?

621
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,293
Oh, we got this. We've got him.

622
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,755
Okay. Thank you.

623
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,024
I'm concerned it might be an
early warning of another stroke.

624
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,537
I found him!

625
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,193
Oh, good. I need to know

626
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,024
if Frankie Baner got his
vitamin K last night.

627
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,521
I wasn't working last night.

628
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:23,777
- Who was?
- I don't know.

629
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,232
It's in the medical records.

630
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:26,413
The medical records. I need to know

631
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,680
if I should put him on heparin or not,

632
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:29,840
because if he doesn't need it,
it could cause a brain bleed.

633
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:31,183
And if he needs it
and doesn't get it,

634
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,365
we're talking about a possible stroke.

635
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,701
You don't know
who was on this morning?

636
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,864
- I don't.
- Doc McStuffins was on!

637
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:37,755
- Who?
- She's not a real doctor.

638
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,427
Frankie says he got an injection.
He can't remember from who.

639
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:42,301
But he was watching "Doc McStuffins."

640
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,305
His mom says it's on
at 6:00 a.m., so who was...

641
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:47,012
At 6:00? Karen! She's on a 12-hour split.

642
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,606
Uh, she was heading to L&D.

643
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:49,736
Call L&D.

644
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:52,043
- No phones.
- Got it. I'm going.

645
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:55,879
♪♪

646
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,552
Should we tell her what's going on?

647
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,227
Well, I'm a big advocate
for truth telling

648
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,740
when it can do any good at all,
and it usually can,

649
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:03,756
but in this case,
it'll only cause panic.

650
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:08,824
Dr. Webber?

651
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,775
His heart rate's been
at 160 since he came in.

652
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,514
- Mm-hmm.
- He had a Red Bull <i>and</i> Adderall.

653
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:16,217
I'd give him adenosine
to bring his heart rate down,

654
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:18,268
but it's contraindicated
for asthma.

655
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,067
Uh, that's easy. Put him in...
in Trendelenburg, man.

656
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,302
I turn him upside down?

657
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,217
Yeah, yeah. You know,
if that doesn't work,

658
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,958
dunk his head in a bucket of ice, huh?

659
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,498
For real?

660
00:27:27,692 --> 00:27:29,200
For real, DeLuca.

661
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:33,853
Okay. It stimulates...
the vagus nerve, okay?

662
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,012
Because, back in my day,

663
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,687
we didn't have a pill
for <i>every</i> little thing.

664
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:42,068
We had to do what the pill does.

665
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,583
Flip him and dip him.

666
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,435
Yes, sir!

667
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:50,327
Um, gonna go get you some ice.

668
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,813
Okay, come on. Okay, finally.

669
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,841
Uh, I need a pan CT,
without contrast...

670
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:58,778
Come on!

671
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,122
Okay.

672
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,889
Damn it. Damn it.
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

673
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,426
I knew it. Bag her!

674
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,394
Do we have headlamps?

675
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,120
Uh...

676
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:12,255
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

677
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:13,540
Schmitt, don't move!

678
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,294
Well, what do we do now?

679
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,310
If you can't even see what
you're doing, what do you do?!

680
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,809
- She's gonna...
- Schmitt, if you don't shut up...

681
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,551
We don't panic, is what we don't do.

682
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,242
Let's prep for a laparotomy
to open her up.

683
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,749
I need a Bookwalter and a 10 blade.

684
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:30,850
And I need four units of B-neg.

685
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,857
Uh, we... we can't. No phones.

686
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,086
Okay, well, send someone down to get it.

687
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,343
I will. I'm on it!

688
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,359
Not you! I need the assist!

689
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:41,172
Forget it now.
You're out of the sterile field.

690
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,898
