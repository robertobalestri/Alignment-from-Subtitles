1
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,348
There's a saying we hear
a lot around hospitals...

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,184
that goes like this...

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,247
"Pain is inevitable.
Suffering is optional."

4
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:24,835
It didn't work.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,618
But I doubt the person who coined it

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,178
ever went through major surgery.

7
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,021
It didn't work.

8
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,158
Or maybe they didn't mean physical pain.

9
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,827
Maybe they meant the other kind...

10
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,161
the worse kind.

11
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,665
- Is Meredith in there?
- Yes.

12
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:46,135
I'm gonna go talk to her.

13
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:48,871
Uh... Not a good idea, all right?

14
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,842
Okay, right now she looks
and sounds just like her mother.

15
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:54,877
Okay? I mean, best we just lay low,

16
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,178
let her work this out herself.

17
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,448
Believe me. I had to
learn it the hard way.

18
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,784
- With Ellis?
- Both of them.

19
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,687
I think we should go in.

20
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,223
Maybe they meant the kind
of searing, seething,

21
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:10,159
boiling pain that tells you
you're a failure and a fraud.

22
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:20,202
Well, I hope you don't want any coffee,
'cause I broke all the mugs.

23
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,375
"Suffering is optional."

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,509
That person didn't know what
the... they were talking about.

26
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,691
Excuse me. Scusi!

27
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,592
Sorry. That's the only word
I know in Italian.

28
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,095
Um, why are we speaking Italian?

29
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,930
He's my stupid little brother.

30
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,573
Um... hi. Uh, excuse me.

31
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,041
I'm still here!

32
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:00,710
I-I still don't speak Italian.

33
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,111
You know what? Have fun.

34
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,913
I'm gonna sleep at the hospital.

35
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,082
Wha... Ugh!

36
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,017
Agh! He's such a baby boy!

37
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,618
Trying to pretend like sex doesn't exist

38
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,520
just because he isn't having any.

39
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:12,922
Andrew's Italian?

40
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:14,857
Andrea is his given name.

41
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,192
Huh.

42
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:19,895
Where were we?

43
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,263
I think... I'm pretty sure

44
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,099
that you were about to
take off your shirt.

45
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,034
I think so, too.

46
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,475
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,148
I'm sorry for Megan.

48
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,817
- But?
- But I'm so glad she doesn't have to go

49
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,286
back to Iraq right away.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,021
Is that awful? Am I awful?

51
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,257
Yeah.

52
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,192
Pretty awful.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,333
You ready? Tuck's
gonna late if we don't...

54
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,169
I don't want to.

55
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,236
You don't want to ride with me?

56
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,707
I don't want to stuff my feet
into these shoes.

57
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,376
You know, when Webber became chief,

58
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,612
he did not have to toddle around
on sticks all day.

59
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,347
When Hunt became chief,

60
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:48,217
he did not have to squeeze five toes

61
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,219
into a space built for two.

62
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,555
But I become chief and I can't wear

63
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:55,958
my perfectly comfortable
surgical clogs anymore.

64
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,493
And you know why?

65
00:03:57,527 --> 00:04:00,196
- Society?
- S... Society.

66
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,468
Um...

67
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:06,836
I'm comin'!

68
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,504
Okay.

69
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:15,678
You sent the kids to school
and went back to bed?

70
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:16,812
- Don't judge me.
- Don't judge her.

71
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:19,582
I'm not. Look. She'll heal, right?

72
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,250
- Eventually, the wound will close.
- It'll close.

73
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,319
Yeah, it'll be ugly and painful.

74
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,187
Probably worse than it was before.

75
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,256
And it'll take months to heal.
She won't be able to travel.

76
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,225
But it will close.

77
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,027
You'll use mesh, and it'll
take time, but it will close.

78
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,929
And now she has a functioning
bowel, which she...

79
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:35,197
- Stop!
- You mad at yourself?

80
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:36,198
Think you were wrong to try?

81
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,667
Yeah, I'm mad at myself.
I was overconfident.

82
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,169
And I'm also mad at medicine.

83
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,238
Fair enough, but don't
take it out on the wall.

84
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:43,939
Well, you did a terrible job
patching it.

85
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,407
You can see the whole entire outline.

86
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:46,742
All right, well, just stop picking at it

87
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:49,411
before we have to replace
the whole damn thing.

88
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,384
- Alex.
- Hmm?

89
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,963
That's it.

90
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,321
That's it!

91
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,260
- Meredith?
- Not till everyone gets here.

92
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,223
Till... Okay, who's everyone?

93
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:08,397
I got your text.

94
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:09,565
Dr. Altman.

95
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,767
An abdominal-wall transplant.

96
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:15,571
I want to do an abdominal-wall
transplant on Megan Hunt.

97
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,540
I want to harvest the skin,
the musculature,

98
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,441
and the fascia from a donor.

99
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:22,411
This surgery has been done three times
before, twice successfully.

100
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,746
But they were done

101
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,782
with a simultaneous
small-bowel transplant.

102
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,385
So this is easier because we've
already repaired her bowel.

103
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,488
And I would use a bone graft
to limit our risk of rejection.

104
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:34,123
I mean, we keep trying
to fix this thing,

105
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,959
and the more we try to fix it,
the worse it gets.

106
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,495
So why do we keep trying to fix it?

107
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,163
Let's just replace it.

108
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,565
All right, well,
what do you need from us?

109
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,301
Well, I need your approval,
and I need you to back me up

110
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,102
in case she doesn't
give me her approval.

111
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,471
And I need you here
as Megan Hunt's advocate.

112
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:53,075
I know you think I overstepped
by taking on this case.

113
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:56,412
But I am able to separate the
personal and the professional.

114
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:57,780
And if we do this,
I want you to scrub in.

115
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:00,983
I don't want anyone questioning
my motives from this point forward.

116
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,822
So if we're gonna do this,
if we're gonna pull this off,

117
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:06,322
I need everybody on board.

118
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,629
Hey, you left early.

119
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,226
- Yeah, busy day.
- Yeah, well, Maggie said a thing

120
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,800
about a thing you
apparently said to Maggie?

121
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,301
Hey, you know what? My day is full.

122
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,970
Can you take her to daycare?

123
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,639
- Ah. Hey.
- Okay. Bye.

124
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,374
Uh...

125
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:35,010
Well, do you think
that Mommy's avoiding me?

126
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,146
I think Mommy's definitely
avoiding Daddy, don't you?

127
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,417
Um, I did a thing.

128
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,152
A stupid thing.

129
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,854
And I know that you don't want
to be my new Stephanie,

130
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,357
but until I find
a new Stephanie, you're it.

131
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,833
You're who I've got to talk to.

132
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,060
And I need you to tell me
exactly how to fix

133
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,092
this incredibly stupid thing!

134
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,530
W-W-W-What the hell did you do?

135
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:59,001
Hey. There. Hi.

136
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,369
That. I did that.

137
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,104
You left your I.D.,

138
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:05,240
which I figured you probably need.

139
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,676
My mom found it, which was... awkward.

140
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,077
That was your mom's house?

141
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,513
Livin' at home, you know.

142
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,548
'Cause costs are high.

143
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,517
So, anyway...

144
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,419
see you later, hopefully.

145
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,191
You slept with him?

146
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,294
No. No. I did not sleep.

147
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,529
I had sex with him, and then I left!

148
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,398
You slept with Glasses?

149
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,873
Oh, God.

150
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,408
Oh, wow!

151
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:42,311
I mean, that's just... That's... Wow.

152
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:47,582
I want to laugh, too,

153
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,120
but I'm trying so hard to be polite.

154
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,787
What would Stephanie do?

155
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,558
This is a donor abdomen?

156
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,294
Yes, we would use the abdominal skin,

157
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,430
the musculature, the fascia

158
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,765
the same way we would
from a donor kidney.

159
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,735
This is groundbreaking.

160
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,603
You know we see a lot of
soldiers with Megan's injury.

161
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,340
If she can pull this off,
it can change a lot of lives.

162
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,775
If it works, I'll have full function?

163
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,043
- Motor and sensory?
- Yes.

164
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,480
And the recovery? Should be
a few weeks, not a few months.

165
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,682
- But what if it doesn't work?
- Mom!

166
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:21,950
I don't like this, Megan.

167
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,452
- I don't like it, either.
- No one asked you.

168
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:24,853
Megan, they're just worried.

169
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,421
No, they just want me stuck here.

170
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:27,594
Because they just got you back!

171
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,325
- They're scared.
- Yeah, well, so am I!

172
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,594
You know what else I am?

173
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:34,580
In pain.

174
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,652
I make a lot of jokes, and
I'm addicted to silver linings

175
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,889
because jokes and silver linings
kept me alive.

176
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,191
But...

177
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,861
I was a hostage.

178
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,862
And now, without this,
I'm a hostage again.

179
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,031
To this bed. To this wound.

180
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,733
And she has a plan to set me free.

181
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,703
And just to be clear, I don't
have to be the one who does this.

182
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,072
If you feel more comfortable
with Dr. Bailey or Dr. Webber,

183
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,417
that's completely fine with me.

184
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,877
You are my surgeon, Dr. Grey.

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,842
Just... promise me that you'll
find me a killer set of abs.

186
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,691
I'm gonna need your Sub-I's
to help me find that donor.

187
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,094
Uh, I can all but assure you
they'll screw up,

188
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,362
but you can try.

189
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,148
You think I can do this?

190
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,767
Yes. I think you can do this.

191
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,707
That 180 from the depths of despair

192
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,076
to the revolutionary solution?

193
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,544
That's impressive.

194
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,980
Yep. That's pure Ellis, too.

195
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,484
- Hi.
- Hey!

196
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,386
Uh, I mean... hello.

197
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,256
Uh, yeah. You know what?
I'm sorry. I got to, um...

198
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,125
Thank you.

199
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,895
The patient is
a 36-year-old Caucasian woman

200
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,063
of Scottish descent,

201
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,500
so we're looking for skin
that's more peach than olive.

202
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,001
Is complexion important?

203
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,804
If you were gonna replace
a big chunk of your body

204
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,006
with a big chunk of someone else's body,

205
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,474
wouldn't you want the parts to match?

206
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,642
Shouldn't you just call UNOS?

207
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,445
We've tried that. There are
no pending donors that match.

208
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,813
This is where you come in.

209
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,982
We want you to scour ERs,
chase ambulances...

210
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,750
Isn't that a little predatory?

211
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,852
Well, the woman whose
life I'm trying to save

212
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,087
is a military surgeon.

213
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,590
She's saved hundreds of
soldiers' lives. She's a hero.

214
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,026
So I'm okay with you
feeling a little predatory.

215
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,662
And whoever does find this donor for me

216
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,364
gets to scrub in on the surgery.

217
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,436
It's a good thing.

218
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,704
You want this.

219
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,599
Go!

220
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey, hey. Andrew.

221
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,556
Or is it Andrea?

222
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,124
Andrew, please.

223
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,159
Why is your sister talking to Bailey?

224
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,395
I don't know. She asked me
to introduce them, so I did.

225
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,797
Well... why?

226
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,033
I-I mean, what does she do?

227
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,335
For a living.
What's she do for a living?

228
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,630
I see you two did a lot
of talking last night.

229
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,049
She's an OB-GYN.

230
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,744
Huh.

231
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,079
The male brain, in all its
facets and all its states,

232
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,748
has been studied quite thoroughly,

233
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,383
but nobody has studied this aspect

234
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,852
of the female anatomy at all until now.

235
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,720
"This aspect," meaning...

236
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,855
The body and the brain,

237
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,557
before, during, and after orgasm.

238
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,726
As with all the other organs,

239
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,894
they study the male brain

240
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,429
and they expect the female brain

241
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,398
to magically fit in
with their conclusions.

242
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,867
But as you and I know,
our bodies are quite different,

243
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,770
so any medications we might need
will also be different.

244
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,072
And your study is funded?

245
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,874
The drug companies have finally realized

246
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,442
that there is money to be made

247
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,745
in developing the equivalent
of a female Viagra.

248
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,514
My personal fascination

249
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,116
is with the role
sexual stimulation can play

250
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,185
in pain control for women.

251
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,120
But of course,
nobody will fund that study.

252
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,055
So this way, two pigeons, one rock.

253
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,257
Uh...

254
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,127
Okay, I understand your
hesitation, Dr. Bailey. I-I do.

255
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,062
But when I heard my brother was working

256
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,732
for a female chief of surgery?

257
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,319
Ah, do you know just how rare that is?

258
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,804
Look, let me just get this right.

259
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,972
You want me to let you

260
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,042
have women masturbate in my MRI machine

261
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,588
so that you can study their
brains while they orgasm?

262
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,646
Yes.

263
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,148
- In the interest of science?
- Yes.

264
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,755
Done.

265
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,594
Well, the good news is you get
a fancy, new grown-up room

266
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,430
while they paint the peds ward.

267
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,565
Is there really
nothing else we can give him?

268
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,933
I mean, not even an aspirin?

269
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,801
He's maxed out on opiates.

270
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,404
And just one aspirin will do
nothing for his pain,

271
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,140
but it'll thin his blood and destroy
his chances of a successful surgery.

272
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,441
You understand?

273
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,411
W-What do I do? I mean, this is...

274
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,847
Watching my kid in this
much pain, what do I do?

275
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,583
Well, he plays baseball, right?
So what do you tell him?

276
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,119
When it's the ninth inning and his team
is down and the pressure's on,

277
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,654
you... you say, "You can do it."

278
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,923
You say, "You got this."

279
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,669
David.

280
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,896
You got this.

281
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,552
No, no. She cannot do the surgery.

282
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:35,902
I didn't ask for his opinion.
I asked for his help.

283
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,000
He said no. I moved on. And in
case anyone needs reminding,

284
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,512
I am the chief of neurosurgery!

285
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,590
Good for you, but the
tumor's invading his jaw.

286
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
The difficult part of the
surgery is in his face,

287
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,860
not his brain. You are not an ENT.

288
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:47,228
It is compressing his trigeminal nerve.

289
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,596
It is causing debilitating pain.

290
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,931
And just because you are afraid of it

291
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,766
doesn't mean I have to be!

292
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:55,069
Avery, if she feels
she has it in hand...

293
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,739
Oh, she doesn't. She... She
does not have it in hand.

294
00:13:57,773 --> 00:14:00,975
It's not your place to
decide that! It's hers!

295
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,877
Her patient, her decision.

296
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,714
Sorry to interrupt.

297
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,050
Jackson, I'm doing a total
abdominal-wall transplant,

298
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,085
and I could really use
some help with the nerves

299
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,821
and the vascular microanastomosis.

300
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,956
An abdominal-wall transplant?

301
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,724
So you will get on board
with her groundbreaking surgery,

302
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,592
but not mine.

303
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,932
Oh, no, yours is not groundbreaking.

304
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,929
Yours is reckless endangerment.

305
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,416
Yes, sir, he's 10 years old.
He's a Syrian refugee.

306
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,438
But, General, if I may,
she was held hostage

307
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,474
for a decade, and he is her son.

308
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:33,875
No, he wasn't legally adopted but...

309
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,941
Is there any way to cut through some
of this red tape a little faster?

310
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,962
No, not legally, but...

311
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,179
Well, then could you
recommend an attorney

312
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,681
who's better than you?! Damn it!

313
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:42,116
- All right, thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir. I'll tell her.

314
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,187
No.

315
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,692
- This surgery could kill her.
- This surgery is her best shot.

316
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:52,360
Her best shot is to lay
in that bed and heal.

317
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:55,330
But she won't. Megan won't.

318
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:56,965
She's not gonna lie there for six months

319
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,333
with her kid over there,
and you know it.

320
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,534
She's going back to Iraq.

321
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,102
And if that wound gets infected...

322
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:03,938
Owen, this surgery is her best option.

323
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,683
This woman has been dead three days.

324
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,459
Is that too long?

325
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,992
Shotgun to the abdomen.

326
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,127
You don't see a problem here?

327
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,695
You can't repair it?

328
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:36,137
Did I mention our patient is female?

329
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,105
Yes.

330
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,894
Hello.

331
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,563
Do you need the MRI?

332
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:03,231
- No.
- No.

333
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,066
No. We just heard about the, um...

334
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,701
My study?

335
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,836
Exactly. Yeah.

336
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,171
I'm Maggie Pierce.

337
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,239
I'm the head of cardiothoracic surgery.

338
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:14,108
Maggie Pierce who used to
date my little brother?

339
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:17,178
- Uh, no, I don't think so.
- Uh, DeLuca.

340
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,581
- What?
- She's DeLuca's sister.

341
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,216
You're even more beautiful than
my stupid little brother said.

342
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:25,587
I am?! He is? He what? What did he say?

343
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:26,821
Whoa! Orgasm!

344
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:30,091
That is the most active uptake
I have ever seen on an MRI.

345
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,426
It's bright.

346
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,294
I'm always looking for volunteers

347
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,113
- if any of you have any free time.
- No.

348
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,565
- No way.
- No, thank you.

349
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:40,301
Cool study, though!

350
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,206
Jo boned a Sub-I.

351
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,774
Six... What?

352
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,243
Yeah, more specifically,
the Sub-I whose glasses...

353
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,279
- No.
- Yes.

354
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:52,614
She did that because you told her

355
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,148
about looking up her husband?

356
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:56,451
No. I-I didn't tell her about that.

357
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,453
Oh, well, she did it
because you're avoiding her

358
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,254
because you're too wimpy to tell her

359
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,123
you looked up her husband.

360
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:03,091
Maybe she just did it.

361
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,792
Maybe it doesn't have
anything to do with me.

362
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,561
Oh, please! Jo is so hot.

363
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,296
She could sleep with anyone she wants.

364
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,232
She chose Glasses? It has
everything to do with you.

365
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,768
When I slept with George, it had
everything to do with Derek.

366
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,336
I still can't believe you did that.

367
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:18,773
Okay, we are way too old to
be having this conversation.

368
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:21,242
Okay, just... just
tell me why you did it.

369
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,910
Because he was there.

370
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:24,312
Yeah, that's not an answer.

371
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,747
Because he wasn't Alex.

372
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,630
Mm, still not quite an answer.

373
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:31,185
Because I choose bad guys, okay?

374
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,621
I choose... really bad guys.

375
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:34,622
Violent guys.

376
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:38,826
In the past, I have chosen
guys who have hurt me.

377
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,194
What? Like, physically?

378
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,829
Yeah.

379
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,534
If a guy hurts you physically,

380
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,038
that has nothing to do with you
or who you choose.

381
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,372
That's not your fault.

382
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,874
And I just don't think Karev is...

383
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:55,109
I saw him beat Andrew to a pulp.

384
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,611
I didn't think he had that
in him, either,

385
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,312
and then I watched it. I...

386
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:00,348
Well, you have your own
history of volatility.

387
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:02,383
It's self-defense. It's different.

388
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:05,553
Hey, Jo? I mean, Dr. Wilson.

389
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,722
- Dr. Jo Wilson.
- Yes?

390
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,057
You have a minute?

391
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,358
Yeah.

392
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:16,064
She's 35. Motorcycle accident.

393
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,832
- Wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Stupid.

394
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,000
Right. So she's brain-dead.

395
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,469
But no injury to the chest or abdomen.

396
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:24,005
Name is Shaugnessy,
which sounds pretty Scottish.

397
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,741
Or Irish? Definitely pale.

398
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,710
I-I think she's a pretty perfect match.

399
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,178
So what's the problem?

400
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:32,480
I don't know if it's appropriate
to approach a family

401
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,215
while their grief is this fresh.

402
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,516
It's not really appropriate

403
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,351
for you to approach them at all.

404
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,753
Right. But, I-I mean,

405
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,421
I'd really love to scrub in
on that surgery, so...

406
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:41,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

407
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:44,425
If you find the donor,
you get to scrub in?

408
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,526
Page Dr. Grey.

409
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,196
I want to fix it, you know?
I want to turn back time.

410
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,330
I just want to get everything right.

411
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:50,498
I want her to not be captured.

412
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:53,367
I just want to fix everything.
And Meredith says she can.

413
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,535
Meredith says she can fix her.

414
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,671
And all I am is terrified
that I'm gonna lose her again.

415
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,940
She doesn't need you
to turn back time, Nathan.

416
00:18:58,974 --> 00:18:59,974
She just needs you to be with her.

417
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,343
She needs to know that
you're all-in with her.

418
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,545
'Cause anything less than that,
anything in between,

419
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,647
is torture.

420
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,150
What do you got?

421
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,385
35-year-old female, fit,
Caucasian, brain dead.

422
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,754
Family have approved the donation.

423
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:15,556
Whew! Do an infectious-disease screen.

424
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,724
Congratulations, Wilson.

425
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,060
If this checks out, you get to scrub in.

426
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,863
- Thank you, Dr. Grey.
- Great job.

427
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,464
Get me a coffee.

428
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:35,794
But she was mine. I found her.
I trusted you!

429
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,629
It means nothing to you
to scrub in on that surgery.

430
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:38,930
And after what happened in my O.R.?

431
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,732
She won't even let you near the table.

432
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,934
For me, this could be a game-changer.

433
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,502
That's not an apology!
You owe me an apology!

434
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:47,818
No, she doesn't owe you anything.

435
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,641
- Alex, don't.
- She's a senior resident.

436
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,010
You're not even a first year,
which makes you a zero year.

437
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,845
You're a zero that
dropped a foreign object

438
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,480
in the surgical field of a 7-year-old.

439
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,181
You're only here because Dr. Wilson

440
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,284
handled your screw-up
and covered your ass.

441
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:01,519
- Got it?!
- Yeah. I-I'm a zero.

442
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:02,887
Okay.

443
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,324
Thank you.

444
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,159
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:09,527
It's... It's funny.

446
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:12,363
I can't believe you...

447
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,502
I know!

448
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,700
We have to ta...

449
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:22,307
Hey, so, I had to go to three different
bakeries, but I found cinnamon cake.

450
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:23,647
- She can't eat.
- I know.

451
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,443
But she said she
wanted to smell it, so...

452
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,154
You sent him on a fool's errand?

453
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:29,405
I needed some time for us
to all get on the same page.

454
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,467
- What same page?
- Sit down, Owen.

455
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,275
We need to talk to you.

456
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:36,572
What about? About
your sham of a marriage.

457
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:43,078
Oh, you got this, buddy.

458
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,380
You got this.

459
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,448
I'm so proud of you.

460
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:57,326
Dr. Shepherd, are you sure
that this surgery

461
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,967
is the right thing for Beau?

462
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:02,012
No one's ever sure of anything, DeLuca.

463
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:05,100
Stop trying to be sure.
It's a losing battle.

464
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:06,402
I-I just...

465
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,781
I feel like you're
adding pain to his pain...

466
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:10,472
for a surgery that you're not sure about

467
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:12,307
on a tumor that is benign.

468
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:14,482
Because his pain is not benign.

469
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,946
You think it's a better plan to send him
home with no hope and an oxy habit?

470
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,682
He will be a shell
of the kid he once was.

471
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:24,034
A ghost. An addict.
This pain will waste him.

472
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,822
I will not send that family home
with no hope.

473
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,524
Not when there's a chance I can fix it.

474
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,464
Been thinking about your thing.

475
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:36,849
Don't want to. Can't stop.

476
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:38,667
Can I call you New Stephanie?

477
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:40,169
Yeah.

478
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:42,805
Uh, okay. Here's my heartfelt advice.

479
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,173
I hear what you're saying,

480
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,375
but I think Karev thought
DeLuca was hurting you.

481
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,770
And I get that you have some
kind of history with bad guys,

482
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,446
but I just don't think
you should feel like

483
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,281
Karev is that kind of guy.

484
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:54,154
Uh. No. Oh, no.

485
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,618
You do not get to tell a woman
how she should feel

486
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,854
after she witnesses something
like what she witnessed

487
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,956
between Karev and DeLuca.

488
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,392
You don't know what it's like
to be female

489
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:05,494
watching men assert their authority

490
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:07,563
by throwing lethal punches.

491
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,788
You don't get an opinion on this.

492
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,602
You know... you're right.

493
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,841
You don't have to
listen to anyone on this

494
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,045
because you are a powerful woman
and you know your own mind.

495
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:26,348
- Thank you, Chief.
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,253
But Karev is a puppy dog.
And he wouldn't hurt a fly.

497
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:34,523
Unless he thought
that fly was hurting you.

498
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:43,165
- That's not true!
- She's entirely absent.

499
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,534
She said hello to me that first
morning and then she left.

500
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:46,627
She wanted to give us space.

501
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,437
That's literally all she gives you.

502
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:50,205
And I'm not the only one that sees it.

503
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,940
You seemed happy at your wedding mostly,

504
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,509
although she was awfully late.

505
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,544
Wait! She was late to the wedding?

506
00:22:55,578 --> 00:22:57,995
- She... panicked.
- And you married her anyway?

507
00:22:58,029 --> 00:22:59,414
Teddy, could you please
explain that marriage

508
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:02,284
isn't as simple as my sister
would want it to be?

509
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:03,719
I'm with her, Owen.

510
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,387
You married a patient

511
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,022
because he needed
your medical insurance.

512
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,390
Because he would've died without it.

513
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:09,884
- Sounds noble to me.
- It was.

514
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:11,527
Yeah, and then you
fell in love with him.

515
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,895
- You did?
- Because he was amazing.

516
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,630
She's not here, Owen.

517
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,698
She's in this hospital.
I see her walking the halls.

518
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,233
But she's not here.

519
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:19,801
Your family is gathered.

520
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:21,403
Is she family or not?

521
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:22,271
I don't need her here.

522
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:24,373
And you don't see a problem with that?

523
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:26,742
Why is your wife
not the person you turn to

524
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,644
- for comfort?
- Okay! You said it!

525
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:30,479
Okay? All of you. And I heard it.

526
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:32,412
- Is that it?
- No, that's not it!

527
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:35,039
Whatever happens
in your stupid marriage...

528
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:37,459
if I die...

529
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,456
I need you to promise me that
you'll take care of Farouk.

530
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:42,824
You'll do whatever you have to do.

531
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,550
You'll move wherever you have to move.

532
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,896
He is one half of my heart,
and you are the other half,

533
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,230
and I need to know that you've got him.

534
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,637
- Damn it, Megan.
- What?

535
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:58,073
I was gonna storm out, and you
just made that really hard!

536
00:23:58,107 --> 00:23:59,675
That was the whole design!

537
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:05,347
Ow. Ow. Don't me laugh.

538
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:08,917
Hey, babe.

539
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:10,485
Hey.

540
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,853
Are we laughing or crying?

541
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:13,488
Both.

542
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:16,158
Well, sorry to be the one
to break up the party,

543
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:19,661
but I was hoping to get
a little time alone with Megan.

544
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,867
Hey.

545
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:28,971
Arizona, hi! Come in. Close the door.

546
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:38,614
So, um... do you have
a patient in there now?

547
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:40,549
No. Just reviewing scans.

548
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,683
Wow!

549
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,552
Right? Aren't they beautiful?

550
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:46,188
Yes. Gosh. Wow. They're so colorful.

551
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:47,445
Mm-hmm.

552
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:50,993
And... you see here?

553
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,597
Here's where the tension's building.

554
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:59,234
And here...

555
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,405
...a little more tension.

556
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,607
Uh-huh... uh...

557
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:08,744
And here...

558
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:15,348
We're building...

559
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:17,819
toward climax.

560
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,221
Uh-huh.

561
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:22,658
And here... we have...

562
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:26,895
...release.

563
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,765
Uh-huh.

564
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,239
Mm-hmm.

565
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:34,993
The female brain is a magical place.

566
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:41,610
Ow!

567
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,034
- Oh, no!
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:44,216
Do not get down on that floor.

569
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,580
That is nasty. You do not
need to be down there.

570
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,749
- Are you gonna let me get through this?
- Probably not!

571
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:49,518
Okay, I made a real mess
of this the first time.

572
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:50,896
So I'd appreciate it if you'd shut up

573
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,721
- and let me get through it this time.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

574
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,022
It's hurting my knees.

575
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:55,724
Megan Hunt...

576
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,764
I have loved you
since the day I met you.

577
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,734
I don't know how I got through
these last 10 years without you.

578
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,602
And now that you're back,
I don't want to spend

579
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:10,072
one more day without knowing
that you and I have actually...

580
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:12,574
We have a match, Megan.

581
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,407
Oh.

582
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,245
Whoa. Sorry.

583
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,481
I'm so sorry.

584
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:20,882
I'm...

585
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,651
No, no, no. Don't... Don't be sorry.

586
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,953
I need that flesh to be fresh
when you sew it on me.

587
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:27,622
We can do this another time.

588
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:31,893
Are you ready?

589
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,132
- Are you?
- Absolutely.

590
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,001
Let's do this.

591
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,377
Hey.

592
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,278
Hey.

593
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,247
- How's Megan?
- She's gone to surgery.

594
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,916
Amelia, can we talk?
I just need a minute.

595
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,155
Amelia, I'm afraid
that something's wrong.

596
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,624
I mean, I know... I know
you go to your AA meetings

597
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,825
and they seem to help,

598
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,927
but I think you need something else.

599
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:14,665
Maybe... Maybe therapy.
Maybe medication.

600
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,802
I think you still have PTSD
from your brother's death.

601
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,671
I don't know. I don't know
because I'm not a shrink.

602
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,941
But I know the amazing person you are,

603
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,811
and no one in my life sees that.

604
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,513
The people who love me don't see that.

605
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:33,150
So when I look at you
through their eyes...

606
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,789
...I think something's wrong
and I want to help.

607
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,197
Your sister doesn't like me...

608
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,199
so I need therapy?

609
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,168
Your friend who is
clearly in love with you

610
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,804
does not like me, so I need medication?

611
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,174
Your mom, who's with a man
half her age, doesn't like me,

612
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,320
so I need help?

613
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,147
Well, thank you for the offer.

614
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,716
But I am about to go
perform a medical miracle,

615
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,120
so I kind of need to focus.

616
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,721
Amelia, I-I...

617
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,624
Oh, and, um, if you want Teddy
as much as she wants you,

618
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,692
you can have her.

619
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,094
Really. It's no skin off my back.

620
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,874
The Sub-I with the
glasses... he found the donor.

621
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,242
Sorry.

622
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,253
If you want to be a shark, be a shark.

623
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:34,979
Don't apologize for it.

624
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,563
Ten blade.

625
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,066
Ten blade.

626
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,541
Prep the recipient for the anastomosis.

627
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,082
Now, that's what it is.

628
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,385
You came here to find out what
your biological mother was like?

629
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,220
There it is.

630
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:52,823
Right there.

631
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,830
Do you and Meredith sit in galleries

632
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,298
and watch me while I operate

633
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,067
and talk about how much I'm like Ellis?

634
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,769
'Cause I'm kind of a hotshot
myself, if you haven't noticed.

635
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,440
Top of my class at Yale.
Youngest-ever head of cardio.

636
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,608
When I'm impressed with you,

637
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,744
I don't immediately credit Ellis.

638
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,315
I guess I like to take a little
of that credit for myself.

639
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,920
But maybe I shouldn't.

640
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,457
'Cause after that competitive
rant you just had?

641
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,958
Pure Ellis.

642
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,266
I'm Stephanie.

643
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,434
What?

644
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,970
Jo's been talking to me today,
confiding in me, and...

645
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,006
I think women keep each other's secrets

646
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,441
no matter how much unnecessary
drama that may cause.

647
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:48,645
But I can't, so I'm just
gonna tell you that...

648
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,102
she's afraid of you.

649
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:51,533
What?

650
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,851
She thinks you could hurt her.

651
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,085
Not emotionally.

652
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,888
She's afraid that you could
hurt her like you hurt DeLuca.

653
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,996
Look at that. You see the mastoid?

654
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,065
It's been completely
destroyed by the tumor.

655
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,000
And the nerve compression.
The pain must've been...

656
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,304
Unbearable.

657
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:18,042
Okay, DeLuca, I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.

658
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,184
Well, hot damn.

659
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,320
Would you look at that?
That is a perfect fit.

660
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,568
Dr. Avery? Dr. Shepherd
needs you in O.R. two.

661
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,103
Little busy here, DeLuca.
Uh, yeah, but...

662
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,704
she's got Beau Martinez on the table.

663
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,474
- And h-his jaw is...
- You've got to be kidding me!

664
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,445
I can't believe you
called me out of a surgery

665
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,613
because you started something
you don't know how to finish.

666
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,348
Well, you said you wouldn't
take his jaw apart.

667
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,017
That's right! So I took it apart.

668
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,052
I just need you to put it
back together again.

669
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,122
It's a little like LEGOS,
which I was never any good at.

670
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,924
I can't make this piece fit.

671
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,968
My arms are a little weak.

672
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,469
- Can you...?
- Yeah.

673
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,214
You ready?

674
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:07,060
Oh... wow.

675
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,000
Can you give us a minute?

676
00:33:27,182 --> 00:33:29,016
Am I alive?

677
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,004
You are.

678
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,154
- Dad?
- I'm right here, son.

679
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,589
It's not hurting.

680
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:37,925
It doesn't hurt.

681
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,563
That's great. That's great. Great.

682
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,432
Wow. That was incredible.

683
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,602
Right? That smile?
That is why we do what we do.

684
00:33:48,636 --> 00:33:51,271
Nope. That was not bravery or victory.

685
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:53,307
That was stupidity. And you got lucky.

686
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,342
You just can't be wrong, can you?

687
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:58,545
DeLuca, why don't we look at
this as a teaching moment, huh?

688
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,048
You saw how she handled that.
You realize how lucky she is

689
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,683
that I'm as good as I am,

690
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,985
how lucky she is that I didn't
report her to the medical board.

691
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:06,453
Because this is exactly
the kind of thing

692
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,955
that would prompt them to reevaluate

693
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,056
her license to practice medicine.

694
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,524
Do you understand me?

695
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:11,820
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

696
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:14,661
You keep it up, and your luck
is gonna run out.

697
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,873
You should've seen
what Shepherd tried...

698
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:28,186
Shh. I just got her down.

699
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:35,082
So, we gonna talk about
what you said to Maggie or what?

700
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,194
Why? Why would we do that?

701
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:37,651
We never talk about
anything that matters.

702
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:39,186
April, come on. What... What is this?

703
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,988
Montana.

704
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:43,223
We never talked about
what happened in Montana.

705
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:46,393
Would you like to?
I didn't realize we needed to.

706
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:49,396
Look, Jackson, I get that you're
really good at compartmentalizing.

707
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,598
You know, like, I'm your friend,
I'm your person,

708
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,568
I'm Harriet's mom,
and sometimes we have sex

709
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:56,537
and that's totally okay with you.

710
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,604
I get it.

711
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,574
It's just that you are
a lot better at it than I am.

712
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:05,512
Montana actually caused me pain.

713
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:06,880
Yeah, I thought I was...

714
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:08,682
I thought I was good.
I thought it was fine.

715
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:12,252
But then I spent weeks
wondering what it was.

716
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,288
And if it was nothing,

717
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:18,692
then it's just, like, casual sex.

718
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,282
Which, to me is...

719
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:35,242
I...

720
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:41,048
It causes me pain,
the way that we're doing this.

721
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,289
And I... I don't... I think
I probably have to move out.

722
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:05,272
- I can't believe it.
- What?

723
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,140
Megan. And what Grey did.

724
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:10,038
I mean, that surgery is
gonna put her on the map.

725
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,180
Did you talk to Amelia?

726
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,515
Yeah. Didn't go real well.

727
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,721
I'm sorry.

728
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:19,297
You know she hasn't stayed
at home in months?

729
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:22,089
A lot of months.

730
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:23,824
She doesn't touch me.

731
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,227
We don't...

732
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,331
She doesn't want to be married to me.

733
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,435
She said...

734
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:41,074
What? W-What did she say?

735
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:58,492
Owen.

736
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:01,061
You... You're married.

737
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,897
And you... are conflicted.

738
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,565
And you...

739
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,535
You are my favorite human on the planet.

740
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:13,373
And if we are meant to be more
in this lifetime,

741
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:17,411
it can't start with you cheating
on... on... on... on your wife.

742
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,499
She doesn't care.

743
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,380
But I care! And you care!

744
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:22,318
And I know you, Owen.

745
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,218
I know your guilt. I know your shame.

746
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:27,521
And I know what it'll do to you, so...

747
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:30,323
Let me stay your favorite person for now

748
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:32,292
and you stay mine, okay?

749
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,497
Okay.

750
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,400
I am s... I am so sorry. I...

751
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:42,436
No, no, no. No. No. No.

752
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,133
No. We are okay.

753
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:48,341
We are okay.

754
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,680
Dr. DeLuca, you still
looking for volunteers?

755
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:54,881
Always.

756
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,717
Because I am in the mood to celebrate.

757
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,085
Okay.

758
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,387
Ooh! Toys!

759
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:01,855
Purple, I think.

760
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,990
Nope... hot pink.

761
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:13,433
You're really
getting rid of all of them, huh?

762
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:14,468
I don't even want to look at them.

763
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:15,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Y-Y-You...

764
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,404
What about these?
Y-You getting rid of these, too?

765
00:38:17,438 --> 00:38:19,439
These are the least comfortable pair.

766
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:22,609
Only if you try to stand up in them.

767
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:24,678
Ooh.

768
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:30,136
You're so...

769
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:32,719
- Come here.
- What? What?

770
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:34,321
Sit down. These are my shoes.

771
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,657
Hey. Ciao.

772
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,966
Did you have to come
to the hospital I work at

773
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,648
to have women... masturbate in the MRI?

774
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:50,303
You don't think that's
the tiniest bit inappropriate?

775
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:54,241
No.

776
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:56,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who... Who is that?

777
00:38:56,511 --> 00:38:59,746
In the MRI. You said
it was a friend of mine?

778
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:04,045
As surgeons, we try to eliminate pain.

779
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:08,424
As humans, we just try
like hell to avoid it.

780
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,659
You have a minute?

781
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:15,095
Did you come to laugh at me again?

782
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:16,516
No.

783
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,802
You know, I-I found your husband.

784
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:27,541
- What?
- I hired a guy. I-I found his name.

785
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,276
I looked him up. And...

786
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,444
And then I went and found him.

787
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,280
Oh, my God, Alex.

788
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:34,447
Look.

789
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:35,949
You didn't ask me to do that,

790
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:39,052
and you... you didn't give me
permission to do that,

791
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,355
and it was wrong, and I-I'm sorry.

792
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:46,293
And, Jo, I-I swear to God,

793
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:50,007
I could never, ever hurt you.

794
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,533
My dad, he... he was like your ex.

795
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:56,570
I'm not like that, all right?
I'm not like my dad.

796
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,572
I mean, I do...
I do things that are wrong.

797
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,140
I do things that are stupid.

798
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:03,877
But... I swear to you...

799
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:05,581
I would never hurt you.

800
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:14,054
- You saw Paul?
- Yeah.

801
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,158
- And you didn't kill him?
- No.

802
00:40:18,192 --> 00:40:19,759
I mean, I thought about it.

803
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,529
But I-I-I... came home instead.

804
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,868
Okay.

805
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:58,698
When we can't avoid pain,
we try to understand it...

806
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,369
Hey.

807
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:03,536
Hey.

808
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:05,458
How's everything with Megan?

809
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,045
Yeah, she's...

810
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,280
She's perfect. Thank you.
You, um... You were incredible.

811
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:15,384
So what are you doing out here?

812
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,484
Well, um...

813
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,789
She doesn't want to be with me.

814
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:24,811
She, uh...

815
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:27,594
She thinks I'm still in love with you.

816
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,837
Meredith!

817
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,339
Hey, look. Can we talk?!

818
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,674
...with pithy little quotes

819
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,642
that we can wrap our heads around...

820
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,979
All right! Let's see my brain on...

821
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:50,083
Whoa! That is a beautiful tumor.

822
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,953
...like "Suffering is optional"...

823
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:54,891
Whose brain is that?

824
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,124
...or "Time heals all wounds"...

825
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,330
and my personal favorite,
"Every pain has a purpose."

826
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,175
God, I hope that one's true.

827
