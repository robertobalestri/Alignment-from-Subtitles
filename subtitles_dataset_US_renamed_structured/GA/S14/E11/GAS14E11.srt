Good news, ma'am.
It doesn't look like a heart attack.

87
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:09,755
May I have that?

88
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,995
I see you are a doctor,

89
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,468
so I'm sure you know that people
can confuse heart attacks

90
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,231
with basic indigestion or reflux...

91
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,173
I'm not confused.
Give me that.

92
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,317
Run a 15-lead EKG.

93
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:26,317

98
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,553
For a posterior EKG,

99
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:42,560
you want to put leads here...

100
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,927
and here...

101
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:47,880

102
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:49,768

Well, don't just stand there!

105
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,238
Now run it again!

106
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,769
Well?

107
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:17,171
Nothing.

108
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:20,405
I'm telling you, Doctor.
The EKG looks fine.

109
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,326
But how about
I take a family history

110
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,286
while we wait for
the cardiac enzymes?

111
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,294
We find out if there's
something else going on.

112
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,151
How about you go away <i>now?</i>
And bring me whomever is in charge?

113
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,392

114

115
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:49,824
You have three seconds
to get inside this house

116
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,596
before I come looking for you!

117
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:53,808
Three! Two!

118
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:55,976
One!

119
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,013
Now, what did I say about coming
in before the street lights?

120
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,759
That if I wasn't inside
before the first flicker,

121
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:04,731
you'd be on me
like white on rice,

122
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:08,356

in a snowstorm, in Antarctica.

123
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,143
And are the lights on?

124
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:14,089
I'm sorry, but I was just
reading in a tree. I promise.

125
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,486
Stuck up in a tree is no place
for a little girl.

126
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:20,334

132
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,780

133
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,819
<i>rather than make my sick patients sicker.</i>

134
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,499

135
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,889

136
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,969

139

140
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,562

141

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,995
Chief Maxwell.

147
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,491
We here at Seattle Presbyterian

153
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:17,073
Believe me, if you were having
a heart attack, I would not.

154
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:20,647
So you're taking your
intern's diagnosis over mine?

155
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,827
I'm taking the H&P, normal EKG,

156
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,756
and negative rapid troponin.

157
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,022
Miranda, we're running

158
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,381
a full cardiac enzyme panel
for good measure,

159
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,660
but trust me... it'll be normal.

160
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,527
My clinical judgment
tells me you're all good.

161
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:34,954
I most certainly am not "all good."

162
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,014
I have nausea, heartburn.

163
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,788
Any big stressors in your life lately?
Any big changes?

164
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,495
- Do not go down that road with me.
- What road is, uh...

165
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:46,243
The road where a woman shows up
in the ER with physical symptoms

166
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:47,468
and you decide that it must be

167
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:50,348
that she's not able to
handle all her feelings.

168
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,405
No, this is not about anxiety.

169
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,845
My secret heart doesn't need fixing.

170
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:56,396
My <i>actual</i> heart needs fixing.

171
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:59,546
Are you sure you're not experiencing
any unusual levels of stress?

172
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,612
- You're fired.
- This man is dead!

173
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,237
Miranda, just get in the car.

174
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,495
I'm gonna take care of myself.

175
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,225
I need $20 million.

176
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,475
I <i>am</i> having a heart attack.

177
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:15,747
And I'm not going anywhere

178
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:19,780
until you do a <i>full</i> cardiac
work-up and prove it.

179
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,940
<i>Paging Dr. Anderson
to Labor and Delivery.</i>

180
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,674
<i>Paging Dr. Anderson
to Labor and Delivery.</i>

181
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:31,177
Whatcha in for?

182
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,209
Uh, heart attack.

183
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,272
Mm. Whatcha workin' on?

184
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,409
Work.

185
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,551
No wonder you had a heart attack.

186
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,446
Sorry. Too soon?

187
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,814
I am Chief of Surgery
at Grey Sloan Memorial,

188
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:47,792
and my work doesn't stop
just because...

189
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,374
they want to take their sweet
time with their work-up!

190
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:51,857
Wow. Chief of Surgery.

191
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,811
Look at you.
Burning it down.

192
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,072
My work ethic sucks.

193
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,034
Drove my parents crazy.

194
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,733
I'm just grateful I had
a temp job when they died.

195
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,486
What are <i>you</i> in for?

196
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,616
Broken femur.
And a nasty road rash.

197
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,833
But, you know,
that what's I get

198
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,077
for... pushing my Kawasaki
to 100 on Route 10.

199
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,922
Needless to say, frequent flyer.

200
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:16,957
What, you not a fan of hogs?

201
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:20,683
Life is a gift, one that
I show my appreciation for

202
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,757
by not recklessly speeding
through mountain roads

203
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,744
on hogs or
anything else for that matter.

204
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,104
I wore a helmet!

205
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,970
Now, you want to talk
reckless?

206
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,641
- Skydiving in Costa Rica.
- Ooh.

207
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,989
That's reckless.

208
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,900
Plane almost lost a wing
on the way up.

209
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:39,713
Hell of a rush, though.

210
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,539
If you say so.

211
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,456
So no interest?

212
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:44,578
Zero.

213
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:45,751
Not even...

214
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,227
Not one iota.

215
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,479
Not buying it.
It's human nature.

216
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:52,510
Everyone has the need to be
a little bit reckless.

217
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:02,825
Ouch! Dang it!

218
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,525
Miranda!
Oh, my Lord!

219
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:06,854
Ohh!

220
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:09,003
I'm okay.
I just scraped my elbow.

221
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,182
Why on Earth weren't you riding
with your training wheels?!

222
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,665
Because I'm in junior high!

223
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,283
And all the other kids pick
on me for using training wheels.

224
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,058
Like they pick on me
for wearing high waters.

225
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,119
Well, I don't want your hem
getting caught up.

226
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,323
And we don't need you tripping,
falling, and busting your head.

227
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,650
I know how to walk.

228
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:27,900
Come on in here.
We gonna clean this up.

229
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,870
<i>Paging Nurse Alvarez.</i>

230
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,494
You seem agitated.

231
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,954
She's having a heart attack
and you're not helping her.

232
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,182
That's agitating.

233
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,892
Thank you.

234
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,533
Let's discuss diet and exercise.

235
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,908
Any significant changes
lately?

236
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,502
Um...

237
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,619
A few years back, my levels
were a little high.

238
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:51,408
I got them under control.
They've been steady ever since.

239
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,424
I take my steps,
drink my green drinks...

240
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:56,178
So no spicy foods or...?

241
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:59,791
You went to Yale Medical School,
as I recall.

242
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,537
- Mm-hmm.
- Ivy League.

243
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:05,322
Is there actual ivy there
or is that just a thing?

244
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:07,775
Dr. Bailey, I would rather
discuss your health

245
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:09,143
than my education.

246
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,643
But, yes. There is actual ivy.
It's not just a thing.

247
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:14,650
Oh. Well, then.
I learned something new today.

248
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,611
Which is more than you can say
for your days at Yale.

249
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:20,564
Because apparently your teachers
didn't get the memo

250
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,135
that women's heart attacks

251
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,682
don't manifest the way
they do in men.

252
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,846
They're not all
chest-clutching, vomiting,

253
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:30,099
"help, my arm is numb,"
boom... floor drop.

254
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,986
Look. Just... Just give me

255
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:34,161
a cardiac stress test, Dr. Maxwell.

256
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,337
Dr. Bailey, I can tell y...

257
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:37,947
Just give her the damn
stress test, Maxwell.

258
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,775
Any medications you take regularly?

259
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,768
Um, other than statins

260
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,475
and anti-depressants
to manage OCD, no.

261
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:50,940
Hm.

262
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,531
<i>Everything's under control.
We're good.</i>

263
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:55,900
<i>You good, Miranda?</i>

264
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:59,293
I put my hands in those
patients, and they died.

265
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,674
I feel so... dirty.

266
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,994
Accept that
you have a disease, Bailey.

267
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,686
Accept help.

268
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,055
Don't do that.

269
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:09,929
Do what?

270
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:13,361
I am a sci-fi-loving

271
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,500
African-American woman
in her 40s

272
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,596
with a stubborn husband,
a beautiful son,

273
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:21,189
and... no pets because
they smell like feet.

274
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,702
And I have a big job

275
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,096
where I do big, lifesaving,
miracle-working things...

276
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,098
where I lead others
so that they can do

277
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,291
their big, lifesaving,
miracle-working thing.

278
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,518
And, yes, I have
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

279
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,877
I am not ashamed of that.

280
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,796
But it's not my story.
It's just one piece.

281
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,102
And if you continue to look
at just that one piece...

282
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,791
if you check the "mental illness" box

283
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,439
and refuse to look at
anything else...

284
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,665
then I'm not gonna live long enough

285
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,211
to finish
the rest of my story.

286
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:53,682
Give me the cardiac stress test,
Dr. Maxwell.

287
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,341
Miranda, you do not need
a stress test.

288
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,135
Okay, then I want a second opinion.

289
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,804
If you're not happy with your
care here, you're free to leave.

290
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,768
Oh, and drop dead
in the parking lot?

291
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,563
No. That is not how my story ends.

292
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,450
Second opinion.
Please.

293
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,533
And preferably not a Yale grad!

294
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:15,040
All that ivy seems to
have poisoned your brain!

295
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,955
Ha! You tell 'im!

296
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,385
If something happens to me,

297
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:25,158
do not let them hook me up to
anything.

298
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:28,304
And if something happens to <i>me,
</i> hook me up.

299
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,236
I want extraordinary measures.

300
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,361
The more extraordinary,
the better.

301
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,291
Seriously.

302
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,799
- Seriously.
- Seriously?

303
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,432
Dr. Bailey. I'm Dr. Gregory.

304
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,871
Finally! I've been waiting
for the stress test

305
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,718
and cardiac consult
for the last half-hour.

306
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:49,522
Well, I <i>am</i> here for a consult,
but I'm not a cardiologist.

307
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,991
I am a psychiatrist,
and I was hoping that we could talk.

308
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,382
♪♪

309
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,567
Dr. Bailey?

310
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:18,249
Yeah, I need you
to meet me in the pit.

311
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,965
I'm on my way. <i>Not our pit.</i>

312
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,898
The pit at Seattle Presbyterian.

313
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,129
- Seattle Presbyt...
- <i>Sh... No, no. Don't say it out loud.</i>

314
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,531
<i>And don't tell anyone
you're coming.</i>

315
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,723
Just get here.
Fast. That's an order.

316
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,233
Also a request.

317
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,813
I'll be right there.

318
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:35,725
Let's talk about your home life.

319
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,694
You have a husband, yes?

320
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,069
Yes.
A husband who is a doctor.

321
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,935
<i>Was</i> a doctor. Now he's a firefighter.

322
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:46,981
It's not easy to be the wife
of a first responder,

323
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,470
knowing your loved ones

324
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,148
run into situations
that most run away from.

325
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,679
He is not the reason
I'm having a heart attack.

326
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:57,273
But is that the reason
that he's not here?

327
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,017
'Cause he's fighting fires, or...?

328
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:00,937
Okay, Dr. Gregory,
with all due respect

329
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,796
to your field of medicine,

330
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:06,156
I need you to understand
that every second we waste,

331
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,278
I'm losing heart muscle.

332
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:12,124
My vessels are constricting.
My heart is being damaged.

333
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,429
I'm a doctor. You should, at the
very least, acknowledge that.

334
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,360
Fair enough, Dr. Bailey.

335
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,413
Well, then, if you'll humor me,

336
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,366
I'd like to ask you for a consult.

337
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,499
I have a patient...

338
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,437
a-a woman who has a big job
with big responsibilities.

339
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,579
Manages life-and-death
scenarios on the daily.

340
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,827
She also has a history of
mental illness.

341
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,187
And I have assessed
limited coping skills.

342
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,929
I see no data to support
her self-diagnosis

343
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:40,890
despite repeated tests.

344
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,759
And on top of that,
I see no support system in place.

345
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,358
No friends or family in sight.

346
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,178
Dr. Bailey,
if you were this woman's doctor

347
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:52,413
and you were looking
at her chart,

348
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,315
what would <i>you</i> think?

349
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,265
63% of women who die suddenly
from coronary heart disease

350
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,822
had no previous symptoms,

351
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,148
and women of color are
at a <i>far</i> greater risk.

352
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:10,085
So if I were consulting
on the patient your describe,

353
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,858
I would take into
consideration statistics

354
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:16,499
that would never even occur
to people who look like you.

355
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,898
And I do have a support system.

356
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,538
And a beautiful child

357
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,827
who had a history presentation
this morning

358
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,937
and who is now
on his mid-morning break.

359
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:31,491
So if you'll excuse me,
we're done here.

00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,054

or showing our bellies
or admitting weakness.

523
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,741
No one is gonna think any
less of you.

524
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,214
Okay, when you came back
from being electrocuted,

525
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:32,061
it was All Hail the Conquering Hero.

526
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:35,319
Nobody doubted your ability
to come back.

527
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,426
- Miranda, this is not...
- No, do not "Miranda" me.

528
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:41,241
This is a battle
you've never had to fight.

529
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,780
It's taken me <i>way</i> too long
to feel tall there.

530
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,740
And I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let a blocked artery

531
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,054
take me down a peg.

532
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:51,073
Will you at least let us call Ben?

533
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:54,116
Let him know you're all right?

534
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:57,228
Is this really something
you want to keep a secret?

535
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,465
Your mother isn't trying
to hold you back.

536
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:03,459
She's trying to keep you safe.

537
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:08,428
She's trying to keep you alive,

538
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,967
the way she couldn't
keep your sister alive.

539
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,578
I had a sister?

540
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:17,787
It was before
you were even born.

541
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,772
Her name was Danielle.

542
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,033
She lived two months.

543
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,389
Sids.

544
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,725
We felt helpless.

545
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,562
Took me a long time

546
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,264
to understand it wasn't our fault.

547
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,630
To forgive myself.

548
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,631
But your mother never could.

549
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,381
So when you were born,

550
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:42,631
she swore she'd never let
anything bad happen to you.

551
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:48,217
Every single day, she lives
with the fear of losing you.

552
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,415
Hmnh. No transferring.
And no calling my husband.

553
00:25:58,483 --> 00:25:59,686
I'll be fine.

554
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:03,881
I will rest and recover and
be back to work by tomorrow.

555
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:06,531
So if you think you're
keeping me out that contest,

556
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,545
you got another thing coming.

557
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:10,139
- Dr. Bailey...
- No. I-I've made up my mind!

558
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,045
What happens at Seattle Pres

559
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:14,914
stays at Sea...

560
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:19,257
Her pressure's dropping.

561
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,727
I need an intra-aortic
balloon pump tray STAT!

562
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:25,414
Okay. Someone page Maxwell! Now!

563
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,560
Ohh.

564
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,027
Okay. Just breathe.

565
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,783
Breathe normal.

566
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:33,156
Miranda. Breathe normal.
Relax.

567
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,376
Hold on, Dr. Bailey.

568
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,775
Start dopamine at five mikes
per kig per minute.

569
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:42,388
She could have a coronary
dissection.

570
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:44,417
Maybe. Her artery was
extremely torturous.

571
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:45,637
Maybe if you had diagnosed her

572
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,263
before she was actively
having a heart attack,

573
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,588
you could've taken your time
with the procedure

574
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,880
instead of having to rush through it!

575
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:51,867
I followed the protocol
for ischemic heart disease.

576
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:53,559
Did you do a cardiac stress test?

577
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:56,512
If you had, you would've seen this

578
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:57,883
long before it became emergent.

579
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,674
Now not only has your stent failed,

580
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,588
but we have to get her
up to the O.R. immediately.

581
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,734
We?

582
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,445
They're talking about doing
an emergency C-section.

583
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:07,946
They can talk all they want.

584
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:10,577
I'm not going to Mercy West.
This baby is not coming out.

585
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,700
- I need a ride.
- You could lose it. You know this.

586
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:15,319
- Things just happen.
- No! The world just doesn't happen!

587
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:17,715
Okay? It's not on God!
It's on me!

588
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,791
Stop it! Stop it.

589
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:22,531
Okay, you're right.
Cars are not safe for children.

590
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:26,485
Okay? Neither are bookcases or squirrels.

591
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:27,999
They're all gonna get your baby.

592
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:31,773
You feel this way
because you are a parent.

593
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:35,508
It'll pass. Mostly.
Some of it never will.

594
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:39,472
No! Oh, no! No, no! No!

595
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,807
The elevators aren't working!

596
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,576
Turn the elevators back on!

597
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,841
Turn them back on!

598
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,498
Oh! Damn it!

599
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:51,183
No, no, no.
Keep breathing.

600
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,476
The IABP will get you stabilized, okay?

601
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:54,764
Get her straight to the O.R.

602
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:56,511
Prep her for a repeat angio
and sternotomy.

603
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,281
A sternotomy?! N-No. No way.

604
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,552
Dr. Pierce, she's likely
going to need a CABG.

605
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,578
Not in two days or two hours, but now.

606
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,569
If you open up her chest, you will be
putting her through hell for no reason.

607
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,299
Angioplasty is no longer an option.

608
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,992
Do the graft via keyhole procedure.

609
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,399
It's far less invasive.

610
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,310
It's a 3-inch incision, max.

611
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,007
You can't. You don't know how.

612
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:16,724
A conventional approach is the safest.

613
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,342
Says the man who ignored
his patient for half the day,

614
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,785
insisted that she was wrong, and
now put her in this position,

615
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:23,670
which she should've never been
in, in the first place.

616
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:26,062
So please step aside
and give me privileges.

617
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:27,513
Huh.

618
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,148
Larry, we've known
each other for a long time,

619
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:33,059

620
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,113
If you give Dr. Pierce privileges,

621
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:38,841
you will be extremely happy
that you did.

622
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,170
For old time's sake?

623
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,747

Fine. I'll do this for you, Richard.

- Okay, let's go.

It's okay.

632

Mom, we've been through this.

633
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,123
You can't become a surgeon
unless you go to medical school.

634
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,802
I'm saying... speech pathology.

635
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,262
It's still a helping profession.

636
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,037
Plus, you can make your own hours,

637
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:12,568
which is no small thing
when starting a family.

638
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,560
Speech pathology is boring.

639
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:16,780
And what's the matter with boring?

640
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,500
Being a surgeon

641
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:20,758
is the highest-stress job
you could have.

642
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,490

697

698

705
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,265
Me neither.

706
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,880
I'm dating Dr. Bailey.

707
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,810
I know the drill.
I know you.

708
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,721
Oh, maybe it's a phrase.
"My question to you." Anybody?

709
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,101
- How many letters?
- 13.

710
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:56,763
No. It's 14. Count again.

711
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:57,905
I just counted.

712
00:32:57,973 --> 00:32:59,842
What, you have X-ray vision
from across the room?

713
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,452
"Will you marry me"
is "my question to you."

714
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,059
And the reason why that it's so easy

715
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,440
is because I made the crossword.

716
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,242
The phrase has 14 letters.

717
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,153
"Will," 4, "you," 7, "marry," 12, "me."

718

727
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,049

728
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:51,724
That's what
you're asking her to do

729

Ohh.

734

Wagyu beef brisket sandwiches.

735
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,635
- Garlic mashed potatoes.
- Wow.

736
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:10,815
Mm-hmm. Oh, I will not have you
drinking that swill.

737

738

Mwah.

741
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:27,167
You don't get to make

742

without a heads-up anymore.

743
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,715
You don't say, "Maybe
I'll apply to be an intern.

We'll see how it goes.

745

758
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:17,172

763
