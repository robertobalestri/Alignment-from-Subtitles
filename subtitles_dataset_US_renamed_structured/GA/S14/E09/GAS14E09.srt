It's "Nanny has the flu day and

Good morning!

- Hey.
- You know what we should do?

17
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:35,068
We should do like a breakfast
or a pre-work double date...

18
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:36,272
- Never.
- What?

19
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,482
- Carina.
- Dr. Bello's rounds are too early,

20
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,732
and she doesn't want to get fired.

21
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,716
Not hungry!
And I don't want to get fired.

22
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,670
Or be late to rounds,
which I am.

23
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,193
Bye.

24
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,755
You know, we live together now.

25
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:49,249
Playing house with a stalker.
How sweet.

26
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,522
It's not playing house, when it's
an actual monogamous relationship

27
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:52,679
that goes past three months.

28
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,522
So, if you ever get there,
please let me know.

29
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,139
When you were a baby, I wanted
to put a pillow

30
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,452

- Okay, Carina.

31
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:59,060

00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,091
Maggie, how long
are we going to do this?

35
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:09,326
All right?
It was kind of sexy at first,

36
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,248
the petulance, the silence,

37
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:14,615
- but now...
- Petulance? Wow. Pot, kettle.

38
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,908
Who's the pot? I'm not the pot.
You think I'm the pot?

39
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,021
Petulance is childlike sulkiness.

40
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,724
You are a grown man who never
learned how to apologize.

41
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,374
I am excellent at apologizing

42
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,287
when I've actually done
something wrong.

43
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,654
My mom always said

44
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,029
men show you who they are
from the very beginning,

45
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,302
if you're paying attention.

46
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:33,599
I'm pretty sure she stole
that from Maya Angelou.

00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,865
<i>It takes almost 15 years
to prepare to be a surgeon.</i>

48
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:57,771
Can I sit with you?

49
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,552
I'd like that.

50
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,900
<i>But no matter
how much you prepare...</i>

51
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,591
<i>15 years isn't enough.</i>

52
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,521
He's been in there for days.

53
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:07,973
Has he slept?

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,334
He sleeps.

55
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:10,456
In the chair.

56
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,107
How worried should we be,

57
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:14,255
like on a scale
from one to super worried?

58
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,841
I think he's okay.

59
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:17,666
I think...

60
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:19,802
I think he'll be okay.

61
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,732
I'm not so sure about Alex.

62
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,873
No progress on Kimmie?

63
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,242
I found a doctor in Chicago

64
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,762
who's doing a similar
kind of ultrasound research.

65
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:29,024
Uh... she hasn't published
much yet,

66
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,829
but I'm hoping she's further
along in the process than I am.

67
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,579
Text me
if anything changes.

68
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,493
- Whoa. Where are you going?
- Rounds.

69
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:44,915
- Uh, skip this one.
- Uh, I really can't.

70
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,579
No, you can because
Ollie is dying,

71
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,365
and Richard doesn't need
to hear you say it again.

72
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,455
There are protocols.

73
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:50,907
When you break them,
you're Meredith Grey.

74
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,434
When I break them,
I get a write-up.

75
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:55,001
Okay. Fine.
Just do it out here.

76
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:56,532
Okay.

77
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:58,688
Roy?

78
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:02,899
But I need to see the patient's
latest vitals, in the room...

79
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,852
Be creative. Qadri?

80
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,204
Uh...
That's... right...

81
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,633
That's Molly...?

82
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,479
Ollie. Olive Warner.
She's 66.

83
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,399
End-stage liver failure
and cardiomyopathy.

84
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,085
Surgical protocols were rejected
in favor of end-of-life support.

85
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,094
Excellent, Bello. Move along.

86
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:24,321
It's the chemo that makes me
so sick, not the tumor.

87
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,290
No, it's the chemo
that's keeping you alive.

88
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:29,048
It's the chemo that's making me
wish I wasn't alive!

89
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,821
Come back later.

90
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,430
Kimmie...

91
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,868
I tried it your way, Dr. Alex!

92
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:39,977
All this time, I stayed here,
and I tried to shrink the tumor,

93
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,920
and I waited on
your miracle cure.

94
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,719
It didn't come,
and it sucks.

95
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:44,894
But...

96
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,337
it's not your fault.

97
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,109
You tried.

98
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:54,290
Now... just...
I want to go see some shows.

99
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,985
I want to see Broadway before I die.

100
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,915
And not just on my computer.

101
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:01,594
I... I want to touch it,
and I want to smell it,

102
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:03,954
and I want to sing...

103
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,680
like I'll just stand on
the street,

104
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,501
and I'll sing. On Broadway.

105
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,449
Maybe that sounds ridiculous,
but...

106
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,594
it's my dream.

107
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:16,617
I've... I-I have a surgery
on another kid to prep for,

108
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,103
but when I'm finished,
I'm going to come straight back here,

109
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,618
and we'll talk about this.

110
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,124
Over ice cream.

111
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,219
I'll even bring
the peanut butter to put on top,

112
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:25,844
as gross as I think that is.

113
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:29,233
Just hang tight.
Okay?

114
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,093
Okay.

115
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,009
<i>Dr. Aronson to the ER.</i>

116
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,317
She's not taking any food?

117
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,312
Are you the only one
doing the the feedings?

118
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,765
My mom has her when I work.

119
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,414
Oh, okay, good.

120
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:56,127
Hey, something is going on
with you, little one.

121
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,396
We're going to figure out
what it is, okay?

122
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,492
Obviously,
I think that might be her heart.

123
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,470
She has a coarctation of the aorta,

124
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,008
and I think that maybe
we should start her

125
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,142
- on...
- I'm sorry.

126
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,867
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

127
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,476
- Every time I look at you...
- You'd like another doctor.

128
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,195
I-I know you were Ruby's

129
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,332
No, I was... I was her doctor in utero,

130
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,500
and now that she's out,
it's perfectly appropriate.

131
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:18,818
I will have someone else
come and see her.

132
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,844
Whatever you need,
Matthew.

133
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,468
No! No, no, no.

134
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:31,626
They do not go in there.

135
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,491
Are you serious?
This is a teaching hospital.

136
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,187
Yeah. Well,
this is a teaching moment.

137
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:38,265
He is a father who lost the
mother of his baby in childbirth.

138
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,936
And now the baby has
a failure to thrive,

139
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,101
and he is breaking,
and he needs a minute!

140
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:44,721
Go!

141
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,484
Ruby has failure to thrive?

142
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,117
What do you think it is?

143
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,211
April, please don't go in there.

144
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,656
No, I won't.

145
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,617
You know, I have research

146
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:03,177
- to do.
- Look, I am your chief,

147
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,888
and I made you my right hand
for a reason.

148
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,486
So you can cover my service
for one day

149
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,601
while I get caught up
on my TrailBlazer.

150
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,500
You know everybody's calling it
the TailBlazer, right?

151
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,468
Excuse me.

152
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,077
Are you Chief Bailey?

153
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:16,297
I am.

154
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,547
Hey, how you doing this morning,
Dr. Bailey?

155
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:20,132
I'm Agent Martin Fields.

156
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:23,304
I... I need to talk
with one of your surgeons.

157
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,084
Uh, Agent Fields?
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,375
Are you FBI? Or...

159
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:30,367
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

160
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:34,140
Yeah, it says here
it's a surgical intern.

161
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,531

Okay, if this is about
Mr. Bartlett's ventilator,

165
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:54,903
I barely bumped it,
and the plug

166
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,828
was never technically all
the way out of the socket...

167
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:57,997
It's not about that.

168
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,958
Good, because I think
it was already loose.

169
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,114
If anything, I saved him...

170
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,358
We don't have a lot of time,
but I need you to pay attention,

171
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,786
and I need you to stay calm.

172
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,271
Okay, he's waiting in my office.

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,388
Who is?

174
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,725
There's an agent from
Immigration and Customs here,

175
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:12,857
and he wants to speak to you.

176
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,081
No. No, no, no, no.

177
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,470
Okay, Bello,
what is this about?

178
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,854
- Are you undocumented?
- No! I'm a Dreamer.

179
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,401
I'm... I'm here under DACA.

180
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,143
I have a work permit,
so I'm protected.

181
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:25,182
Okay, and everything is
up to date, your status?

182
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,213
Of course! The only way
I could get deported

183
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:29,034
is if I break the law, but I-I don't!

184
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,081
I... I don't speed. I don't do drugs.

185
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,786
- I don't do anything wrong.
- Okay. This is good.

186
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:38,069
Okay, so they probably just want
to check your papers or something.

187
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,097
No.

188
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,792
I have to run. I-I-I have to hide.

189
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,282
- I...
- Bello, Bello, calm down.

190
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,891
I have a friend from high school.

191
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,377
She... She was at work...
an intern in a law firm.

192
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:51,110
ICE came to her work. They
said they just wanted to talk.

193
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,305
Two days later, she was
dropped off in Mexico City

194
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,322
with a bag of clothes
and a check from her family

195
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,790
she had no way of cashing.

196
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,876
She just...
She doesn't even speak Spanish.

197
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,024
She came here
when she was 2.

198
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,758
Dr. Bailey, how do I calm down?

199
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,048
Okay, I found Dr. Bello.

200
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,493
- Great! 
- Sadly, she is in surgery.

201
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,141
And how long will that take?

202
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,454
Well, it's a renal
reconstruction

203
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,094
with ureteral implantation.

204
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:22,540
If all goes well, barring
any complications, it's...

205
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,071
difficult to say, at this point,

206
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:26,289
when it would be over.

207
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,610
When will you know?

208
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,915
When it's over.

209
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:31,206
- Ah.
- Yeah.

210
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,917
I will wait.

211
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,876
Okay!

212
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:52,390
Hey, I need you to postpone
this morning's colectomy.

213
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,290
And, Helm, I need a favor.

214
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,516
You didn't call me Hellmouth.

215
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,141
What's wrong? Who died?

216
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,977
Is it Vik?

217
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,672
Tom Koracick sings your praises.

218
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,413
- Oh, Tom.
- I know. I'd love to compare data.

219
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,274
We successfully did the
ultrasound procedure

220
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:10,423
on a hypothalamic tumor,

221
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,807
but we have a patient
with a mass

222
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:13,416
that's encroaching on Wernicke's area.

223
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,361
I'm giving a lecture next week at UW.

224
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:17,196
Maybe I stay a few extra days,

225
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,400
and we can share acoustic
spectrum secrets.

226
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:20,765
That would be incredible.
And I bet

227
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,293
I can get the foundation
to pay for your expenses.

228
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,368
- How's that?
- The foundation?

229
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,021
Grey Sloan is a
Harper Avery hospital.

230
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,451
Oh.

231
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,477
Shoot. I didn't realize that.

232
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,101
Is that a problem?

233
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,037
Yes, unfortunately, it is.
I'm really sorry, Dr. Shepherd.

234
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,529
Nice talking to you.

235
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:38,787
Good luck!

236
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,459
Wait...

237
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,506
What was that?

238
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:46,029
Dr. DeLuca, uh, Dr. Grey needs you.

239
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:47,193
Dr. Grey?

240
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,561
DeLuca's on my service today.

241
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,365
I'm sorry, but she needs you
right now.

242
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:53,904
She's 3 months old, and she
has a coarctation of the aorta.

243
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,084
Her complaints include
occasional vomiting,

244
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,310
difficulty feeding, failure to thrive,

245
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,718
tachycardia, irritability.

246
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:01,552
We were hoping we could hold off
on cardiac repairs

247
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,632
- until she got older, but
- Did you talk to Karev?

248
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,390
Well, he has a surgery
that can't wait,

249
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,319
which is why I'm giving her
to you in the meantime

250
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:10,717
because I trust you,
and I need this baby to be okay.

251
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,788
- Mm.
- She's going to need a cardiac consult.

252
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:15,288
Dad is emotional...
this is a hard place for him to be...

253
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:18,131
but you cannot let him leave
with her.

254
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,068
Okay, but I have a busy pit today,
so...

255
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,137
I'll cover it.

256
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,678
Sorry. I was eavesdropping.

257
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,060
I'll cover the pit. You
just take care of Ruby.

258
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:27,033
Please.

259
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:29,826
Okay. I'll take care of them.

260
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,539
Who even called them, okay?
They can't just take you.

261
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,648
They can, Andrew.

262
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,146
They can detain me for
as long as they want.

263
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,553
And if they decide to, they can
send me back to El Salvador.

264
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:39,898
But you don't even...

265
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,285
- Have you ever even been to El Salvador?
- No.

266
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,130
My entire family moved here
when I was one.

267
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,677
I don't know a single person there.

268
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,082
You should get married.

269
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,190
People have green card marriages
all the time.

270
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,107
Right. Okay. Let's do it. Today!

271
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,121
What? You're ready
to get married?

272
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,842
- Well, I... Do you not want to?
- No, yeah.

273
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,787
I-I-I just, I thought we were
still figuring stuff out.

274
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,134
Yeah, no, it is soon.
It's really soon, but...

275
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,428
I just didn't know that you were
there... that we were there yet.

276
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,959
No, sure, but I want to see
if we can get there.

277
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,069
And we can't get there
if you're not here,

278
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:08,327
so if we need to get there to
see if we can get there, then...

279
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,566
Okay, let's just keep
our eye on the prize, okay?

280
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,410
- Right.
- Right.

281
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,574
It won't work.

282
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,527
It doesn't work that way
for Dreamers.

283
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,051
Getting married
won't give me legal status.

284
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:24,395
Well, bright side, that was the
worst proposal I've ever seen.

285
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:25,892
No, no, no. I wasn't...

286
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,832
That's not
how I would actually do it!

287
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,797
Okay, we'll figure
something else out.

288
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,011
Oh, here she is!

289
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:36,201
Dr. Robbins is here!

290
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,404
Hi. Dr. Robbins, I don't think
they actually gave me the epidural

291
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,941
because I still feel the soccer
ball with the knife-like edges.

292
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,271
I just increased her dose.
I know it hurts, Lanie,

293
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,287
but it's going to kick in
any minute now, okay?

294
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,713
Is everything progressing well?

295
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,457
Yes. She's five centimeters
dilated

296
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,327
and contracting
three to four times in ten.

297
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,380
Great! So you are
in active labor now.

298
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,013
So the baby's heart is okay?

299
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,656
And my heart is okay?

300
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,395
Everything looks really great, Lanie.

301
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,728
She has a history of a Fontan
operation for a single ventricle,

302
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,295
which was also evolving in the baby.

303
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:05,966
So I did a fetal aortic
valvuloplasty at 26 weeks,

304
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,741
and it's been smooth sailing
for the little guy.

305
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,294
Isn't a C-section indicated?

306
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,021
- I wish!
- No.

307
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,654
A vaginal delivery is safer here.

308
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,639
There's more potential for blood
loss with a C-section.

309
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,912
But then it would be over faster.

310
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,110
I know. I know that it hurts, okay?

311
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,106
Just keep breathing. Keep breathing.

312
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,013
I want an EKG, her most recent echo,

313
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:26,566
a nasal cannula,
oxytocin, bisoprolol,

314
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:30,301
digoxin, and a setup for vacuum
delivery all by Lanie's bedside.

315
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,029
Oh, I also want
a cardiologist on standby.

316
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,863
Am I missing something?
You just said she was fine.

317
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,535
Wait. Are we supposed to lie to moms?

318
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:38,849
Arizona, she's fine.

319
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,100
You have too many statistics

320
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,560
from the maternal mortality
project in your head.

321
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,836
She's not showing any signs of...

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,380
Neither was the last patient
who died postpartum.

323
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,199
She wasn't showing any signs of anything.

324
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:49,598
Go get my stuff.

325
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,699
- Any word?
- Still at it.

326
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,222
Let need to be clear with you,
Dr. Bailey.

327
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,658
If you're lying about
the whereabouts of Dr. Bello,

328
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,059
you're breaking federal law.

329
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:10,194
Oh, I am clear on that, sir.

330
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:14,766
And I assure you that Dr. Bello
is in an operating room.

331
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,339
Did Dr. Bello break any laws?

332
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,270
I'm not at liberty
to discuss her case with you.

333
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:25,308
I apologize.

334
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,089
Stomach trouble?

335
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,848
Always.

336
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,380
When was your last physical?

337
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,224
Why do you ask?

338
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,893
Because you've been sitting
still for quite some time,

339
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,365
and your jugular is bulging so much

340
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,164
that I can see your pulse
from here.

341
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,566
I'm gonna say 120, resting.

342
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,126
May I?

343
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:54,106
- Let's see.
- Dr. Bailey, you don't...

344
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,621
Mm-hmm.

345
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:58,577
Hmm.

346
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,345
Yep. Your pulse is irregular.

347
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,008
Have you seen a cardiologist?

348
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,715
Dr. Bailey, let's not play
this game, okay?

349
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,212
I'm just doing my job.

350
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:08,348
As am I, Agent Fields.

351
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,301
Look, heart health is nothing
to mess around with.

352
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,689
I will just wait here
for Dr. Bello, okay?

353
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,347
Thank you, though.

354
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:19,207
Mm-hmm.

355
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,066
- Bello's from El Salvador?
- Barely.

356
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,810
But if we don't come up
with something,

357
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,053
they're going to put her in
a van, put a bag over her head,

358
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,404
and send her back there.

359
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,827
I don't think that's how it works.

360
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:38,857
Still, I need ideas.
Don't you know anyone?

361
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,262
- What?
- Your dad...

362
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,740
he was a drug dealer, right?

363
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,179
Isn't there an underground or something?

364
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,973
My dad was a drug <i>user.</i>
<i>He didn't know crap.</i>

365
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,076
You know who you should talk to?

366
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,745
You're going to need $1,500.

367
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:52,447
- I don't have...
- We'll get it.

368
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,815
You're going to go to New York,

369
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,682
and you're going to talk
to a guy named Mikey.

370
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:56,816
I'll vouch for you.

371
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,188
Mikey will file a false police report

372
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,359
and get you a death certificate.

373
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,929
It's usually from someone
who died in another country.

374
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,426
The tricky part is getting the corpse,

375
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:07,428
but Mikey has some sort of side
hustle with the city morgue.

376
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:10,264
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- I don't want to become another person!

377
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,434
It worked for me.

378
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,267
Is that what you did?
You faked your death?

379
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,309
No. That was my Plan B.

380
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,311
I just legally changed my name,
and I moved states.

381
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,910
But I was just hiding from
a person, not a whole country.

382
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,843
I graduated college magna cum laude.

383
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,145
I was valedictorian of my high school.

384
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,910
I was captain of the dance squad.

385
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,647
Okay, what does that have to do with...

386
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:28,732
She's saying she's not

387
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:30,284
the fake-your-own-death kind of person.

388
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

389
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,888
So we'll think of something else.

390
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,872
Okay, so what exactly
is the problem, then,

391
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,988
or what was the problem?

392
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,520
I really can't say.

393
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,777
I'm just trying to help here.

394
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:57,311
So, did you used to work for us?

395
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,004
Or is this a noncompete situation?

396
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:00,816
No, I mean I cannot say.

397
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,000
I signed a legal agreement that
says that I can't talk about

398
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,816
the legal agreement that I signed.

399
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,789
Okay, well, my grandfather
has passed,

400
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,910
so you can feel free
to discuss anything with me.

401
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,199
- Where'd she go?
- Yeah. She does that.

402
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,207
What? That's rude.

403
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,324
All right, we'll get
somebody else, then.

404
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:20,568
No, there is no one else. I need her.

405
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,703
I can't look at Alex
and tell him that I'm done

406
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,104
trying to save his favorite patient.

407
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,106
I need fresh eyes. I need fresh in...

408
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,473
I-I need her.

409
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,246
- Hey.
- Hey.

410
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,856
Lanie wants to walk around
and let gravity do its job...

411
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,209
Oh, no. No, no.
She needs continuous monitoring.

412
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:36,521
<i>Code blue!</i>

413
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,751
Are you okay?

414
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,184
<i>It's hard.</i>

415
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,783
It's hard to see Matthew here with Ruby.

416
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,918
I know, and I'm so sorry about
that, but Lanie is fine.

417
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:47,391
She's progressing well, and
she's experiencing no signs...

418
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,563
Crash cart.

419
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,598
- What?
- I... I need a crash cart.

420
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,099
- Who's crashing?
- No, no, no.

421
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,942
I need a crash cart
for before they're crashing!

422
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,169
Oh! Bloodbank.

423
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:56,370
All right, you need to come with me.

424
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:57,926
And bring all that stuff.

425
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,356
Hey.

426
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,224
How he's doing?

427
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,738
Well, he'd be doing a lot better

428
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,326
if I could get him
to take a walk, get some air.

429
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:09,917
I'm gonna get him
a hot meal.

430
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,050
Even if he doesn't eat it,

431
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,285
at least I'll feel
like I'm doing something.

432
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:16,144
Right. Hey, have you heard
of Dr. Rebecca Froy?

433
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,175
Neuroscientist
based out of Chicago?

434
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:21,044
- Why?
- Well, Shepherd wanted to meet with her

435
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:22,332
about her ultrasound work,

436
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,450
but when she heard
we were a Harper Avery hospital,

437
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,536
she canceled.

438
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:27,925
I guess she signed some
agreement with Grandfather?

439
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,178
I think I do remember that.

440
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,175
Yeah, some dust-up over research.

441
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:34,793
Harper took her to court.
She lost. End of story.

442
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,988
You know how
your grandfather loved a fight.

443
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,412
Yeah.

444
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,825
You know what? Maya Angelou
and your mom were right.

445
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,340
People show you who they are.

446
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,754
I've done that.
I've shown you I'm loyal.

447
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,246
You know I'm not a gossip.

448
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,675
And you certainly know
I'm not just going to

449
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,144
stir up drama for no reason.

450
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,215
What you've shown me

451
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:16,246
is that you keep secrets
very effectively

452
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:17,683
and that you lie by omission,

453
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,691
and if you've demonstrated
loyalty to anyone, it isn't me.

454
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,593
- This is where you wanted it?
- That's perfect.

455
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,511
Thank you, Dr. Parker.

456
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,590
What's that?

457
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,402
EKG machine in case you change your mind.

458
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,105
Is that like a blood-draw thing?

459
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,290
Like needles?

460
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,995
No. Just a few stickers.

461
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:05,611
Takes five minutes.

462
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,300
Owen! I need you to call Megan
and ask for a favor.

463
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,301
- What?
- Sam Bello needs a hole

464
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,419
to hide in for a while.

465
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,910
I'm gonna need more information.

466
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,262
Because our government is
in the habit

467
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,131
of deporting neurosurgeons
in the making.

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,644
- Wait. What?
- Sam Bello is a Dreamer,

469
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,152
and ICE has come for her.

470
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,397
We're trying to get her someplace safe

471
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:31,770
so she can get an immigration lawyer

472
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,277
and get this stuff sorted out.

473
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,731
We smuggled Megan's kid into the country,

474
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,062
so I figure she owes us one.

475
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:40,122
- Okay, just wait...
- She's great, Owen. She's my best...

476
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,246
It doesn't matter how great she
is if she's not law abiding...

477
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,318
Have you met Sam Bello?
She is not a criminal, Owen!

478
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,091
She's my favorite intern!
Please help!

479
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:50,312
Okay, so you want to send her
down to Southern California...

480
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,731
- Yes!
- Where she'll be far away

481
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,863
from immigration problems?

482
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,364
Can you call someone in the Army
and have them talk to ICE?

483
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,816
I think you're grasping at straws.

484
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,235
If it's the man, call in the man.

485
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,847
- Isn't that how it works?
- Nope.

486
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,972
<i>Dr. Parker with NICU.</i>

487
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:09,442
It's great, right?

488
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:12,183
I just found this emergency
cart, gutted the thing!

489
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,519
It's got room for everything.

490
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,523
But is someone gonna
need this somewhere?

491
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:17,594
- There are more, right?
- But you did this all wrong.

492
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:19,698
How is it wrong? I just made it up!

493
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,927
Because you put the hemorrhage
supplies in the bottom drawer.

494
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:24,027
- So?
- I mean, okay, what drawer

495
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:24,889
do you put your underwear in?

496
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,223
- Um... Pass?
- You put it in the top drawer

497
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,660
because it's what you grab first.

498
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,964
Then surgical equipment
in the bottom drawer.

499
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,355
Cardiovascular event,

500
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,044
and then preeclampsia,

501
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,128
sepsis, hemorrhage...
this zone.

502
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:38,506
- And that's... hold on, and then I think
- Yeah.

503
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:41,417
That I want to put
this in here.

504
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,688
This is the EKG for Agent Fields.

505
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,970
Is this a patient of yours?

506
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,378
Uh, that gentleman.

507
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,792
He works with ICE.

508
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,450
And he's here to talk with Dr. Bello,

509
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,285
whose Dreamer status is in question.

510
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,953
There's an ICE agent here?

511
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,077
Yes, for one of our star interns.

512
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,790
But hey,
that's neither here nor there

513
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,158
because this man's heart...

514
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,761
Oh! Okay!

515
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,792
Yeah, I can run all the tests.

516
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,063
I can do an echo.

517
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,753
I can do a treadmill nuclear stress test

518
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:09,125
Just look at the EKG.

519
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:10,277
Yeah. I'm gonna look at it.

520
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,410
I'll look at it really thoroughly.

521
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm going to...

522
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:16,128
I could even do a PET scan
if you need more time...

523
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,309
Dr. Pierce. Look.

524
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,214
Oh.

525
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:23,800
ST and T wave changes.

526
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,004
This isn't good.

527
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:26,527
This is what I'm talking about.

528
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,488
Is this Dr. Bello?

529
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:32,347
Oh, no, this is Dr. Pierce,
our chief of cardiothoracic surgery.

530
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,586
She just looked at your EKG...

531
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,895
Oh, come on. Dr. Bailey,
I've been here all day.

532
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:41,167
Agent Fields, I had a heart
attack a couple of months ago.

533
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:42,937
It almost took me out of the game

534
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:45,575
and left my child without a mother.

535
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:50,509
Please, sir. Listen to
what Dr. Pierce has to say.

536
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,160
Hey, I thought
you were covering the pit.

537
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,886
I am. It's covered.
Have you heard from cardio?

538
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:59,251
Not yet. I was just telling Matthew...

539
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,383
I don't think it's her heart.

540
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:02,311
- Why?
- I don't know. It's just a feeling.

541
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,605
But we have her medical records.

542
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,499
No, I know, but...
You don't have any kids.

543
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,292
Look, if Harriet had this,

544
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,677
I'd be thinking all sorts
of other things,

545
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,238
like GI obstruction or reflux,
pyloric stenosis, sepsis.

546
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,512
But Harriet doesn't have
a known heart condition.

547
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:17,511
- Ruby does.
- No, I know.

548
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,066
I know, but
can you please check it out,

549
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,386
I mean, since you're waiting,
anyway?

550
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,223
Please.

551
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,613
Of course I will.

552
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:27,384
- Thanks.
- Sure.

553
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,949

00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,967
Sam's an American, okay, just like me.

558
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,893
She came here when
she was a baby with her mother,

559
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,095
just like me!

00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,731

Andrea! I deported no one!

563
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:55,169
I would never do something
like that to you, to her...

564
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,280
Wow.

Did Alex... Did Dr. Karev sign off?

572
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,076
Dr. Karev won't sign off.
He'll never sign off.

573
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:40,255
Dr. Shepherd is looking for a
new partner for the ultrasound.

574

Dr. Wilson,
you've all been so good to us.

575
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:44,747
I asked you to fight for Kimmie,
and you fought.

576
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,685
Now I want to do
what Kimmie wants.

577
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,853
I'm taking her
where she wants to go.

578
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:50,067

Ah! Good.
Quick and easy.

588
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:25,861
Were you able to help out Bello?

589
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:27,296
Uh, no, I don't think so.

590
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,765
I think I actually
just scared her.

591
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,379
So... Um-hmm!

592
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,851
So, no church wedding.

593
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,984
What?

594
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,822
I thought that we could
start wedding planning.

595
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,232
So, maybe a restaurant or a bar.

596
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,296
I mean, not Joe's Bar.

597
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:41,092
Or maybe Joe's Bar
if we decorate it...

598
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,828
We got time to figure it out
and plan it.

599
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,040
I know. I just...
I thought

600
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,003
it might feel good to
plan something.

601
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,243
Thanks. I got to check on Kimmie.

602
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,946
- Alex?
- Yeah?

603
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,007
Kimmie left.

604
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:53,745
What? When?

605
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:56,382
Just a bit ago. She...
She told me to...

606
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:02,554
<i>Dr. Teller, extension 2219.</i>

607
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:05,023
<i>Dr. Teller, extension 2219.</i>

608
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,685
- Hey.
- Hi.

609
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,533
Mocha. Extra shot.

610
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:12,239
You're such a good boy.

611
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:13,638
Mm.

612
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,139
How's she doing?

613
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:18,732
She takes
about one breath a minute.

614
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:21,114
It's very slow, very painful.

615
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:23,286
Not for her. For Richard.

616
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,958
Sorry to hear that.

617
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,075
Well, you let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

618
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:31,529
Oh, I spoke to Evan in legal
about the Rebecca Froy thing.

619
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:34,491
Oh, leave that alone, honey.
It's not worth your time.

620
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,569
Well, Shepherd's trying to save
children with brain tumors, Mom.

621
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,061
Some petty fight over research

622
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,536
should not get in the way of that.

623
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:42,194
I've asked the lawyers

624
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,280
to waive whatever agreement
Harper made with her.

625
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,288
- You did what?
- Yeah. Took five minutes.

626
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:47,700
Handled.

627
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,145
Hey, how is she?

628
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,989
- She's in love.
- What?

629
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:04,185
With her healthy baby boy,
who has yet to be named.

630
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:06,638
5 pounds, 14 ounces.

631
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:07,989
She only pushed three times.

632
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,325
No bleeding?
No... No - No complications?

633
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,443
No forceps,
no... no vacuum extraction?

634
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,302
- None of that.
- Oh! I was just trying to be cautious.

635
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:16,380
I know.

636
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,935
So... should I return the cart or...

637
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:22,222
You should just...
just leave it, Bloodbank.

638
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,351
So it's not her heart?

639
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,107
No, it's her belly.
She has pyloric stenosis.

640
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,513
See this area here?

641
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,139
It's a little spot where
the muscle is getting too big

642
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,818
and won't let
the food pass through.

643
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:45,333
And what happens now?

644
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:46,889
It is a simple,
simple surgery.

645
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:49,013
Half an hour, and she's going to
be good as new.

646
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:51,435
Okay. Okay.

647
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:52,903
Thanks.

648
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:56,861
I-I'm sorry. It's, uh... It's a lot.

649
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,075
I know. I know. You're taking
care of her on your own.

650
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:00,377
I'm sorry. I can't imagine...

651
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,310
Yeah. It's, uh, tough.

652
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:04,529
Nights are tough.

653
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:07,497
But she cries, and I go in
and take one look at her,

654
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:10,005
and I'm just so happy
to see her, you know?

655
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,693
I'm sorry. Thank you for catching this.

656
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:17,127
Oh, no, I didn't. Dr. Kepner did.

657
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,811
- Dr. Kepner?
- Yeah. She's a mom.

658
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,091
And she had a feeling.

659
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,082
I'll come find you when
we're done, okay?

660
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,449
Okay.

661
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:35,761
Pyloric stenosis?

662
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,434
Yeah. She didn't have
all the obvious symptoms,

663
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,649
but at least we caught it early,
and she's gonna be just fine.

664
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,313
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

665
00:27:43,854 --> 00:27:45,002
Help!

666
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:46,848
Oh, my God... help! Someone help me!

667
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,686
My wife is bleeding!
She's bleeding! Someone help!

668
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,418
Hey, Schmitt, Schmitt!
Grab the cart and follow me.

669
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,223
- What happened?
- Somebody help her!

670
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,278
You have to help her!

671
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:57,332
She had a vaginal delivery late
last night... no complications.

672
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,635
Ahh! Something's wrong!

673
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:00,571
Start her on high-flow O2, 10 liters,

674
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,998
and we'll need a bolus
of 10 units of oxytocin IM

675
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,209
followed by an infusion.

676
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,585
Okay, no, hold on.
Sorry... it's right there.

677
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,317
Schmitt, top drawer, oxytocin.

678
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,345
- Speculum and 4x4s?
- Got it.

679
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:11,412
- Balloon catheter?
- Bottom drawer.

680
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,045
- I don't see it.
- It's on the right.

681
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,617
No, it's on the left,
underneath the packing.

682
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,253
- Got it.
- Look at me.

683
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,465
Hang on there, okay?
Just hang in there.

684
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:20,612
We got you. You've got this.

685
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,748
It's... It's not good.

686
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:27,997
You have severe defects
in blood flow to your heart

687
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:31,408
during stress, which suggests
major occlusions...

688
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:33,704
- Occlusions?
- Oh, blockages.

689
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,221
Your coronary arteries

690
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,307
are almost completely clogged shut...

691
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:39,675
Leaving you at high risk
for a heart attack.

692
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:40,923
Very high risk.

693
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,790
I thought you guys
were just stalling me...

694
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,396
- Right?
- But no, no. No, we, um...

695
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,923
You're in very grave danger.

696
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,655
I swear to God, if this
is some sort of game...

697
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,725
Agent Fields, I swear to God it is not.

698
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:01,531
I'm recommending
a cardiac catheterization.

699
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:05,376
I'll go in, open up
the arteries right now... today.

700
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:08,377
Well, can I... Can I call my wife?

701
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:11,634
I mean, she-she's gonna be
out of her mind with worry.

702
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,931
Of course. Right, yeah.
Call whoever you need to.

703
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:17,431
- We'll get you started.
- Mm-hmm.

704
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:20,236
Dr. Bailey, thank you.

705
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:21,962
I'm grateful.

706
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:24,103
But I'm going to have to call my office,

707
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:27,392
and they're going to send
somebody else for Dr. Bello.

708
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,040
Agent Fields...

709
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:33,486
hey, I know that there are protocols,

710
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:36,837
but can you please just tell me...

711
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,773
did Dr. Bello break the law?

712
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,845
- A red light?
- That's what he said.

713
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:45,409
Said they have her on camera.

714
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,120
Well, I run
a red light once a month.

715
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:48,794
They can deport her for that?

716
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:49,964
Apparently.

717
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,745
I was at work for 36 hours.

718
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:53,956
There was a six-car
pileup in the pit,

719
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,408
and I scrubbed in on...
on three different surgeries,

720
00:29:57,517 --> 00:29:59,556
and I was floating all the way home.

721
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:03,839
Till I heard a horn, and some
guy behind me riding my bumper.

722
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:07,463
And the light turned yellow,
and no one was coming,

723
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,150
so I pumped the gas.

724
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,568
I thought I made it through. I thought...

725
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,292
I thought I made it through.

726
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,606
Okay, if...
if you end up in El Salvador...

727
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,041
it's likely your medical
accreditation won't transfer,

728
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,742
and you'll have to
start over from scratch.

729
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:22,212
Look, we will do everything
we can

730
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,149
to try and land you somewhere
at the same level you are here.

731
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:28,221
My mom took my sister and I
out of that country

732
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,260
because there was a war,

733
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,388
and she saw my dad get shot
on our front porch.

734
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,486
We moved to Florida,
and she worked two jobs...

735
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:35,495
20 hours a day... to keep us safe.

736
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:38,428
No, I not going back there.
I won't.

737
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:41,392
We should run.
I have a friend in Canada.

738
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,276
We get somebody to drive us
across the border.

739
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:44,735
We hole up, and we wait.

740
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,018
- No.
- We run, and we wait.

741
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:47,159
You can't run.

742
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:49,337
Listen... I'm all for
driving the getaway car,

743
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:50,948
but right now, they are treating you

744
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,720
like someone who snuck into this
country in the trunk of a car.

745
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,612
Don't become
what they're trying to make you.

746
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,400
If you run, you're a criminal.

747
00:30:57,469 --> 00:31:01,087
If you're a criminal, you could
never practice medicine again.

748
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:03,478
Do not give them that.

749
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,025
- Hey.
- Hey.

750
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:13,389
Lanie is stable,
and so is the baby boy, Gryffin,

751
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,392
named for Gryffindor.

752
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:17,408
Steady numbers
across the board.

753
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:21,642
Our patient with the postpartum
bleed is stable, too. Thank God.

754
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,279
She would have bled out
in minutes

755
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,189
if we didn't have all this,

756
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,263
you and your little cart.

757
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:31,046
You saved her.

758
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,512
I think that we're finished.

759
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:34,629
What?

760
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:36,432
Our project. Maternal mortality.

761
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:39,371
I think this cart is
the next step.

762
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:42,142
I mean, if we had one on
every OB and delivery floor,

763
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:44,546
then we're prepared for
any postpartum complications.

764
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:46,829
The key to not turning birth
into a trauma

765
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:49,267
is to prepare for it
as if it is a trauma.

766
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,320
You're brilliant.

767
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:57,992
Are you...

768
00:31:58,314 --> 00:31:59,987
Are you going to move to
another country?

769
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:01,064
What?

770
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,846
Well, just...
You're a free spirit, and you...

771
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:05,872
you like the freedom to just,
you know, move countries.

772
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,033
But...

773
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:08,700
Listen. Your research is almost done,

774
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:10,301
and our project is almost done,
and I...

775
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,307
I'm running scenarios,
and I just want to be prepared.

776
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,447
I want to know how loaded
my crash cart should be.

777
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:16,978
I don't want a crash cart.

778
00:32:17,147 --> 00:32:20,634
You... You don't...
You don't want a crash cart?

779
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:23,025
Or you don't want a crash?
I'm sorry. I just...

780
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,306
I'm mixing up my metaphors.

781
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,775
I don't want to leave you, Arizona.

782
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,502
If you have someplace else to be,

783
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:41,031
I can page you
when I'm done here.

784
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,187
Oh, no, I'd like to see him
through to the end.

785
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,346
I'm dying?

786
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:47,437
No. Um, if I make a diagnosis,

787
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,007
I want to see my patient
through treatment.

788
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:52,212
I don't like doing my job halfway.

789
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,656
I don't like doing my job at all.

790
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:56,992
I don't even like wearing the jacket.

791
00:32:57,117 --> 00:32:58,656
Some guys like wearing the jacket.

792
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:01,585
I used to.
I used to feel good about it.

793
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,205
I believe in law and order.

794
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,701
You know, I...
I grew up watching Westerns.

795
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:09,665
I wanted to be the sheriff
that rode in at the last minute

796
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:11,062
and saved everyone.

797
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:12,897
Now...

798
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:14,862
I don't know what we're doing.

799
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:19,841
Staking out schools,
taking kids...

800
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:21,929
doctors...

801
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,074
I don't know what we're doing anymore.

802
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:32,487
Okay, I talked to your mom.
She's trying to reach a lawyer.

803
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:34,132
I don't even know
if I can take a bag.

804
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:35,590
Do you know if they let you take a...

805
00:33:35,658 --> 00:33:37,377
Here's a plane ticket to Zurich.

806
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:39,360
I'm going to Switzerland?

807
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:41,523
You are voluntarily leaving the country

808
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,171
to continue your studies

809
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,977
at the prestigious cardiothoracic program

810
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,480
at Klausman Institute.

811
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,320
Congratulations on your acceptance.

812
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,492
- What?
- You applied last year.

813
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,639
I did?

814
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,687
Here's your application
and your essay.

815
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,468
They were very impressed.

816
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,476
- Who wrote this?
- You did.

817
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:00,359
With the help of Dr. Pierce.

818
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:04,450
When you land tomorrow, somebody
will be there to meet you.

819
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,988
They will help get you settled,
and Dr. Yang is expecting you.

820
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,321
You're going to love
working with her.

821
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,249
She was also the best
in her class.

My supervisor will be here
in the morning,

852
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,817
but I can get you started
at least with the paperwork.

853
00:36:38,928 --> 00:36:42,398
So, are you looking to foster a child?
Or foster to adopt?

854
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:44,660
Foster to adopt.

855
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,442
<i>We spend our childhoods</i>

856
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:48,754
<i>writing our dreams in diaries.</i>

857
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:54,460
As adults, those dreams quietly
<i>come true every single day...</i>

858
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:58,788
<i>only sometimes we forget to notice,
until it's too late.</i>

859
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,897
I'm coming with you, okay?

860
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,085
As soon as I can.

861
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,721
No... Andrew,
I don't even want to go!

862
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,260
Yes, I am, okay?
I love you, Sam.

863
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:07,502
- You can't...
- I'm in love with you.

864
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:09,749
You're not throwing your life
away because I have to!

865
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,908
No, I'll beg Dr. Yang for a job...

866
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,288
No. I...

867
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,874
I followed you here. I'm a liar.

868
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,749
I'm... I'm a crazy stalker,

869
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:20,647
and you should stay away
from me.

870
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,397
Sam. Stop.

871
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,007
Hey.

872
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,491
We work.

873
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:28,948
We don't.

874
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,742
No, even when we do,
we don't.

875
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:37,467
<i>♪ Angels will call on me

876
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,088

<i>So slow down.</i>

886
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,699
<i>And take it in.</i>

887
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:37,716
- Hey.
- People can't be

888
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:39,184
with the people they love.

889
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,560
What?

890
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:43,371
All over the world, people can't
be with the people they love

891
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,777
because of stupid laws and
stupid life and stupid death.

892
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:51,277
And so I see where
my aggressive avoidance of you

893
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,137
might come across
as ever so slightly petulant.

894
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,310
But I still wish
that you would apologize.

895
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,426
I just need you to see
that what you did was wrong.

896
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:02,285
- Maggie, April kissed me.
- That wasn't... No. I get that.

897
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:05,692
And I am not mad about that!
I am mad because you didn't tell me!

898
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,793
I'm mad that you
thought I couldn't handle it!

899
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,192
Because my whole life,
people have been talking over me

900
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:11,997
and talking down to me

901
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,082
and assuming that just because
I'm a little awkward

902
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:15,902
and... and... goofy,

903
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:18,273
that I can't handle simple information!

904
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,028
That's not what I was doing...

905
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:22,014
Do you think I can't see
that what you and April had

906
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:24,138
was big and complicated?
I mean, do you think you need

907
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:26,068
- to protect me from that?
- I wasn't protecting you.

908
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:27,487
I was protecting April.

909
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:30,754
I was probably protecting
myself, honestly, from this.

910
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:32,990
- From...
- From all of this.

911
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:35,430
Maggie, you think of yourself
as this goofy underdog.

912
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,371
I mean, that's an old idea.

913
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:38,988
You're beautiful.

914
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,067
You're brilliant. You're powerful.

915
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:43,071
You have all the power here.
I'm over here sunk.

916
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,646
And you keep showing me
how capable you are

917
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,004
of just walking away.

918
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:48,449
You have all these reasons...
over and over...

919
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,753
reasons to resist us, reasons
why we can't be together.

920
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,285
First it's April,
and then it's what, our parents?

921
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:54,636
Then it's the fact
that we all work together.

922
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:56,607
Now it's this. It's just another thing,

923
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:59,363
one moment I had with April when
I was trying to be her friend.

924
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,988
And now you're convinced again

925
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:03,324
that you can just walk away
again and again.

926
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:04,728
This keeps hap...

927
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,572
I'm not.

928
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:14,619
I am not capable anymore.

929
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:18,134
Well, then maybe I am sorry.

930
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:30,080
<i>Let yourself feel it.</i>

931
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,776
Oh, love. I'm so sorry.

932
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:38,517
It's all right.

933
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,370
I'm all right.

934
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:43,931
Are you?

935
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,392
No.

936
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:47,148
None of us are all right.

937
00:40:47,332 --> 00:40:48,734
Jackson...

938
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,119
Jackson ruined us.

939
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:54,494
Richard, we are ruined.

940
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,173
<i>Because sometimes even
the most beautiful dreams...</i>

941
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,095
<i>disappear when the sun comes up</i>
