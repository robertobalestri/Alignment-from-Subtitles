1
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:07,760
<i>In 1963, Dr. Thomas Starzl performed
the first five liver transplants.</i>

2
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:10,588
We know it is a departure from
existing Alzheimer's research,

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,479
but we believe it
is worth pursuing.

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,878
Evidence already suggests that
changes in the gut's microbiome

5
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:16,526
is correlated with Parkinson's.

6
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,745
If the same proves
true for Alzheimer's,

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,339
it could completely transform
the search for a cure.

8
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,745
<i>One patient bled to death
on the operating table.</i>

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,034
- Uh. We're happy to answer questions.
- Not necessary.

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,535
In fact, I'm sorry we dragged you
all the way from Boston for this.

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,677
But it's just that our board will
ask if we met Dr. Grey in person

12
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,395
when we recommend
they fund the project.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,220
<i>The other four died within days.</i>

14
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,025
- You are asking for money, right?
- Yes.

15
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:40,051
We didn't expect an
answer so soon, but...

16
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,849
The board still has to vote. But
frankly, it's more of a formality,

17
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:45,722
especially given Dr. Grey's
affiliation with the Fox Foundation.

18
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:48,732
Should we set up a meeting with
Dr. Fox to discuss next steps?

19
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:53,589
<i>As a result, the operation was considered
too dangerous to be performed on humans</i>

20
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,728
<i>and liver transplantation was suspended
worldwide for the next four years.</i>

21
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:01,347
Hey, you almost hit me when you
pulled into the parking lot.

22
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,293
Maybe you should consider
running against traffic.

23
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,885
Thanks for the tip.

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,076
♪ <i>Know why you're
Running under sheet</i> ♪

25
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,136
I need to do a wound vac
change before rounds.

26
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,063
- I'll see you inside.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,723
I'm still mad at you for
getting us banned from the OR.

28
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:14,950
I didn't ask for your thoughts.

29
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,778
Can you not be a tool right
now? I'm trying to be nice.

30
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:19,488
- This is you being nice?
- Yes.

31
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,488
I'm declaring a momentary truce.

32
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,931
You got us in trouble, but
you're still my roommate,

33
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,891
kind of my friend and you
were just dumped so...

34
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,719
- Are you okay?
- I wasn't dumped.

35
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:32,048
- Mutual breakup, whatever. But...
- I'm fine.

36
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:34,576
You are making it really
hard to be Team Skywalker!

37
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:38,685
<i>Wasn't exactly an auspicious start for a
surgery that has saved countless lives.</i>

38
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,381
From now on, I'm waiting in the
car when we do these meetings.

39
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,333
Everybody knows my affiliation with
Catherine, and somebody will talk.

40
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:48,273
Should we give up now? Or can we hold out
until one thing in my life is on track?

41
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:52,268
My flight is not until 6:00, so I
can make some calls from your lab.

42
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,494
Our lab.

43
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,662
- Ooh, space.
- I think she's waiting.

44
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,623
- Uh, or she's on her phone.
- What about Westerly Science?

45
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:03,518
They're small and new, but they
have deep research pockets.

46
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,425
Did you get a cat?

47
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,489
I've given up on finding
a human soulmate.

48
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,648
Oh.

49
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,309
Hey, I was waiting
for that spot.

50
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:14,238
- Well, you were on your phone.
- Answering an important text.

51
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:15,731
On your phone.

52
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:19,005
There's an overflow lo...

53
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,507
<i>Dr. Lewis to oncology.
Dr. Lewis to oncology.</i>

54
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:26,601
Hey. Uh, and you can erase
Dorian's abdominal washout.

55
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:31,281
- How's he doing?
- Uh. He's stable for now. The poor kid's got a ways to go.

56
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,199
- Okay. Let's hear it.
- What?

57
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:39,328
You've been complaining about my changes
to the residency program nonstop.

58
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:41,756
So, I've got time
before my next surgery.

59
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:43,983
Maybe get all that
negativity out now

60
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,612
instead of sprinkling it throughout
my day, like you've been doing.

61
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,170
No negativity today.

62
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,929
I'm going on vacation.

63
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:54,494
Seems early in your
new position to be...

64
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:57,115
Going someplace warm?

65
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,073
Chicago.

66
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:59,672
Oh. Say hello to Maggie for me.

67
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,745
I will. I will. But,
uh, when I get back,

68
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:04,114
I do wanna discuss an
idea for the interns.

69
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:05,781
Don't you have a plane to catch?

70
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,480
Griffith, Millin, take the pit.

71
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:13,549
I'm visualizing a multi-car
crash or a construction accident.

72
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:15,743
- I need chest tubes.
- I need intubations.

73
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,103
And I need a foot massage.

74
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:20,863
- Kwan, you're with Beltran.
- The new peds attending?

75
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:24,330
Yeah, you know what they say about
peds without the OR? Babysitting.

76
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:27,358
Don't care. Beltran was on the team
that pioneered single-port surgery.

77
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:29,851
Way to brag about reading
the hospital newsletter.

78
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,480
- Just trying to stay ahead.
- Yasuda, Adams, ICU.

79
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:35,308
Uh. Millin, wanna trade? There are
a lot of chest tubes in the ICU.

80
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,637
- I already have most of those...
- No trading, negotiating or complaining.

81
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:41,698
Unless one of you picked up
a vanilla latte on the way?

82
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,387
Didn't think so.

83
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,123
Go!

84
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,558
Hmm.

85
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,285
This won't hurt, okay?

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,470
Good morning.

87
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,882
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
You must be Malan.

88
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,587
I'm her mom, Maria Flor.

89
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:10,284
- It's nice to meet you both.
- Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:14,576
Good morning. I'm Dr. Beltran, pediatric
surgeon. I'm sorry I'm a little late.

91
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,437
I had an unexpected delay.

92
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,765
- Who's presenting?
- I'm the chief of neurosurgery.

93
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,660
Good for you.

94
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,055
Uh, Malan Vasconcelos,
eight years old,

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,584
diagnosed with congenital
hydrocephalus at birth.

96
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,276
She's had five VP shunts to
control the CSF build up.

97
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,336
All vitals look good.
No signs of infection.

98
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,541
She's here today because her mom says
that Malan's not acting like herself.

99
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,604
Would you mind
if I take a look?

100
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,955
Miss Vasconcelos, have you noticed
any change in her motor skills?

101
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,885
No, she's just, um, she's just tired, like
something's off. Something's not right.

102
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,857
She's normally full of energy, running
around the house dancing and kicking.

103
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,726
Not dancing and kicking.
It's <i>ginga</i> and <i>meia-lua.</i>

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,796
- She does Capoeira.
- I got my orange belt last month.

105
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:01,431
Yeah.

106
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:03,400
Dr. Shepherd, do
you see anything?

107
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,088
- No...
- But that doesn't mean anything.

108
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,749
Well, it means I wasn't
finished with my sentence.

109
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,444
Uh, Maria Flor, I'd like
to take her for some scans.

110
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:14,652
She's already gone through four shunt
revisions and they all malfunctioned.

111
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,756
I don't want her to have to
go through another surgery.

112
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,316
No, I know. I know, but let's hold
off worrying until we see the scans.

113
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,386
Agreed. No need to exacerbate
an already stressful situation.

114
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,564
Kwan, uh, why don't you get her
to radiology for a shunt series?

115
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,890
Okay.

116
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,310
Hey, big trauma coming
into the back lot.

117
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,240
I need everyone that
does not have a patient.

118
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:35,864
- Let's grab gowns.
- Dibs on the airway.

119
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:37,197
Chest tube.

120
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:40,079
Uh, how big? I have to leave for
the airport in a couple hours.

121
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,447
I'll take what I
can get. Let's go.

122
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,406
- Steady.
- Wow.

123
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:46,100
- What is this thing?
- Nate Ardilla, 34.

124
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,642
His watercraft was hit
by a container ship.

125
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,289
He's got crush injuries to his
pelvis and right upper extremity.

126
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:54,806
Couldn't fully extricate at the scene,
but Jaws of Life are on the way.

127
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:56,025
Easy. Easy.

128
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,206
Is this part of a boat?

129
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,853
No, it's a self-propelled
floating bubble.

130
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:02,392
- I made it myself. It's cool, right?
- That's one word for it.

131
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,291
Mr. Ardilla, I'm gonna need
to check your injuries, okay?

132
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,767
Steel rims seemed like
a good idea at the time,

133
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,161
but now, not so much.

134
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,121
You can get me out
of this, right?

135
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,465
Let's take a look at you.

136
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,897
I've been working around the
clock to keep this kid alive,

137
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:35,260
and I've got a full day in the
OR, so try not to disappoint me.

138
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:37,895
Yasuda.

139
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:42,267
Dorian Cardenas, post-op day six
from ex lap with splenectomy.

140
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,703
Small and large bowel
repair and ostomy creation.

141
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:48,573
In stable condition after abdominal
washout and closure today.

142
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:53,044
Keep track of his coags, acid-based
electrolytes and renal functions.

143
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,814
And what ventilator alarms
are we watching for?

144
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,382
Elevated peak and
plateau pressures.

145
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,618
And if only the peak
pressure alarm goes off?

146
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,985
Tubes dislodged, or kinking.

147
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,521
Which means?

148
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:06,057
Don't page me. Fix it yourself.

149
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,293
Wait, so you just want
us to monitor him?

150
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:13,899
Oh, you want something less boring than
keeping an entire unit of patients alive?

151
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:17,335
Including a young man recovering
from multiple gunshot wounds?

152
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,447
I meant you also want us to
log procedures so that we...

153
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,107
It's-It's good. We're
good. Thank you.

154
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,311
- Truce is off!
- Ow!

155
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,978
What the hell was that?

156
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:31,216
Don't be a smart-ass to the
person who holds all the cards.

157
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,084
Literally.

158
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,787
Um, truce back on.

159
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,456
What's the MRN for the chart?

160
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,493
I really thought I was
gonna make it this time.

161
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,129
- You've done this before?
- Fourth try.

162
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:48,133
- Where were you headed? Bainbridge?
- Hong Kong.

163
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,539
It needs to sound more impressive
than Rich Doyle's record.

164
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,375
He set a solo record rowing
from San Francisco to Hawaii.

165
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,444
Wait, Rich Doyle the,
uh, tech billionaire?

166
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,647
Didn't he fund that floating clinic in
Tanzania? Is he your boss or something?

167
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,625
My wife's ex-boyfriend.-

168
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,785
And to be clear, she would
say he's a non issue,

169
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,663
but I know she thinks
about him. I mean, I would.

170
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,631
I'd think every day about
what my life would be like

171
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,525
if I married a billionaire
adventurer rather than a pharmacist

172
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:16,361
with a 401 and ten
days of paid vacation.

173
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:17,529
Nate.

174
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,698
Am I almost out?
This really hurts.

175
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,133
It's definitely a vascular
injury in the upper extremity.

176
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,870
If we don't get him out of there
soon, he's gonna lose that arm.

177
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,138
Assuming he doesn't have
massive internal hemorrhage.

178
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,040
Okay, I'm ready
to get out now.

179
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,642
Get me out of here.
Please get me out.

180
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,979
Nate, Nate. Hey, hey, Nate,
look at me, look at me.

181
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,389
- I'm Dr. Hunt, okay?
- Uh-huh. Okay.

182
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,924
Now, the pressure
from these metal bars

183
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,184
might be the only thing
stopping you from bleeding out.

184
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,828
So we need to be mindful
how we get you out.

185
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,321
We stopped the bleeding in
your arm with the tourniquet.

186
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,757
Next, we need to remove
this bar from your pelvis.

187
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,996
Then we're gonna get you straight to an
OR, but I need you to stay still, okay?

188
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,172
Good.

189
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,664
Millin, Griffith,
put another IV.

190
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,342
We're gonna need a gurney
and trauma supplies.

191
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,003
- On it.
- Can someone call my wife? Please.

192
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,737
Just tell her I'm here.

193
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,673
But maybe don't mention the part
about the bars or the bleeding.

194
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,574
Yeah.

195
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,850
- Do you hate me?
- Sometimes.

196
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,519
- What? Why would you say that?
- Why would you ask me that?

197
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:18,223
Because when certain people
show up at the hospital,

198
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,091
I'd think you'd
give me a heads-up.

199
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,593
You get the hospital alerts.

200
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,396
Plus if we hurry, we can
probably still see him.

201
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,797
What are you talking about?

202
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,799
The insane guy with
the pedal boat.

203
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,702
Guy tried to paddle across the Pacific
and then he trashed his appa...

204
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:34,205
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Well, I was talking about Nico.

205
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,576
- Who?
- Nico. My ex.

206
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,420
I saw you having a whole
conversation with him.

207
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:40,845
Why is he here?

208
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,647
I can't tell you.

209
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:45,083
- Because it's about me?
- Because HIPAA.

210
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,719
Look, I gotta go. Just
stop freaking out.

211
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:50,388
HIPAA? He's your patient?

212
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,457
Oh. You're in black scrubs.

213
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:57,796
Why does Nico need
an ob-gyn, Jo?

214
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,764
Bye.

215
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,339
Meredith.

216
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,608
- Hey.
- Hey.

217
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,743
I'm so surprised
to see you here.

218
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:15,014
Well, I could say the same
for you. Are you back already?

219
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,248
Physical therapy.

220
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,950
But I'm feeling so much better.

221
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:21,987
- Are you here for a consult?
- Uh, yeah, something like that.

222
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,355
No one tells me anything.

223
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,458
Ndugu has locked me out
of the cardio charts,

224
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:30,362
and Owen refuses to tell
me that Leo is acting up

225
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,273
even though I am
on the same emails.

226
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,767
And Richard... Well, he's telling
me that I should hang in there

227
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,004
even though I have offered
to help with admin.

228
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,638
He says that I-I need to rest.

229
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,606
Well, you know,
Richard's usually right.

230
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,943
Yeah, well, no one seems to be
minding me walking on a treadmill

231
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,811
for a mind-numbing hour.

232
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:48,446
I'd do it.

233
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,749
I no longer have time
to walk or be bored.

234
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,119
You should come with me.

235
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,452
- To PT?
- Yeah.

236
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,354
You can get in your
steps, I can get in mine,

237
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,923
and you can catch me
up on life in Boston.

238
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,493
- You're busy. I get it.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,496
- It's always such a pleasure to see you.
- Yeah.

240
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,533
- You know what? I would love to come.
- Great.

241
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,168
Yes.

242
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,646
You were at UT Medical Center?

243
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,371
Is that where you
did your residency?

244
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:16,650
Nope, that was Penn. Also
where I went to medical school.

245
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,511
I was lured to Texas by the
promise of good weather.

246
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,292
Dr. Shepherd, you were in LA?

247
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,581
Uh, for private practice.

248
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:26,027
Residency was in Baltimore
and med school was Boston.

249
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,839
Just say Harvard. They think if they
say Boston it sounds less pretentious.

250
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,534
- Where'd you go?
- St. Kitts.

251
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,428
Hmm. Balmy.

252
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,902
- Scans are up.
- Mom was right.

253
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,529
Malan's shunt is
no longer working.

254
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:40,081
- We'll have to replace it.
- Well, it's not working.

255
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,948
She's too active, and
she's gonna keep growing.

256
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:44,207
- It's gonna keep getting disconnected.
- That's the standard of care.

257
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:47,730
But we can talk to the mom about
Malan's level of physical activity.

258
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,628
What about an endoscopic
ventriculostomy?

259
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:53,964
You insert a scope into
the ventricles of the brain

260
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,495
and create a shunt
using a balloon.

261
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,586
It's far less invasive, and there's
nothing to get disconnected.

262
00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:59,581
No, I know what it is,

263
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:01,319
but I also know that
she is not a candidate.

264
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,495
She's had ventriculitis, and she
has an aberrant basilar artery.

265
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,856
So getting a scope in
would be near impossible.

266
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,970
Why don't you take
a minute then?

267
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:10,706
Excuse me?

268
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,767
If you can't figure
it out, take a minute.

269
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,361
Well, it's not about figuring it
out. The procedure won't work.

270
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,421
And I can explain that to
you four different ways,

271
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,058
but I have three other
consults, a meningioma to remove

272
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,863
and a research meeting.

273
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:26,917
- Ah. So, impatience is your thing.
- Should I leave?

274
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,386
No.

275
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,380
I have a colectomy
for an eight-year-old,

276
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:33,597
a Wilms' tumor consult
for a 14-year-old,

277
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,621
and a palliative care visit
for a baby in the NICU.

278
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:36,947
You wanna swap?

279
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:41,097
I'll tell Malan's mom you're
gonna look into another option.

280
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:51,576
He is stable and alert, but please
call back as soon as you get this.

281
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,443
We're already out of lap pads?

282
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,116
Nice hair, by the way.

283
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,948
Needed a change.

284
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,493
Yeah? What happened
with you and Adams?

285
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:06,990
We're roommates, because
apparently I'm selfish.

286
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:11,104
This is where you say, "He doesn't
know what he's talking about."

287
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:12,896
Oh, I shouldn't speak for him.

288
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,067
What happened with you and Kwan?

289
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,160
- You knew about that?
- Everyone knew about that.

290
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,480
You know, we don't have to do this.
We've got everything. Let's go.

291
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:23,007
You asked first.

292
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,204
NaCl. Right.

293
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:28,904
<i>Dr. Wells to peds ICU.</i>

294
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,273
<i>Dr. Robin Wells to peds ICU.</i>

295
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,668
They look like a nice family.

296
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,508
You have sisters, right?

297
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,001
We don't have to talk.

298
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:46,557
I know we don't have to talk,
but I was just thinking that...

299
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:47,693
Where are you going?

300
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:48,753
Uh. To do anything else.

301
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,958
Bailey gave us explicit
instructions to...

302
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,036
Sit here and do math?

303
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:55,163
Well, she also said to do
about a zillion procedures

304
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:57,991
if we ever want to set
foot in the OR again, so...

305
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,083
Yeah, I'ma do that.

306
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,396
Well, I'm not leaving him.

307
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,723
Well, I'm not letting Kwan get
back in the OR before I do,

308
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,917
so, uh, page me if he codes.

309
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,817
Gurney coming through.

310
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:10,897
You need to head to the airport?

311
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,232
No, let's just get this guy out.

312
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,003
- Splint looks good.
- Okay, everybody get ready.

313
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,560
We need a intubation tray,

314
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,895
- blood and bicarb on standby.
- On it.

315
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,589
Nate, it's time to try
extricating you now.

316
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:23,584
Okay. Everybody, on
my count. One, two...

317
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,511
- Wait! Wait.
- Hold up.

318
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,638
Tell me what happens
when you lift the bar.

319
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:31,031
We can't be
totally sure, Nate.

320
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,732
But we have a whole team of
people ready for almost anything.

321
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:35,057
What if I die?

322
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:37,943
What if I die without
ever getting to...

323
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,709
You're never getting to
Hong Kong in a bubble.

324
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,982
All you succeeded in doing

325
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,254
is taking away resources from the
coast guard when they rescued you.

326
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,091
Not to mention the paramedics. Not
everyone gets to go where they wanna go.

327
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,951
I was gonna say, "Without ever
getting to see my wife again."

328
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,909
I wanna talk to her.

329
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,015
I need to talk to her.

330
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:56,841
- Is she here?
- She didn't answer. I left a voicemail.

331
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,902
- We don't have much time.
- Can wait a few minutes.

332
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,881
Try her again.

333
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,106
Okay.

334
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,224
Dr. Kwan.

335
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:10,050
Uh, Dr. Beltran
will be back soon.

336
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,811
No... Malan's extremely
sensitive to hospital sounds.

337
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,699
Would it be possible to
get her some headphones?

338
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:16,455
The ones that block out
the noise, you know?

339
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,415
Sometimes the radiology
department has those.

340
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:21,992
- They don't loan those out.
- I'm sure we can find them.

341
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,206
If it'll make Malan more
comfortable, then it's no problem.

342
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,432
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,726
Uh, radiology doesn't let
those out of their sight.

344
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,330
- It's a thing.
- I guess you're gonna have to ask nicely.

345
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,058
That won't make a difference.

346
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,035
That woman's daughter is going
through something terrifying.

347
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,528
If she thinks headphones will
help, then get her headphones.

348
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:41,089
And after you do that, find
Shepherd. I need an update.

349
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,447
Everything okay?

350
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:53,238
These are not hospital pencils.
I bring them from home.

351
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,615
I've had worse habits.

352
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,142
Well, sometimes I
pop Bubble Wrap.

353
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:01,534
Wanna tell me what's
bothering you?

354
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,260
No.

355
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:09,561
This new ped surgeon is pushing me
to consider an alternate procedure

356
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,162
to the one that I
already know works.

357
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,756
Will the alternate work?

358
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,902
I me... It's more risk
than I'd recommend.

359
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,045
- But will it work?
- It's beside the point.

360
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,740
Are you irritated with the
suggestion or the suggester?

361
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,232
Beltran aggravates
a lot of people.

362
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:26,291
How do you know?

363
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,349
I hired her.

364
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,376
She was known as
a boundary pusher.

365
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:31,782
Kinda like you.

366
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,242
Hey.

367
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,798
- Levi.
- Nico. Hi.

368
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,145
How are you?

369
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,850
- Good.
- How's, uh, work going at the hospital?

370
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,562
You'd think a hospital vending
machine would have healthier options.

371
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,487
- Here.
- Ah. He doesn't like raisins.

372
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,322
- I know.
- They're not for me.

373
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:54,025
- Oh.
- They're for our surrogate.

374
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,730
He's a stickler about her diet.

375
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:58,488
Can't bring myself to think
what he's gonna feed our son.

376
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,183
Our kitchen's already
full of baby food gadgets.

377
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,653
- Oh.
- I'm Jason.

378
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:06,128
Are... Did you and
Nico work together?

379
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:08,886
Um, yeah. Yeah.

380
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:12,136
- I'm Levi.
- Nice to meet you.

381
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,996
Are you also in ortho?

382
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:15,855
No. No.

383
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,972
I'm, uh, I'm general
surgery chief resident.

384
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,351
- Oh, wow.
- Okay. Cool.

385
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,125
- Uh... We should go.
- Yeah.

386
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,786
Erin's probably wondering
what happened to us.

387
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,501
- It was nice seeing you.
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,080
Nice meeting you, Levon.

389
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,554
Levon?

390
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,214
I mean, it's almost
easier coming to work.

391
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,214
I mean, try explaining to a
four-year-old why Mommy can't carry him.

392
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,899
Right? And Owen has
been a champion,

393
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,003
but he's had extra
trauma shifts.

394
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,214
His mom's helping out,

395
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,509
but she's not really the type
to play the floor is lava.

396
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,904
She's more into giving them a
snack and turning on the TV.

397
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,765
I remember during COVID, a
very smart doctor once told me

398
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,426
to get some rest and ask
for help when I needed it.

399
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,386
Look at you throwing
my words back at me.

400
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:09,075
How's Boston?

401
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,981
- Oh!
- Teddy!

402
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:14,008
Teddy, are you okay?

403
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,272
Dr. Lincoln said to tell
you he's scrubbing in.

404
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,644
- Millin's helping him prep.
- Is Jessica on her way?

405
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:22,672
- She's still not answering.
- He's getting more hypotensive.

406
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:25,386
Nate, the longer
you're up here,

407
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,394
the more likely you are
to have a complication.

408
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,746
If you wanna give yourself the best
shot at seeing your wife again,

409
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,306
we should go now.

410
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:34,050
Tell me. Whatever you wanna
say to her, say it to me.

411
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,010
I'll tell her as
soon as she arrives.

412
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,605
I love her.

413
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,433
That's all that matters.

414
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,261
I love her so much.

415
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:46,684
Everything I do is for her.
All of this was for her.

416
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,013
I know she married me and not Rich,
but I want her to be proud of me.

417
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,820
Tell her that I
know she has doubts,

418
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:53,810
and I don't want her to spend
another second of her life

419
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,437
questioning her choosing me.

420
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:59,966
Tell her that I'll never give
up trying to do right by her.

421
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,592
- I will.
- Okay.

422
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:05,322
Okay then. I'm ready.

423
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,226
Okay.

424
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,791
Okay. On my count.
One, two, three.

425
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,527
Okay, he's bleeding out.

426
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,588
Prepare to intubate. Come
on, come on, come on.

427
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,592
- Hang two units of blood.
- Let's go. Get him on the gurney.

428
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,652
Okay, let's pack the
wound and apply pressure.

429
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,517
Let's make sure we have
a clear path to the OR.

430
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,622
He's not gonna make it to
the OR. Give me your shears.

431
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:27,692
Bring me a REBOA.

432
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:28,653
We'll slow the bleeding,

433
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,255
and it'll buy us some
time to transport.

434
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,189
Come on, Nate. Come on. Stay
with me now. Stay with me.

435
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,415
All right. Glove me. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

436
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,375
Stay with us, Nate. Come on now.

437
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,805
He didn't know who I was.

438
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,531
You guys dated for a really
long time. He's faking.

439
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,985
Not Nico. Jason.

440
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,447
They live together.
They're having a baby.

441
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,374
Surely they've discussed...

442
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:52,408
You?

443
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,805
Significant prior relationships.

444
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,641
It's like I didn't exist.

445
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,953
Do you wanna get back
together with Nico?

446
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:02,673
I'm not sure I know him anymore.

447
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,959
He never talked about kids
when we were together.

448
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:07,086
He didn't even want
a fake <i>Sims</i> family.

449
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,578
But apparently it's
different with Jason.

450
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:12,342
You haven't mentioned Nico in months,
and now all of a sudden you're all,

451
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,758
"Oh, why didn't he
do that with me?"

452
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,984
I don't sound like that.

453
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,430
- Well...
- And I don't wanna get back together.

454
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,942
- I...
- Okay.

455
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:25,161
Then you're just upset that his life
has moved further along than yours.

456
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,187
I am?

457
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:31,145
He is living with someone.
They're having a kid together.

458
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,571
You've barely dated.

459
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,828
You're living in a
loft with your coworker

460
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,586
with a twin sheet hanging
between your beds for privacy.

461
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,779
You really do hate me.

462
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,173
No, I'm just...

463
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,861
There are two main reasons
that people get upset

464
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,120
when they run into an ex.

465
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,947
And yours is, "I
am losing at life."

466
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,830
- Are you trying to make this worse?
- I'm just saying.

467
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:53,093
You talk about wanting to meet someone,
and you deleted your dating apps.

468
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,414
You talk about wanting to get into peds,
and you haven't turned in the application.

469
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,274
You wanna win?

470
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,703
Get in the game.

471
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:09,657
Finally.

472
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,393
You do know we were
waiting for you, right?

473
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,930
You told me to take a minute.

474
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:15,338
- All right. Show us what you got.
- Okay. As you can see,

475
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,599
Malan's aberrant basilar artery at
the floor of the third ventricle

476
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:20,601
is a huge problem.

477
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,157
And why is that, Dr. Kwan?

478
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,394
Because in order to insert the
sheath into the third ventricle...

479
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:28,123
No, no, no. Start again but like
you're explaining it to a parent.

480
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,304
Malan has a blood vessel
that is blocking the way,

481
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:34,565
which would make it difficult to
pass the balloon into that area

482
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,594
to create the shunt.

483
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,555
Now, difficult is
an understatement.

484
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,024
The vessel is positioned such

485
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,539
that a fraction of a
millimeter left or right

486
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:44,200
could result in major
bleeding, stroke or worse.

487
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,293
But you've found an
alternative route?

488
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:50,854
No... ...but we might be able
to combine this computer system

489
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:54,883
with the intraoperative imaging technology
that we use for mapping brain tumors.

490
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:59,125
We would program it to provide us with a
real-time guide, with ultra precision in the OR.

491
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,930
So it's like a GPS system of Malan's brain
to make sure you're on the right path?

492
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,490
The safest path.

493
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,255
- And she wouldn't need a VP shunt.
- Hmm.

494
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,727
- How long would it take you to build this technology?
- Me? Forever.

495
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:13,955
But I talked to our tech team
and they have it working now.

496
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,899
I would be willing to try it

497
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:17,559
if the mom agrees.

498
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:21,386
What are you thinking?

499
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:22,422
I'm thinking you're
much more effective

500
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,147
when you take your time.

501
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,998
Find another elevator!
We have a trauma coming!

502
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,260
Move out! Make way
for the gurney!

503
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:33,488
Either hug the wall or
get out of the hall!

504
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:35,046
- We found his wife yet?
- Not yet.

505
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:36,340
- Let's try again.
- Yeah.

506
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,740
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

507
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,290
- You take over pressure?
- Yep.

508
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,537
Type and cross him. Let's
get the blood cooler in here.

509
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,774
Let's raise the temp in this
room and find this man's wife.

510
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,901
Gown and glove me.
No time to scrub.

511
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,172
All right. On three.

512
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:50,406
One, two... ...three.

513
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,781
Let's get this wet
suit off of him now.

514
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,006
Let's run a TEG.

515
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,233
Somebody find his wife.

516
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:56,873
Let's go, let's go.

517
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:03,432
Yeah. "Small dark lesions of
the lips and oral mucosa."

518
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:04,740
Abdominal pain.

519
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:07,768
CT scan shows small bowel
mass with concentric rings.

520
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:13,232
"What is the most likely cause:
Intestinal lipoma or hamartomatous polyp?"

521
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:14,789
Thoughts?

522
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:15,949
Dorian?

523
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:20,418
Oh. Is your tube dislodged?

524
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:23,079
Hey, don't be embarrassed.
It happens to the best of us.

525
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:26,673
Oh, no. Wait, no,
no, no, no, no.

526
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,490
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Dorian?

527
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:31,880
Hey, I-I need help in here.

528
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,961
It's just a bad sprain.

529
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:36,021
It can't hurt to take a look.

530
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,578
Injured during PT? I'm a cliché.

531
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:40,571
All right.

532
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:41,830
- All right.
- Okay.

533
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:44,048
Oh, crap.

534
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,750
What happened? Are you okay?

535
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,859
Oh, I'm fine. I just misstepped.

536
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,018
Take it easy.

537
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:51,346
Dr. Grey, I didn't
know you were in town.

538
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,500
Well, it's just a quick trip.

539
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:54,560
For a consult?

540
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,544
Yeah. I-I asked her, uh,

541
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,357
for a second opinion on
one of my old patients.

542
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,990
And you had that thing
with the house, right?

543
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:06,122
Yes. Uh... Insurance issues.

544
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:08,561
Well, it's always
good to have you here.

545
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:13,079
And I am really looking forward to hearing
the update on your research next month.

546
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,411
- Take care, Altman.
- Thank you.

547
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:20,346
So it's probably nothing, but
we should have it x-rayed.

548
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:23,138
I'm gonna have to run. I can have
a nurse take you to radiology.

549
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:26,606
I'm good. But I do wanna hear
why you're actually here.

550
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,683
I see multiple serosal tears.

551
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:37,340
Would you rather marry a
soulless tech millionaire

552
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:40,643
or the eccentric pharmacist?

553
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:41,811
Neither.

554
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:43,371
No, you have to pick one.

555
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,443
Lap pads.

556
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:52,255
We have an expanding
retroperitoneal...

557
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:02,541
I don't have that much
tension with my roommates.

558
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:04,660
Your roommate is a hundred.

559
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:07,088
Maxine is a young 82.

560
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,043
- Levi.
- Hey.

561
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,630
- You're still here.
- Uh, yeah.

562
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,356
Erin might have
gestational diabetes,

563
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,856
so they're testing her.

564
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,283
How far along is she?

565
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:19,864
Twenty-three weeks.

566
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,224
- Have you picked a name?
- Yeah.

567
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,403
Levon.

568
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:25,707
Really?

569
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,235
- No, I'm just kidding.
- Okay.

570
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,244
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

571
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,887
I corrected him in the elevator.
He felt awful about it.

572
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,347
He seems nice.

573
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,685
Have you been together long?

574
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,112
- Nine months.
- Oh.

575
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:42,672
If he had in his dating profile
that he was in the process

576
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:45,535
of interviewing surrogates, I
probably wouldn't have swiped.

577
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,270
When he told me, I freaked out.

578
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,598
I literally snuck out the back at
Parkside Pizza in the middle of dinner.

579
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:51,942
You left the pizza?

580
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,702
I was really freaked out.

581
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,519
I think I never realized
that I wanted to be a dad.

582
00:25:58,544 --> 00:26:01,410
Maybe I felt that I
wasn't ready for it,

583
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,129
but Jason knew all along
that he wanted to have kids.

584
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,059
And the thought of not
having him in my life...

585
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,586
I...

586
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:10,137
I've never met anyone
in my life like him.

587
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:12,363
He sees light in everything.

588
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:15,758
And these days no
one does, you know?

589
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:21,379
Losing him just seemed a lot scarier than
the idea of having a family with him.

590
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,639
So.

591
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,934
Here we are.

592
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,147
I'm happy for you.

593
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,824
Good luck.

594
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:33,766
Thanks.

595
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:35,445
- You too.
- Hmm.

596
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,039
Just so I'm clear...
You told the woman

597
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,810
whose name is on the
building of where you work

598
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,435
that you stopped doing
research at her request,

599
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,230
- but you're still doing it?
- Trying to.

600
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,472
I am bored at home,

601
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:52,663
and you are living in... in,
like, a medical thriller book.

602
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:54,089
And no one else knows?

603
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,318
- Except Amelia.
- Amelia?

604
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,819
We're not actually...
in a medical thriller.

605
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,988
It's just so bold and exciting.

606
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,090
- And about to be over.
- You found a cure?

607
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,360
I might still be in
a medical thriller.

608
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,330
No, we, um...

609
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,412
We have no money.

610
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:11,333
We had a plan and
it fell through.

611
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,451
Was it Seagrade Tech? They are
pulling back on everything.

612
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:17,512
No, actually, and it doesn't
even matter who we ask

613
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,959
because that's the problem
with secret research.

614
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:21,586
Everybody wants
to talk about it.

615
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,053
- Well, I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't what?

616
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:27,890
Talk about it. Not that I have many
people to talk to these days. Thanks.

617
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:32,502
Listen, Grey-Sloan has
a discretionary fund.

618
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,729
It wouldn't be enough to
fund your whole project,

619
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:38,873
but you could publish an initial
report, and that would open more doors.

620
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:40,498
You would do that?
But... I mean,

621
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,811
don't you have to say where the
money is going? What about Catherine?

622
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:46,239
A breakthrough in an Alzheimer's cure
would go down in medical history,

623
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,901
like a smallpox
vaccine or antibiotics.

624
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:52,107
You just have to get far enough along
that she couldn't deny its value,

625
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:54,601
and I'm willing to
take that risk on you.

626
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,810
- Oh. You go ahead.
- Um, you go.

627
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,236
Really, it's okay.

628
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:07,829
I will grab another one.

629
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,389
Okay.

630
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,391
Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Beltran.

631
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:16,161
I know I can't scrub
in, but can I observe?

632
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:19,248
- Sit with her mother.
- You're letting her mom watch the surgery?

633
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:20,216
No.

634
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,509
Oh.

635
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,295
Maybe we should let him watch.

636
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,564
Even if it's just
from the gallery.

637
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,435
I don't do this
surgery very often.

638
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,863
He's on my service. You can let
him watch when he's on yours.

639
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,377
Where have you been?

640
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:40,319
Peak and plateau alarms
are both going off.

641
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,302
- You checked for obstructions?
- I did. It's clear.

642
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:44,528
And that wouldn't explain
elevated plateau pressure.

643
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,055
Uh... BP's plummeting.

644
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,412
Should we start pressors?

645
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,179
Low urine output, elevated
peak and plateau pressures,

646
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:53,475
low BP, increased
bladder pressure.

647
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,461
It's abdominal
compartment syndrome.

648
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,190
Are you sure he's not
bleeding out somewhere?

649
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,865
We need a cut down tray.

650
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,026
Don't let him die
while I'm gone.

651
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,244
Come on. Stay with me, Dorian.

652
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,682
Okay, if you pulled me out of
the OR for a dislodged tube...

653
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,198
I think it's abdominal
compartment syndrome.

654
00:29:11,222 --> 00:29:13,758
Uh, low urine output, uh, elevated
peak and plateau pressures,

655
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:15,785
BP falling, increased
bladder pressure.

656
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,837
Should I book an OR?

657
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:19,760
No. He'll die before
he gets there.

658
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:21,619
We need to open
him up right here.

659
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,314
Crash cart!

660
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:28,297
Well, thank you for joining us, Yasuda.
Sorry if we're interrupting your break.

661
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:30,991
- Oh, no. Dr. Bailey, I was just asking...
- Not now, Yasuda.

662
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,851

714
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,016
He always comes home.

715
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,859
You know, I spent all this time

00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,452

717
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,886

always loved him.

718
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,505

that all that mattered was us.

722
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:38,581

723

No. No.

725
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:43,874

726
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,936
He knew that you
loved him. He told me.

727
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:48,296
He said the floating to
Hong Kong in the bubble,

728
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,155
none of that was about you.

729
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,311
He wanted to prove to
himself he could do it.

730
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:53,970
And he told me if
he didn't make it

731

739

741
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,750
I went to Yale.
Almost a full year.

742
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:36,412
And then my mom got sick, I moved home
and then one thing led to another.

743
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:38,338
Look, I-I may not have

746
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,800
I am capable of more than
hand-holding a patient's mom.

747
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,345
If you think that
assignment was punitive

748
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,353
because of where you were
educated, you're wrong.

749
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:51,712

750
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:53,002
Of course it was.

751
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:56,673
Do you know who really saved Malan
from severe complications today?

752
00:34:56,698 --> 00:35:00,635
Dr. Shepherd. You.

753
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,564
You and Dr. Shepherd?

754
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:06,226
Malan's mom knew that something
was wrong and brought her here.

755
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,384
Whether they have a medical
degree or not, moms know.

00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,710
You never bet against them.

757
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,306
I don't care where
you went to school.

758
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:15,072
What matters is how you treat
patients, and in peds, their families.

759
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,776
I'm gonna need you to understand that if
you're gonna be on my service tomorrow.

760
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,671
Well, they don't make the
assignments until the morning.

761
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,279
I requested you.

762
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,172
See you tomorrow, Dr. Kwan.

763
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,646
Rough day.

764
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:43,282
I was going to the airport

765
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,910
because I was supposed
to meet Maggie.

766
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,375
But she canceled on me.

767
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:52,312
And then I took it out on
a patient, and he died.

768
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:55,047
We did everything
we could, Winston.

769
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:55,985
And we both knew

770
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,776
from the second we saw
those bars crushing him

771
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,070
this was never going
to be an easy case.

772
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:02,609
I'm sorry about Maggie.

773
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:07,343
We were supposed to talk
about what's next for us.

774
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:12,336
Just like we were supposed to do
last week and the week before.

775
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:18,361
But there's always a
consult, or a class, paper.

776
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:25,003
At what point do I stop trying?

777
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:27,438
I'm not sure there's a good
answer to that question,

778
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:30,632
but maybe the better
question is, "Why?"

779
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,445
Why are you trying?

780
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,795
That might tell you
what you need to know.

784
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:01,540
I made the diagnosis.

785
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:03,313
You didn't even
know what it was.

786
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:04,690
Is there a rule that says

787
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:06,727
the person who makes the
diagnosis does the procedure?

788
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,585
- Not that I know of.
- Shut up!

789
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:12,229
I was trying to be a
good friend to you,

790
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,409
and you repaid me
by lying to Bailey?

791
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,835
- I didn't tell her anything.
- Exactly.

792
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,221
You could've told her I was
looking for the cut down tray

793
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:22,651
or that I sat by Dorian's bedside
all day like she told us to

794
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,279
while you went looking
for procedures!

795
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:27,081
Maybe give him a chance to
explain before you rip into him.

796
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:29,507
He sharked me. No explanation.

797
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:33,463
It's his fault that we're all stuck
in the ICU and not in the OR anyway.

798
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:35,003
You know? And why are
you defending him?

799
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:37,763
- He was a jerk to you too.
- All right. Stop! Just stop.

800
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,489
I'm tired of the blame
and the finger-pointing.

801
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:42,143
It is all our faults.

802
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:44,135
I was there too. So were you.

803
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,659
Kwan didn't do us any favors.

804
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:47,237
We all screwed up.

805
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:51,625

put it behind us and move on.

808
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,486

be your friend anymore.

Hey. I got your text.
What's happening?

842
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:43,470
We have to keep going.

843
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:45,067
How many of these have you had?

844
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,704
Maybe one too many.

845
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,361
But I still don't
think we should quit.

846
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,800
Look, I know that it is gonna be
hard for us to find the money,

847
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:53,681
but what if we
could find a cure?

848
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,191
We gotta keep trying.

849
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,103
I'm happy to hear you
say that because I think

850
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,130
I may have found us some money.

851
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,353
So, I just left Teddy...
