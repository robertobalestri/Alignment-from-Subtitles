1
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:10,614
Research suggests that we
start to recognize our mother's voice

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,791
from the womb around 31 weeks.

3
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,415
Child, I don't know why
you brought me all this way

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,176
just to watch you clean
somebody else's house.

5
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:22,110
I could have been home
watching my stories.

6
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:25,398
This is your new home, Granny.

7
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:26,583
It is?

8
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:30,265
- Did I know that?
- We toured a bunch of places, Granny,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,120
and this is the one you picked.

10
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,285
- Remember?
- Denise...

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:36,255
did I do that?

12
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,507
Do you... do you have to go?

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,067
I can stay a little longer.

14
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,333
Granny...

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,046
I've never seen this.

16
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,971
This is when you
were pregnant with Simone.

17
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,590
As soon as we're born,

18
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,548
our language skills begin to develop.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,591
Okay. True or false.

20
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:04,302
CSF production rate is affected
by intracranial pressure.

21
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:05,800
- False.
- Stop!

22
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,306
Is it true?

23
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:11,907
N-No, you practically
rolled past that stop sign.

24
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,982
Why can't you just ask the
questions without back seat driving?

25
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:18,227
Why can't you just study
with the other interns?

26
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,724
- Okay.
- From birth to six months,

27
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,294
we mostly coo, cry and murmur
as the vocal cords mature.

28
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,719
How old is this thing again?

29
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:30,904
Leona is a 1975 Chevy G10.

30
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:33,733
- We've been through a lot together.
- And you paid money for this?

31
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,037
Shh. She can hear you.

32
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,887
No, no, no. Come on.

33
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:40,509
Come on, Leona.

34
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,880
Just a hundred more yards.

35
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:44,458
Come on, girl, you can do it. Come on.

36
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,708
So, you're just gonna
leave me here alone.

37
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,114
You have Leona.

38
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:55,573
Then we advance to babbling until
words start around 18 months.

39
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,748
Eventually, words lead to sentences.

40
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,553
And soon, we forget the time
when we couldn't speak at all.

41
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,857
Did you, uh, tell your mom
about Allison's playdate?

42
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,212
Yeah. Chloe at 2:00. Yeah.

43
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:05,559
And that she needs socks for the...

44
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,205
- Indoor gym? She knows.
- Thanks.

45
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,114
I don't show up for work one day,

46
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,762
it's because Adams totaled
my car with me in it.

47
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,677
I'm gonna head to the cafeteria.

48
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,716
What was that?

49
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,319
Maybe it's waffle day.

50
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,705
He's just been kind of distant lately.

51
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,493
I mean, he's fine one minute, and
then hardly says two words the next.

52
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,227
I mean, he's normal around the kids,

53
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,825
but then once they're
asleep, he goes to bed.

54
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,294
Have you noticed anything?

55
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,333
- No.
- He said something to you, didn't he?

56
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:38,927
No. No. And I have to check my post-ops,

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,241
and now I can't stop thinking
about waffles.

58
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:44,828
So weird.

59
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,565
I spent 30 bucks on supplies

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,567
to repair the holes
you made on my walls.

61
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,318
Venmo or progress notes. You pick.

62
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,915
I pick you getting out of my face.

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,536
Okay, listen up. The ABSITE
exam is one week from today.

64
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:58,364
If it's not in your calendars,
you no longer work for me.

65
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:01,476
If you are late to the exam,
if you forget to show up,

66
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,823
you also no longer work for me.

67
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,921
- I like standardized tests.
- Said literally no one ever.

68
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,588
Except the one person who aced it.

69
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,453
So, what other programs
did you get into again?

70
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,513
And if you haven't already,
your completed procedure logs

71
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,870
should be submitted to Schmitt or Helm.

72
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,732
- Mine's done.
- Mine's almost done.

73
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:20,691
Well, in the immortal words of
Brandy, "almost doesn't count."

74
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,843
- Griffith. You're late.
- I know. I'm so sorry.

75
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,603
She has eyes in the back of her head.

76
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,295
I can see your reflection
through the window.

77
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,987
- Get it together.
- Morning, Dr. Bailey.

78
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:30,982
- Hey.
- Wow, it's everyone.

79
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,049
Are they in trouble or am I?

80
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,648
They're interns. They're
always in trouble.

81
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,857
Adams.

82
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:41,206
Dorian Cardenas. Post-endoscopic
clip for stress ulcer.

83
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,105
H and H is stable. Tolerating
a clear liquid diet.

84
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,453
His labs are normal, and he
is ambulating and pain-free,

85
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,895
which is why today we are
downgrading him from the ICU.

86
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,701
- Wait, really?
- We know you'll miss having no privacy

87
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:56,117
and all of your suite mates
being in critical condition.

88
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,487
That's Yasuda's way of
saying congratulations.

89
00:03:58,512 --> 00:03:59,789
And...

90
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:07,163
Red Cloak Volume 12? I love this series.

91
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,300
It just came out, according to my son.

92
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,479
Oh, okay, I have to cut
this celebration short.

93
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:15,818
I'm needed in the OR.
I will see you upstairs.

94
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,500
Mmm. Mmm.

95
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,488
As much fun as this party
is, you all have work.

96
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,490
Millin, Griffith, Kwan, take the pit.

97
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,183
Yasuda, Adams, take
Dorian to his new room.

98
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,243
Yeah.

99
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,868
Chest tube, chest tube,
chest tube, chest tube.

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,760
I have one left on my procedure log.

101
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:35,924
Well, me too.

102
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,628
Want to bet who finishes first?

103
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:38,945
Loser buys drinks at Joe's?

104
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,167
You're on.

105
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,850
I got this one. Link, you got the other.

106
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,770
What do we got?

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,764
Gillian Mendelson, 46.

108
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,528
Status Post-MVC. GCS 15.

109
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:52,245
Brief LOC, small head lac,
complaints of headache.

110
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:54,970
I'd think it's a migraine
if I wasn't just in a car accident.

111
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,385
Let's get you inside and check you out.

112
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,894
Wait. I want to make
sure Cassandra is okay.

113
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:03,115
Cassandra Lewis, 45. MVC.
GCS 15. Left knee swelling.

114
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,428
We gave her morphine for the pain.

115
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,764
- Hi.
- Cass, you okay, babe?

116
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,732
Remember when the kids
were at soccer camp

117
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,150
- and we tried those gummies?
- She's okay.

118
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:13,018
We gotta make sure
you are too. Let's go.

119
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,880
Jayden, slow down. Mommy can't

120
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,914
handle any more broken
bones today.

121
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:21,740
- Miles Ferguson?
- Ooh. Ooh.

122
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:24,103
- Oh, this is a bad one.
- How far along are you?

123
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,104
Thirty-nine weeks.

124
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,314
I'm having irregular
contractions. Just Braxton-Hicks.

125
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,784
Nothing serious.

126
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,835
- How's your wrist?
- Wow. This feels like a trap.

127
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,433
Smart man. What happened?

128
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,220
I was moving furniture, getting
the house ready for a showing,

129
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,671
and you know, new shoes,
marble floors, I slipped.

130
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:44,122
It's his brokerage. He has
people who do this for him.

131
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:45,679
They put the desk in the breakfast

132
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,470
nook. It made no
sense. It made no sense.

133
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:48,781
We'll get an X-ray.

134
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,084
Ooh. Oh.

135
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,293
Is that another contraction?

136
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,269
Uh, just indigestion.

137
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,985
It-It started last week.

138
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,680
Uh, my OB says it's normal

139
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,914
- this late in pregnancy.
- Yeah.

140
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:00,923
Oh, th... this is a contraction.

141
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,141
X-ray's pretty backed
up. It might be a while.

142
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,695
Why don't I run you up
to OB in the meantime

143
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,722
just to see how you're progressing.

144
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,972
Yeah, if we're stuck here
for a while, it makes sense.

145
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,197
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

146
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:15,074
Also, the OB nurses have
a secret stash of cookies...

147
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:18,181
and I might know where it is.

148
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:22,702
Oh, well, that's too bad.
Jayden doesn't like cookies.

149
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,225
I do like cookies.

150
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,050
Okay. Well, let's go.

151
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,555
All right.

152
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,539
- Uh, don't fall off anything, please.
- Come on.

153
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,645
- What do you see, Kwan?
- I see nothing.

154
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,131
X-ray looks normal.

155
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,718
So why is my knee the
size of a softball?

156
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,675
There's a lot of blood. So we'll
have to insert a needle and drain it.

157
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,733
Kwan, can you book her
in a procedure room?

158
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,322
- Yep.
- Okay. Gillian's C-spine is clear.

159
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,240
You both are very lucky.

160
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,153
Any idea how fast the
other car was going?

161
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:53,492
- It wasn't. It was parked.
- It was mine.

162
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,252
We were at Hamilton Viewpoint.

163
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,678
- Isn't that where the...
- Teenagers go to make out?

164
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,507
Yeah, we know.

165
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,332
I was going to say where
the trailhead starts,

166
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,050
but I appreciate the tip.

167
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,761
Between work and our kids, we
don't get a lot of alone time,

168
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,203
so I thought it would be
nice to meet for lunch.

169
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:10,102
And by "lunch," I mean,

170
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,991
not lunch, if you know what I mean.

171
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:13,590
Anyway, things heated up.

172
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,583
One of us must have
kicked the parking brake,

173
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,897
and the next thing you know, the
car was rolling down the hill,

174
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:21,686
smashed into her minivan, and my
brain felt like it was gonna explode.

175
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,921
Well, your neuro exam is good, but
we're gonna do a CT just to be safe.

176
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,946
- Okay?
- Great.

177
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,570
Oh. That's mine.

178
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,827
There it is.

179
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:36,823
Shut the curtain.
Please, shut the curtain.

180
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:38,392
Gill?

181
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,659
Are you okay?

182
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,378
Car app said there was an accident.

183
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,362
You won't answer your phone,
so I called the police.

184
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:44,708
They said you were here.

185
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,447
Yeah. I'm... I'm okay.
My head just hurts.

186
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:49,464
Um, doctors, this is Aaron.

187
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,953
- My husband.
- Huh.

188
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:58,002
Nice to meet you.

189
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,347
Dr. Bokhari to peds ICU.

190
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:15,996
Dr. David Bokhari to peds ICU.

191
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,314
- Dr. Ndugu?
- Yeah?

192
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:23,136
I know that it's been
kind of hectic for you

193
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,578
with the under-staffing
in your department.

194
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,979
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

195
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,764
please don't hesitate to let me know.

196
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,736
Okay. Appreciate that.

197
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,113
Maybe we could grab a drink

198
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,796
and get to know each
other better sometime.

199
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,892
Um.

200
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,028
My schedule is a little crazy right

201
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,162
now, but I... I'll keep that in mind.

202
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,337
- Okay.
- All right.

203
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,243
She seems nice.

204
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:56,141
Yeah.

205
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,619
Um, yeah, she is.

206
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:58,887
Did you need something?

207
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,519
Well, looks like

208
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:05,119
we're on Mr. Riley's
hiatal hernia together.

209
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,270
Yeah, looks that way.

210
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,792
Looking forward to it.

211
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,205
Me too.

212
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:18,909
Peekaboo!

213
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,074
Ooh, Jayden took her sweet time.

214
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,058
I was in labor for 72 hours.

215
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,022
Well, this baby is gonna
go a lot faster than that.

216
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,947
You are already four and
a half centimeters dilated.

217
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,239
So, we're gonna have to admit you.

218
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,311
I... I can't be in labor. We're
not ready. My mom's not here.

219
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:36,071
My husband's in the emergency
room with a broken wrist.

220
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:39,523
Okay, um, Lauren, your blood
pressure is going up a little bit.

221
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,948
So just take some deep breaths.

222
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,385
That's great.

223
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,916
Okay. When was the last
time that you saw your OB?

224
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,351
It was, uh, last week.

225
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:51,658
They ran some blood work,
but I haven't heard anything.

226
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,616
- I was scheduled to go back tomorrow.
- Okay.

227
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:57,196
Um, we will call to follow
up on her prenatal records.

228
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,581
- And, um, send for blood and urine tests.
- Yeah.

229
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:01,823
- Will someone tell Miles? Okay.
- I'll get him up here.

230
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,607
Okay. Do you want
us to take Jayden to day care?

231
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,920
Jayden, do you want
to go up to day care?

232
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,622
There's so many fun toys,
and my daughter is there,

233
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,684
and she's almost as old as you.

234
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,697
You wanna go, baby? Yeah? Okay.

235
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,765
Ooh!

236
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,898
Can I have a kiss right here? Mmm.

237
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,072
- All right. I love you.
- Love you.

238
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,096
All right. Thank you.

239
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,745
That little girl

240
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,000
has no idea how much her
life's gonna flip upside down.

241
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,750
It's always been just the three of us.

242
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,743
Kids always handle stuff better
than adults think they will.

243
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:37,768
Oh.

244
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,558
Dads, not so much.

245
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,527
Fair.

246
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,964
Cassandra's in the procedure
room. You think the husband knows?

247
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,089
I think he knows they
went to Pilates and brunch.

248
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:50,925
I kind of want to see
how this turns out,

249
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,849
but... Lincoln's letting me do a knee

250
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,771
aspiration, and I have a bet to win.

251
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:58,351
Mmm. Did I mention I only have
suture one more laceration for my log?

252
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:01,674
One chest tube, two IVs, and
then you're buying me drinks.

253
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,370
You sound very sure about that.

254
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,667
- Loser buys drinks and fries.
- It's gotten completely out of hand.

255
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:07,884
Aaron, please.

256
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,407
She's constantly calling and texting.

257
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:11,478
Always asking for a ride.
She depends on you too much.

258
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:14,169
Do you know how many times
Cass has driven Zoe to soccer?

259
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,274
Too many, if this is the
kind of accident she gets in.

260
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,956
- We should get a lawyer.
- For what?

261
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,956
Our bumper's gone, and
you're in the hospital.

262
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,719
I know she's your friend, I know she's a

263
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:25,035
single mom, but this should not
be on us. She rear-ended you, right?

264
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,399
Okay. CT's ready.
We can get you up now.

265
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:30,324
Great. I mean, okay. Okay.

266
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,661
- Okay, let's go.
- Bye, Aaron.

267
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,411
Bye.

268
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:37,848
Smells of antiseptic,
doesn't have a view, but...

269
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:38,874
It's not the ICU.

270
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:40,472
- And...
- Surprise!

271
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:43,545
No way. James? Fiona?

272
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,856
They reached out and
insisted on being here.

273
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:47,761
- I hope that's okay.
- More than okay.

274
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:49,618
We're in the same engineering program.

275
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,714
Well, we were.

276
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:52,963
Don't worry. We brought all your work

277
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,210
from last semester so you can catch up.

278
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,875
No, we didn't, jerk.

279
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,488
We did bring a bunch of cards

280
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:58,860
from people back at school though.

281
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,948
- Everybody misses you, D.
- Not entirely sure why.

282
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,630
All right, let's get you settled here.

283
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,846
Wait. She... she's in labor?

284
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,226
- Okay, I... I need to sit down.
- You're sitting down.

285
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,193
- You sure?
- You're leaning against the bed...

286
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:14,127
No, no, no. I mean... I mean,
are you sure she's in labor?

287
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,309
She is four and a half
centimeters dilated.

288
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,647
Okay, I gotta get up
there. And where's Jay...

289
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,846
- Hey.
- Ow.

290
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,961
Jayden is in the hospital day care.

291
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,609
You are no good to her
or Lauren with that wrist.

292
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:27,164
Your X-ray shows a
distal radius fracture.

293
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,292
- Is that bad?
- No.

294
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,771
We'll take you to the cast room so

295
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:32,248
someone from ortho can set the bone,

296
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:34,896
they'll make you a splint, and
then you can go have a baby.

297
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:37,701
Okay. Um... how did Lauren seem?

298
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:38,926
- Was she scared?
- Not at all.

299
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,083
- She's doing great.
- Yeah?

300
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,557
- Yeah.
- Okay.

301
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,190
I'll have a nurse get you
something for the pain.

302
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,182
- All right. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,746
- How long does this take?
- It should be quick.

304
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,462
Well, I was hoping it would be longer.

305
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:52,014
If my head wasn't pounding,
I'd just as soon stay.

306
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,223
Well, relax while you
can and hold still, okay?

307
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,927
You want to know how I got
in this mess, don't you?

308
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,699
- You don't have to tell us.
- Kind of.

309
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:01,242
Aaron and I got married
right after law school.

310
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:03,106
We had our kids, we did our jobs.

311
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,453
And then the kids were
older, and work was...

312
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:10,768
Well, I do tax law, and all of it
just got so boring. Uninspiring.

313
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:15,610
But then I met Cass at the PTA,
and she made life... not boring.

314
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,637
So here I am with a giant headache.

315
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:20,440
- Literally and figuratively.
- Complicated.

316
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,092
Do you think she has a
subarachnoid hemorrhage?

317
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:26,646
No, her scan's clear.
Situation's a mess.

318
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,397
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah.

319
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,480
Any updates?

320
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,068
Husbands with broken bones
are forcefully inquiring.

321
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:39,221
She is five centimeters dilated
and progressing beautifully.

322
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:40,457
How's Miles doing?

323
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:42,317
Small break. They're
splinting him now.

324
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,138
He better not use that as an excuse

325
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,219
to avoid changing diapers

326
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,199
or do preschool drop-offs.

327
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:53,020
- You have one daughter, or...
- Yeah, Luna.

328
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:57,298
But my partner, he has a
son. Same age, same chaos.

329
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:59,093
- Nothing like noise, right?
- Right.

330
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,060
You've got this. I'll
bring Miles up in a bit.

331
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,915
- Okay. Thank you.
- Can I have a...

332
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,362
- Can I have a tissue?
- Sure.

333
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,900
Lauren, are you okay? Do you
have any headaches? Blurry vision?

334
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,478
Is something wrong?

335
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,308
Have her blood and
urine tests come back yet?

336
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,244
Okay. Just breathe. Breathe.

337
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,041
Damn it, her blood
pressure's skyrocketing.

338
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,327
Oh, oh, she's having
an eclamptic seizure.

339
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,432
Let's get her on her side. There you go.

340
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:32,298
Push six-gram bolus of
mag and page Dr. DeLuca.

341
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,111
We have to take her
for a C-section now.

342
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,720
Okay. You're okay,
Lauren. Okay. It's okay.

343
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:42,181
Nice work, Kwan. Keep going.

344
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:45,140
Guess this is the price
you pay for great sex, huh?

345
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:46,455
Seems expensive.

346
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,602
Expensive.

347
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,432
That's what I thought of
Gillian when we first met.

348
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,365
She'd show up to school meetings
in her pricey athleisure,

349
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,202
and just when the
meeting was about to end,

350
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,506
she'd always have one more question.

351
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,434
Everything about her should annoy me,

352
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,650
but... she mesmerizes me.

353
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,482
Her voice, her persistence, her body.

354
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,146
And the sex.

355
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:11,487
Just mind-blowingly good.
Bust-your-knee-not-even-care good.

356
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,111
And I know she's not gonna leave
Aaron until the kids are in college,

357
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,896
but... I can't stop.

358
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,206
Don't want to.

359
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,264
Especially when she does this thing...

360
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:24,094
Okay. It looks like we're all done here.

361
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,030
You need an MRI on that knee.

362
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,541
Dr. Kwan will take you.
One more IV and you're done.

363
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,630
Can I get my bra back?

364
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:47,245
Um, how are you gonna pay for that?

365
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,912
Just wanted a bite.

366
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,176
Just like how you wanted to take a

367
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,667
bite out of the stew I made last night

368
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:53,977
and then it was gone?

369
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,763
Take as many as you want.

370
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:59,447
And that is how roommates share food.

371
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,050
Where were you this morning?

372
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:02,429
My grandma...

373
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:07,681
- Got an underwire guy.
- Mm-mmm. It's my patient's.

374
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:11,974
Who is having an affair with my
patient who is married to a man.

375
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,342
- Juicy.
- I'm Team Gillian.

376
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,367
I think that marriage is
an antiquated institution.

377
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,130
Well, does her husband know that?

378
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:19,795
Oh. Radiology. Gotta go.

379
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,979
- That's all you.
- Thank you.

380
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:24,423
I love grapes.

381
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,170
So, what time is dinner at Joe's?

382
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:27,795
Oh, so it's dinner now?

383
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,251
- Are you afraid of losing?
- No.

384
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:31,747
I'm just trying to remember what

385
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,879
nights they do wine pairings at Joe's.

386
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,637
Oh, I got tied up
approving some purchase orders.

387
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:45,132
- Sorry I'm late.
- Late for...

388
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,953
Surgery. Ndugu asked
that I scrub in with you.

389
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:51,269
- May I ask why?
- Well, he didn't say.

390
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,348
Richard, I appreciate you
looking out for me, but I am good.

391
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,618
I had three procedures
yesterday and one this morning,

392
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,871
and a hiatal hernia is nothing for me.

393
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,587
- Don't worry.
- Right.

394
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,328
Well, glad you're here.

395
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,084
- Talk to me.
- Thirty years old.

396
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,451
Gravida 2, para 1.

397
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,569
No past medical history. Rapidly
progressed into eclampsia.

398
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,474
- What's mom's name?
- Lauren.

399
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,123
- Ten blade.
- Okay.

400
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,905
Okay, Lauren. We're gonna get this

401
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,651
baby out, and then
you're gonna be fine.

402
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:22,367
Just a few more seconds.

403
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,998
I'm through the uterine wall.

404
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,578
Get ready, everybody.
Baby coming your way.

405
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,951
Have the NICU team on standby.

406
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:33,068
Baby looks good.

407
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:35,480
Clamp.

408
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:38,620
Scissors.

409
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:40,820
I know.

410
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,020
Okay.

411
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:48,123
Ah, she's bleeding heavily.

412
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,897
Massaging the uterus.
Give her more Pitocin and push TXA.

413
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,648
Her blood pressure's rising again.

414
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:55,537
It's uterine atony and DIC.
We got a bleeder. Clamp.

415
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,613
- O-chromic.
- Watch out for the ureter.

416
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:00,828
Yeah. Okay. Bleeding's under control.

417
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:02,865
Okay, let's close the hysterotomy.

418
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,330
The sooner we get her upstairs,
the sooner she meets her baby.

419
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,514
O-PDS.

420
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,310
She's hemorrhaging.

421
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:11,415
Okay, it looks like the upper abdomen.

422
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,970
It could be a liver
subcapsular hematoma.

423
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,154
Was she complaining of
right upper quadrant pain?

424
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,019
She was in labor.
I thought her pain was that.

425
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,641
I... Okay. Um... We're
gonna convert to an ex lap.

426
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,979
I need lap pads and page Dr. Bailey.

427
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:25,716
What do you mean her scan is clear?

428
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:28,087
- Aaron.
- You're clearly in pain.

429
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,514
We're gonna keep her in for
observation. This could be a concussion.

430
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:32,574
- She did hit her head pretty hard.
- You did?

431
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,244
Well, that's how she got the cut.

432
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:35,750
Why didn't the airbag inflate?

433
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,245
Oh, uh, it did. I... I hit the door.

434
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,323
Can we not talk about this now?

435
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:41,180
But the cut's on the
right side of your head...

436
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,255
Listen, the good thing is...

437
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,976
If you were driving,
the door would be...

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,860
- Oh, my head is really pounding.
- Try to keep the ice pack...

439
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,785
She hit you so hard that
it flipped you in your seat?

440
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:52,087
That woman should definitely
not be driving our kids around.

441
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,388
She's irresponsible and...

442
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,388
We're having an affair!

443
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,533
Could we please be anywhere else?

444
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,715
- What'd you say?
- An affair!

445
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,097
You know, sex? The thing
you and I never have anymore.

446
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:06,091
That's what Cass and I
were doing in the back seat,

447
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:09,448
like we've been doing for two years.

448
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:12,201
Two years! Any more questions?

449
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:25,223
I felt a lot better yelling at him.

450
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:29,123
Well, sometimes getting it
all out can be a huge relief.

451
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:34,005
No, no, I... I feel awful
now, but when I'm yelling...

452
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:37,755
my head doesn't hurt!

453
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,470
Lauren is at five centimeters.

454
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,324
What?

455
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:51,090
I texted your regular OB,
but she hasn't responded yet.

456
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:55,335
Okay. Did, uh... Did Lauren tell
you how on-brand this is for me?

457
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,436
She may have hinted a little.

458
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:59,878
We first met in college.
Intro to macroeconomics.

459
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,157
Yeah. She was so beautiful,
I just couldn't stop staring.

460
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,238
Didn't even notice there was no
chair where I was trying to sit.

461
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,103
Fell flat on my ass in front
of the girl of my dreams.

462
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,716
That's sweet.

463
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,599
Yeah, hurt like hell,
but she's worth it though.

464
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,344
Uh, they can take you to
Lauren Ferguson's room.

465
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,321
I'll check in as soon as
I respond to this page.

466
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,589
- Okay, cool.
- All right.

467
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:24,898
Dr. Ford to Pediatrics.

468
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:26,836
Dr. Sue Ellen Ford to Pediatrics.

469
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,183
You left the box of your
soccer crap in the garage.

470
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,422
Did you change the password
to the online study prep?

471
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,873
It kicked me out mid-session last night.

472
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:33,990
Because it's my login.

473
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,234
- Not the Benny story.
- Just here to check vitals.

474
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:37,328
Sure.

475
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:40,272
So, James is telling Benny
about how Bronk Industries

476
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:42,368
is a corrupt government organization.

477
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,519
He's read the reports, blah, blah, blah.

478
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,890
- Who's Benny?
- Transfer student. Good guy.

479
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:51,007
Anyway, James is going on and
on until finally Benny goes,

480
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,103
"You don't know my last name, do you?"

481
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:56,081
Benny's last name is Bronk.

482
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:58,774
His dad owns the company.

483
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,767
You know who won't be recruiting
James after graduation?

484
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,643
Hey, could you guys give me a minute?

485
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,562
- Yeah, of course.
- Sure.

486
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,216
It sucks when your friends
move on without you.

487
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,803
No, that's not...

488
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,242
I think my ostomy bag is leaking.

489
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,858
Okay, Gillian, we took
the image. Just give it a second.

490
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,142
Can I yell?

491
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,962
Uh, sure.

492
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:30,037
I'm really sorry, but it feels
so much better when I do this.

493
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:34,075
Gillian, I'm going to
turn off the intercom.

494
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:37,229
So just yell at us if you need anything.

495
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,573
Mmm.

496
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,818
Hey, so you missed the version
where she was yelling at her husband.

497
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,141
Uh, oh. Hey, have you talked to Teddy?

498
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,685
Hmm? Um, oh, Scans are up.

499
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,067
Yeah, I still don't see anything.

500
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,824
She was yelling into a
pillow the entire way up here.

501
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,851
We only got a break
when we did the scan.

502
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,957
Gillian, we are going to scan you

503
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:02,320
again, and this time
just keep screaming.

504
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:05,141
No problem!

505
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,070
Millin, what happens to the venous

506
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:09,359
pressure in the head
when we scream?

507
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:12,490
- Does it... Does it shift?
- You are correct.

508
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,657
And so am I. There.

509
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:21,959
Gillian, you have something called
an Arnold-Chiari malformation.

510
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:23,548
It can be triggered by whiplash.

511
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,861
Screaming shifts your cerebellar tonsils

512
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,198
which relieves some of
the intracranial pressure.

513
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,004
That is why it is
making you feel better.

514
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,395
Can you make it so I
don't have to scream

515
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,458
- to feel good?
- Please make it stop. I'm sorry.

516
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:40,141
It is a straightforward
surgery to relieve the pressure.

517
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,600
We can do it tonight.

518
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,662
Thank you.

519
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:47,126
Can I see Cassandra?

520
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:49,367
God, I miss the OR.

521
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:52,429
I mean, the sterility of the
room, the clinking of instruments.

522
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,146
I mean, even the smell of the cautery.

523
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:57,616
The left and right
pleura are approximated.

524
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:59,200
It's the place where my brain

525
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,272
completely turns everything else off.

526
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,305
Um, BokHee, we're gonna
need another reload.

527
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,708
Yeah, I'm sure Owen is happy

528
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:06,142
that I'm out of his hair at home.

529
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:10,560
He has just been so great, taking
on the lion's share of parenting

530
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:12,691
on top of his 60-hour work week.

531
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:15,143
Then taking care of me I'm sure
was the last thing that he needed.

532
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,670
No, I bet he didn't mind.

533
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,972
Did I tell you about

534
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,844
the amyloidosis case I read yesterday?

535
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:23,521
No, but I'm guessing
you're about to. Another suture, BokHee.

536
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,931
The appendage of the man's right atrium

537
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:28,613
was literally green in the picture.

538
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:30,649
It's not the ostomy bag.

539
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,746
- It's fluids.
- So it's coming from the incision?

540
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:35,516
- Did my incision open up?
- Adams, get a fistula bag.

541
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,312
We need to measure how
much fluid is coming out.

542
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:39,693
It might be an enterocutaneous fistula.

543
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,515
It's when your skin becomes attached
to part of your digestive tract.

544
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,526
We need to get you to CT to make sure.

545
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,209
Will you tell my friends where I went?

546
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:50,683
- I don't want them to worry.
- Of course. I got you.

547
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,091
There you go.

548
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,816
Hey, I was finishing up a lap chole.

549
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,990
Came as soon as I
could. What do we have?

550
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,304
We did a crash section
and had uncontrollable bleeding.

551
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,961
I think it's a ruptured liver
hematoma from HELLP syndrome.

552
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,481
- We think or we know?
- The labs still aren't back.

553
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:10,621
Damn it, she's
bleeding from the uterus again.

554
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:12,692
- Should we take a VIR?
- No, she's lost too much blood.

555
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:14,624
We need to do a hysterectomy.
Heaney clamp.

556
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,237
Okay. How many units so far?

557
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:18,525
Four units of blood, two units of FFP.

558
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,940
She's gonna need more.

559
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,011
Ligating the round ligament.

560
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:22,554
All right, page IR.

561
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:25,566
Have them on standby for
an emergent embolization

562
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,233
if we can't get control in here.

563
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,880
Okay, uterus is coming out.

564
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,563
- Dr. Bailey, did you...
- We're gonna need blood now.

565
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:33,126
- More lap sponges.
- Okay, suction.

566
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,542
Oh, my God, what happened?

567
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:35,843
Uh, Griffith,

568
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,835
call the blood bank and activate MTP.

569
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,528
Griffith, now!

570
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,437
Yasuda, what do you see?

571
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:50,536
- An enterocutaneous fistula.
- Recommended treatment?

572
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,791
We'll need to surgically remove
the connection that was formed

573
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:56,743
- between Dorian's small bowel and skin.
- Damn it.

574
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,983
For now, no food or
drinks by mouth for him.

575
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,700
He was just starting to
not be absolutely miserable.

576
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,111
If we don't restrict his
diet, it will only get worse.

577
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:08,623
Get a CBC, and we should think
about taking him back to the ICU.

578
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,152
News keeps getting better.

579
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,972
We already started IV antibiotics.

580
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,622
That should help soon,

581
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,248
but might be a few days
until we can operate.

582
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,552
You wanna tell him or should I?

583
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:37,179
Property returned.

584
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,665
Man, you find a bra that you love,
and they'll just stop making it.

585
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:41,173
It's a whole thing.

586
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,564
Didn't ask.

587
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:44,151
Uh, just checking with Lincoln

588
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,833
on booking Cassandra's meniscus repair.

589
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:46,963
Mm-hmm.

590
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,821
Are you thinking about
backing out of our bet?

591
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:53,526
No, I love free dinners.

592
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,650
I hope you get one sometime.

593
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:57,776
Your smugness just
makes me more motivated.

594
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,045
Well, it's not smug if it's true.

595
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,881
In fact, if I lose,

596
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:06,210
steak and lobster at Nicoletti's.

597
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,892
You confident enough to up the ante?

598
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,249
Okay.

599
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:13,461
Then if I lose,

600
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,758
we have sex in a car.

601
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,172
That's how confident I am.

602
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:20,973
Or how much you wanna
have sex in a car with me.

603
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:29,221
Dr. Beckett to the
ER. Dr. James Beckett to the ER...

604
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:30,410
Is D okay? Can we see him?

605
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:32,834
We figured he'd be hungry,
but it's probably cold by now.

606
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,684
Well, he can't eat it anyway.

607
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,273
He loves chicken Parm. It's
from his favorite place.

608
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:37,792
Can we leave it for him to eat tomorrow?

609
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:40,198
He can't eat it tomorrow,
or the day after.

610
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,915
He might never eat again.

611
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,279
Really? Why?

612
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:44,902
Because he was shot.

613
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,180
Three bullets went into his body.

614
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,098
He's been hanging on
by a thread for weeks.

615
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,554
And he's already feeling disconnected

616
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,289
enough not knowing
how long he'll be here.

617
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:54,809
He doesn't need to listen to
stories about people he doesn't know

618
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,914
or graduations he won't attend.

619
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,562
He just needs to know that
you're actually here for him.

620
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:01,184
Hey, Adams, let's take a walk.

621
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,980
Maybe it's for the better
that you weren't here.

622
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:04,714
You obviously have no idea
what he's been through.

623
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,949
Adams! Take a walk!

624
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,441
I am so sorry about that.
I will be right back, okay?

625
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,275
- Are you out of your mind?
- Dorian's been here for 51 days,

626
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,240
and they waited till now to visit him?

627
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:25,777
Maybe he didn't want them
here. What is your problem?

628
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:33,871
Come on, Lauren,

629
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:35,781
you've got two beautiful
babies waiting for you.

630
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:37,005
BP is still dropping.

631
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,929
Um, doing a Pringle.

632
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,926
Uh, she's coding!

633
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,020
Damn it.

634
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,410
Okay, starting CPR.

635
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:49,759
- Okay, Wilson, keep packing.
- Yeah.

636
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:52,246
- Griffith, gown and glove.
- I haven't completed my procedure log.

637
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,079
I don't know if I should...

638
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:54,489
I don't care about
the damn log right now.

639
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,689
I care about this woman dying
on the table. I need more hands.

640
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:01,069
Okay, remember when you and Adams
did the Pringle maneuver in the rig

641
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:02,795
- and you clamped with your fingers?
- Yes.

642
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,506
Okay, you're gonna do that again.

643
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,931
Come on.

644
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:09,941
All right, find the paraduodenal
ligament and squeeze.

645
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:13,508
- Got it.
- Good.

646
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:16,821
Okay. All right, hold
your fingers still.

647
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,683
- Mr. Ferguson?
- Yes. Yeah.

648
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,133
Your wife is in surgery...

649
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,961
Lauren, is she...

650
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:53,368
She lost... a lot of blood.

651
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:56,864
But she is stable, and we
are taking her to the ICU.

652
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:59,832
Turns out her indigestion
wasn't indigestion.

653
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:03,077
Her pain was worsening preeclampsia.
It caused her liver to fail.

654
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,920
But your baby is healthy, and we are

655
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,908
doing everything we can for Lauren.

656
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:09,211
Preeclampsia? I don't understand.

657
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:11,257
Shouldn't someone have seen this?

658
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,008
I mean, we were just at our OB.

659
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,153
We were here for two hours
before she went into labor.

660
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,373
- Mr. Ferguson...
- All we've done is plan,

661
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,112
you know, since the day that we
found out we were having another baby.

662
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:25,582
I mean, we read all the
books, the online discussions.

663
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:30,731
We just settled on a doula and a
lactation consultant, just in case.

664
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:34,747
You know, Lauren was not
gonna be another statistic.

665
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,746
This was not in our plan.

666
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:39,241
This was not in our plan.

667
00:30:41,036 --> 00:30:42,313
I'm sorry.

668
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,463
Okay.

669
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,005
- When can I see her?
- I'll go check.

670
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,482
Thank you. Okay.

671
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,518
If...

672
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,472
If Lauren had...

673
00:31:00,954 --> 00:31:03,129
- I-I don't know if I could do this.
- You could.

674
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,100
Have you picked out a name?

675
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:11,784
We have.

676
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:14,531
It's Simone.

677
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,095
It means "faith."

678
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,629
Excuse me?

679
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:25,011
Emani. It means "faith."

680
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,642
Aaron.

681
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:37,193
I wasn't sure you'd still be here.

682
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:40,519
Gillian's the mother of my children.
I wanted to make sure she was okay.

683
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,163
Yeah. Well, Dr. Shepherd
repaired the malformation.

684
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:47,435
Gillian is recovering
in the ICU. She's okay.

685
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,530
Not exactly sure what had happened.

686
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:57,388
There was never any big fight...
or anything. We just... stopped talking.

687
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,076
And I told myself that...

688
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,186
maybe that's what happens when
you've been married for 20 years.

689
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,682
You know what the other person is
thinking, you don't have to talk.

690
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:05,949
But I think...

691
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:10,609
I was just scared of losing her,

692
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:12,306
so I didn't ask.

693
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,412
But now I've lost her anyway.

694
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,248
I am sorry.

695
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:30,120
All right, let's start
Miss Amelia on pressors,

696
00:32:30,145 --> 00:32:31,984
and keep checking on
her every 15 minutes.

697
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:33,883
- All right?
- Absolutely, Doctor.

698
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:35,988
Dr. Crosley
to cardiothoracic surgery.

699
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:39,223
Dr. Bill Crosley to
cardiothoracic surgery.

700
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:40,544
I missed you in surgery.

701
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:41,847
Yeah. Sorry about that.

702
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:44,332
It's just been one of those days.

703
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:49,509
Um, I know you and Maggie
have been discussing divorce.

704
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:52,429
I just want you to know
you have my full support.

705
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,880
Okay.

706
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,928
I've come to care for
you like a son. I...

707
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:57,657
I don't want that to change.

708
00:32:57,682 --> 00:33:02,359
So if you want to know that
nurse better, be my guest.

709
00:33:02,384 --> 00:33:05,846
You're an attractive man
with quite a few years left.

710
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:08,218
You deserve to have a little fun.

711
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:11,311
Just you don't have to
avoid me like you did today.

712
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,544
It's only weird if you make it weird.

713
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,778
Actually, my bypass graft ran long.

714
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:19,376
That's why I didn't make
the hiatal hernia repair.

715
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,622
So, I just made it weird.

716
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:24,683
Yeah.

717
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,532
But, uh...

718
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:28,744
it's good to know I
have your full support.

719
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:33,726
Yeah.

720
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,492
- Hey.
- Hey, what can I get you?

721
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:44,564
- Two shots of tequila, please.
- You got it.

722
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:49,465
Thank you.

723
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,125
You meeting someone?

724
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:56,471
Nope. I don't wanna talk.

725
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,794
Thank you.

726
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,204
- Refill.
- Yeah.

727
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,159
Dr. Wilson? Lauren Ferguson's
labs just came back.

728
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:37,057
I was about to head
home. Everything okay?

729
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:42,229
My patient's labs just came
back positive for HELLP syndrome

730
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,496
hours after she went through hell.

731
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:46,695
She won't recover for months.

732
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:49,979
Her four-year-old daughter
and her newborn baby girl

733
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,468
almost lost their mom today.

734
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,174
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:57,349
If... If I'd just put
a rush on these labs then...

736
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,166
all this could've been avoided.

737
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:01,676
I read about these awful
outcomes all the time.

738
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:03,929
I'm just... part of the problem.

739
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:05,552
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on yourself?

740
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:08,112
My patient was sick,
and I didn't know it.

741
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,626
I don't know if I didn't
ask the right questions

742
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,000
or if I wasn't listening, but
either way, it's a problem.

743
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:22,237
I think... I think I need
to quit general surgery

744
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:26,917
and... focus all my time on OB.

745
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:32,292
Okay.

746
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,148
Okay.

747
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:45,609
Did you go apologize
to Dorian's friends?

748
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:48,594
After you called me out in front
of them, maybe you should apologize.

749
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,104
Maybe I should apol...

750
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,771
You're lucky it was me that saw you

751
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:54,074
and not Schmitt or Bailey.

752
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,840
Otherwise, you'd be stuck on night call,

753
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:57,316
pulling objects out of drunk people's

754
00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,011
butts like me most of the time lately.

755
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:00,623
So, you're welcome.

756
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:03,015
Would you have done
the same thing for Kwan?

757
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,535
You moved out!

758
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,891
And I didn't even ask Kwan to
move in. That was all Griffith.

759
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,445
So I am sorry that you two
didn't work out, but I...

760
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,541
It's not about Simone.

761
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,590
You said you were done.

762
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:19,409
Yeah, because I was mad
that you stole the procedure.

763
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:20,660
I didn't think that
you would just, like,

764
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:22,275
disappear into the middle of the night

765
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,808
like my camp girlfriend
after I wrote her a poem.

766
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,032
Are you laughing at me?

767
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:31,128
No, I just...

768
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:34,840
Yeah, I'm remembering what it was
like to fight with you, and it's...

769
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:37,590
I mean, it's the most
normal I've felt in a while.

770
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:39,823
That is pathetic...

771
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,075
Skywalker.

772
00:36:43,056 --> 00:36:44,437
There it is.

773
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:54,143
Mmm. I'm almost done.

774
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:57,019
Oh, your mom texted. The
kids are down, shockingly.

775
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,485
I'm afraid of losing you, Teddy.

776
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,177
I had an EKG two days ago.
Ndugu said everything is good.

777
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:05,542
It's not, Teddy.

778
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,488
It feels like...

779
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:09,296
It feels like we're on autopilot.

780
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:11,229
The kids, their schedule, our schedule.

781
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:12,995
It made sense when you were recovering,

782
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,475
but now that you're better, it
feels like we're still far apart.

783
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,959
We don't talk anymore.

784
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,582
I am struggling in my work right now,

785
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,999
and I'm talking to Amelia about
it when I should be talking to you.

786
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,922
Owen, I want you to talk to me.

787
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:26,270
But I can't because I don't
wanna...

788
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,798
- I don't wanna put more stress on you...
- I'm fine.

789
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:30,859
You flatlined in front of me.

790
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,894
Owen, I... I don't know what
else to do to convince you

791
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,230
that you are not going to break me.

792
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,188
Please, talk to me.

793
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:42,674
I mean, if there is anything
that I have been able to count on

794
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,298
in the last 20 years,
it's... it's you, it's us.

795
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:49,585
I miss you.

796
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:51,913
I miss us.

797
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,681
What? Wait. What are you doing?

798
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:07,147
Children are less afraid to
say what they're feeling than adults.

799
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:13,764
I miss us too.

800
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,190
It's only as we get older,

801
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:18,045
that we learn to censor ourselves.

802
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:24,810
Maybe we do it because we're
simply afraid to rock the boat.

803
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,958
Ah. Another shot, Darren.

804
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,221
You got it.

805
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,933
John?

806
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:34,519
- Does it even start with a J?
- No.

807
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,167
Oh, sorry.

808
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,313
Griffith?

809
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,982
- Oh, no.
- Picking up?

810
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,927
Let's go. Thank you.

811
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:54,090
I'm not at work right now, so,
technically, you can't tell...

812
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,394
If you like your job, you will
not finish that sentence. Get up.

813
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,824
Or maybe we're terrified
that by saying what we feel,

814
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:03,927
or asking for what we need...

815
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:06,472
that it will cause more drama
than there is to begin with.

816
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:09,849
- That doesn't look good.
- Uh, she wanted space.

817
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:12,118
But I'll check on her at home later.

818
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:17,605
So do milkshakes count
as a dessert or a drink?

819
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,942
Because we only bet drinks.

820
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,305
I'd say either.

821
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:22,281
I can cover them if you want.

822
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,431
No, no, I settle my bets.

823
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:27,802
So, I guess all that's
left is sex in a car.

824
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:30,827
Guess so.

825
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,856
Hey, you ate without me?

826
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,774
You have to sit here till I'm done.

827
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,209
Hi...

828
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,586
So we choose, over and over again,

829
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:43,248
to tamp down our voices.

830
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,698
And a milkshake. Thank you.

831
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,792
To stuff it so far down,

832
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,697
it can make us sick.

833
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:55,621
Until we can't anymore,
and we have to let it out.

834
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,792
How do you know where everything is?

835
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,996
I've been here more times than I'd like.

836
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,952
Atypical abdominal pain. That's
what I should've been thinking.

837
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,585
You're not an OB-GYN.

838
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,475
I know, but I should've
said something to Dr. Wilson.

839
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,421
My mother died at Grey-Sloan...

840
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,027
while giving birth to me.

841
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,117
Oh, I... I didn't know
that. Simone, I'm so sorry.

842
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,387
I don't know all the details, but
I know someone missed something.

843
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,702
I always wondered who
those doctors were.

844
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,862
Now I know they're me.

845
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,750
Look at me.

846
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:50,086
Look at me.

847
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:55,512
You did everything
you were taught today.

848
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,513
Everything that we were taught.

849
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:02,683
This is why we need to be here.

850
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:05,373
Why patients like Lauren

851
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:09,082
need surgeons like us to care for them.

852
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:15,187
It is our job to make sure that
no one falls through the cracks.

853
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,019
To make sure that no
one overlooks their pain.

854
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,506
And... And it's not fair.

855
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:25,887
No, it shouldn't be this way.
