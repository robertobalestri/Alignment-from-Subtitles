00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:10,432
<i>Research suggests</i>
<i>that up to 40% of our day</i>

2
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,903
<i>is spent acting out</i>
<i>existing habits...</i>

3
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,938
Smells amazing.
What are you making?

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,909
Celebratory arrabbiata for your
last day as a general surgeon.

5
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:22,478
<i>...rather than</i>
<i>making new decisions.</i>

6
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:25,916
Mmm. It's so good.
The kids are gonna love it.

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,218
Mmm. Well, they'll
have to love it tomorrow

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,719
'cause they've already been fed,
bathed and put to bed.

9
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:31,787
It's just you and me?

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,821
It's just you and me.

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,429
<i>From sleep to personal</i>
<i>hygiene to diet and exercise.</i>

12
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:42,631
So this is
my curriculum description

13
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:44,134
of my
Bleeding Intervention Program.

14
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,303
I wanna show it to every
chief of trauma surgery

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,370
in the country.

16
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,438
Yeah, it's good.

17
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:50,506
Clear.

18
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,280
So, hey, um, you had a chance
to look at the budget, or...

19
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,149
<i>Some of our habits</i>
<i>serve us well.</i>

20
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:01,450
Come here.

21
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:02,618
Hmm? Oh.

22
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,154
Okay.

23
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:05,989
<i>Others can be more complicated.</i>

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,063
<i>You want to change a habit?</i>

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,636
<i>Behavioral scientists suggest</i>
<i>starting small.</i>

26
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,372
Incoming.

27
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,872
-Hey.
-Hey.

28
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,541
Do you wanna go grab a bite?

29
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,476
I wish, but I'm waiting on labs.

30
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,380
It'll go faster if you go
down there and ask in person.

31
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,847
You have your way, I have mine.

32
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,351
Fair.

33
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,186
I'm gonna go
grab something to eat.

34
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:38,121
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah, definitely.

35
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,789
<i>Make one minor</i>
<i>adjustment over time.</i>

36
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,993
Time of death: 2024.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,396
We're still in a rough patch,

38
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,466
but we talked
and we're gonna keep trying.

39
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:51,301
Well, you know,
she is right.

40
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,903
If you go down there yourself,
it'll be much faster.

41
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,473
Great.

42
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,308
<i>It creates</i>
<i>a domino effect</i>

43
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,010
<i>that helps us make</i>
<i>bigger changes down the line.</i>

44
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,844
Dr. Fox.

45
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,981
Uh, what brings you to my
little corner of the hospital?

46
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,883
Natasha here is just taking me
on a little tour.

47
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:11,354
I wish I'd known. I would
have prepared a presentation.

48
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,423
You don't have to
put on a show for me.

49
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:15,657
I just like to pop in
from time to time

50
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,860
and see where my money's going.

51
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:20,662
Well, uh, if you have
any questions, I'm--

52
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:24,767
Ah. I think I've seen
everything I needed to see.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,970
Good night, Dr. Shepherd.

54
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>Make a radical change,</i>

55
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,710
<i>and you've set yourself up</i>
<i>for failure.</i>

56
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,047
We have a problem.

57
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:01,471
Well, you are a sight
for sore eyes.

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,571
-Hi.
-Hey.

59
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:04,207
Oh...

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,976
You came all the way back here
for one patient?

61
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,045
You are some doctor,
Maggie Pierce.

62
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,879
Well, I've been with him
for a long time

63
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,449
and he's getting bad news today,

64
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,616
so thought it should
come from me.

65
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,459
Hi. How are you?

66
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:23,960
Good.

67
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:25,462
How was your flight?

68
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:27,130
Bumpy, and there
weren't any snacks.

69
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:30,200
But I made it here,
so I guess it did its job.

70
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,368
Guess it did, yeah.

71
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:37,840
-Well, I gotta prep
for a surgery, so...
-Of course.

72
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,811
-We'll catch up later.
-Yeah, all right.

73
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,089
Dr. Altman.

74
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,690
Yes. Please, uh, come in.

75
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:55,791
Have a seat.

76
00:03:58,328 --> 00:03:59,761
Thanks.

77
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:02,532
Dr. Adams,
we would like to follow up

78
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,201
on the investigation
of Sam Sutton's death.

79
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,704
The family has decided to settle
with the hospital.

80
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,543
And our GME Council
is recommending

81
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:17,514
that you remediate
your intern year.

82
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:20,083
Wait, I have to start over?

83
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:23,620
The Council just
gave a recommendation.

84
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:26,122
Catherine Fox will make
the final decision.

85
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:29,392
Her office will be reaching out
to set a meeting with you.

86
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:32,295
Uh, but does
this recommendation say

87
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,662
what I should have done instead?

88
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:35,831
While I had
a patient bleeding out

89
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,300
and there was
no attending in the room?

90
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,369
That was a unique situation,

91
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,472
and I am sorry that my medical
crisis left you alone in the OR.

92
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,174
But after the investigation,

93
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:46,376
the Council is not confident
that you will be ready

94
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,478
to move forward
with your surgical training.

95
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,980
I wasn't the only intern
who operated on him.

96
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,516
But it was your decision to cut.

97
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,019
Your judgment is in question,
not your skills.

98
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,493
Look, I know repeating
your intern year

99
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,428
sounds like a big price to pay--

100
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,231
Adams.

101
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,731
Thanks for letting me know.

102
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm not giving you
my grandmother's
banana bread recipe.

103
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:15,871
- Good morning.
- I gave you my car.

104
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,674
Yes, because the judge made you.

105
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,342
All right. Time-out.
We need to make this quick.

106
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,776
I have an important surgery
to prepare for.

107
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,545
Sorry, Dr. Ndugu.
Just give me the recipe.

108
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,745
-Not happening.
-Dr. Griffith.

109
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,714
Mason Peterson, 16 years old

110
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,849
with idiopathic
pulmonary hypertension.

111
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:30,420
Admitted for new onset
congestive heart failure.

112
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,121
Do you have any
big plans for today?

113
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,390
What do you think?
Thought I'd run a marathon.

114
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:38,228
Go for a swim after.
Lift some weights.

115
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:42,999
I think you're gonna
need new lungs for all that.

116
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,768
-Did she say...
-He's getting new lungs?

117
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,638
And a heart.
We just got the call.

118
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:52,242
Oh, my God. Baby.

119
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,110
I'm gonna go with the team
to procure the organs,

120
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,912
and Dr. Ndugu here
will get you prepped

121
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,447
for the operating room, okay?

122
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,449
Oh, baby.

123
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,720
Schmitt, who's on my service?

124
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:05,455
What multiverse are we in?

125
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,257
Adams, you're with me.

126
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,591
Oh, he's actually in the pit.

127
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,126
She doesn't care.

128
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,996
Dr. Pierce. I can't
believe you came.

129
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,265
Always.

130
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:18,735
-Dr. Adams, this is Brady--
-Brady Hauser. Forty-two,

131
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,336
had a heart transplant
four years ago.

132
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,804
Readmitted last week
after an MI IVUS

133
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,174
shows chronic cardiac
graft vasculopathy.

134
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,944
He's on IV steroids
and antithymocyte globulin.

135
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,182
Uh, I skimmed his chart
as fast as I could.

136
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:34,951
Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:37,487
Brady was one of my
first patients in Seattle.

138
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,290
And you must be Ian.

139
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,824
I've heard so much about you.
I mean, not so much about you.

140
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,161
I don't know your
Social Security number
or anything like that.

141
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,497
But I know that you're a
history teacher and you guys met

142
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,798
when you accidentally picked up
his matcha latte

143
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,701
at the coffee shop. Yeah.

144
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,038
-Ian. Right? It's Ian?
-Yeah, it's okay.

145
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,040
He knows I'm madly
in love with him.

146
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,108
Better be. We just
moved in together.

147
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:01,810
Yeah. I wanna spend as much time
together as we can

148
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,146
in case, um...

149
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,181
Don't go there.

150
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,285
So it's bad, right?

151
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,088
I mean, you wouldn't come all
the way out here to say hello.

152
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:16,159
Chronic rejection
is causing your heart to fail.

153
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:18,261
We need to put you back on
the transplant list.

154
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:24,467
We should plant
the tulips that you want

155
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,003
and see the Space Needle.
You've never done that.

156
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:28,837
Should we get married?
We should get married, right?

157
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,039
-Brady.
-No. No, you're right.

158
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:32,041
That was a terrible proposal.

159
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,577
I take it back.

160
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,679
How long can I make
it with this heart?

161
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,016
With medications, a few months.

162
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,250
But Ian is right.

163
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,352
Don't go there.

164
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,786
We're gonna talk to UNOS.

165
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:46,923
Don't lose hope.

166
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,664
I can't find my gloves.

167
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,766
-Oh, uh, buddy,
they're in your hands.
-Not these ones.

168
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,368
He wants the ones
with the stripes

169
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,436
'cause Mia said they're cool.

170
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,605
Well, if Mia said they're cool,
go look in your basketball bag.

171
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:04,407
Is this how you hold a 10 blade?

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,510
Keep it at a 45-degree angle.
Yeah. And let it glide.

173
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,579
Hold it strong.
There you go.

174
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,214
So there's this house

175
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,915
that just came in the market
in Chestnut Hill.

176
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,518
It's four bedrooms.
It's got a big yard.

177
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:17,053
I mean, I don't know.
We could get a dog.

178
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,755
-Can we? Please.
-Don't listen to him.

179
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,356
-How-- Did you hear that?
-Dog.

180
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,691
The dog's negotiable.
What do you think?

181
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:22,625
Who is that?

182
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,060
Amelia.

183
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:26,062
Amelia? You didn't tell me
she was coming.

184
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,563
I would have rearranged my day.

185
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,099
You made good time.

186
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,634
How long are you staying?

187
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,936
I brought hard drives,
papers, everything.

188
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,240
I couldn't risk leaving them
there. Catherine's all over us.

189
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,483
Dorian has requested
orange Jell-O.

190
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,086
Turns out he's
a Cleveland fan. Yeah!

191
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,288
Well, he passed
his swallow study,

192
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,756
so we can finally advance him

193
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,993
from full liquids
to a soft food diet.

194
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,128
Look, his white count
is elevated again.

195
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,630
It's barely above
the normal range.

196
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:02,098
He doesn't show any signs
of wound infection

197
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,599
or peritonitis or nothing.

198
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,402
-How are his CRP and PCT?
-Normal.

199
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,171
His progress is remarkable.

200
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:12,108
Yeah, we should still order
additional labs, cultures,

201
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:14,343
and a chest X-ray
just to rule out infection.

202
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,845
I heard about Adams.

203
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,648
Uh-- Let me know
when the labs are back.

204
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,919
I don't know if
Catherine knows about us,

205
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:24,654
or if she is just
sniffing around everyone's labs.

206
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,322
<i>But either way, it is not good.</i>

207
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,157
We need more time.
Can you stall?

208
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,426
<i>Catherine has access</i>
<i>to the hospital finances,</i>

209
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,829
so if she doesn't know by now
it's just a matter of time.

210
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,363
Wait, you didn't cook the books?

211
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,499
I'm funding research,
not a mafia hit.

212
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,434
<i>If Catherine</i>
<i>pulls the plug,</i>

213
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,269
<i>no one will fund us off of</i>
<i>a hunch and some raw data.</i>

214
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,338
We need time to finish
analyzing everything.

215
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:44,440
<i>-All right.</i>
<i>How much time do you need?</i>
-A few weeks.

216
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,509
A few weeks? You've had months.

217
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,377
<i>We're trying to find</i>
<i>a cure for Alzheimer's.</i>

218
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,112
Did you think that was gonna
happen in a couple of months?

219
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:51,614
I mean,
this is a cross-sectional
observational study

220
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,149
with just the two of us.

221
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,851
We don't have analysts,
coordinators,

222
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,118
<i>techs, assistants, nothing.</i>

223
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,553
And this is Catherine Fox.

224
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,355
You better find a way
to speed it up.

225
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:01,190
If we powered through
and didn't take any breaks,

226
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,893
it would still take four days.

227
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,527
Who's on your service today?

228
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,329
Kwan and Millin.

229
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:07,931
Do we trust them?

230
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,035
Oh. Sorry.

231
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,004
I can go somewhere else if
you're trying to get some rest.

232
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:18,007
Brady Hauser's back on
the transplant list.

233
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,442
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,813
I really missed this couch.

235
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:25,314
It's a great couch.

236
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:27,483
Do you still have
that hideous recliner?

237
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,685
Why do you have to be like that?
It's a great chair.

238
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,187
It's definitely a chair.

239
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,490
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

240
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,531
Is there any chance
you could assist on
a heart-lung transplant?

241
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:43,165
Altman was supposed to do it,

242
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,867
but she got pulled into
some chief emergency.

243
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,502
It's an old patient of ours,
Mason Peterson.

244
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,371
Oh, my God.

245
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:50,406
-Mason's getting
a new heart and lungs.
-Yeah.

246
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,909
That's amazing.

247
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,844
I would love to scrub in.
Thank you for asking.

248
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:57,213
All right. Um... Yeah.
I'll put us on the board.

249
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,619
Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry that I
haven't signed the papers yet.

250
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,087
I meant to, but--

251
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,689
No, it's okay. It's no rush.

252
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:09,425
I mean, my lawyers wanted
them, like, a month ago,

253
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,029
but I told them, "You'll
get them when you get them."

254
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,430
-Well, sure you did.
-What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,867
Well, just that, you know,
sometimes you can be a little--

256
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,135
Careful now.

257
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:22,238
Direct. Some might say bossy.

258
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,307
You said you
loved that about me.

259
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,742
Because I didn't wanna have to
sleep on this couch.

260
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,412
I'll see you in the OR.

261
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:34,550
Are we working on
vascular anastomosis today?

262
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,419
I need help with
a very important,

263
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,988
highly confidential project.

264
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,957
Nobody can know
what you're working on.

265
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,024
Can I trust you?

266
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:43,426
-Of course.
-Absolutely.

267
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,394
These are
gut microbiome sequences.

268
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,730
I need you to enter them
into the database.

269
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:51,902
So the very important project
is data entry?

270
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,436
Can you handle this?

271
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,570
-Absolutely.
-Great.

272
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,472
Thank you.

273
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,741
We're just allowed back
in the OR

274
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:01,078
and now we have to code
literal crap?

275
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,645
You wanna fight the chief,
be my guest.

276
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,580
I'm gonna get to work.

277
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,782
Have you guys seen Adams?
He's not answering my texts.

278
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,484
-Haven't seen him.
-Nope.

279
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:09,987
-What are you doing in here?
-Give me your spot on

280
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,520
the heart-lung transplant
and I'll tell you.

281
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:12,555
I don't care that much.

282
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:15,858
What? She said no.

283
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,695
Hey, Link. Link.
Link, do you have a minute?

284
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:23,033
I just got scans back
for one of my OB patients.

285
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,834
She's 17 weeks.

286
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,603
Her prenatal ultrasound showed
a cystic mass behind the uterus,

287
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,505
but I say we just
watch it closely, right?

288
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,775
About ten centimeters.

289
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:34,978
You see that, Yasuda?
A tailgut cyst.

290
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,680
It is benign,
but it carries the risk
of malignant transformation,

291
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,515
so I'd recommend removing it.

292
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,450
That makes sense.

293
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:44,620
But the chances of it becoming
malignant are extremely rare,

294
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,356
and she's asymptomatic,
so I say we just watch and wait.

295
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,358
-That also makes sense.
-Right.

296
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,061
-It's a decent-sized tumor.
-It's an incidental finding.

297
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,462
-You asked my opinion.
-If we operate,

298
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:55,297
one misstep,
she could lose her pregnancy,

299
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,867
she could lose the function
of her leg, her bladder.

300
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,669
And if it becomes malignant,
she could die.

301
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:03,639
But you're right.

302
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,307
Transformation is unlikely,

303
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,243
-so we could watch and wait.
-Right.

304
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,212
But watch it carefully. An MRI
every two months at least.

305
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,415
Great. Thank you
for the consult.

306
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,421
Is everything okay?

307
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,690
Um...

308
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,893
You know how Brady
casually dropped marriage?

309
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,226
Funny story.

310
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,395
I had already
been thinking about that,

311
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,330
and I have my grandpa's ring.

312
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,332
But I didn't know
if it would fit,

313
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:33,335
so I put it on him
when he fell asleep,

314
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,604
which was a really bad idea.

315
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,416
His heart failure
is causing his hands to swell.

316
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,485
Let's see.

317
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:52,822
Let's try this.

318
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,402
Thank you.

319
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,841
When are you gonna propose?

320
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,543
Uh, haven't decided yet.

321
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,378
You probably think I'm crazy.

322
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:19,348
He has congestive heart failure,
and I'm planning a wedding.

323
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:24,520
I think you two
love each other a lot.

324
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,823
What's that? What's happening?

325
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:29,792
-Out of the way.
-Oh, my God, Brady.

326
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,162
<i>Code blue. Fourth floor.</i>
<i>Cardiac arrhythmia.</i>

327
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,729
Oh, please, help.

328
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,297
<i>Code blue. Fourth floor.</i>
<i>Cardiac Care Unit.</i>

329
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:36,365
Page Dr. Pierce!

330
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,304
- Charge to 180. Clear.
- Charged.

331
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,306
Why isn't it working?

332
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,308
Somebody get him out of the ICU.

333
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,044
Two hundred. Clear.

334
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:51,881
Give him one of epi.

335
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,653
-And charge to 250. Clear.
-Charged.

336
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,024
What's happening?

337
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:02,691
We got a rhythm,
but the HemoSphere is showing

338
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,527
his ejection fraction is 15.

339
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,662
All right. We need to get him
on ECMO immediately.

340
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:09,732
Update UNOS.
They need to know that
he is in critical condition.

341
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,970
- This upload
is taking forever.
- Shut up.

342
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,307
Is this a group project where
I do all of the work
and you do none--

343
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,676
This is a group project in which
you will do none of the work

344
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,346
because I have written a code
that will do the work for us.

345
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,682
It'll even send
the file when it's done.

346
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:28,517
-You know how to write code?
-Yeah.

347
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:32,055
-I taught myself in high school.
-And you did this for fun?

348
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:34,057
No, I did it for survival.

349
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,458
I mean, if I needed
a Reiki session,

350
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:39,829
my parents had me covered,
but real-life survival stuff?

351
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,797
I was on my own.
So, I learned how to code

352
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,867
so I could rig
online sweepstakes.

353
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,635
That's diabolical.

354
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,571
I got a Jacuzzi once,
but we had nowhere to put it.

355
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,174
So, now you can enjoy a hot soak
if you're ever near

356
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,474
the spiritual center
of the desert.

357
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:53,910
Unlikely.

358
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,180
Could you optimize
my dating apps?

359
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,714
It's kinda like a contest.

360
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:01,750
I am not writing code
so you can get laid.

361
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:03,719
Too hard? Can't figure it out?

362
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,188
-All right.
-Too hard.

363
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:06,388
Give me your phone.

364
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,727
Hey. I'm on my way
to assist in the OR,

365
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,495
but I wanna know
how your meeting went.

366
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:14,998
Can't talk right now.
Trying to help Dr. Pierce.

367
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,732
Do you wanna come over
to the house after work?

368
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,235
You know what's going on?

369
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,568
They're making me
repeat intern year

370
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,704
because of what happened
with Sam Sutton.

371
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:24,207
I told the lawyers
I wouldn't have operated
if you weren't there.

372
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,909
-This is my fault.
-No, it's not your fault.

373
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,843
It was my decision.
I made the cut.

374
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,778
I will talk to Dr. Fox.
I will request a hearing
with the board.

375
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:32,115
-We were all there.
We can defend you.
-And then what?

376
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,251
Just let it go, Simone.

377
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,254
Could I get
the MRN for Ms. Patel?

378
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,888
No. Why?

379
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,522
Dr. Lincoln asked me
to schedule her procedure,

380
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:42,092
so I need to
order her pre-op labs.

381
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,426
We decided we weren't
doing the surgery.

382
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,728
You were there.

383
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,264
I was, and we did.

384
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,565
But then Lincoln
talked to DeLuca about it,

385
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,902
and now the patient decided
to remove the cyst.

386
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:53,569
Why wasn't I told about this?

387
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,871
All due respect,
that is way above my pay grade.

388
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,307
And yours too, apparently.

389
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,775
So sorry.
My filter's broken today.

390
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,244
I don't believe this.

391
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,479
So the pre-op labs. Could--

392
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:06,983
Tell Dr. Lincoln to take
his pre-op labs and shove it.

393
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:10,186
Yeah,
I'm not doing that.

394
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,289
Where's Pierce?

395
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,957
She had to put
a patient on ECMO.

396
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,892
They're finishing up
the organ procurement.

397
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,894
I know
he needs a new heart

398
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,096
so he can adapt
to the new lungs,

399
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,098
but isn't Mason's heart
technically fine
for somebody else?

400
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,100
Why won't UNOS
accept it as a donor?

401
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:26,903
Well, it's adapted to Mason's
pulmonary hypertension.

402
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:28,405
So to work for someone else,

403
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,106
it would not only
have to be a match

404
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,642
but also have similar
physiological conditioning.

405
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,081
Hey, page Schmitt.
He can cover for you in the OR.

406
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:40,350
-I need you to check
on something for me.
-Okay.

407
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,488
Things seem good here.

408
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:49,292
The kids look happy,
you seem settled.

409
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:50,859
Yes.

410
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,830
-What are you fishing for?
-Nick moved in yet?

411
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:56,099
No.

412
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,034
Hand me that dataset.

413
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,536
Well, whatever we find in
the data, I hope it is strong

414
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,504
so that when we present it
to Catherine,

415
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,473
she can't turn it down.

416
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:06,209
We're not
presenting it to Catherine.

417
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,044
We're sticking to
the original plan.

418
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,046
We're publishing an abstract
based on our findings.

419
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,349
We've already gone behind her
back once. If we do it again--

420
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,384
We can't risk her
pulling the plug on us.

421
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:15,884
We need independent funding.

422
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:19,488
What if I say no?

423
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:24,294
Meredith, you might not care
about your relationship

424
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,794
with the Fox Foundation,
but I do.

425
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:27,464
They are still
funding my other research.

426
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:29,199
They are
the majority stakeholder

427
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,334
at the hospital where I work.

428
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,372
I can't lose my job, Meredith.

429
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,440
No one's talking
about that happening.

430
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,512
We are erasing him.

431
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,548
Derek.

432
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:51,254
And if we are right about this,
it makes his work obsolete.

433
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:52,588
No one is gonna read it.

434
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:54,991
No one is gonna
reference it ever again.

435
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,060
Why are you doing this now?

436
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,230
I thought that I would have
more time to process.

437
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:02,399
And now you're talking about
being days away

438
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,936
from his entire contribution
to this field just disappearing.

439
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,105
And he would understand that
because new discoveries

440
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,673
replace existing theories
every single day.

441
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:13,575
I'm not saying
that it's rational,

442
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,445
but it doesn't change the fact
that when we do this,

443
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:17,880
we are burying my brother
deeper in the ground.

444
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,283
And I would think that
you of all people
would understand that.

445
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,185
I do understand that.

446
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:24,954
I also think I've come too far
to throw the towel in.

447
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,457
And I seriously hope
you feel the same way.

448
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:30,060
Okay.

449
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,874
Being on ECMO is not ideal,
but it buys us some time.

450
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,111
Well, can I go sit with him?

451
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,645
Yeah, of course.

452
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,951
I gotta go check on
some patients in Chicago
and then I'll come back--

453
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:57,653
-We might have a heart
for Brady.
-UNOS called with a match?

454
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:59,422
Dr. Ndugu's preserving
he cardiac graft

455
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,990
from a heart-lung
transplantation.

456
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,126
The heart is salvageable,
and it's a match.

457
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,727
-It was only failing
because of pulmon--
-Pulmonary hypertension.

458
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,565
Okay. I don't wanna get
the boyfriend's hopes up.

459
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:10,133
This is Mason's heart.

460
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,901
What about screening
for infectious diseases?

461
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,336
-All negative.
-Valvular function?

462
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:15,004
Good for transplantation.

463
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,340
You found one?
A heart for Brady?

464
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,309
-I have to get back to surgery.
-Okay.

465
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:22,145
There is another
transplant patient

466
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,812
whose heart might be a match,

467
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:25,515
but we don't wanna
get ahead of ourselves.

468
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,150
This is not
something we do regularly.

469
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,185
A lot of stars have to align
for this to work.

470
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,054
But they-- they could, right?

471
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:37,193
Okay. Let me check with UNOS,
put eyes on the heart,

472
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:39,661
and then we'll go from there.

473
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:41,697
Come on.

474
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,969
-Hey.
-What's going on?

475
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,138
I need to talk to you.
Chief to former chief.

476
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,838
That doesn't not turn me on.

477
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:52,609
Okay. So remember
when I was promoted

478
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:55,178
and I wanted to get those shoes
that said, "I'm in charge"?

479
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,113
Yeah. The ones that
I told you not to buy

480
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:58,982
'cause we had a mountain
of legal debt and you secretly

481
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:01,584
bought them anyway
with our emergency savings.

482
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:03,852
Ahem. How can I help?

483
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:05,687
I used discretionary budget

484
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,656
to fund Meredith's Alzheimer's
research

485
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:10,393
after Catherine shut it down,
and I think she's onto me.

486
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,362
What made you think
that was a good idea?

487
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,663
Because it's a potential cure
for Alzheimer's disease.

488
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,698
And it's not like
I stole something.

489
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,536
And regardless,
Catherine has 30 hospitals.

490
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:23,373
I didn't think that
she would notice
one small line item.

491
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:25,741
Listen...

492
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:30,846
I didn't wanna
keep pestering you

493
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:33,815
about funding my Bleed Program,
so I went to Catherine.

494
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,219
And she said that she'd
look into your budget.

495
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,886
You went behind my back?

496
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,390
Owen, I told you
I was working on it.

497
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,724
You're accusing me,
and you're the one
who's misappropriating funds?

498
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,561
Like you have never
bent the rules around here.

499
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,462
-I'm trying to help you.
-Oh, God.

500
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:49,432
Okay. Okay.

501
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:50,934
Okay, listen.

502
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,403
Go to Catherine.
Tell her the truth.

503
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,271
Better to come clean
than to get caught.

504
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,373
She will respect you
for doing the hard thing,

505
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,142
and then you can
figure it out together.

506
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,544
Okay. I can do that.

507
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:02,844
I can do the hard thing.

508
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:04,314
-Okay. Yeah.
-Thank you.

509
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,954
All right.
Aortic anastomosis is complete.

510
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:14,090
-Let's get this heart beating.
Schmitt?
-Coming off bypass.

511
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:15,791
- Where's the heart?
- Back table.

512
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:17,260
Glove me, please.

513
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:19,429
Have you done a domino
heart transplant before?

514
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,698
-No, never.
-Sounds like we should all
buy lottery tickets today.

515
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,900
If this works, it's huge.
 But it doesn't change the fact

516
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,135
that I've got four patients
on the floor right now

517
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,404
who might not make
it through the week.
So, yeah, miracles are great,

518
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:31,107
but we wouldn't need them if
more people were organ donors.

519
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,409
Come on, Mason.
Come on. Come on.

520
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:35,478
Starting
cardiac massage.

521
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:38,414
Come on.

522
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,284
Come on, Mason.

523
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,820
Come on. Come on.

524
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,559
- All right. Internal paddles.
- Yeah.

525
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:51,160
How's it looking
back there, Pierce?

526
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:52,828
- The heart is healthy, but...
- Clear.

527
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,465
...the SVC-- it's too narrow.

528
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:56,633
Won't fit.

529
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,434
Can we stent it?

530
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:00,236
It's a good thought,
but it won't be enough.

531
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,304
Clear.

532
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:04,641
Come on, Mason.

533
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,213
Again. Clear.

534
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,919
It's incredible.

535
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:18,787
Yeah, never gets old.
You good to close?

536
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,123
-Yeah. Go ahead. We got you.
-All right.

537
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:21,857
How's it looking?

538
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,760
So Brady's SVC
is scarred from prior surgeries.

539
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,129
We need a bigger diameter
to allow for proper blood flow.

540
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:29,265
We can get
a bigger diameter if we
excise the fibrotic area.

541
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:30,933
The scarring's too extensive.

542
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,801
There won't be enough tissue
to make it work.

543
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,304
Okay. Then we reconstruct
the SVC

544
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:36,172
with a bovine pericardial patch.

545
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,977
Come on. We've done difficult
reconstructions before.

546
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,712
We've even done
a partial heart transplant.

547
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,380
We can handle some scar tissue.

548
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,451
All right.
I'm gonna need a pair of loops.

549
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:50,286
What is it that
you're looking for?

550
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,690
Do you want, like, casual dating
or a relationship or sex?

551
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,458
No one uses apps
for relationships.

552
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,460
I met my
ex-girlfriend on an app.

553
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:58,860
Were you looking for
a relationship

554
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,630
or were you looking for sex?

555
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,732
What about her?

556
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,835
She's a financial
security analyst.

557
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,204
I don't know what that means.

558
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:10,206
You are just like
every other guy.

559
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,474
You just want
a dumb trophy wife.

560
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,009
Oh, you're jealous.

561
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:16,079
-You are sorely mistaken.
-Oh, really?

562
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:18,181
Because I'm pretty sure
you told me that you loved me.

563
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:20,849
Okay. That was
a moment of weakness.

564
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:22,652
-That doesn't sound like
a denial.
-Ooh!

565
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:25,755
Fine. I have
a tiny crush on you.

566
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:28,857
But you know what? I'm hot,
I'm single. I'm a damn doctor.

567
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,159
You're--

568
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:31,928
You're like a cold.

569
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:34,030
I have it, I'll get over it

570
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,532
and then it'll be like
it never happened.

571
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,576
Hey, what's up? What's going on?

572
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,678
Catherine may have found out
about everything,

573
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,547
so we just need to move
up the timeline to publish.

574
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:53,716
I thought you said you
and Amelia were careful.

575
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,386
We were very careful,
but Catherine does have
access to Teddy's budget,

576
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,554
so we just need to move
a lot faster.

577
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:01,257
If Catherine knows, that's it.
It's done. You cannot publish.

578
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,293
I can't afford not to. You're
the one who said, "Find a way."

579
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:06,396
-Yeah, and you got caught.
-So what should I do?

580
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:08,264
Just throw everything
I've done away?

581
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:11,768
Okay.

582
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,704
When you get fired from
the Fox Foundation,
what happens then?

583
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:17,940
-I will continue the work
somewhere else.
-You think I'm fine with that?

584
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,376
I mean, you can't expect me
to keep uprooting my life.

585
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,745
I-- I moved to Seattle.
I followed you to Boston.

586
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,247
Now you're back
and forth to Seattle.

587
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,882
I'm living in
a glorified dorm room.

588
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,817
But I said I wanted
to move in with you.

589
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,886
Yeah, months ago. And I don't
pay lip service here, okay?

590
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,721
When I say I wanna move
in with you, I mean it.

591
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:33,456
I want family dinners
every night

592
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,658
and camping trips with the kids.
And I wanna take care of you

593
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:37,560
when you're sick and lift
you up when you're sad.

594
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:40,463
I mean, my God, you don't get
it. I wanna marry you, Meredith.

595
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,599
-You do?
-I do.

596
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,268
And you can't even be bothered
to ask if I'm on board

597
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:46,969
before you burn it
all to the ground.

598
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,193
I thought we were
watching and waiting.

599
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:12,462
I know, but I had reservations.

600
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:14,197
So you went over
my head to my boss?

601
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,865
I was working with
DeLuca on another case.

602
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,633
-I just brought it up.
-Not your place.

603
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,535
I brought you in.
You should have paged me.

604
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:22,004
There wasn't time. DeLuca
got paged to deliver a baby.

605
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,873
-That's convenient.
-It's the truth.

606
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:26,175
Maybe, but clearly he
didn't care what I had to say.

607
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,478
The patient seemed
pretty worried about
the cyst growing bigger.

608
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,046
I should have been consulted.

609
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,115
Jo, I value your opinion,
but you're a resident.

610
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:36,519
It was a rare tumor. I wanted
to talk with somebody who had
more experience. That's it.

611
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,653
Open. Open. Open.

612
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,489
Can we talk about this later?

613
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,157
-I have patients to check on.
-You're an attending.

614
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,525
Just have your resident do it.

615
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:47,196
This tissue
is more dense than I thought.

616
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,465
-Can you help me
clean out these edges?
-I can give you some traction.

617
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,467
If this doesn't work,
what happens to Brady?

618
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:54,003
He stays on ECMO,
and we wait for another donor.

619
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:55,973
- Could take months.
- He's got a lot to live for.

620
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,641
I have to believe
that he will hang on.

621
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:00,710
-How's Mason?
-He's doing great.

622
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,346
Dr. Schmitt did an excellent job
placing the sternal wires.

623
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,015
- Can I get a ray tech?
-  -What sutures are you gonna use

624
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:07,850
to attach the pericardial patch?

625
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,886
-4-0 GORE-TEX?
-Exactly.

626
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,654
Well, unless you're Dr. Pierce.

627
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,689
She uses a 5-0
with the eyelid retractor.

628
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:16,058
-You remember that.
-Oh, I remember.

629
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,662
-We don't.
-Well, I find that I have more
control with a smaller suture,

630
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,497
but it is not the norm.

631
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,266
So I normally don't have
a resident assist me

632
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,935
when I'm placing a patch.

633
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:26,702
I don't wanna teach bad habits.

634
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,237
But sometimes you get
an overachiever

635
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,207
who insists on being
in the OR with you

636
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,775
and learning all your secrets.

637
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,344
All right.
I hit healthy tissue.

638
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:37,413
All right. Dr. Pierce,
what do you think?

639
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:39,448
I think...

640
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,552
...we still got it.

641
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,389
-Brady's getting a new heart.
-All right.

642
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,624
Let's prep the patient
for transplant.

643
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:58,634
I won a trip
to the Bahamas once.

644
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:01,203
Sounds fun.

645
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:04,273
Yeah, it was right after
my mom got cancer.

646
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:09,980
I moved back home, and there was
this townie bar near her place.

647
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:13,616
They had this promotion where
for every drink you bought,

648
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,787
you got an entry to win
a trip for two to the Bahamas.

649
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,923
And I was there more
than I care to admit.

650
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:21,490
Racked up a bunch of entries,

651
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,093
and I won.

652
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:29,465
So, you abandoned your mom
to go on vacation?

653
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,667
The opposite.

654
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,070
I convinced them
to extend the deadline

655
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,437
so I could bring her.

656
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,739
She really wanted to go.

657
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:38,808
I thought we would go
after she got better,

658
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:42,144
but that is obviously
not what happened.

659
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,815
She died,
and I needed an escape.

660
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,451
So my girlfriend
and I went instead.

661
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:52,655
-Well, how was it?
-She got sun poisoning
and I broke my arm.

662
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:54,523
It sounds like you need a redo.

663
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,197
Uh, we should get out of here
before someone tries to come in.

664
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,938
Uh, what I said earlier--

665
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:12,042
- This Isn't-- Like, we aren't--
- Uh, no, I--

666
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:14,477
I just don't think
it's the right time...

667
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,979
-Oh, no.
-...to get in a relation--

668
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:17,813
Stop.

669
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:19,281
I don't want you
to have the satisfaction

670
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,951
of being the one
to cut this off.

671
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,251
So, I'm good.

672
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:24,620
We're-- We're good.

673
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:26,389
Just a cold, right?

674
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:27,690
Yeah.

675
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,092
Yeah, just a cold.

676
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,635
Hey. I'm just
headed to the airport.

677
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:40,971
Had to grab my stuff.

678
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:42,672
Do you have a minute?

679
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:46,009
Millin and Kwan just uploaded
their last dataset.

680
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,050
Wait, does that say--

681
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,717
95% confidence.

682
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:00,222
There is a definite correlation
between gut microbiomes

683
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,757
and Alzheimer's
disease progression.

684
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:04,061
Even before
patients have symptoms.

685
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,029
I mean, this might mean
that people could be diagnosed

686
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:07,663
before they're symptomatic.

687
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,199
And if we could
alter the gut microbiome,

688
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,903
maybe we could prevent
the disease altogether.

689
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:14,971
Oh, my God.

690
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,043
I thought about Derek.

691
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,379
But mostly I've thought
about my mother.

692
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:26,983
This disease robbed her
of her entire identity.

693
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,620
I know how personal
it is for you.

694
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:35,791
I just didn't want
the world to forget him.

695
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:40,130
This is as much your research
as it is mine,

696
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:43,232
so if you don't wanna publish,
we can find another way.

697
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,904
I mean, they would want us to
push through no matter the cost.

698
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:49,940
That is how we honor them.

699
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,809
Well, then I guess
we have an abstract to write.

700
00:30:55,078 --> 00:30:56,113
Oh, my God.

701
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,816
He did great.

702
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,585
-Can we see him?
-He's being transferred

703
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:04,787
to the CCU now,
but once he's settled, you can.

704
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,756
I have to head
back into surgery,
but we'll check in tomorrow,

705
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,557
and we'll talk about
plans for recovery.

706
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,392
What about the person
who got his heart?

707
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:12,229
-Are they okay?
-Unfortunately,

708
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,830
we can't share any information
about the recipient.

709
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:17,234
Um, excuse me?

710
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:21,270
I'm sorry, but did your son
donate a heart today?

711
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,706
Yes, he did.

712
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,444
Thank you.

713
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:32,015
Thank you.

714
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,801
Adams.

715
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:54,037
Impressive work today.

716
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,704
It was a rush.

717
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:58,041
Yeah, we got really lucky.

718
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,044
Yeah.

719
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,212
Do you like it here?

720
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,682
Does anyone like
being an intern?

721
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:09,518
We have a categorical position
at the Heart Center.

722
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,520
You would train
at the University of Chicago

723
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,956
and do your research with us.

724
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:14,523
I think you should consider it.

725
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,592
I think you'd do
really well there.

726
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:22,865
I always thought I'd do neuro.

727
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,533
Why? Because you're a Shepherd?

728
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,870
There are worse things
than being a neurosurgeon,

729
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:30,907
but cardio is pretty great.

730
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,542
Just think about it.

731
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,920
I can't believe you remember me

732
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:45,354
teaching you
pericardial patches.

733
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:47,023
That was, like,
a million years ago.

734
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:48,724
Yeah. Donna Barton.

735
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:51,560
We did her transplant
my second year of residency.

736
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,898
Same complications, same fix,

737
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,033
but not exactly
outside her body.

738
00:32:57,067 --> 00:33:00,203
-No.
-I remember everything
that you taught me.

739
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,217
Oh, my God. Um--

740
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:15,285
I'm--

741
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:17,053
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

742
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,422
Yeah, no. It's okay. Um--

743
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:24,961
You make an amazing save
in the OR,
and then celebrating after.

744
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:26,963
It's what we do.

745
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,799
What we did.

746
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,969
Right.

747
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,170
Yeah.

748
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,342
I think it's time

749
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,913
for us to let go.

750
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:48,817
I signed 'em.

751
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,957
Yeah.

752
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:01,630
Until the next
miraculous surgery.

753
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,068
Goodbye, Maggie Pierce.

754
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:36,699
Pierce offered me a position
at her hospital.

755
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:40,869
In Chicago?

756
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,843
Yeah. I'd be a designated
cardiothoracic resident.

757
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:51,214
Working on groundbreaking
surgeries like we did today.

758
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:53,482
Every day.

759
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:56,052
Sounds like a great opportunity.

760
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:57,553
Yeah.

761
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:59,389
And I'm considering it.

762
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:08,497
Dorian's repeat labs
and scans are all normal. Hmm.

763
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,002
He's been through it more
so than most, but he's okay.

764
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,037
He made it.

765
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,538
Okay. Thank you
for double-checking.

766
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,477
The ABSITE results come
in tomorrow, don't they?

767
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:24,580
I asked Millin how it went,
and her answer was,
"I think I finished."

768
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:27,683
- What-- I mean,
Yasuda said it was easy.

769
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:30,987
Kwan gave a half groan,
half laugh.

770
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:32,888
I learned not to ask.

771
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,758
I mean, they've come really far
in the last few months.

772
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,395
They're finally
where I need them to be.

773
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,930
And if any of the rest of them
have to start over--

774
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,865
You've come to care for them.

775
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,167
They're interns.

776
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,935
They're your interns.

777
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:49,139
There will come a moment
when their pain is your pain.

778
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,409
Their success is your success.

779
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,912
Trust me. I get it.

780
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,920
Hey.

781
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,587
Did you finish
Lincoln's post-op orders?

782
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,923
I can't do this anymore.

783
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,590
What?

784
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:12,462
You're breaking up with me?

785
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,596
Here?

786
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,698
You know, you are one of
the most incredible people

787
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:18,401
I've ever known.

788
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,402
-Don't patronize me.
-I'm-- I'm not.

789
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:21,804
When I-- I first met you,

790
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:24,606
I was so stressed
because I had no money.

791
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,608
I mean, I was
working all the time.

792
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,811
I didn't even sleep.
I barely ate.

793
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:33,283
And then one day,
I walked into a bar,

794
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,952
and you smiled at me.

795
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,655
And for a moment,
everything was okay.

796
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:42,825
But now you are my boss.

797
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:45,661
You literally get paid
to tell me what to do.

798
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:48,498
And as much as I wish that
I could just put that aside,

799
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,102
I-- I don't think
that either of us

800
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,137
have strong enough feelings
to prioritize

801
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,772
this relationship
over everything else.

802
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,777
So you're choosing work.

803
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:04,347
Wouldn't you?

804
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,994
I used
my discretionary budget

805
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,431
for Meredith Grey's
Alzheimer's research project.

806
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:24,167
There is no excuse
for going behind your back.

807
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,269
It was disrespectful,
and I am sorry.

808
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:29,805
Dr. Altman, we all make
mistakes at every level,

809
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,442
but not everyone
is honest about it.

810
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:34,110
That takes courage.

811
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:37,380
Tells me you're a woman
of great principle.

812
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:38,915
Thank you.

813
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:41,518
I knew that you
would understand.

814
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:45,054
I didn't say I understand.

815
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:59,502
Hey, can I get a beer, please?
One for him too.

816
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:00,869
We're celebrating.

817
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,704
We saved two lives today.

818
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,673
Ah. Yeah, right.

819
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,409
You say that like
it happens all the time.

820
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:08,178
Well, technically,
it is our job.

821
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,146
Technically, things don't always
go our way.

822
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,648
Unless they do for you.
In which case,

823
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,082
this beer is also mine.

824
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,086
Cheers.

825
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:36,339
I'm sorry.

826
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:38,707
I could have handled
everything better today.

827
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,778
I'm sorry too.

828
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:44,514
Going back to being a resident

829
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:47,383
is harder than I thought
it would be,

830
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,718
and I took it out on you.

831
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,689
<i>The principle</i>
<i>of the domino effect</i>

832
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,524
<i>is a double-edge sword...</i>

833
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:56,459
Then tell me
what I can do.

834
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,663
I think that we should keep work
and home separate,

835
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:04,467
and only work together
when absolutely necessary.

836
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,768
And just keep it professional.

837
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,571
-Okay.
-Okay.

838
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:12,909
And under this new arrangement,
can I do this at work?

839
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:16,012
That would be
highly inappropriate.

840
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:18,448
- Mm-hmm.
- What about this?

841
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:22,252
<i>...it can help us</i>
<i>build healthy habits,</i>

842
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:26,155
<i>but it can lead to</i>
<i>destructive tendencies as well.</i>

843
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,925
Wait, you--
you got on the gurney with him?

844
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:31,394
-I didn't know what else to do.
-Oh, my gosh.

845
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:33,663
Yeah.

846
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:35,764
I'm sorry.
Maybe it's not that funny.

847
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,268
No, sorry. I, um...

848
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,671
I signed divorce papers today.

849
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:48,344
Oh, God.

850
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:49,979
I'm not-- I'm--

851
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,514
I'm laughing with you.
I'm not laughing at you.

852
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:53,182
-I'm not laughing.
-No, no.

853
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:55,285
It's just-- I just
got divorced too.

854
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,320
And we rented doves.

855
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,022
-When you got divorced?
-No, no, no, no.

856
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,124
When we got married.

857
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:03,593
We should have rented 'em
for the divorce.
That would have been fun.

858
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:05,928
I even built a tent, though,
on the be-- on the beach.

859
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:07,964
Oh, really? We had a live band.

860
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:09,966
We had custom sand sculptures.

861
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,201
Ew. Why?

862
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,105
Oh, no.

863
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:18,141
This is gonna suck
for a while, isn't it?

864
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:20,476
Yeah.

865
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,082
<i>One small misstep</i>
<i>becomes one bad habit.</i>

866
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,522
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>none of us is perfect.</i>

867
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:36,326
<i>And so much</i>
<i>is out of our control.</i>

868
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:43,166
-Hey. The kids asleep?
-Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,233
They were exhausted.

870
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,502
I got your favorite.

871
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,140
Where are you going?

872
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:53,042
I'm gonna go
sleep in my own bed.

873
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,179
You're right. I'm terrible
at being in relationships.

874
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:57,547
And if it makes you
feel any better,

875
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,549
I've always been this way.

876
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,851
You know, it really--
it really, really doesn't.

877
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:04,853
You know you're the most
important person in my life

878
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:06,489
besides my children.

879
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:08,524
I don't know that
I can marry you.

880
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:11,327
I did that once before. I don't
know that I can do that again.

881
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:13,763
But I know I love you so much.

882
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:15,864
And I love
going to sleep with you,

883
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:18,234
and waking up
and seeing your face.

884
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,637
I can promise
to love you forever.

885
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:25,675
Or as long as
I can remember you.

886
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,745
Mer, I love you too. That's
not the issue. You know that.

887
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,855
The issue is that I put
work before you,
and you're right, I do.

888
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,423
But just right now.

889
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,258
That's not forever.

890
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:46,729
And if you love me,
then you'll support me.

891
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:49,332
And if you support me,
then I can do this.

892
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:53,903
Are you in?

893
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,477
You should take that.

894
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,282
<i>All you can do</i>
<i>is make the best choices</i>
<i>available to you...</i>

895
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,989
Teddy. Is everything okay?

896
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,325
Catherine just fired me.

897
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,594
<i>...and hope they don't</i>
<i>come back to bite you.</i>
