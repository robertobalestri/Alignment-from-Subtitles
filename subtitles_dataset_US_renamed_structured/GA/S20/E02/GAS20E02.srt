Luna's waking up so
early these days,

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,616
we should get some sleep.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,920
Yeah, we should.

7
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:17,498
<i>They looked at participants'

00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,004

Atheromatosis.

Uh, you... No, you go.

30
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,340
Right.

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,306
Thanks.

32
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,847
You didn't get
any sleep, either?

33
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:29,718
Mnh. Nope. Should
we change the locks?

34
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:31,196
You want to lock out one
of the chief residents?

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,464
Yasuda has the van.

36
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:33,617
We're already not
allowed in the OR.

37
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,770
What's Helm gonna do?

38
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,271
Hey, are we good?

39
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,562
You said you needed a minute.

40
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:39,863
It's been a week.

41
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:42,034
Yeah. Just working
some things out.

42
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,136
I can't really put
a timeline on it.

43
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,457
Okay, but if you
want to talk...

44
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,753
Oh, finally.

45
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,660
Someone had fun last night.

46
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:50,296
Hey, what happened
to your ground rules

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,006
and needing three
full REM cycles?

48
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,644
Karma sucks, doesn't it?

49
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:55,417
Let's go. I can't be late.
I've got a liver biopsy.

50
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:56,950
Say it louder.

51
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,220
I didn't mean that. I... Okay.

52
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:04,665
Hey, uh, please don't
put me on rectals.

53
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,377
Ben: You getting nervous? Huh?

54
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:10,136
The interns should be nervous.

55
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,097
I know this job.
I <i>made</i> this job.

56
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,518
Yeah, but times have changed.

57
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:16,479
This generation, they
ain't afraid to push back.

58
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,589
I'd like to see
them try with me.

59
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:20,207
I'm just saying that
you should be prepared

60
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:21,488
for this class to be different.

61
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:24,140
They're baby surgeons.
Baby surgeons don't change.

62
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:26,971
They need structure,
limitations, and tough love.

63
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,482
Right, Pru? Who's the boss?

64
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,456
You're the boss! See? She knows.

65
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,774
Why you make that
girl do that?

66
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,679
Here you go. Thanks.

67
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,466
Did that guy just wink at you?

68
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,040
Um, probably.

69
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,882
20 years later, it never ends.

70
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,423
What do you mean?

71
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:44,397
What do you mean,
"What do I mean?"

72
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:45,976
That's how we met.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,222
Your first shift at Jimmy's.

74
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,763
The guy who looked
like Father Time.

75
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,511
He was hitting on
you. I bailed you out.

76
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,222
Sorry I don't have an
encyclopedic memory

77
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,853
of every guy who hits on me.

78
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:55,675
Well, how about an
encyclopedic memory

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,333
of meeting the man you love?

80
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:58,433
Who?

81
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:00,808
I'm kidding.

82
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,086
Now that I know that

83
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,376
you're not into the
whole monogamy thing...

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,496
Don't finish that sentence.

85
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,166
Have you ever been
in a throuple?

86
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,466
Do you remember when
we were just colleagues

87
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,676
and didn't know anything
about each other?

88
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,426
Can we <i>please</i> go back to that?

89
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,096
Mm. Millin was in a
throuple. I didn't say that.

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,097
Hey, love who you want to love.

91
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,256
20 bucks says that you're loving

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,016
a new job before the year's up.

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,386
50 says it's
Griffith. What? Why?

94
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,846
High risk, high reward.

95
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,396
I need gas money.
Millin, you in?

96
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,016
Can we all just shut up and
focus on our jobs, please?

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,266
Yeah.

98
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,276
Bailey: You're late.

99
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,906
I stopped to get
you the Mean Green.

100
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,366
Suck up. Number I rule <i>broken.</i>

101
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,826
Get out of my space.

102
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,486
I don't know what their deal is.

103
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,656
Your days as surgical
cowboys are over.

104
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,576
Our patients deserve
well-trained surgeons,

105
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,496
which you decidedly are not.

106
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,376
You're going back to basics.

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,086
No more dodging protocols,
no cutting corners.

108
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,296
If you want to operate
again, you will earn it.

109
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,046
Procedure logs.

110
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,596
You will complete every
procedure to perfection

111
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,766
and get an attending
to sign off.

112
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,726
Until those cards are complete,

113
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,896
you will not so much
as <i>look</i> at an OR.

114
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,856
10 IVs, 15 chest tubes?
10 central lines?

115
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,476
Dr. Bailey,

116
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,276
we appreciate what
you're doing. Suck up.

117
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,656
But we're already cramming
for the ABSITE exam.

118
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,196
Oh. Well, if it's
too much for you,

119
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,156
feel free to choose
another career.

120
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,366
I hear that dermatology is nice.

121
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,696
Want to be a
dermatologist, Dr. Kwan?

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,536
Didn't think so.

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,166
Schmitt and Helm have
your assignments.

124
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,706
Okay. Kwan, Adams,
Millin, take the pit.

125
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,876
Yasuda, you're with Ndugu.

126
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,796
Griffith, you're with Schmitt.

127
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,876
Any chance we're going somewhere

128
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,176
with a lot of procedures?

129
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,136
We get what we get and
we don't get upset.

130
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,136
Did your class ever have
to do surgical bingo?

131
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,950
My class didn't screw
up like your class.

132
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,686
Alright, I put an order in
for a repeat chest X-ray.

133
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,976
How are you feeling?

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,266
Great.

135
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,686
Honestly, I am more concerned

136
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,686
about Ms. Acharya
and Mr. Jenkins.

137
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,896
Well, her biopsy was benign,

138
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,486
and his ECHO got pushed to noon.

139
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,487
So your patients are covered.

140
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,156
Just focus on recovery.

141
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,066
Yeah. Doctor's orders. Okay?

142
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,866
Oh, it's...

143
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,036
Oh, it's the ER. I'll,
uh, check in later, okay?

144
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,326
Okay. Yeah. I just... Can I...

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,956
I'm here and ready to help.

146
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,626
I can remove chest tubes or...

147
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,166
Never mind.

148
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,456
Let me guess.
Dr. Bailey's new program?

149
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,966
Well...

150
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,176
Listen.

151
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,386
No procedures on the chief.

152
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,056
And no trolling for
them on my service.

153
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,057
So finish rounding,
then come find me.

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,396
Yasuda. I could use your help.

155
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,726
Yeah. Of course.

156
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,606
Tuggle, Futrell...

157
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,736
Are they specific
techniques? They're patients.

158
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,446
I want you to check on
them and report back.

159
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,446
Are you sure you
should be working?

160
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,366
It's only been a
week, and I've got...

161
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,786
A procedure log. I know.

162
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,416
Okay, Mr. Tuggle is going to
need his pacing wires removed.

163
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,546
And Mr. Futrell, he's always
pulling out his A-line, so...

164
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,296
Oh, procedures. Okay. Mm.

165
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,836
And when you're done with
those, I have others.

166
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,966
Just use discretion.

167
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,636
Discretion is my middle name.

168
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,806
Actually, it's Elaine.

169
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,200
I-I'm on it.

170
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,346
All my life... All my life,
I've wanted to be a champion.

171
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,856
And what happens? I get...

172
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,226
Millin: If we could all
just talk one at a time.

173
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,476
Please.

174
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,026
Okay, this sounds
counter intuitive.

175
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,026
But this is going
to go a lot faster

176
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,606
if one person speaks at a time.

177
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,406
Our family softball game

178
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,736
turned into a bit
of a bloodbath.

179
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,866
I cut my leg, and Allie
and Billy need some help.

180
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,916
Yeah, I... I can't
straighten my arm.

181
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,996
That's not normal, right?

182
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,326
No. Not really. What about you?

183
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,496
I don't know.

184
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,586
It feels like I broke my back.

185
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,916
Make her the priority.

186
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,586
She's carrying my grandbaby.

187
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,916
How about my broken nose?

188
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,126
Charlotte fouled a
ball into my face.

189
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,136
Who is Charlotte? Me!

190
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,426
She's my other son's daughter.

191
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,466
She's going to be
this year's MVP.

192
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,346
Oh, when pigs fly.

193
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,846
Okay, Millin, let's get
the Best family settled

194
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,266
while I do their intake, okay?

195
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,976
Alright, let's go.

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,396
Alright, who actually
needs medical attention?

197
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,146
Come with me.

198
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,106
The rest of you can wait
in the waiting room.

199
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,937
Paramedic: Coming through.

200
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,396
Oh, oh, wait.

201
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,816
Everybody move back.
Move back, please.

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,156
Right, let's get
him to trauma three.

203
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,816
John Doe, looks
to be in his 20s,

204
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,986
found unconscious by
Fisherman's Terminal.

205
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,786
No witnesses, multiple
gunshot wounds

206
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,036
to his chest and abdomen.

207
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,956
Systolic has been
stable in the low 100s.

208
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,626
Received 2 liters of fluid

209
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,706
and 200 mics of fentanyl
on the way here.

210
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,836
Alrighty. On my
count, everybody.

211
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,440
Ready? One, two, and three.

212
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,636
Whoa. Smells like
Pike Place Market.

213
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,006
Order a type and screen.

214
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,370
I can't get through.

215
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,356
Whoo! That's a whole
lot of Benjamins.

216
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,576
Richard: Dr. Griffith,
will you please present?

217
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,126
Dante Collier, 33.

218
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,957
He's had right
upper quadrant pain

219
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,416
on and off for two weeks.

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,296
Presented to the
ER this morning.

221
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,876
His lab showed
elevated transaminases

222
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,966
with normal alc, phos, and bili.

223
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,176
Ultrasound confirmed
cholecystitis.

224
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,306
He is scheduled
for surgery today.

225
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,136
Soup to nuts, how long
is this gonna take?

226
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,976
I need to feed my
pumpernickel starter.

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,790
What's a pumpernickel
starter eat?

228
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,896
Sorry. I am a surgical resident.

229
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,226
I keep textbooks in my oven.

230
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,566
Richard: I'm afraid we're
going to have to keep you here.

231
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,856
Dante is a baker.

232
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,656
He owns Bread for
This, the bakery.

233
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,946
Oh, their cinnamon
rolls changed my life.

234
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,656
That's my baby.

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,076
You should come by
sometime, on the house.

236
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,706
I'll tell the staff to look
out for the handsome surgeon

237
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,286
who keeps textbooks
in his oven.

238
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,166
You know, my wife
makes a mean cornbread.

239
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,416
Sweet or savory?

240
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,626
Oh. You kidding? Sweet.

241
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,877
We'll try and get
you back to work

242
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,426
as soon as we can.

243
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,636
Dr. Schmitt will be
your lead surgeon.

244
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,006
I'll be assisting.

245
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,370
You will?

246
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,306
Uh, he will. Because I
am your lead surgeon.

247
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,056
Griffith, go check
on his labs, please.

248
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,686
Do you want me to stop
and see if Mrs. Fairey

249
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,226
needs her wound vac changed?

250
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,726
Just the labs.

251
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,260
Uh, okay. Get some rest.
We'll be back soon.

252
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,090
Looking forward to it.

253
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,276
How far along are you?

254
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,156
29 weeks.

255
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,956
And, yes, I know I had no
business playing softball.

256
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,416
Not the way your family plays.

257
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,166
They're my in-laws.

258
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,956
This is what happens
when you take a bunch

259
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,086
of highly competitive,

260
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,466
wildly unathletic people
and give them bats.

261
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,136
I've suggested Wiffle
ball or badminton,

262
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,886
literally, anything else, but...

263
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,556
Babe, those aren't real games.

264
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,176
Well, I paged OB.

265
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,266
But I'm also going
to get you an ortho

266
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,936
and a neuro consult.

267
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,106
That doesn't sound too good.

268
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,266
Well, I just want
them to check you out.

269
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,976
So you just stay right here

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,736
and don't go chasing
after any fly balls.

271
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,526
Couldn't if I tried.

272
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,566
D-Did he rob a bank?

273
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,326
This must be
thousands of dollars.

274
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,286
Or maybe he was trying
<i>not</i> to get robbed.

275
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,786
Winston: He has three wounds
in the front, two in back.

276
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,826
One bullet must be inside still.

277
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,956
We're ready for films.

278
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,126
I could buy six vans with that.

279
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,456
Yasuda, what do you need?

280
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,916
Mr. Tuggle's post-op, day two.

281
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,917
Should I remove
his pacing wires?

282
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,666
No. And it's not
the time to ask.

283
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,176
Let's hang another unit.

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
X-rays up. Kwan?

285
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,886
Bilateral hemopneumothoraces.

286
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,847
He needs a chest tube.

287
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:15,886
Mm-hmm.

288
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,386
Both: I could do it.

289
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,136
Adams, take that
money down to security

290
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,476
and have them lock it up
until the police arrive.

291
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,130
Here, Kwan.

292
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,066
Oh. Pressure's tanking.

293
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,316
He's coding. Let's
prep for a thoracotomy.

294
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,656
Scalpel.

295
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,126
Have you seen the pie episode
of the "Great Bakeoff"?

296
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,956
It's dope.

297
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,586
I don't have a lot
of time for TV.

298
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,166
Before surgery, we
need to make sure

299
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,006
we have all your
medications noted.

300
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,086
I already told the ER doctor.

301
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,950
Are you taking any
medication for HIV?

302
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,556
Excuse me?

303
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,636
I didn't see any
meds listed for HIV.

304
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,716
I figured it was a mistake.

305
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,176
Just wanted to make sure.

306
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,500
I don't have HIV.

307
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,726
I'm so sorry.

308
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,380
Hold on.

309
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,816
Our labs indicate a
positive HIV result.

310
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,777
It's right here.
Well, it's wrong.

311
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,566
I mean, when was I tested?

312
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,220
Standard screening for our ER.

313
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,036
I want one of the other doctors.

314
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,246
Oh, Dante, I would never...
No, you've made a mistake,

315
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,030
and clearly you don't
know what you're doing.

316
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,586
So...

317
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,916
Get me another doctor.

318
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,790
Okay.

319
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,976
Hello, Allie.

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,436
I'm Dr. Lincoln.
This is Dr. Shepherd.

321
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,226
Hey, Allie. Tell me,

322
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,396
have you experienced
any back pain

323
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,896
during your pregnancy?

324
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,236
Maybe a little. Mm-hmm.

325
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,236
This is sharper. Stabbier.

326
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,616
And my groin area
is a little numb.

327
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,326
Herb should be MVP. He's 81.

328
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,866
He's still pitching strikeouts.

329
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,616
Everyone gets unlimited pitches.

330
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,996
You're really going to
deprive a dying man?

331
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,997
Who says he's dying?

332
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,360
Look at him!

333
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,716
If anyone deserves
MVP, it's Allie.

334
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,376
I don't want MVP...

335
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,926
Gah! Ah! Ah. Ah.

336
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,136
Okay. Hang on. Ooh, ah, ah.

337
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,716
Wait. I think my water broke.

338
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,676
What's happening? Is she okay?

339
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,516
Uh, Allie, I-I don't
think it's amniotic fluid.

340
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,646
It's urine.

341
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,266
I peed myself in
front of my in-laws?

342
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,606
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We're family.

343
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,066
She needs an MRI. This
could be a spinal injury.

344
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,406
And if we don't move now,
she could end up paralyzed.

345
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,966
Trash duty suits you.

346
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,756
Security's busy on
the psych floor.

347
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,056
I'm stuck with this guy's money

348
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,806
until they get back.

349
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,726
It's been 20 minutes.
No cardiac response.

350
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,096
Okay. Injecting another epi.

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,636
Hang more blood.

352
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,516
Heart's not starting.
Resuming cardiac massage.

353
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,936
Come on, man, come on.

354
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,316
Is there any ID on
this kid, Adams?

355
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,486
Uh, no, nothing.

356
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,946
Still nothing. Damn it!

357
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,696
Time of death...

358
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,946
Before you declare him,

359
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,850
can I take over cardiac massage?

360
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,206
He's dead.

361
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,786
Exactly. Good practice.

362
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,496
Yeah, fine, Kwan. Step in.

363
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,256
Careful, now. One hand on top,

364
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,046
one hand underneath,

365
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,360
and squeeze up from the apex.

366
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,306
Yeah.

367
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,516
It's beating. It...

368
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,976
Is it beating?

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,856
What?

370
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,896
Oh, congratulations. Now move.

371
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,986
Let's get him up to the OR ASAP.

372
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,276
Can I scrub in?

373
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,406
It's not up to me.

374
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,026
Ask your residency director.

375
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,866
Is your procedure log completed?

376
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,577
We just got it this morning.

377
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,496
Then, no. Let's go.

378
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,996
You just happened to
get your hand in there

379
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,456
at the right time.

380
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,586
You're walking
around with $40,000

381
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,086
in a trash bag.

382
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,846
Dante, we repeated
your lab test twice,

383
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,266
and they both came
back positive for HIV.

384
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,016
Now, I know this is
a lot to take in,

385
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,476
so we'll give you some time.

386
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,646
We can postpone your surgery

387
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,056
for a couple of hours

388
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,606
and provide you
with some counseling

389
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,146
and a referral to a specialist.

390
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,066
Schmitt? I'll put
in the consult now.

391
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,986
Hey, careful. You'll
pull out your IV.

392
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,566
I need to get out of here.

393
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,026
You can get some air,
but we need to keep

394
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,616
the IV antibiotics
going until surgery.

395
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,946
Surgery is the last thing
on my mind right now.

396
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,956
I need to go.

397
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,616
HIV can be treated

398
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,456
with minimal changes
to your life.

399
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,286
But if we don't treat your
gallbladder infection,

400
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,666
your health will
drastically decline.

401
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,876
Where are my clothes?

402
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,086
Dante, please let us help you.

403
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,376
I'll sign whatever
you need me to sign,

404
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,086
but <i>please</i> let me go!

405
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,676
Uncle Bo: Herb's been
playing for 60 years.

406
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,176
Just because she's 5

407
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,396
doesn't mean she
can't add value.

408
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,606
How's a busted nose added value?

409
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,816
Ohh. What do you
think, Dr. Millin?

410
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,436
I think that I am
done with your leg.

411
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,276
Give me a sec. Okay?

412
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,236
You're a sore loser.
Because you cheat.

413
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,486
Oh.

414
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,656
Dr. Hunt,

415
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,196
I finished the, uh, leg lac.

416
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
Could you please sign
my procedure log?

417
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,076
Uh, could you please put
me on a different patient?

418
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,036
This family is... a lot.

419
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,876
Dislocated finger in
bed seven, Millin.

420
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,610
Okay? Yes.

421
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,916
Allie: Is it almost over?

422
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,126
First time all day I
can hear myself think,

423
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,136
and now all my thoughts
are terrifying.

424
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,596
<i>Should just be a
few more minutes.</i>

425
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,886
I grew up an only
child, and I hated it.

426
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,806
I wanted noise and
sibling rivalry

427
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,186
and someone who also
despised my mom.

428
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,010
<i>Then I married Billy
and his giant family.</i>

429
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,326
But if anything were to happen

430
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,616
to my baby because of
this <i>stupid</i> game...

431
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,906
Try to take a few deep breaths.

432
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,166
Hey, uh, no more cake.

433
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,900
So your options are
chocolate, sugar, and glazed.

434
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,007
Second breakfast?

435
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,126
First. First.

436
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,006
Scans are up.

437
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,056
There, severe disc herniation
at L5 and S1 levels.

438
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,476
The disc is protruding

439
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,806
and pressing into
the nerve root.

440
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,476
This is cauda equina syndrome.

441
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,476
I'll book her an OR for
emergent decompression.

442
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,936
Mm-hmm. You can't
go in posteriorly.

443
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,566
If we go in anteriorly,

444
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,936
we'll have to deliver the baby.

445
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,396
She's only 29 weeks.

446
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,946
We can't position her laterally.

447
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,816
It increases her
chance of bleeding.

448
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,180
You're not leaving
us many options.

449
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,850
I think I have one.

450
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,956
Teddy: What's happening?

451
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,786
Mr. Jenkins is
prepped for his CABG.

452
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,456
No change on Mr. Futrell,

453
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,876
but I think he has a
crush on Dr. Beckman.

454
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,466
Which is relevant because...?

455
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,966
When he pulls out his A-line,

456
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,046
he only wants Dr. Beckman
to put it back in.

457
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,056
Here, answers to
your other questions.

458
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,660
Good.

459
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,886
Actually, I need
to finish rounding

460
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,436
on Ndugu's patients.

461
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,750
That's got a possible
central line.

462
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,526
Are you sure you
don't need help?

463
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,920
Yes, with my patients. Go.

464
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh.

465
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,376
Those are the AMA forms to sign.

466
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,086
I arranged an appointment
with our clinic

467
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,296
so you can talk to them
about your treatment options.

468
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,136
I already know the spiel

469
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,256
a pill a day

470
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,716
and then passing on the virus

471
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,976
is basically a non-issue.

472
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,016
There's also an
inject able option

473
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,186
if you're not into pills.

474
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,476
When I saw you walk into
the room this morning,

475
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,316
my first thought was,

476
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,920
how was I going to ask the
hot surgeon out on a date?

477
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,276
Now I'll always remember
your face as one of the ones

478
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,656
who told me my dating
life had changed forever.

479
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,326
Hey, y-you will still date.

480
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,706
When and how you disclose
your status is up to you.

481
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,166
And then they'll run.

482
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,110
Or they'll be like me and
they'll already be on PrEP.

483
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,336
So they'll have the freedom
to date whoever they're into.

484
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,176
Even guys who

485
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,506
feed their pumpernickel.

486
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,766
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

487
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,976
I think it's getting worse.

488
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,016
You're getting clammy, too.

489
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,806
Dante, you need this surgery.

490
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,396
Hey, if you walk out of here,

491
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,566
you could become septic and die.

492
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,646
Okay. Okay.

493
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,816
Okay? Yeah.

494
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,106
That... That's it? Yeah.

495
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,566
Because I don't
think I can walk.

496
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,030
Can I get a hand in here?

497
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,706
We still don't know
who this kid is.

498
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,270
As a parent, I... I
just can't imagine.

499
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,966
Um, if you have something
to say to me, go ahead.

500
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,030
Lap pad.

501
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,506
You learn how to be a surgeon
in the operating room.

502
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,556
Full stop.

503
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,846
Suspending the interns

504
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,596
is stunting their education.

505
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,096
And what's worse,
it's impeding my work.

506
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,016
They should be in the OR,

507
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,106
pushing past their mistakes
and learning from them.

508
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,226
Growing, Bailey. Suction.

509
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,186
I won a Catherine
Fox award. I'm aware.

510
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,276
Most people think it
is because of my work

511
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,236
in reproductive care,

512
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,986
but really, it's for
<i>teaching</i> reproductive care.

513
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,286
Okay, this bullet
shattered the spleen

514
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,866
and hit the small
and large bowels.

515
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,996
I'm afraid the SMA is involved.

516
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,876
He might never eat
normally again.

517
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,206
If he lives.

518
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,047
Looks like the bullet injured

519
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:49,706
the hilum of his lung.

520
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,876
Think I can feel it. Oh, yeah.

521
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,836
There it is. Gotcha.

522
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,846
Whoa!

523
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,006
Adams.

524
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,556
Take the bullet to pathology.

525
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,090
As in now.

526
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,526
His pressure's tanking.

527
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,446
Whoever you are

528
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,327
stay with us.

529
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,416
The table is shaped
like a donut?

530
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,046
No. We add supports
to the iliac crest

531
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,586
to create a hole in the
center like a donut.

532
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,966
That way, you can lie face down

533
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,086
without putting
pressure on your belly.

534
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,506
And we go in and
remove the discs

535
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,796
pressing on your nerves.

536
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,096
And you've done this before.

537
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,636
Well, it's an unusual situation.

538
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,846
That sounds like no.

539
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,056
Is this safe for the baby?

540
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,146
I think it's the best choice.

541
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,476
And I will be in there
to monitor both of you.

542
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,476
I should have
let that ball go.

543
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,236
I didn't want to
disappoint anyone,

544
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,146
but now the baby...
I-I-I should have...

545
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,736
Hey, hey. Hey, it'll be okay.

546
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,776
No matter what happens,

547
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,536
we will all be there for
you when you wake up.

548
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,076
Everyone?

549
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,980
I will tell whoever
you want to leave.

550
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,666
I love you.

551
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,577
As soon as we have an update,

552
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,770
we'll let you know.

553
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,756
You're here.

554
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,846
That must mean Mr. Wallace

555
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,386
is out of surgery.

556
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,926
I passed that case to Dr. Boyle

557
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,686
because I have a lap chole.

558
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,306
Why? Is someone asking?

559
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,556
I plead the Fifth.

560
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,726
Yasuda, you want to tell me

561
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,146
what's really going on here?

562
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,776
I plead the Fifth again.

563
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,510
This doesn't concern
me, so I'm gonna...

564
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,026
Chief Altman said

565
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,446
I might get some
procedures for my log

566
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,366
if I checked on
her patients. Mm.

567
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,536
Don't worry. Joke's on me.

568
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,286
I haven't done a
single procedure,

569
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,746
and I'm behind on
Ndugu's patients, so...

570
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,286
Also, I know it's not my place,

571
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,310
but maybe she's pushing it
just a little bit too...

572
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,296
What are you doing?

573
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,916
Well...

574
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,990
Yeah. You did these.

575
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,346
On my wife.

576
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,926
You helped save
her life, Yasuda.

577
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,556
I won't forget that. Okay?

578
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,556
Now, I need your help
getting her to rest.

579
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,266
Save her from herself.

580
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,266
And don't tell her it's
coming from me, okay?

581
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,396
Use discretion.

582
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll see what I can
do. Owen: Thank you.

583
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,816
Amelia: Finished
the decompression.

584
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Screwdriver.

585
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,076
Art. Father Time's name was Art.

586
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,616
Are we still talking about this?

587
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,996
It's important.

588
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,616
Well, maybe you
should have warned me.

589
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,537
There'd be a quiz
about the day we met

590
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,390
20 years later.

591
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,126
Almost done
stabilizing the spine.

592
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,376
No, no, no, no, no.

593
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,256
I'm seeing deep decels.

594
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,256
The baby's heart rate is
dropping into the 60s.

595
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,716
Okay, we need five minutes.
We might not have that.

596
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,176
Her spine is not stable.

597
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,006
If we move her, we
could paralyze her.

598
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,966
Okay, I might be able
to manipulate the baby.

599
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,476
If the cord is compressed,

600
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,846
I might be able to
reposition the baby

601
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,146
to take the pressure off.

602
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,726
Okay, I need the
other screwdriver.

603
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,686
Jo?

604
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,550
No change. Let me just
try one more thing.

605
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,196
Damn it! It's not working.
We need to get the baby out.

606
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,067
I haven't confirmed placement...

607
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,526
We need to flip her now!

608
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,866
Alright, we've
got enough screws.

609
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,370
We can finish after
we save the baby.

610
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,706
Let's do this. Wet lap pads.

611
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,496
Page the NICU team and OB.

612
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,536
Let them know we're doing
an emergency C-section.

613
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,916
Everyone here, drop what you're
doing and help us flip her.

614
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,096
Hey.

615
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,870
I got your text. What happened?

616
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,516
Just gave someone the biggest
diagnosis of their life

617
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,476
as casually as ordering
a freakin' coffee.

618
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,226
And then he almost
canceled his lap chole.

619
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,526
He could've died 'cause of me.

620
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,340
That really sucks.

621
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
I'm sorry.

622
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,426
Are you sure you want this?

623
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,096
I want to feel better.

624
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,346
Uh.

625
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,420
Is there a problem?

626
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,686
Look, I want to. You're upset.

627
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,896
And...

628
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,857
Well, maybe we should talk.

629
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,316
Yeah, don't worry about it.

630
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,986
Wait, look... Simone, I...

631
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,486
Hey, Simone.

632
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,126
We successfully
stabilized Allie's spine,

633
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,416
and it'll take a little while,

634
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,206
but we are expecting
a full recovery.

635
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,666
That's great.

636
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,506
And, uh, what about our baby?

637
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,926
Is she going to be okay?

638
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,136
Well, her lungs aren't
fully developed,

639
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,466
so she'll need a little
time on a ventilator.

640
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,556
But for her age,

641
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,806
she is strong.

642
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,606
Yeah.

643
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,396
Hi.

644
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,396
Welcome to the team,
little slugger.

645
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,576
So, we are loud and
we're opinionated,

646
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,286
and we're not the
best athletes, okay?

647
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,520
But we are the Best family.

648
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,706
Yes, we are.

649
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,900
We'll give you a moment.

650
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,546
He can be sentimental.

651
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,176
Well, he is a new father.

652
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,400
I was talking about Link.

653
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,256
I mean, he remembers everything.

654
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,476
Birthdays and anniversaries,

655
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,096
good and bad.

656
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,977
Well, you've known him longer.

657
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,476
You know how sensitive he is,

658
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,516
how much he cares.

659
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,356
And I think

660
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,066
it's even more intense
with people that he loves.

661
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,526
He told you about us?

662
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,880
He didn't have to.

663
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,446
We were already family anyway.

664
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,760
Hm. Mm.

665
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,546
How is Dante?

666
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,126
His gallbladder
was very inflamed,

667
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,716
so we had to convert
to an open procedure.

668
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,466
But Schmitt handled it well.

669
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,256
He'll brief you on
the post-op orders.

670
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,740
Mm-hmm.

671
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,186
He'll be okay.

672
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,186
My instincts... I've
always trusted them.

673
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,566
Lately...

674
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,646
I don't know.

675
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,526
It's a terrifying
feeling, isn't it?

676
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,930
No one has a perfect record.

677
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,970
I mismanaged more than
a few things in my life.

678
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,286
How long did it
take you before you

679
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,520
stopped?

680
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,610
I'll let you know when I do.

681
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,870
What do you have for me, Yasuda?

682
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,266
Lemon, orange, and cherry.

683
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,686
It's Jell-O.

684
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,687
I don't want Jell-O.

685
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,266
I used to hate it.

686
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,276
My mom could serve
nine kids from one box.

687
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,026
So we had it all the time.

688
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,696
A-And I mean literally
every Sunday afternoon.

689
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,236
But then I went to college,

690
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,446
and I found myself grabbing
it at the dining hall.

691
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,196
It... It became a
little taste of home.

692
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,406
You know who wants
a taste of home?

693
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,706
Ms. Granados.

694
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,916
Was she discharged?

695
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,376
Chief.

696
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
What about...

697
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,796
What about focusing on rest?

698
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,126
I don't know if
it was my husband

699
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,136
or my surgeon who
put you up to this,

700
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,386
but either way...

701
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,636
I'm fine.

702
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,016
You are not fine.

703
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,646
And that is not coming
from Dr. Hunt or Ndugu.

704
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,186
That is <i>fact.</i>

705
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,936
I know because I was
standing next to you

706
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,146
when you collapsed in the OR.

707
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,566
We pounded on your
heart to keep you alive.

708
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,526
It was... It was
traumatic and awful.

709
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,366
And I'm still not over it,
but... but here you are,

710
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,390
acting like business as
usual when you almost died!

711
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,626
Chief Altman.

712
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,676
Oh. I... I should go.

713
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,570
Okay.

714
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,266
Please don't tell
anyone this happened.

715
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,516
Discretion. Total discretion.

716
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,356
It doesn't matter. She shouldn't leave
if she's pregnant. I understand that.

717
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,356
Excuse me.

718
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,106
Excuse me!

719
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,856
Billy is with Allie.
The baby is fine.

720
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,406
Now, all of you who needed
help have been seen.

721
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,866
So you are all free to go.

722
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,656
Oh, thank you so much, Doctor.

723
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,786
Thank you. You're welcome.

724
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,116
Alright, what about the MVP?

725
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,876
What? Oh, what about Nowell?

726
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,286
What about him?

727
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,836
An MVP is supposed
to inspire people.

728
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,586
Okay? Make them want to
rise up and do better.

729
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,666
Nowell's played left
field for 25 years.

730
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,426
Hasn't caught so much as a cold.

731
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,296
Oh, at least he didn't
set the cabin on fire

732
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,176
with illegal fireworks.
Those weren't mine!

733
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,926
Really? That's why your
eyebrows were singed off?!

734
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,766
Stop!

735
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,386
Stop it! This is a hospital.

736
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,146
There are people who are
sick and injured here.

737
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,436
Some are in pain.
Some will never leave.

738
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,986
You should all be grateful
that you have a family

739
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,696
that wants to spend
time together,

740
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,606
that plays games together,
that has family traditions.

741
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,236
And instead you have all
been arguing all day,

742
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,496
making it next to impossible for
me to do my job and help you.

743
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,076
So I hope that you
all remember this

744
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,980
when you are all
back here next year.

745
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,876
MVP.

746
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,966
Please.

747
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,596
Family: MVP.

748
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,886
No. Family: MVP.

749
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,266
- MVP!
- Whoo!

750
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,016
MVP!

751
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,896
Family: MVP! MVP! MVP!

752
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,156
If I ask you something,

753
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,736
will you just not
be you for a second?

754
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,076
I need to know the
question first.

755
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,616
Have you seen the bag of cash?

756
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,206
I think "idiot"

757
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,576
might be too generous
in this situation.

758
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,980
Help me find the bag.

759
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,376
You're on all the butt stuff
for the next two weeks.

760
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,070
Fine. I don't care.
Just help me find it.

761
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,926
You left it in the on
call room, dumb-ass.

762
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,767
You're lucky I'm the
one who found it.

763
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,426
Ooh, oops.

764
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,726
Bailey: Hand me that bag

765
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,896
before I hand you
something else.

766
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,016
The police put out a
missing persons report.

767
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,090
Hopefully someone will
recognize our John Doe.

768
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,986
Dr. Bailey, is this a good time

769
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,947
to sign my procedure log?

770
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,106
No.

771
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,196
So I don't get credit

772
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,576
for the cardiac massage?

773
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,116
You didn't do that for credit.

774
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,746
You did it to learn
to save a life.

775
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,116
What?

776
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,536
This...

777
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,246
Look, this man is a human being.

778
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,626
He's someone's son,
maybe someone's brother.

779
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,126
He's just like you, at the
beginning of his adult life.

780
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,086
And then he was
shot multiple times

781
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,136
and might not live.

782
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,056
Yet, the only thing the
two of you seem to see

783
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,636
is blank boxes to be checked.

784
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,436
This exercise is not a game.

785
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,106
It is to determine whether
or not you will ever

786
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,986
regain the privilege
of operating

787
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,446
inside someone's living body.

788
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,866
And if I hear that you put
procedures over patients again,

789
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,406
I will make sure
that you never do.

790
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,466
Surgery went well,

791
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,796
but you will have
a longer recovery

792
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,136
since we weren't able to
go in laparoscopically.

793
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,806
You'll have to be here
a couple days, okay?

794
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,596
Griffith, now is
not a good time...

795
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,830
I just want to apologize
if that's okay.

796
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,896
Okay.

797
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you.

798
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,896
Dante, I am so sorry.

799
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,276
I should have been more tactful.

800
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,656
It's no excuse, but I was
racing through my work,

801
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,350
and I-I screwed up.

802
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,180
Sorry. Been there.

803
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,286
I missed a couple of calls
from the health department

804
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,536
a few months ago.

805
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,286
Huge red flag, I know.

806
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,376
But we had just
launched mobile orders.

807
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,916
The kitchen was slammed.

808
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,126
I didn't have any symptoms,

809
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,626
and I wasn't seeing anyone.

810
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,780
So I put it off.

811
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,830
I never expected to have HIV.

812
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,040
I had to find out at
some point, right?

813
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,830
See you in the morning.

814
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,960
Thank you.

815
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,026
Got any dinner
plans, Dr. Schmitt?

816
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,906
I hear the pudding's good.

817
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,680
No dinner plans.

818
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,510
But I-I do have other patients.

819
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,576
Right.

820
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,376
But I could spare
maybe 20 minutes.

821
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,666
Have you ever seen
the "Great Bakeoff"?

822
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,296
It's my favorite.

823
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,600
It's good. Right?

824
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,426
Hi, I'm Dr. Kwan.

825
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,676
You two responded to the
missing person notice.

826
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,596
Our son... he was on
break from grad school.

827
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,676
And he got work on
a fishing barge.

828
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,436
Andres: They docked yesterday,
but we never heard from him.

829
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,186

was a... a robbery

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,990
Winston. Hi.

892
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,740
I got a cat.

893
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,450
Are you talking to me?

894
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,516
I miss my family,
I miss Meredith,

895
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,856
I miss Maggie, I-I miss Kai,

896
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,106
so, uh, I got a cat.

897
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,460
Oh.

898
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,616
I know things have
been rocky between us,

899
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,866
but I consider you family,

900
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,616
and I would love it

901
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,407
if we were the kind of family

902
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:22,906
that could fight

903
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,090
and still eat meals together.

904
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,110
Would you be interested
in a burger at Joe's?

905
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,256
I could go to Joe's. Yeah.

906
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,626
You know it would
be with me, right?

907
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,096
Yeah. Come on.

908
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,280
Okay.

909
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,846
Oh.

910
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,266
Oh. Oh, uh, Pru convinced Tuck
to set up the camping tent.

911
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,170
So now they're singing
campfire songs.

912
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,720
Is everything okay?

913
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,826
Yeah, we had a John
Doe in his 20s.

914
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,286
He came in full of bullets.

915
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,166
Turns out to be a fisherman

916
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,376
who had, uh, just
gotten his big payday

917
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,006
when someone stuck
a gun in his face.

918
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,756
Just senseless.

919
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,136
It's the worst part of the job.

920
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,570
Now, I'm different.

921
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,556
The interns, right,

922
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,936
they're just like
any other class

923
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,306
clumsy, competitive.

924
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,106
Their hearts are sometimes
in the right place.

925
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,476
But...

926
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,526
I've changed.

927
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,146
I've seen too much.

928
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,066
I've felt too much.

929
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,196
But isn't that a good thing?

930
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,526
No.

931
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,076
Doctor Ndugu openly
questioned my methods today.

932
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,060
And, um...

933
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,956
Well, maybe he's right.

934
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,536
Maybe

935
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,836
it's a sign that.

936
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,400
I... I shouldn't do this again.

937
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,796
Um... Hold on. Hold on.

938
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,886
You remember how long it took me

939
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,056
to figure out
Pru's Diaper Genie?

940
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,016
Or how frustrated I got when

941
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,136
she would only eat orange foods?

942
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,226
As long as it's food, who cares?

943
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,226
Exactly.

944
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,816
See, you, y-you're sailing
through parenting Pru

945
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,396
because you've done it before.

946
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,356
You know what works
and what doesn't.

947
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,696
You know when to get mad
and when to hold a hand.

948
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,236
So, yes.

949
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
You've changed,

950
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,996
but for the better.

951
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,376
I scored four
procedures on my card,

952
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,086
and I won a trophy.

953
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,416
I think victory
looks good on me.

954
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,756
Anyone else?

955
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,176
I got two procedures,

956
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,926
I saw an attending
cry, and I'm exhausted.

957
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,950
Oh, who cried?

958
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,466

960
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,596
Also two. Come on,

00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,000
Not in the mood.

971
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,886
Jimmy's did
All-You-Can-Eat Crab Day?

972

Oh, when they didn't
limit the time,

973

and everyone who came for
lunch stayed through dinner

974

I remember.

979
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,106
Okay. Well, after
that awful shift,

980
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,696
you and I sat in the back booth

981
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,116
eating oyster crackers.

982
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,286

984
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,326
