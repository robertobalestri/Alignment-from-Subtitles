1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:03,654
<i>Years ago,</i>
<i>a New York physician</i>
<i>discovered a gene mutation</i>

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,924
<i>that causes congenital</i>
<i>insensitivity to pain...</i>

3
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:10,060
Have you seen my charger? I
thought I left it on the table.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,128
<i>...or CIP.</i>

5
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,631
I don't remember. Sorry.

6
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,599
I will find it.

7
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,201
Coffee will help.

8
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,072
Sorry.

9
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,409
I'll make more.

10
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,810
But you're kinda... out.

11
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,649
<i>It's an extremely rare</i>
<i>condition that blocks people</i>
<i>from feeling pain.</i>

12
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,049
Important meeting. Gotta go.

13
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:35,453
<i>It sounds good in theory,</i>
<i>but pain is important.</i>

14
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:37,622
<i>It tells the body</i>

15
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,558
<i>when it's in danger,</i>
<i>and helps keep it alive.</i>

16
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,859
Oh-- Oh,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

17
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,129
I s-see your
appointment went well.

18
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:47,765
X-rays show the bone's healed,
so Link cleared me.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,001
The brace is off,
and I am fully back.

20
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,438
- Now, you--
you know I'm careful.

21
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,707
I just can't keep feeling like
I'm letting the station down
by not pulling my weight.

22
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,709
-You-- You're back.
-I'm back!

23
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:00,144
You're back.

24
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,313
-Gotta run.
-N--

25
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:02,681
<i>Put your hand in fire,</i>

26
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:05,049
<i>get burned, and you learn</i>
<i>not to do it again.</i>

27
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,919
<i>- Or put another way:</i>
<i>living hurts.</i>

28
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:18,896
Were you aware when you
intubated Maxine Anderson
that she was DNI?

29
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,565
Maxine didn't wanna
die on a ventilator.

30
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,201
-But I knew if
I can get in through--
-Yes or no, Dr. Kwan?

31
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:26,371
Ms. Anderson didn't wanna die.
I-I could see it in her eyes.

32
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:29,274
Could you see the giant orange
DNI sticker on her chart?

33
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:33,143
Max-- M-Ms. Anderson-- She's not
suing Dr. Kwan or the hospital.

34
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,013
You're listed as Ms. Anderson's
medical proxy. Why is that?

35
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,881
It was her choice.
Why does it matter?

36
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,883
Because her son
has launched an inquiry into it.

37
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,152
Let's return to the other night.

38
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,421
Where were you
when Dr. Altman collapsed?

39
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:47,825
OR 1. We rushed Sam Sutton in
because his chest tube was
putting out liters of blood.

40
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,462
But you left Mr. Sutton
to attend to Dr. Altman.

41
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,731
Dr. Altman is our
Chief of Surgery.

42
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:55,032
And Dr. Adams was
with Mr. Sutton.

43
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:57,435
Don't you mean Dr. Adams
was opening Mr. Sutton?

44
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,769
Sam was dying.

45
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,838
He didn't have minutes.
He had seconds.

46
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,475
According to whom? You are a--

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,011
You're a first-year
resident, correct? An intern.

48
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,681
I know what a dying
patient's vitals look like.

49
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,081
And what might those be?

50
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,717
The patient hardly had
a blood pressure reading,

51
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,784
high heart rate.

52
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,220
He was definitely bleeding out.

53
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:17,389
And you believed you and
Dr. Adams could save him?

54
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,823
- It all happened really fast.
- Dr. Griffith,

55
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:22,893
if you were in the OR
by yourself without Dr. Adams,

56
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:25,664
would you still have
opened up the patient?

57
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,967
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,270
I already did that twice.

59
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:34,004
Can you evict family?

60
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:37,808
Lucas is just crashing at
my place, and it's not ideal.

61
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,843
He's into all my stuff.
His stuff--

62
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,546
Every time I turn around,
there's more.

63
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,914
I mean, I know
I am not the easiest person
to live with, but--

64
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,551
-But you do pick up
after yourself. Mmm.
-Is it so hard?

65
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,420
-We already did that.
-It's slow.

66
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:51,356
Oh. Maybe it just
doesn't like you.

67
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:55,160
-I'm gonna take the stairs.
-Mmm. Okay.

68
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:57,995
<i>How was your interview?</i>

69
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:59,897
-Mine was pretty brutal.
-Don't talk to me.

70
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,833
Lawyers are paid
to make you feel badly, Kwan.

71
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,503
Shake it off.
Just focus on the work. Here.

72
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:06,937
Everyone's making progress.

73
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,006
One more chest tube,
and I am out of this dungeon.

74
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,376
Dr. Bailey, given that we're
close to finishing our logs,

75
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,078
would it make sense
to focus on that
instead of wherever we're going?

76
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,913
It would make
sense for you to trust

77
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,150
that anything I ask of you
will make you a better doctor.

78
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,757
There she is.

79
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,526
Oh. Dr. Bailey, just in time.

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,060
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

81
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,097
Take a seat and learn something.

82
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,546
Meet Vida Madera,
26 years old, 30 weeks pregnant

83
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,047
with a history of vision loss.

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,317
Dr. Wilson and I
met Vida through the clinic

85
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,754
when she learned
she was pregnant after
suffering two miscarriages.

86
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,423
Two weeks ago,
an ultrasound revealed

87
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:02,193
a vein of Galen malformation
in the fetus's brain.

88
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,796
-I'm-- I'm sorry. Uh, may I?
-Yeah, of course.

89
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,865
Okay. Uh, who can
tell me what a VOGM is?

90
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,600
A rare arteriovenous fistula.

91
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,469
An artery in the brain connects
to the vein directly,

92
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,872
causing dysregulated blood flow
into the defect.

93
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:16,241
Correct. And in utero,
the baby is typically sheltered

94
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:19,943
by mom and the placenta,
but then after delivery
and the cord is clamped,

95
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,979
what happens? Yes.

96
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,947
The baby's heart and lungs
become overwhelmed

97
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,583
with a massive
overflow of blood.

98
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,286
Which can lead to heart failure,
seizures, and possibly death.

99
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,890
Standard procedure has been
embolization after delivery,

100
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,991
but many babies do not survive.

101
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,661
And if they do, the child
often has major brain injury.

102
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,930
So that's when
I called Dr. Robbins.

103
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,167
So a few months ago,
I started a clinical trial

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,736
with a team of
interventional neuroradiologists

105
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,806
in which we operate
on the baby's brain,

106
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,841
before delivery.

107
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,477
In-utero brain surgery. Sick.

108
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,712
Ugh. I hate babies.

109
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:55,880
Technically a fetus.

110
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:57,782
What did I say
about talking to me?

111
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,219
-Yes.
-How many times
has this been done?

112
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,923
Oh,
um, let me think, uh...

113
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,492
None.

114
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,863
So who wants to make history?

115
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:20,037
- Morning, Dr. Webber.
- Dr. Ndugu, do you have a minute?

116
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,575
Oh, no, I have a TAVR--
two, actually. We still
haven't filled Maggie's spot.

117
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:26,143
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. I have a solution.

118
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,078
You coming back right now
is not the solution.

119
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,181
You don't know
what I was gonna say.

120
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,250
But you're not wrong.

121
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,984
Altman, it's been
barely four weeks

122
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,320
since your surgery.

123
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,355
But I have been practicing
in the skills lab.

124
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,357
I am strong, and I
am more than ready.

125
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,025
To return to your desk,
not to the OR. All right?

126
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,127
It's about stamina not skills.

127
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,168
"Stamina." Please.

128
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,002
Come on in.

129
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:55,440
Quite a crowd
you've brought, Dr. Bailey.

130
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:59,076
So we have, uh,
Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Wilson,

131
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,747
world-renowned
fetal surgeon Dr. Robbins,

132
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,216
-and the surgical interns.
-Hey.

133
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,618
- Hi, Vida.
- Hi.

134
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,187
Dr. Robbins, we have
been Internet-stalking you,

135
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,422
and you are truly incredible.

136
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:14,459
We just read
about the work you did
with twin-to-twin transfusions.

137
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,261
Yeah. Well, my field
has come a long way.

138
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,563
And thank you. Dr. Griffith.

139
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:22,800
Vida Madera, 26, history
of vision impairment, hear--

140
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,168
Dr. Robbins.

141
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:27,338
W-We really appreciate
you coming all this way,

142
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,807
but I've given it some thought,

143
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,176
and... I'm so sorry.

144
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,978
Hey, what are you talking about?

145
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,680
I've changed my mind.

146
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,248
I-I can't have the surgery.

147
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:39,049
'Cause it's never
been done before?

148
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,051
Because I can't lose this baby.

149
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,488
Well, I-I assure you,
Vida, that's exactly
what we're trying to avoid.

150
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,357
Do you know how many blind
and low-vision mothers have

151
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,561
social services called on them
for no reason other than
their sight?

152
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,897
When this became a successful,
viable pregnancy,

153
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:56,834
I knew that I was going to have
to fight to protect this baby.

154
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,604
So the idea of a giant needle
being stuck into her brain

155
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:03,073
before I've even had the chance
to hold her myself, I-- I can't.

156
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:06,578
We've gone through so much
to get to this point.
I just can't risk it.

157
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:10,548
And Dr. Shepherd--
She did say that
the baby would have a chance.

158
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:13,116
It is an extremely
small chance, Vida.

159
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,786
And in that case,

160
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,789
the baby would likely have
significant neurological
injuries.

161
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:20,625
But there's still a chance.
So I'm going with that.

162
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:22,894
World-class or not, Dr. Robbins,

163
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,363
I'm saying no. No surgery.

164
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,387
Here's the file. Here.

165
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,455
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

166
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,523
-Hi.
-Hi.

167
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,657
Sorry to bother, but, um,

168
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,192
I'm waiting for Dr. Millin.

169
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,527
They said they sent out a page.

170
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,729
I'm sure Dr. Millin
will be down soon.

171
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,266
Can I help you?
I'm also a doctor.

172
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,802
I'll wait... for Dr. Millin.

173
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, uh...

174
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,842
-Dr. Hunt. Hi.
-Yeah?

175
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,744
So as soon as I place a chest
tube, I'm back in the OR.

176
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,712
So anything that I can do
to make that happen--

177
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,282
Ms. Timms in bed three needs
a rectal disimpaction.

178
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:07,119
And if she gets
an accidental chest tube,
I'll know who to blame. Okay?

179
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,690
Hey, somebody paged me?

180
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,926
Oh, yeah. That guy
was looking for you.

181
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,895
-Do I know him?
-I don't keep a log
of who you know.

182
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,300
Hi.

183
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,001
I heard you were looking for me.

184
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,369
I'm Dr. Millin.

185
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,638
Uh, no, you're not.

186
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,575
Joshy, my guy.

187
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:30,843
Dr. Millin.

188
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,811
Hey. Uh.

189
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,780
Guess what. There's
another Dr. Millin.

190
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,382
Hmm. He is not a doctor.

191
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,085
But she is my sister.

192
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,596
Vida has asked to be discharged.

193
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:52,297
We can't let her
leave. She's just scared.

194
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,999
And when were you
going to tell me

195
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,401
that my patient would be
the very first in
this clinical trial?

196
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,571
It's a trial.
Someone has to go first,
and Vida's a perfect candidate.

197
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:03,242
- The fetal malformation is just
wide enough to justify the risk,

198
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,144
and there's no evidence
of brain damage so--

199
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,615
And the parents have to be
completely on board.
So this is done.

200
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,450
I have a patient
to see. Robbins,

201
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,253
sorry this didn't work out,
but it was good to see you.

202
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:15,521
Travel safely home.

203
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,260
If you don't do this surgery,
that baby will not survive.

204
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:25,598
It is a statistical miracle that
she is still a viable candidate.

205
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,634
And if Vida changes her mind
in the future,

206
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,401
then it might be too late.

207
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,436
I know. I'm disappointed too.

208
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,971
But my hands are tied.

209
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,908
So...
...I'm sorry.

210
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,978
<i>Dr. Man to</i>
<i>labor and delivery. Dr. Man--</i>

211
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,014
Dorian. Dorian, it's okay.

212
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,815
- You're gonna rip out your A-line.
-  -What's happening?

213
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,784
-Oh, when did he wake up?
-A few minutes ago.

214
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,754
His vitals look okay,
but he's weak,
he's disoriented and combative.

215
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,522
- Don't touch me.
- Dorian. Dorian.

216
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,292
I'm Dr. Ndugu. Now, this is
Dr. Bailey, Schmitt, and Kwan.

217
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,861
You're at Grey-Sloan Memorial
in the ICU.

218
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,529
We need you to stop
fighting us. Okay?

219
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,398
Just try to relax.
Give him a second.

220
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,732
Dorian. Dorian.

221
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,603
Hi. Do you remember
what happened to you?

222
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:08,907
Uh. I remember two guys,
maybe a gun.

223
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,611
Okay. Kwan, make sure
and alert the police
that he's awake.

224
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,412
-Okay.
-Do my parents know I'm here?

225
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,148
Yes. And they've been here
sitting by your side
almost every day.

226
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:20,185
Was I shot?
- Yes.

227
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,521
Technically, you died,

228
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,390
and then we opened up your chest
and your heart started
to beat again.

229
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,794
Doctors Bailey and Ndugu
repaired your chest
and your abdominal injuries,

230
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,762
removed some of your
bowels and spleen--

231
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,764
Okay. That's
enough, Kwan, for now.

232
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,566
-I'm due in the OR.
-Yes.

233
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,936
His white blood count is high,
and his heart rate
has been increasing.

234
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,239
We need to do an
infection workup.

235
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,509
Kwan, run a nutrition panel
and fix his A-line. Okay?

236
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:52,184
I have 200 emails, and you
page me 911 to what, exactly?

237
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:53,919
A mock OR.

238
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,288
I've helped dozens of athletes
get back after injury,

239
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,626
and not one has gotten
back on the field without
playing a scrimmage first.

240
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,860
Uh, you'll
operate, and I'll assist.

241
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,996
And I'll be
your anesthesiologist,

242
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,365
your scrub nurse,
circulating nurse.

243
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:10,969
Your patient is
a 65-year-old male
with a history of tobacco use,

244
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,238
here for a four-vessel CABG.

245
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,677
My patient is a
30-pound lump of plastic.

246
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,047
Oh, no. He's gone
into cardiac arrest.

247
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,049
What? Should I push some meds?

248
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,218
-Push epi.
-You're losing him.

249
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,255
Push epi.

250
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,960
<i>Dr. Nelson to dermatology.</i>

251
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,630
<i>Dr. Charlotte Nelson</i>
<i>to dermatology.</i>

252
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,267
Hey, uh, what did
the lawyers ask you?

253
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,503
Same as everyone else.
"What happened that night?"

254
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,171
Yeah. W-What did you say?

255
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:50,042
-Oh, I need to check
on Bailey's post-ops.
-Uh--

256
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,312
You took my car this morning.

257
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,947
-You said I could borrow it.
-Not without asking me first.

258
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,151
-Well, I left you a note.
-Under which pile of stuff?

259
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,588
Would this be a bad time
to let you know that
I'm on your service?

260
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,659
-You have got to be kidding me.
-I'll go round on your patients.

261
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,361
<i>Dr. Reynolds to pediatrics.</i>
<i>Dr. Ethel Reynolds...</i>

262
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,363
Intern woes?

263
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,632
Yeah, something like that.

264
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,033
The, um, fetal embolization
is canceled.

265
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,536
-Mom got spooked.
-Well, it's a spooky surgery.

266
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,204
Not only are you
inserting a needle,

267
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:21,774
but multiple metal coils into
their tiny, tiny baby's brain.

268
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,743
Well, this is the
best shot that baby has.

269
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,778
Doesn't make it
any less terrifying.

270
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,348
-Okay.
-All right.

271
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,120
Why do you have to invade
my workplace with your mess?

272
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:38,957
Joshy is not a mess. He's a
human being, and a subscriber.

273
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh, God. Are you still making
those dumb videos?

274
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,062
I heal people, just like you.

275
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,998
-You are an influencer.
-A wellness influencer.

276
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,901
You went on one yoga retreat
and dated a Pilates instructor.

277
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,371
That does not make you a doctor.

278
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,040
It's branding, like
Dr. Dre or Dr. Seuss.

279
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,542
They don't wear scrubs
and tell people what to eat.

280
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,611
Hey, Dr. Millin?

281
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,679
-Yes.
-That's me.

282
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,247
Um. Kind of hurting here.

283
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,283
-Okay. Is the pain
getting worse?
-Yeah.

284
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,086
- It's like I told the doc
in my DM...

285
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,989
...it started as an ingrown hair
or something on my back,

286
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,425
but now it's swelled up.

287
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,060
I can't see. Is it bad?

288
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,266
That, um--

289
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,370
That one's gonna be
all you, Dr. Millin.

290
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,438
Mm-hmm.

291
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,843
-Thank you so much.
-There you go.

292
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,211
Dr. Robbins.
Stop, please.

293
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,280
You can't leave.

294
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,516
I can't do the surgery

295
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,451
without consent or your trust.

296
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,356
You have mine, and, uh, I
think you'll have Vida's.

297
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,725
She just needs a minute.

298
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,194
Two weeks ago,
we were debating
the cost of crib sheets,

299
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,030
and...
...today, well, we're here.

300
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,134
Look, our baby can't die.

301
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,471
If she dies, Vida
won't survive that,

302
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:03,008
so please,
just keep prepping and planning
what you need to do.

303
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,311
But whatever happens,
Dr. Robbins, just don't leave.

304
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:12,658
<i>Dr... call Oncology 2622.</i>

305
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:15,594
-Hi. Could you
help me with something?
-Ooh, is it a chest tube?

306
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:16,928
-No.
-Oh. Then no, thanks.

307
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,329
I'm trying to drain
this giant abscess,

308
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,565
and nothing is coming out.

309
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:20,965
Just call an attending.

310
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,669
-Hunt's around.
-I'd really rather not.

311
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:25,370
You did know that guy.

312
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:26,438
I didn't.

313
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,474
I know the guy he's with.

314
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,509
An ex-boyfriend?
Someone you ghosted?

315
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,578
Ew. No, it's my brother.

316
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:34,680
And he is nothing but trouble.

317
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,949
He thinks he's a doctor,
and I would rather not
involve anyone else

318
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:41,520
on a day when
we've already been interviewed
by hospital lawyers. So--

319
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:44,222
-Okay, I'm in.
-Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

320
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,925
But I get to ask him
as many questions about
your childhood as I want.

321
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,127
I--

322
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,195
Dorian's prelim culture
came back negative,

323
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,465
except for the sample from
the subclavian central line.

324
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,066
Yeah. Well, he needs access.

325
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,969
DC the infected line and get a
new one on the opposite side.

326
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,937
Have you placed a
subclavian line before?

327
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:00,838
Two.

328
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:02,675
Well, time to make it three.

329
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:06,377
Now would be nice.

330
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:09,280
I've never done one
without supervision.

331
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,082
Are you sure you don't want me
to wait for you?

332
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,917
It's a central line, Kwan.

333
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,520
You've seen it. You've done it.

334
00:15:14,553 --> 00:15:16,087
Just trust your instincts.

335
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:21,359
Okay.
Once the baby's in position,
I'll inject the paralytic,

336
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:24,996
then we'll start the clock
with the goal of finishing
under 20 minutes. Why?

337
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,298
Rookies, I'm asking you.

338
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,167
Uh, more time means more stress
on the baby.

339
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,270
And the mom.
She'll be awake the entire time.

340
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:35,306
A prolonged procedure also
puts stress on the pregnancy.

341
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,509
So there's no
room for error. None.

342
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:39,445
Are you going to
be pacing in the OR?

343
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:42,146
Because if so, please
remind me to disinvite you.

344
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,048
Okay. We're through the skull.

345
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,819
What are these, exactly?

346
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:50,723
Phantom skulls. They approximate
different possible densities
of fetal skulls.

347
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:53,925
If this were the real thing,
blood would come
through the needle,

348
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,893
but until then,
everything is hypothetical.

349
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,161
But it's not.

350
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,332
You're practicing
on a 3D printed bone simulation.

351
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:03,802
-How is that even close
to the real thing?
-Griffith--

352
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,203
And why are we practicing at all

353
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,071
if the patient hasn't agreed
to the surgery?

354
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:08,873
Uh, shouldn't we be in there
talking to Vida,

355
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,744
explaining the consequences
of not going through with
the surgery?

356
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:15,146
We don't convince anyone of
anything. That's not what we do.

357
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,049
Okay.
Then should we be recommending
this procedure at all?

358
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,284
Okay. Both you
and Griffith, out.

359
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,122
Wait.

360
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,225
He's not wrong.

361
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,994
Well, I mean, he--
he's kind of wrong.

362
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,096
But what I mean is,

363
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,700
is anyone good
with a 3D printer?

364
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:40,639
So, what was Millin like
as a kid?

365
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:41,774
Kind of the same.

366
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,375
Smart, cool, weirdly good skin?

367
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,778
I was gonna say mean.

368
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,913
Hey, Joshy.

369
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,082
You'll need to hydrate
after this. Okay?

370
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:54,887
Our bodies are 60% water.
Go back to the source, amigo.

371
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,354
-Thanks, Dr. Millin.
-Of course.

372
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,490
All right, I'm going to
make another incision.

373
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:02,260
You'll feel some pressure,
and then hopefully
you'll feel better.

374
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,765
Hmm.

375
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,803
Nothing?

376
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,070
I swear I made
a deep enough incision.

377
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,240
-We have to call Hunt.
-I'd really rather not.

378
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:21,178
And I'd really rather not
get in trouble for doing
something without an attending

379
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:23,681
after already being in trouble
for something I didn't do.

380
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,015
I'd really rather not die,

381
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,384
so can someone please call
whoever Hunt is?

382
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm doing it.

383
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,994
Hey.

384
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:39,931
You listen carefully.

385
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:42,433
My boss is probably gonna come,

386
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:46,871
and I don't want you
embarrassing me with
your "Dr. Millin" crap.

387
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,807
Okay. You are
going to wait outside.

388
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:53,343
And don't talk to
anyone. Don't move.

389
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:56,379
I'd say don't think, but
you've already got that covered.

390
00:17:56,414 --> 00:18:00,518
You are going to stay
where I can see you,

391
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:03,019
or, so help me God,

392
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:07,692
I will hire a bot farm to
drag you on every message board
on the Internet.

393
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,025
Got it?

394
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,328
Great.

395
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,904
Shepherd was
annoyed with me, not you.

396
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:22,440
This morning,

397
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:27,945
the lawyers asked
if I would have opened Sam up
if you hadn't asked me to,

398
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,012
and I said no.

399
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,482
So you threw me under the bus.

400
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:34,084
-I defended myself. I just--
-By slitting my throat.

401
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:37,320
You told me to tell
them the truth, so I did.

402
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,391
We didn't get a chance to
align our stories because you...

403
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,964
walked away.

404
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,936
Where are you
even living, Lucas?

405
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:56,139
Lucas.

406
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,809
We have to focus
on work, remember?

407
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:08,084
So what does
the spleen do, exactly?

408
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,287
Hell if I know.

409
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:13,591
How many times was I shot?

410
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:15,593
Come on. Just tell me.

411
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,161
There were three bullets.

412
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:22,198
One hit your lung, and two
went through your abdomen.

413
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:25,636
- So, how long
do I have to stay here?

414
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,940
We'll know more
once we can confirm that you're
getting adequate nutrients

415
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,008
despite how much
bowel was removed.

416
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:33,044
It's important for healing.

417
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,481
- The left side of my chest--
it hurts.

418
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,016
I need oxygen.

419
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,183
On it.

420
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:42,453
-Is this normal?
-Page Dr. Schmitt.

421
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,822
Come on, come on. It's okay.
Breathe. Breathe.

422
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:46,189
It's okay. It's okay.

423
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:52,020
Hi, Vida.

424
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:53,921
I'm still not ready
to make any decision.

425
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,124
But-- And you don't have to.

426
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,463
My colleague,
Dr. Herman, likes to--

427
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:05,267
Well, if you've read about me,
then you've most certainly
read about her.

428
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,867
She also has low vision,

429
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,171
and when we discuss a surgery,
she likes to walk through it.

430
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:13,141
So, before you leave,
I'd like to discuss the surgery

431
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:16,211
and walk you through it the way
that I walk through it with her.

432
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:17,945
Okay.

433
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:21,617
So this is a 3D printed model

434
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,818
of your daughter's ultrasound
this morning.

435
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:36,331
And this is an MRI
of your baby's brain.

436
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,668
We're going to position her
facing downwards

437
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:43,438
so that we can access
and enter her head here.

438
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,641
We're gonna insert the catheter

439
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:48,243
and then deploy the coils
into the malformation.

440
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,518
I know that it's hard

441
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:59,920
when you can't hope based on
what others have done
before you.

442
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:02,990
And it's one thing
to have faith for yourself,

443
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,193
but to have it
for someone else, to--

444
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:07,895
to have it for your child...

445
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,335
And no matter
how many times I tell you

446
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:18,873
that I know
exactly what I'm doing,
you're still gonna be scared.

447
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,777
And I know that it's painful,

448
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,280
but this pain--
this pain has purpose.

449
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:29,518
This pain could have life

450
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:30,918
on the other side of it.

451
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:40,195
- What happened?
-  -I inserted the line, then he went into distress.

452
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:42,897
The X-ray shows that he dropped
a lung. He needs a chest tube.

453
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,566
So why are you
just standing there?

454
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,966
I was waiting for you.

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,036
Am I dying? Is this it?

456
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,739
It's a complication
that unfortunately can happen,

457
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:52,407
but you're gonna be okay.

458
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:56,611
Dr. Kwan is gonna
insert a chest tube
to reinflate the lung.

459
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:09,324
Keep going.

460
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,630
I can't. You should do it.

461
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:27,975
That's good.

462
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:31,380
I can breathe.

463
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:38,787
Hey. What do we got?
- This is Joshy.

464
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,822
He came in with a
four-by-four centimeter abscess.

465
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:45,360
We started the I and D,
but made the incision here,
and there's no pus.

466
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:48,896
Mmm. Yeah, I see the problem.
It's likely loculated
and deeper. Okay.

467
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,232
Palpate around the perimeter.

468
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,534
Okay. You made
a good first incision,

469
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,370
but you need to use your finger
to get to the correct pocket.

470
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,938
Okay.
Now, as you palpate, it's--
you're gonna feel pressure.

471
00:22:57,972 --> 00:22:59,875
You feel that?

472
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:01,510
-Yeah.
-Okay. Good. Uh, scalpel.

473
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,678
- All right.
- Let's get this here.

474
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:05,113
Now, cut deeper.

475
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:08,083
- Wait one second.
- Okay.

476
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:10,552
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God. Yes!

477
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,055
Yeah. Unfortunately,
you never forget that smell.

478
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:15,990
You okay there, Joshy?

479
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:17,426
Never felt better.

480
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,395
- Thank God for Dr. Millin.
- Nice work. Okay.

481
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,597
Let's wash out the wound,
pack it with iodine gauze,

482
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:25,333
and set him up with home health
for dressing changes.

483
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,204
Whoa! I need a gurney!

484
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,173
Does anybody know
who this guy is?

485
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:41,015
Really? I think
this is the same model that
I practiced on 20 years ago.

486
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,952
Are you ready or not for
phase two? Fine motor skills?

487
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:49,791
You need to do
an anastomosis with this
perfect saphenous vein graft.

488
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,395
We can stop
if you need to, you know.

489
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,796
No, I'm good.

490
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,866
This patient needs a bypass,
and I am going to give him one.

491
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,568
Potts scissors.

492
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:02,537
Potts scissors. Right. Um.

493
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,739
-No.
-Um.

494
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,974
- Ugh.
- You're no BokHee.

495
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,744
Neither are you.

496
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,414
Am I interrupting?

497
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:13,981
Dr. Ndugu.

498
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:17,285
I have been standing
for multiple hours.

499
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,789
I have performed CPR,
and I've cracked a chest,

500
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:23,024
and now I am
operating on a heart.

501
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:27,195
I can assure you
that I have stamina.

502
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:29,664
Well, that's great.
But you're not cleared.

503
00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:32,501
I feel fine.

504
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:34,302
Yeah, you feel fine today.

505
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,671
We both know recovery
for open-heart surgery

506
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,240
is a month minimum.

507
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,308
If you came back early and
something happened to a patient,

508
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,178
I wouldn't be able to live with
myself, and neither would you.

509
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,814
I'll take her to the OR.

510
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,349
Dr. Webber.

511
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,985
I've been with her all day.
I know what she can do.

512
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:53,255
I'll observe her work,
and then I'll sign off
on her return.

513
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:56,825
If he signs off, then I do too.

514
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,034
And then after that,
I'm gonna need labs
on the Turner kid in room 1343.

515
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,336
-And make sure that--
-You stole my intern?

516
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,372
-Your surgery was canceled.
-It's back on.

517
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:13,174
Okay. Well, if interns
aren't allowed in the OR anyway,

518
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,010
I could really use
him on my post-ops.

519
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:17,178
-Yeah, I could use
the hours in peds.
-Prep Vida.

520
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,214
Right now. He's occupied.

521
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:22,117
Clearly.

522
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,052
<i>Dr. Faraji to the SICU.</i>
<i>Dr. Faraji...</i>

523
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:25,487
I'm gonna prep Vida.

524
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,155
-Great. See you in the OR.
-I won't be there.

525
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:28,690
I'll see Dr. Griffith?

526
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,192
-No, interns aren't allowed
in the OR.
-Says who?

527
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,362
Wha--

528
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:38,166
You--

529
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,337
-This used to be an office.
-Never.

530
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,539
It doesn't matter.
What matters is--

531
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:45,607
What happened, Bailey?

532
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:47,776
Vida consented.

533
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:50,046
No, no, no, no.
Not to Vida, to you.

534
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:53,181
You once put
an HIV virus in a kid

535
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:56,052
because you read two papers that
said it might cure his SCID.

536
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:58,486
Okay. It-It-It-- Had it
ever been done before? No.

537
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,122
But you did it anyways
because otherwise
the kid might have died.

538
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:05,393
- Okay, Robbins-- -I'm still going.
-  Okay?

539
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:08,830
You got an award for teaching,
which is not surprising,

540
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:11,933
because you raised surgeons like
Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey.

541
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:13,702
And you were finally
recognized for that.

542
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:17,372
So can you imagine how
excited I was to come back here

543
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:20,375
and to stand next to you
and to teach? But...

544
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,113
interns are not
even allowed in the OR?

545
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,248
I mean-- What-- Bailey.

546
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,922
We might fix a baby's
brain inside a womb.

547
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:36,591
That is magic.

548
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,194
And I don't know-- I don't know

549
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,996
what the interns did
to get themselves banned.

550
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,864
And I'm sure that it was awful.

551
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:48,269
But if you don't let
them see the magic,

552
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:51,539
then how will they be motivated
to get back in?

553
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,380
I can't remember the last time

554
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:01,149
I was this excited
for a VATS procedure.

555
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:05,654
Maybe my first, but some of
the excitement was terror.

556
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:09,724
- My attending stood over me...
- ...the entire time,

557
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:14,429
but I held it together,
and the procedure went fine.

558
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:19,668
I never think that
nerves are a bad thing.

559
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:21,503
Ready?

560
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:40,288
Spinal's
been administered.

561
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:41,956
Great. Thank you.

562
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:44,759
Hi, Vida. It's Dr. Robbins.

563
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:48,164
Okay. I want to ask you
one more time if you're sure,

564
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,231
because you can still say no.

565
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:52,333
You are the one
that's in control.

566
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:54,502
Yeah.

567
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,172
Yeah, I'm sure.

568
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:57,639
I'm ready.

569
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,076
Save my baby.

570
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,348
Okay. Up against
the wall. All of you.

571
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:13,288
Okay. Let's do this.

572
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:14,989
Ultrasound, please.

573
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,394
Dim the lights.

574
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,532
All right, baby girl.

575
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:26,334
Here we go.

576
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,909
Okay, keep going.

577
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,744
We need the back of the baby's
head facing the mom's belly.

578
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:35,945
- I'm doing
the best I can.

579
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:38,247
-She's being stubborn.
-Schmitt. Gotta go.

580
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,750
Doesn't Bailey outrank him?

581
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:42,084
It's been
20 minutes of this.

582
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:43,754
Maybe try
the other direction.

583
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:47,390
It's you.

584
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:49,860
If that phone
belongs to one of you,

585
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,628
take it in this room,
'cause it's the last time
you'll be in it.

586
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,230
It isn't mine.

587
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,766
If we weren't
fired this morning, we are now.

588
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,901
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying.

589
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:01,237
It's Doug.

590
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,774
We're close. I almost
have the head in position.

591
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:05,007
There. There.

592
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,743
Okay, Wilson, hold her there.

593
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:09,947
Injecting the paralytic
and anesthetic
into the baby's thigh.

594
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,787
Needle is in.

595
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,957
Okay.

596
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:22,926
There she is.

597
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,260
She's still.

598
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:26,062
Dr. Shepherd.

599
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:27,597
Start the clock.

600
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,065
Eighteen gauge, please.

601
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:31,802
Every second puts the mother
and baby in more danger,

602
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,269
so let's make them count.

603
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:37,340
What is your problem?

604
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:38,541
I woke up alone.

605
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:41,544
-I was in surgery.
-Okay. Calm down, Julie Jules.

606
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,914
Dr. Millin.

607
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,548
You're my sister.

608
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,650
-I don't make you call me that.
-You're not a doctor.

609
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:50,286
I have spent every dollar

610
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,589
and every ounce of my energy
to achieve that title.

611
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:57,193
I have fought, sweat
and scraped my way through mess,

612
00:29:57,226 --> 00:30:01,130
and I am done with anyone who
tries to take that away from me.

613
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,766
- Do you hear me?
- Millin.

614
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,233
-What?
-Yes?

615
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,869
He didn't say doctor.
He just said Millin.

616
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:09,272
Dr. Millin can't treat you
because she's your sister.

617
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,942
We have strict rules
about family treating family.

618
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:15,444
But I assume you know that,
being a health care professional
and all.

619
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:18,381
Listen, I know it can be hard
to take advice from family,

620
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,416
so I'm gonna say this to you.

621
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:24,186
Misleading others in
their health and wellness
is questionable at best.

622
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,156
And as you saw today,
it can have severe consequences.

623
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:30,894
So I recommend you find
other ways to influence people.

624
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:35,032
And I hope you're proud
that you're related

625
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,499
to an excellent physician.

626
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,603
Now, you're free to go, okay?

627
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:47,878
-Do you want a juice
for the road?
-Mmm.

628
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,846
Okay,
it's been 14 minutes.

629
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,316
We're going as fast as we can.
We need about three more coils.

630
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,085
Stop, Shepherd.

631
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,354
Stop right now.

632
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:03,259
Okay. I'm gonna
speak quietly and calmly,

633
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,896
and I would like for
everyone else to do the same.

634
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,430
The baby is moving slightly,

635
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,766
and I'm gonna administer
another round of paralytics.

636
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,367
- We're mid-coil.
- Yeah.

637
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,269
If the baby is moving
when we're inserting the coils,

638
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:15,104
we risk putting them
in the wrong place.

639
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,340
Can we shift the ultrasound,
so we can visualize
the baby's thigh?

640
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:19,141
Very, very carefully, because

641
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:21,177
there's a needle
sticking out the back
of this baby's head.

642
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,780
- Robbins.
-  -Bailey, I need you to trust me.

643
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,016
All right. Calm down, baby girl.

644
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,383
Calm down.

645
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,052
There. Okay.

646
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,419
Here we go.

647
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,555
How much more time
does this buy us?

648
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:34,690
It doesn't.
This is just tiding us over.
We have five minutes.

649
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,425
Okay, she's still.

650
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,493
Show me her heart.

651
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:42,899
It's strong. Back to her brain.

652
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,768
Dr. Shepherd, you need to--

653
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,202
-Move fast.
-Yeah.

654
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,119
-Hey.
-Hmm.

655
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,686
How was the VATS?

656
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,154
Well, Beckman's doing it.

657
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:12,361
I've been away from the OR
about three weeks...

658
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:15,132
...and I thought
today was the day.

659
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:17,500
But when I started
to glove and gown,

660
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:19,970
I saw the patient.

661
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:22,505
I smelled the room
and heard the monitors.

662
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:25,174
I used to be able to
take a break from the OR.

663
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:27,276
And no matter
how long I was out,

664
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,379
it would immediately
come right back to me.

665
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:32,082
But today...

666
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,419
I didn't feel it come back.

667
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,156
It's still there.

668
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:43,559
You were watching me all day,
but I was also watching you.

669
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:46,163
You had my back
today. You always do.

670
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:49,733
So let me do the same for you.
Trust me.

671
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:52,769
If I ever believe
that you do not belong in there,

672
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,370
I will tell you.

673
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,778
Okay.
All coils deployed.

674
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,312
Removing the needle now.

675
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:08,018
Can you load
the pre-op ultrasound, please?

676
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:15,058
Oh, my God.

677
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,161
It's gone.

678
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:21,430
It's not gone.

679
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:24,233
It's repaired.

680
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:28,370
Dr. Bailey.

681
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:32,374
Magic.

682
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,544
Great
work, Dr. Shepherd.

683
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:52,771
Uh, I restarted
his trickle feeds.

684
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:55,741
His parents have been updated,
and they're on their way.

685
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,009
Thanks.

686
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,143
I saw Maxine...

687
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:04,549
in my head. I--

688
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:08,119
Dorian was
struggling to breathe,

689
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:11,288
and I could only see Maxine.

690
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:14,892
You met with the lawyers
this morning, didn't you?

691
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:18,729
You'll keep seeing Maxine.

692
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,898
That's just how it is.

693
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:22,399
The memorable complications,

694
00:34:22,432 --> 00:34:26,403
the ones that we think will
affect our entire careers.

695
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:29,774
They follow you whether
it's a good or bad outcome.

696
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,107
Soon, it--

697
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,045
it'll start to dull, though.

698
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:35,312
Will it go away?

699
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:36,814
No.

700
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,316
But I'm not sure we want it to.

701
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,222
Vida, it's still early,
but the procedure went well.

702
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:49,459
And so far,
your baby's doing great.

703
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:52,530
Her cardiac output is,
uh, decreasing,
and it looks promising.

704
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,866
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

705
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,935
Um. So, what now? We just wait?

706
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,203
No, we'll follow
closely with imaging.

707
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:01,806
And after you give birth,

708
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,009
we will take the baby to
the NICU, likely for a month.

709
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:07,011
-A whole month?
-We need to be extra careful.

710
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:11,015
And then we'll continue
to monitor you and the baby
for the next two years.

711
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:12,883
We'll-- We'll be in it together.

712
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,020
Gosh.

713
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:17,253
Dr. Bailey.

714
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,657
Yeah-- Uh-- Yes, I'm-I'm here.

715
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,124
Thank you.

716
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:25,128
Thank you for the clinic,
for following up with me,

717
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:27,098
for introducing
us to Dr. Robbins...

718
00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:29,432
...for everything.

719
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:32,135
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

720
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:35,606
Mmm.

721
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,841
Crisps.

722
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,109
C-3.

723
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,313
-Doug seems--
-Don't say nice
or charming, please.

724
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,116
I was gonna say spoiled.

725
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,917
Infuriating.

726
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,252
I may be projecting
my own brother issues.

727
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:51,321
Do you know how many times

728
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:53,189
I have had to bail him out?

729
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:54,992
I always hated it
when my mom would say,

730
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:58,461
"It's the big sister's job to
watch after the younger kids."

731
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:01,132
No, I mean out of jail.

732
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:04,702
Always for dumb stuff
like trespassing and vandalism.

733
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:07,571
And you know, it's the
same thing with my parents.

734
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:10,074
-Mmm.
-Something goes wrong,
call Jules.

735
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:16,212
And the dumbest part is
that I answer every time.

736
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:18,649
You know, Maxine's
more family to me than them.

737
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:20,951
And the lawyer said
that her son doesn't want me

738
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:22,553
to be her medical proxy anymore.

739
00:36:22,586 --> 00:36:24,689
You know, honestly,
he should be grateful.

740
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:28,859
If it weren't for our mistakes,
his mom could still be
on a vent or dead.

741
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:30,326
That is a terrible thing to say.

742
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,631
Well, we might all be named
in lawsuits anyway.

743
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,865
Okay, but why you?

744
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,332
You didn't even do
anything wrong that night.

745
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:38,536
This is what I keep saying.

746
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,705
Finally.

747
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,542
Are my keys back there?

748
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,745
Adams texted me
that they were at the desk.

749
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:50,447
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

750
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,284
Would you page Adams
and tell him
the chief of neuro needs a word?

751
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:58,221
Wow. You really have it out
for that intern.

752
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,590
You really sneak up on people.

753
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,759
Did he make a mistake
on one of your patients?

754
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,695
He's my nephew,
and he's crashing at my place,
and he's a slob.

755
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:07,098
Also, he has my car keys.

756
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,265
Mmm. You need a ride home?

757
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:11,702
Uh. No, thanks.

758
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,905
Well, cut him some slack.

759
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:17,240
I mean, his aunt just performed
groundbreaking surgery,

760
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:18,743
and he can't even
enter labs correctly.

761
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:21,011
-He messed up your labs?
-Hmm. Horribly.

762
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:22,613
We were all interns once.

763
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,749
Congrats on your surgery.

764
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,591
It still smells
the same in here.

765
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:38,461
You said you'd
make history, and you did.

766
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:39,530
We did.

767
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,968
Uh, look, the
interns killed a patient

768
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:47,204
by opening his chest without
an attending being in the room.

769
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:49,439
So, I sidelined them.

770
00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:53,010
They have to complete procedure
logs with all the basics

771
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:54,678
before being
allowed back in the OR.

772
00:37:54,712 --> 00:37:57,748
-They're almost finished.
-Mmm.

773
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,618
You know,
going back to the basics

774
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:02,887
won't stop them
from making mistakes.

775
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,256
They're interns.

776
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,591
-Tiny surgeons.
-Mmm.

777
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:12,596
But... you know this.

778
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,697
So I--

779
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:19,335
Okay, last month,
Ben broke his arm on duty.

780
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:21,272
-Oh. I--
-No, no, he was fine,

781
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:25,676
but he could only man the desk
or drive the trucks.

782
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:31,248
And then today,
the brace came off.

783
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:34,652
So, now he'll be right back
to the calls and--

784
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:36,687
-Danger.
-Yes.

785
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,622
- Ugh.
- Yes.

786
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:41,926
It's so hard letting them
out of our sight.

787
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:49,500
But you have to trust
in things you can't see.

788
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,970
Sometimes you just
gotta trust...

789
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,638
...that it'll be okay.

790
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,978
Yeah, that, um, isn't exactly
easy for me. It's--

791
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:02,345
Yeah, fair.

792
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:06,784
So, are you gonna
let 'em back in the OR?

793
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:09,920
-Hell no.
-Bailey.

794
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:14,058
They didn't
even appreciate the magic.

795
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:15,192
Okay.

796
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,027
-There she is.
-What?

797
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:19,196
<i>As long as you're hurting,</i>
<i>you're living. We know this.</i>

798
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,598
- Goodness.
- I missed you.

799
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:22,233
<i>Pain is an excellent teacher.</i>

800
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,300
I did it.

801
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,501
I completed my log.

802
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,170
I'm going to the OR.

803
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:28,939
I beat all you people.

804
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,541
Let me see that.

805
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:33,644
You got lucky.

806
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:35,846
Or I work hard and
I'm a good doctor,

807
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,016
unlike the rest of you, who
gravitate toward malpractice.

808
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:41,952
Are you rounding on Vida
in the morning or am I?

809
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:43,220
Whatever.

810
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,890
If you don't wanna
talk to me, fine,

811
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,491
-but can you at least be civil?
-I didn't say anything.

812
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:48,893
Okay, could you two please not?

813
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,461
I could say
the same to all of you.

814
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:59,036
Now, I gave you the opportunity
to watch medical history
be made today,

815
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:03,439
and all you care about
is which one of you
is doing what procedure,

816
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:05,475
how many or whose fault it is.

817
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,546
Everything in that OR
today happened

818
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,617
because some of
the best surgeons
put their heads together.

819
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:16,419
They communicated.
They anticipated.

820
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:20,357
You wanna get back in the OR?
You need to learn
to work together.

821
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:22,960
So, here's the new rule.

822
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:27,331
Nobody operates until every
procedure card is completed.

823
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,333
-But I just finished mine.
-Good for you.

824
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,502
You can help
your colleagues finish theirs.

825
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:35,906
Great.

826
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,141
<i>And life is full of sayings</i>

827
00:40:37,174 --> 00:40:39,209
<i>that remind us</i>
<i>of its upsides.</i>

828
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:46,884
<i>Growing pains. Labor pains.</i>

829
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:48,852
- Hey.
- Hi.

830
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:51,755
<i>Happy tears.</i>

831
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:54,091
<i>So good it hurts.</i>

832
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:56,360
I, uh-- I bought more coffee.

833
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:57,861
<i>Pain warns us.</i>

834
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:00,931
<i>It protects us.</i>

835
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:02,666
Intern year is hard.

836
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,002
I remember.

837
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,137
Yeah, really?

838
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:09,974
Did you almost flame out
in your first few months?

839
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:11,608
If I'm being honest, yes.

840
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:13,510
Did you alienate
all your friends?

841
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:15,646
Well, when I wasn't
sober. Definitely.

842
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,614
Did you have to live
in your family's shadow?

843
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:19,984
Wonder if you ever live up
to those expectations?

844
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:21,919
Your uncle Derek was a legend.

845
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,455
Well, you have no idea what it
was like working here with him.

846
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:25,723
I meant you.

847
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:29,560
Come here.

848
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:31,061
<i>And most of all,</i>

849
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:33,630
<i>pain makes us appreciate</i>
<i>life's pleasures.</i>

850
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:40,504
<i>Cherish good</i>
<i>company, good health.</i>

851
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,373
What if I'm not
cut out for this?

852
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:46,577
You'll find something else
to do, and the family legacy
dies with me.

853
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,480
But I think you'll be fine.

854
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,749
<i>Savor the moments</i>
<i>after the hurting,</i>

855
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:54,218
<i>when you're all better,</i>
<i>pain-free.</i>

856
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:55,552
You're gonna watch with me?

857
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,921
Well, you're kinda on my bed.

858
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,625
<i>At least for a while.</i>
