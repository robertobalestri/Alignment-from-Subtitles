1
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,250
Genetics. Diet. Exercise.

2
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,390
All of these factors
have shown to be

3
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:13,875
the key determinants
of longevity.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,672
Okay, kids. Off to day care.

5
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:19,605
But researchers
discovered another way

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,919
to predict our
lifespans, our zip codes.

7
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,439
- Good morning. How"s my little...
- Hi.

8
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,854
Oh. What is this?

9
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,373
Bluey. It"s educational.

10
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:29,339
Not what I meant.

11
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,445
"Property of Scout"?

12
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,895
I got a new one. And,
you know, he loves it.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,587
And we talked about
limited screen time,

14
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,898
now he has one of his own?

15
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,729
Ooh.

16
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,076
Mommy has a consult. I gotta go.

17
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,254
Hey, you"re alive. Why aren't
you answering my texts?

18
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:50,119
My meditations for A Woman
Scornedpodcast advises

19
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:52,638
waiting until you"re no
longer angry before speaking.

20
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,640
Wait. You"re mad? At me?

21
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,401
I am not a part of this.

22
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,715
Can you at least give me a hint?

23
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:59,611
I was covered in puke.

24
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:00,853
I"m gonna need a bigger hint.

25
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,373
You stuck me with
a crappy assignment

26
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,479
when Schmitt was going to
put me on an impalement.

27
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:06,963
You got in the
way of me learning

28
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,413
to become a better surgeon.

29
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:09,897
So, yeah. I am mad.

30
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,450
And I am not ready
to talk about it.

31
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,075
In some cities...

32
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,455
I assigned you to cardio today.

33
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,319
A few blocks could
increase the likelihood

34
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,907
of dying 30 years sooner.

35
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,979
Where we live,
determines how we live.

36
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:24,636
Do you have lunch plans?

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,225
I have back-to-back
meetings all day.

38
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,986
Our most important benefactor
family is coming into peds,

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,437
so I need to make an appearance.

40
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,094
I could go to that
Chinese restaurant

41
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,688
that you like and
bring something back.

42
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,821
You"re not operating today?

43
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,478
Uh, today"s an admin day.

44
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,619
You"ve had quite a
few of those lately.

45
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:43,931
Well, it"s been slow.

46
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,416
I have a lot of
administrating to do.

47
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,625
You"re married to a very
important man, you know.

48
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,628
Well, if you get bored at
a desk, I can change that.

49
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:53,941
I"m important too.

50
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:55,494
Like I could ever forget that.

51
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,946
And how we live matters more

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,016
than you might imagine.

53
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:04,503
June Sally"s chest tube has
minimal output, no air leaks.

54
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,540
She should be ready
for discharge tomorrow.

55
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,989
Home in time for her birthday.

56
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:10,853
- That"s great.
- Yep. Uh, Dr. Beltran,

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,960
I know that we don"t know
each other that well yet,

58
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,031
but I did turn in my
fellowship application.

59
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,723
Oh, was I supposed to read
over your personal statement?

60
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,173
Yes, but it"s fine.

61
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,347
I already turned it in

62
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,693
and now I"m-I'm hoping that

63
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:24,040
you"d put in a good
word for me here.

64
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:25,869
Okay, get me up to
speed. Why peds?

65
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:27,975
Doctor Webber suggested it.

66
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,321
People say I"m great with kids

67
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,152
and ped surgeons are
always in high demand,

68
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,257
so I"d be providing a
much needed service.

69
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,503
Noted. And noble.

70
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,884
So, you"ll make the call?

71
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:44,198
No, but, um, thank
you for asking.

72
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,555
Dr. Vardy to Radiology.

73
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,408
Dr. Kerry Vardy to Radiology.

74
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,136
Would you wanna study
together tonight at the house?

75
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,863
I don "t know if
that"s a good idea.

76
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,660
Good morning, everyone.

77
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,144
Here. Take one.

78
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,596
Aha. There, there.

79
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,874
Are we practicing suturing?

80
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:05,944
While blindfolded?

81
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,705
These are wellness kits.

82
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,018
As you care for your patients,

83
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,537
you need to make sure

84
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,747
that you are also taking
care of yourselves.

85
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:20,407
So we want to avoid exhaustion,
burnout, and depression.

86
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,856
Oh, I could swim in this.

87
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,720
It holds 64 ounces.

88
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,206
It is important
to stay hydrated,

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,105
along with getting quality
sleep and eating healthy.

90
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,349
Are these supposed to help
us finish our procedure logs?

91
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:34,938
It is hard to finish anything
if you are unwell, Millin.

92
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:38,252
Now, if you would
pull out the workbook.

93
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:39,771
It has recipes.

94
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,256
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Altman
is paging me.

95
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,225
If I already care about
myself, may I start my service?

96
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,711
Uh, that"s the ICU.

97
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,091
Ortho.

98
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:52,922
Oh, everybody"s...

99
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,304
Okay. Go on, go on.

100
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,652
Hey, take your bags!

101
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:04,796
Thank you.

102
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,670
Never been to this part
of the hospital before.

103
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,249
Doesn"t the prison system
have its own doctors?

104
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,906
There are some.
Not nearly enough.

105
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:14,737
Um, couldn"t they have
given this guy a TB test?

106
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,497
They may not have
the resources.

107
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,086
If it"s tuberculosis, it
spreads pretty quickly

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,605
in crowded conditions.

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,917
That"s why prisons
need to contain it

110
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,264
as quickly as possible.

111
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,413
Do we know why he"s in prison?

112
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,921
No, and it"s not important.

113
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,682
I know. Was just curious.

114
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:31,409
Before we go in, this patient
room is a little different.

115
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,927
There are limited supplies,

116
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,654
bare furniture, and
everything is strapped down.

117
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:39,417
Not only to contain
potential TB, but also...

118
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:40,866
- Anything can be a weapon.
- Right.

119
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,179
Do you have your mask?

120
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:45,802
- Ready?
- Yeah.

121
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:47,701
Thank you.

122
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,325
Hello, Mr. JimÃ©nez.

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,604
I am Dr. Altman and
this is Dr. Yasuda.

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,020
Thank you for seeing me.

125
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,850
Is it okay if I
listen to your chest?

126
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,992
Can we remove the
handcuffs please?

127
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:13,761
Okay, can you lean
forward for me?

128
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,420
Thank you. Now, try
to take a deep breath.

129
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,528
Okay, you can lie back.

130
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,357
We"re also gonna do
some blood work, okay?

131
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,396
Misty Valentine, 15,
MVC two years ago,

132
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,088
resulting in an
above-the-knee amputation.

133
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,263
- She"s experiencing discomfort...
- Try fricking agony.

134
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,577
She"s now experiencing
extreme pain

135
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:39,373
from the socket connecting her
residual limb to her prosthesis

136
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,858
which is negatively impacting
her mobility and coordination.

137
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,688
And my entire life.

138
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,241
Misty"s a long-distance
cyclist...

139
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,277
Was a long-distance cyclist.

140
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,383
Her dream was to race a century

141
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,661
for the Grand Prix
Seattle next year.

142
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,767
Impressive. A hundred miles.

143
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,389
Emphasis on "dream."

144
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,263
Amputees can be badass cyclists.

145
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,393
If anyone can do it, she can.

146
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:01,430
- Catherine.
- Shannon.

147
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,397
Anthony, so good to see you.

148
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,571
Where were we last...

149
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,711
- That resort.
- The Maldives. Yeah.

150
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:08,954
And how is my Misty girl now?

151
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,128
You ready for surgery?

152
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,727
Thank you for getting
us in here so quickly.

153
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,235
Oh, of course.

154
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,238
So, what"s the plan?

155
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:19,724
We"ll be doing a
residual limb revision,

156
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,898
which will give your
prosthesis a much better fit,

157
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,625
and it should ease your pain
and improve maneuverability.

158
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,247
Over a hundred miles?

159
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:27,708
Because right now
the thing falls off

160
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:28,871
just trying to get to class.

161
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:30,804
Not to mention the phantom pain.

162
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,633
We"ll do our best to
reduce all of that.

163
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:35,947
But you"re saying I might go
through all of this for nothing?

164
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:40,814
You work for a Fox hospital.

165
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,092
Do you know who works
for Fox hospitals?

166
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,162
Top surgeons.

167
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,543
So tell me,

168
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,166
is that surgery truly
the best you can do?

169
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,409
- It"s the standard of care.
- Standard?

170
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:54,310
In this hospital, that
family flies first class.

171
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,898
You just offered them coach.

172
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,634
That"s not how I would
describe the treatment...

173
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,659
The Valentines are not
just my dear friends.

174
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,145
They are major benefactors
to this hospital.

175
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,597
And if they decide to pull back
on their annual contribution,

176
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:08,600
guess whose salaries
I"ll be cutting it from?

177
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:11,223
Do better.

178
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,814
Wow.

179
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,264
I"ve only flown coach.

180
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,197
What the hell just happened?

181
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,717
That"s what we call the
Catherine Fox effect.

182
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:37,111
Stop. Mom, I"m
fine. Just back off.

183
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,389
Dorian. How are we
doing this morning?

184
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,219
Dr. Webber, will
you please tell him

185
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,048
he can"t have a cheeseburger?

186
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:45,164
I haven"t had real food the
entire time I"ve been here.

187
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,614
I"m afraid it's gonna
be a little longer.

188
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:47,950
Ow.

189
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,548
This is why you need
to let us help you.

190
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,747
- You"re weak.
- Because I can"t eat real food.

191
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:54,612
- Can you stop?
- I got it.

192
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,890
How much longer before you
guys let me out of here?

193
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,409
We"re not ready to talk about
discharging you quite yet.

194
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:02,136
- Adams?
- Your hemoglobin was low this morning.

195
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,035
What does that mean?
Should we be worried?

196
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,037
Anemia can be caused
by a number of factors.

197
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,142
First, Dr. Adams is
gonna run some tests

198
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,144
to confirm that it"s
not a lab error.

199
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,561
- No. No more tests.
- Dorian...

200
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,804
People come in every 20
minutes. I can"t sleep.

201
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,842
I can"t eat, I can't think
because all I hear are monitors.

202
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,395
I"m done.

203
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,502
No more needles, no more
tests, no more medicine.

204
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,986
I wanna go home.

205
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,264
- We just need to take some blood so we...
- No.

206
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,197
You"re not touching me. Get out.

207
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,406
- Well, he doesn"t mean...
- Out!

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,994
Now.

209
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,065
Let"s, uh... Let"s give
him some space, yeah?

210
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,106
Please don"t give up on him.

211
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,591
He"s just been through a lot.

212
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,765
- Oh, we understand.
- What about the hemoglobin?

213
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,111
I"ll keep an eye on it.

214
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,182
- You need to take a break too.
- Yeah.

215
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,598
You go home.

216
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,737
If anything changes...

217
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:51,771
- We"ll call you.
- Yeah.

218
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,951
Let"s do some repeat labs.

219
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,609
If he doesn"t let you, just come
back every hour and try again.

220
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:03,543
- You think it"s dilutional?
- I hope so. If it"s not,

221
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,683
we"re losing time diagnosing
what else it could be.

222
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,236
After all he"s been through,

223
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,869
you"d think a blood
draw would be nothin".

224
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:11,205
He"s feeling a loss of control.

225
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,276
It happens with
long-term ICU patients.

226
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,245
- How long does it usually last?
- Everyone"s different.

227
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,626
All we can do is be patient.

228
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,043
You fill up that water bottle.

229
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,734
Thank you.

230
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,874
- Who else?
- What"s this?

231
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,222
Ah. A wellness kit that
I painstakingly assembled

232
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,086
on my kitchen floor
at 2:00 in the morning

233
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,054
for our ungrateful interns.

234
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,988
You know who cared about my
wellness when I was an intern?

235
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:37,266
- Um...
- Nobody.

236
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,620
It"s hard to prioritize wellness

237
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,234
when you"re working
80-hour weeks.

238
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,065
That"s what the bags are for.

239
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,929
- Look.
- You... You want me to...

240
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,518
Mmm.

241
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,831
Thank you.

242
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:52,937
That so hard?

243
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,221
- You talked to Bailey about me.
- No, I didn"t.

244
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:05,259
You told Bailey what I said
on the roof that night,

245
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:08,331
and now we"re getting lectured
on step counts and meditation.

246
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,539
I wouldn"t do that.

247
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,196
Not without talking
to you first.

248
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,967
Please. You"re desperate
to get in good with Bailey.

249
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,337
Like you aren"t?

250
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:17,030
If you"re gonna be
a snitch, own it.

251
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,378
Dr. Sellers, 4619.

252
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,104
Dr. Monty Sellers, 4619.

253
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,623
I think I"ve got a solution.

254
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,979
Tell me it"s picking
up a custom prosthetic

255
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:26,626
- from the Maldives.
- Is that a thing?

256
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,628
No, I just haven"t had a
vacation in three years.

257
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,457
- What"s your idea?
- Osseointegration.

258
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,665
You want to implant a
titanium rod into her bone?

259
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,806
It"ll attach directly
to the prosthesis,

260
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,290
which can reduce pain
and increase mobility.

261
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:40,018
Schmitt, can you tell me why
this is not a great option?

262
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,193
It"s, uh, not going
to the Maldives?

263
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,988
How many have you done?
Or have you done any?

264
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,586
- I know it"s fairly new.
- Two.

265
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,370
I"m one of four surgeons
trained to do it.

266
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:48,682
How many of those were on kids?

267
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:51,858
Kids grow.

268
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,307
That means more operations

269
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:54,895
to adjust it over time.

270
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,795
But Misty"s 15. She"s
an adult skeletal-wise,

271
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,911
and this is the first surgery
I would have offered her

272
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,695
if she was over 21.

273
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,663
I"m trying to give
her what she wants.

274
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,803
What she wants or
what Dr. Fox wants?

275
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,046
But you said it, she"s
15. She"s still a kid.

276
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,230
Just because she
wants something,

277
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,600
doesn"t mean she should have it.

278
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,395
Yeah. What a concept.

279
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,856
Look, I"m not saying
that this surgery

280
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,709
isn"t ever a viable option.

281
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,090
I"m saying we
should tell Dr. Fox

282
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:18,850
that Misty needs
to wait a while.

283
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,932
- Good luck with that.
- Okay, what"s happening?

284
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,026
It"s not you.

285
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,165
I let our kid play with

286
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,684
a tablet this morning.

287
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,385
To be clear, he gave our
three-year-old a tablet

288
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,445
with his name on it,

289
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,205
despite many conversations

290
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,897
about screens and
brain development.

291
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,761
Saying "no" is not his forte.

292
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,935
Do you want some privacy?

293
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,040
No.

294
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,355
Look, I"ve spent years working
with professional athletes,

295
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,885
most of them don"t have
half of the passion.

296
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,117
Misty has for cycling.

297
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,705
She has her whole
life ahead of her.

298
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,613
How are we gonna tell her
to give up on her dream

299
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,812
if there"s a chance
we can keep it alive?

300
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,575
Fine. If Misty"s okay with it

301
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,690
and her parents are okay
with it, then I"m on board.

302
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,028
Wait, no caveats,

303
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:01,030
no threats if
anything goes wrong?

304
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,480
I"m thinking it,
but it looks like

305
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,965
you have enough arguing
in your life already.

306
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,796
Is it tuberculosis?

307
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,566
We"re still waiting
on your blood work,

308
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,938
but in the meantime, we"re
gonna take a chest X-ray.

309
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,872
- Okay.
- So you"ve had this cough for about a year now?

310
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,598
More or less. It"s hard
to keep track of time.

311
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,497
Any other symptoms, any pain?

312
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,258
I"ve had, uh, back
pain for a while now.

313
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,951
And lately my stomach
has been hurting.

314
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,160
Okay. Can you please put
your arms up over your head?

315
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,678
Great. Thank you.

316
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:29,783
Any weight loss?

317
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:32,061
Yes. I just traded in my pants

318
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:33,787
for a smaller size.

319
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,341
- All right.
- Mr. JimÃ©nez, take a deep breath.

320
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,516
Hold.

321
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,494
Okay. You can breathe normally.

322
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:44,142
Okay, TB usually appears
as a small cavitary lesion.

323
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,111
Is that...

324
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,846
All right, we need to get him
up to CT as soon as possible.

325
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,841
This is definitely not TB.

326
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:03,783
Can I come in?

327
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,131
I really need to send
over another lab.

328
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,443
I"ll just use your
A-line. No needle.

329
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,307
- Are you gonna let me leave?
- Nope.

330
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,377
- Eat food?
- No.

331
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,793
Then, no, you can"t come in.

332
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:17,831
All right, you"re a smart guy.

333
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,833
You know it"s not a good
idea to refuse care.

334
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:22,836
I was shot because I
had $40,000 in my pants.

335
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,355
Not all my ideas are good.

336
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,943
Low hemoglobin could be nothing,

337
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,668
but it could also
be a serious issue

338
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:28,943
that needs immediate treatment.

339
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,465
I"ll take those odds.

340
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,995
- Dorian, it"s not about...
- You don"t get it.

341
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,642
This place is fun for you.

342
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:38,231
You get to cut people
open and save lives

343
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:40,129
and whatever the hell else.

344
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:42,211
I"m not sure that "fun" would be
the most accurate description.

345
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,651
I can"t even go to the
bathroom on my own.

346
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,239
You wanna swap nightmares?

347
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,242
I need a break.

348
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:52,383
If you can"t understand that,
could you at least respect it?

349
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,699
I"ll come back in an hour.

350
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:07,225
We"d implant a titanium
rod in Misty"s femur,

351
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,158
and place an abutment
that attaches

352
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:11,540
directly to the prosthesis.

353
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,612
Less pressure, pain and chafing.

354
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,510
And no falling off
on your way to class.

355
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,236
And because it attaches
to bone and muscle,

356
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,066
it"ll grow stronger with use,

357
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,412
which increases mobility.

358
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:23,932
This sounds complicated.

359
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,934
Have you done a lot of these?

360
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:31,422
It"s a relatively new technique.
I"ve done two, both on adults.

361
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:32,906
Obviously it"s more involved.

362
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,597
But given Misty"s
age and height,

363
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,461
I think it"s a viable option.

364
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:38,843
I don"t know.

365
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,570
What do you think?

366
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,883
I think, um...

367
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,748
- I think this sucks.
- Dr. Beltran...

368
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,405
No, I think it blows.

369
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,579
You"re 15.

370
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:51,718
You should be deciding

371
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:52,902
what to do over spring break,

372
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,755
or whether to join drama club

373
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,447
or who"s extra.

374
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,312
Do kids even say that
anymore? Probably not.

375
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:01,555
You shouldn"t have to
be picking which surgery

376
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,281
is gonna make you
more comfortable

377
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,627
as you walk to class.

378
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:07,458
So, yeah, I think the
whole thing sucks.

379
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,911
It does suck.

380
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,740
So much.

381
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,017
I just wanna go back.

382
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,228
I want to walk
and jump and dance

383
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:22,335
and ride without all the pain.

384
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,890
If this surgery will do that,
even if it"s just a chance.

385
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:32,138
I think we have our answer.

386
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,659
Just try and take deep breaths.

387
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,837
Easy for you. I feel trapped.

388
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,977
This coming from a guy
who"s been locked up

389
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,979
for more than 40 years.

390
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,914
Uh, that was
supposed to be funny.

391
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:56,576
So sorry.

392
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:01,512
Oh, things have really changed.

393
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,100
Know what a pay phone is?

394
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:06,827
Uh, I think I saw one in
an old-timey movie once.

395
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,001
Ouch.

396
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:10,279
You make a guy feel old.

397
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,972
When you"re in prison, you stop.

398
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,181
The whole world
just keeps going.

399
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:18,632
I wonder if Seattle
Unified still serves

400
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,876
lemon-berry coffee cake.

401
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,705
That"s what you think about?

402
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,224
School cafeteria food.

403
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,470
Best part of school: Free food.

404
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,163
And Mrs. Samba who... who
would smile at me every morning

405
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,958
when she handed it to me.

406
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,723
Hey, I"m good at reading people,

407
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,070
and I saw your face

408
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:45,073
when you looked at my X-ray.

409
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,903
How bad is it?

410
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,252
Let"s look at your CT.

411
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,812
We"re gonna start the scan
now. Please try to hold still.

412
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:04,367
Hey, thanks for coming by.

413
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,196
I could use a second
set of eyes on this.

414
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:07,854
Happy to help. Is
this his X-ray?

415
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:10,719
He came in to rule out TB,
and then we found that mass.

416
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:12,583
It"s big, but I think
I can resect it.

417
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:15,044
It"d be a hell of a surgery on
your first day back in the OR.

418
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,310
Scan"s coming in.

419
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,521
Oh, my God. Is...

420
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,213
Are those mets on his liver?

421
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,594
Yeah, and his spine.

422
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,630
His pelvis, his adrenal glands.

423
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:29,220
He has an 8 cm lesion
on the left upper lobe,

424
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,050
and two others on the
right middle lobe.

425
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,706
Looks like multiple
positive nodes.

426
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,432
Right. Yasuda, get
us on the schedule

427
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,263
for an image guided biopsy ASAP.

428
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:38,850
Welcome back.

429
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,406
Can you confirm that home
health is set for Ms. Land

430
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,235
- in room 4877?
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,479
You okay?

432
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,422
I"d be better if this
conversation was over.

433
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,217
I think you wish I"d
said something to Bailey

434
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,725
and you"re mad I didn't.

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,117
I think you missed your
calling as a detective.

436
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,601
Okay, if you don"t
wanna be real, fine,

437
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,592
but don"t take whatever
this is out on me.

438
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,629
I don"t deserve it.

439
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:00,838
You want real?

440
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,635
I eat chips from the
vending machine for lunch

441
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,258
because I am too busy
to go to the cafeteria.

442
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:09,122
Haven"t had a full
night"s sleep in months

443
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,676
because my upstairs neighbors
blast house music till 3:00 a.m.

444
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:13,471
And I don"t remember
the last time

445
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,473
I had a vegetable or
drank enough water.

446
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,752
But it is not because I am
having a mental breakdown.

447
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:20,685
It "s because I"m a
first-year resident.

448
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,515
What flavor chips?

449
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:24,793
Sea salt and vinegar.

450
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,106
Sometimes sour cream and onion.

451
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,314
Correct answer is barbecue.

452
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,698
You"re right. Lecturing
us on wellness is useless.

453
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,114
If Bailey wants
us to feel better,

454
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,667
she should give us raises.

455
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,186
And reduce our hours.

456
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,533
That is the first thing
we agreed on all day.

457
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,568
Go home.

458
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,468
- Dr. Bailey...
- You wanna disrespect me

459
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:45,607
and this program,

460
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,091
do it somewhere else.

461
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,680
Now!

462
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,350
The pathologist said
their prelim read

463
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:07,284
on the biopsy tissue
is adenocarcinoma.

464
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,733
It"s cancer?

465
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:10,194
Well, we have to wait
for the final pathology,

466
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,357
but yes.

467
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,979
I mean, there are lesions

468
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:14,922
throughout his body. It"s
definitely inoperable.

469
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,707
Okay, so, chemo.

470
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:20,573
It depends on those results.

471
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,678
There is a lot of red tape.

472
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:23,931
It"s a little out of our hands,

473
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,312
but we will definitely
give him meds

474
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:26,382
for the pain and his cough.

475
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,590
And hopefully there are people

476
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,098
at the facility
that can help too.

477
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,032
Wait. So we"re sending
him back to prison?

478
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,838
- That"s how it works.
- But he"s sick.

479
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,105
He was getting sicker and
sicker for over a year

480
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,107
and they didn"t even
give him screening tests.

481
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,558
If we send him back
now, he"s just gonna...

482
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,043
It"s a valid point.

483
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,631
We will talk him
through his options.

484
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,771
Dr. Altman...

485
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,739
We can at least talk to him.

486
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,092
Your three minutes
are almost up.

487
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,921
You"re making me nervous.

488
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,554
You have half that
time on the real test.

489
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,614
Okay.

490
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,236
Bleeding after cardiac surgery,

491
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,755
TEG with prolonged K-time.

492
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:06,343
Give cryo.

493
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,758
Correct.

494
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,140
How pissed do we
think Bailey is?

495
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:13,695
She"s not happy. That's why we
can"t slow down on ABSITE prep.

496
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,075
You"re right.

497
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,216
- Give me the timer.
- I don"t need it.

498
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,159
- You think you"re that fast?
- I know 3 minutes.

499
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,057
The time I no longer have
to make a soft-boiled egg.

500
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,428
You cook soft-boiled eggs?

501
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,361
Yeah. They"re good
in salads and ramen.

502
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,914
Mmm. You"re making me hungry.

503
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,296
Oof. It is way past lunchtime.

504
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,883
Should we order pizza?

505
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:31,920
After Bailey"s wellness lecture?

506
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,302
We have frozen peas,
expired yogurt,

507
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,994
and I could maybe dig
up some stale pretzels.

508
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,167
Buried in the cabinets?

509
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,479
More like the couch.

510
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,791
So, pizza?

511
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,518
Or

512
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:46,245
Whatever"s in these bags.

513
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:56,565
Dr. Webber still needs
those labs on you.

514
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,498
Is there a burger
inside that lab coat?

515
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,674
I"ll just...
...update your chart.

516
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,296
You are in grad school?

517
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,333
- I was.
- You"re not going back?

518
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,957
Engineering was my
parents" dream. Not mine.

519
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,339
Yeah. My parents always
wanted me to be a doctor.

520
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,582
Congrats on not being
a disappointment.

521
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,584
No, I mean, that
was always a reason

522
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,311
for me not to go
into med school.

523
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,451
Yeah. I don"t really
get along with them.

524
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:22,281
Junior year in college,

525
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,318
I got into a car accident on my
way home from soccer practice.

526
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,424
Internal bleeding, broken bones.

527
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,978
The surgeons on call
that night saved my life.

528
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,740
After that I changed my mind.

529
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:36,640
I"ve never felt that
way about anything.

530
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:39,332
I don"t know. You seem pretty
passionate about cheeseburgers.

531
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,817
Dorian!

532
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,199
I need a crash cart
in here and blood!

533
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,201
- Page Dr. Webber!
- Right away.

534
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:48,790
Come on. Come on. Dorian,
I got you. It"s okay.

535
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,861
It"s okay. Just hold
on, just hold on.

536
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,010
Implant is in position.

537
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,384
Now we carefully screw
it into the bone.

538
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,351
Schmitt, wanna do the honors?

539
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,732
Absolutely. Yes.

540
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:01,492
Wait, this is the
only the third time

541
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,081
you"ve done this and you"re
letting a resident do it?

542
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,185
He"s got it.

543
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,199
You"re gonna have to screw it

544
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:09,880
with a little more
force than that.

545
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,572
Mmm. There you go.

546
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,921
- Okay.
- Okay. Great. Fluoro.

547
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,722
- Damn it.
- It"s in position, right?

548
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,379
No, it"s not fitting perfectly,

549
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,770
especially if we want
her to ride again.

550
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:29,278
What do you mean?

551
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:30,739
We"re gonna have to
take the implant out.

552
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,661
And then what? How did
you not anticipate this?

553
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,216
You can "t know until
you" re doing it.

554
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:36,044
You have to feel
the bone quality.

555
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:38,194
A CT won"t show you that. We
have to take more of the bone.

556
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:39,368
We"ll need her parents' consent.

557
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,083
So we"re gonna tell her parents

558
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,707
that your plan is gonna cost
their daughter more of her leg?

559
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:46,813
Stay here. It was my idea.
I"ll get their consent.

560
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,930
I can"t wait to see

561
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,577
the Catherine Fox
effect on that.

562
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,061
Let"s just keep this dry.

563
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,722
You want to take
more of her femur?

564
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,862
If that doesn"t work, then what?

565
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,416
Maybe we should have stuck
with the original plan.

566
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:04,773
We"re pretty close
to making thi...

567
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,695
I"m sure Dr. Lincoln can revert

568
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,560
to the old plan if
that"s what you want.

569
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,838
We can do that.

570
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,910
Um, and Misty will
probably feel fine

571
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,567
for a few months.

572
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:19,467
Then her residual limb
will begin to chafe,

573
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,640
her pain will increase.

574
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:21,986
She"ll push through because

575
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,954
that"s what competitive
cyclists do.

576
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:25,276
She might not tell
you right away

577
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,750
because that"s
what teenagers do,

578
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:28,624
which means she could
damage her leg even more.

579
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,308
Look, I know that this is
not exactly what you want,

580
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:34,930
and I know it"s tough,

581
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,934
but I really do believe the
outcome will be worth it.

582
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,600
Let"s do it.

583
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,787
What happened?

584
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,330
He was fine. We were talking,

585
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:57,366
and then all of a sudden
he started vomiting blood.

586
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:00,853
BP"s tanking. Systolic's
in the 80s. Sats, 70s.

587
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,511
I gave him 80 mg
of pantoprazole.

588
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,891
Blood is running.

589
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,135
Next two units are on their way.

590
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,768
Maxed out his oxygen.

591
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,138
His sats aren"t responding.

592
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,002
Dr. Webber. I"ve
been waiting for you

593
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,210
to get here to intubate.

594
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:14,832
Dr. Webber!

595
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,629
I"ll take it from
here, Adams. Good work.

596
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:20,459
I need to stop the bleeding.

597
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,046
Call us an endo tower.

598
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,496
Here"s a laryngoscope.

599
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,153
Have the tube ready for me.

600
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:37,337
Did you go to culinary
school or something?

601
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,132
I"m a surgeon, I like cutting.

602
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,756
Me too, but not vegetables.

603
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,172
Yeah, I spent a lot of years

604
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:46,554
watching my mom turn
whatever was in our fridge

605
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:48,107
into something delicious.

606
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,005
Hmm.

607
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,767
- What do you need?
- Tongs, spatula, or... Ooh.

608
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:54,665
This works.

609
00:24:56,771 --> 00:25:00,084
So, the key to stir-fry is
getting the pan really hot,

610
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,406
and keeping the
vegetables moving

611
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,087
so they don"t steam
and get soggy.

612
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:04,744
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you have any soy sauce?

613
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,332
Mmm.

614
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,403
Maybe from takeout
the other night.

615
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,922
What else does your mom cook?

616
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:11,510
Oh, chicken soup.

617
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,683
- Lasagna.
- Mmm.

618
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:14,927
Jook, which is a rice porridge.

619
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,722
Mmm. She give lessons?

620
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:17,930
She died.

621
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,104
Sorry.

622
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,038
No, uh, it "s okay.
It"s been a while.

623
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:24,626
Mine died when I was born. So...

624
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,560
No cooking lessons.

625
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,425
Here.

626
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,392
Come on.

627
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:33,773
Just, like, keep it all moving.

628
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,883
Hey, Bailey. Any of
those extra vegetables

629
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,747
from the wellness
seminar up for grabs?

630
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,852
We were too busy to go
grocery shopping this week.

631
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:46,199
And as a department head,
I feel entitled to...

632
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:49,409
- Be my guest.
- Are you sure? I don"t have to...

633
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:51,101
Owen, do you know
how tired I am?

634
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,552
I mean, I... I have three jobs.

635
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,139
I run a clinic.

636
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:57,590
I"m residency director,
a full time surgeon, and,

637
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,419
and I"m a mom.

638
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:01,421
Actually, that"s four jobs.

639
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:04,770
I"m lucky if I get five
hours of sleep a night,

640
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:09,498
and I took time out of my
busy, sleep-deprived life

641
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,571
to do something about the
well-being of our interns

642
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,575
so they don"t end up stressed
and run down or burnt out.

643
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:21,959
Because I am a damn good teacher
and I care about these people.

644
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:25,342
And what do I get in return?
Just blatant disrespect.

645
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:29,104
You know, sounds like you could
use a little wellness yourself.

646
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,141
Excuse me?

647
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,970
When was the last time
you took a day off?

648
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:36,629
I mean, four jobs, five-hours
sleep. You might need a break.

649
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:39,114
Listen, you want to give
the interns permission

650
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:40,426
to take time for themselves?

651
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,566
Maybe you need to
take your own advice.

652
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:50,263
There was this guy in my cell
block that had colon cancer,

653
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:55,544
and by the time that he got
diagnosed, he went pretty quick.

654
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,133
It"s just like that.

655
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:00,446
- So, um...
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,656
When you have this many mets,
it affects a lot of your organs.

657
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:06,383
We don"t know how long you have,

658
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,386
but it explains why you"ve
been feeling so awful.

659
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,457
Is there, like, any chance

660
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:16,980
that this could just...
magically stop spreading?

661
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:20,362
No, but there are treatments
that we could consider.

662
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:22,779
- That could fix me?
- It may give you more time.

663
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,056
But I"ll be honest with you,

664
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,023
in your case, your
circumstances,

665
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:28,370
it may cause you
more pain than good.

666
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:31,788
- How long?
- Uh...

667
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:33,755
It"s hard to say. Some
people live months.

668
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,172
Forget it.

669
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:38,277
No treatment.

670
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:44,593
I spent a lot of nights
struggling to breathe.

671
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:47,596
Begging for someone
to listen to me.

672
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:49,875
It won"t change.

673
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,672
I was 17 when I got locked up.

674
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:58,228
Tough... Tough as
nails on the outside...

675
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,715
scared on the inside.

676
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:07,030
I would lie awake at night

677
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:11,103
praying that I
wouldn"t get stabbed

678
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,139
or beat to death.

679
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,903
I never thought
I"d go like this.

680
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:21,320
I wish it wasn"t this
way. I am so sorry.

681
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:25,600
I am too.

682
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:30,570
The implant is almost
in. Let"s try this again.

683
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:31,640
Schmitt.

684
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:34,643
Okay.

685
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:38,440
Clockwise rotation
until I feel resistance.

686
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,858
Almost there.

687
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,791
Okay. That... That feels good.

688
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,794
Okay. Moment of truth. Fluoro.

689
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:55,457
- Oh, thank God.
- It worked.

690
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:57,839
Yeah, see the implant is
just hitting the isthmus.

691
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,635
- It feels rock solid.
- Yeah.

692
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,326
- Nice work, Schmitt.
- Thanks.

693
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,743
Okay. Let"s look for
the sciatic nerve.

694
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,697
Time for targeted
muscle reinnervation.

695
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,129
Hey, are you almost done

696
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,724
with Mr. JimÃ©nez"s
discharge paperwork?

697
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,790
Yasuda, the prison
transport is on their way.

698
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,792
What about enrolling
him in a clinical trial?

699
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,657
- Yasuda.
- I found one at the University of Chicago.

700
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,177
Uses immunotherapy and
stereotactic radiotherapy

701
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,488
for stage 4 lung cancer.

702
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:28,767
- He doesn"t want treatment.
- And...

703
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,286
You know, just because
the system failed him

704
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,805
doesn"t mean that we should too.

705
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,634
There has to be
something else we can do.

706
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:38,397
His punishment was supposed
to be time, not... not death.

707
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,019
Listen to me.

708
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:41,814
I know it is frustrating.

709
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,816
The suffering, the
neglect, the pain.

710
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,094
And knowing that it
might have been prevented

711
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,544
with earlier intervention

712
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,166
just makes it so much worse.

713
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:51,513
But you know what
else is frustrating?

714
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,034
Lying in bed alone
and feeling like

715
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:56,829
feeling like you
have no control.

716
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,520
That no one is hearing you.

717
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:03,525
We can"t even begin to imagine
what he"s been through.

718
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,633
We can"t imagine what any of
our patients have been through.

719
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,739
So we have to trust that they
know their lives better than us.

720
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:14,019
I wish that people had listened
to him when he first got sick.

721
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:17,643
I wish that I could turn back
time and diagnose him earlier.

722
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,888
But right now, the best way
that we can take care of him

723
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:23,718
is to try to alleviate
any suffering that we can.

724
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,066
I"ll finish the
discharge papers.

725
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,516
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

726
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:30,725
- And, Yasuda.
- Yeah?

727
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,761
It"s good that you care.

728
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:34,073
Not enough people do.

729
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:38,978
What are we looking for?

730
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,873
I won"t know until we find it.

731
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:45,222
Ah. There it is. It"s an
upper GI bleed from an ulcer.

732
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,637
Let"s inject epi.

733
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:48,881
This is likely a stress ulcer

734
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,745
which can cause focal
damage to the mucosa

735
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:52,264
and have high risk of bleeding.

736
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,645
- Ah. Still bleeding.
- Come on.

737
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,303
- Let"s clip it.
- Okay.

738
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,375
Come on, Dorian.

739
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,861
- All right. Let"s hurry.
- Okay.

740
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,452
Clip it.

741
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,559
There. Got it.

742
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,009
Amazing.

743
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,355
Good job, everyone.

744
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,046
Oh. You did that
like it was nothing.

745
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,565
I"ve been clipping
upper GI bleeds

746
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,773
since before you were born.

747
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,395
You"ll get there.

748
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,225
Let"s get repeat labs.

749
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,041
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

750
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:46,628
Which of the
following is not true

751
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,907
of preoperative selective
portal vein embolization?

752
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,049
B.

753
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,982
B as in "boy" or D as in "dog"?

754
00:31:56,535 --> 00:32:00,919
"B" as in Bailey"s wellness
plan kind of worked.

755
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:01,954
I feel better.

756
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:03,852
Correct on both accounts.

757
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:05,993
Unless she fires us for
being disrespectful.

758
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:12,516
I"m okay. I just
want you to know

759
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,967
med school was a
rough time in my life,

760
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,211
but I worked through it.

761
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:19,282
I"m good.

762
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,180
Really.

763
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:23,700
Okay.

764
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,460
- Done?
- Mmm.

765
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,712
But if you did have to
drop out of medicine,

766
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,852
I think you have a career
in the restaurant business.

767
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:40,579
Well, I will settle
for a full kitchen.

768
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,823
You and Yasuda need
some real knives.

769
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:45,722
And you want us to
do what with them?

770
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:49,691
I wash, you dry.

771
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:56,560
You had to take more of my leg?

772
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,873
I-I don"t understand.

773
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,910
We did. Um, in order for
the technique to work,

774
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:03,843
the implant has
to fit perfectly.

775
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,362
Now it does.

776
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,064
So, does that mean I"ll
be able to ride again?

777
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:08,503
We are confident that you will.

778
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:10,471
I never thought this
would be possible.

779
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,748
And now that it is,

780
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,337
I... I don"t even
know what to say.

781
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:17,305
Catherine, these surgeons
have outdone themselves.

782
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,480
I"d expect nothing less.

783
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:22,345
When I race my first century
ride, will you all come?

784
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,701
- I"d love to.
- Of course.

785
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:25,013
I"ll make T-shirts.

786
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,832
- Deal.
- Okay. We"ll come back

787
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,352
- and check on you later, all right?
- Thank you all again.

788
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,399
And whatever we can do to
support your work in the future,

789
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,183
don"t hesitate to ask.

790
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:35,161
You know I won"t. Now,
enough of this shop talk.

791
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,670
- We got a lot to celebrate.
- Yeah.

792
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:42,779
- Millin, follow up on her post-op labs.
- Yeah, got it.

793
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,092
Yeah, I guess it really
does pay to be rich.

794
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,921
- Nice work, everyone.
- Hmm.

795
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:49,579
Schmitt, you really stepped up.

796
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:52,596
Can I just... Thank you.

797
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,103
Thank you.

798
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,109
Do you have a problem with me?

799
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,456
- I"m sorry? What?
- I did step up today.

800
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,217
My bedside manner was excellent.

801
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,288
I successfully placed
Misty"s implant.

802
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:11,290
Dr. Lincoln said I did a
good job. Why can"t you?

803
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,601
Why does it matter?

804
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,121
I wanna be a peds surgeon.

805
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,088
Okay. Well, if you
need my validation

806
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,469
or anyone"s validation to
feel like you did a good job,

807
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,472
then peds is not the
right specialty for you.

808
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:23,543
Everybody likes validation.

809
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,717
- It"s human.
- No, it"s needy.

810
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:27,996
What happens when you mess up?

811
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:29,826
What happens when
there"s a bad outcome?

812
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,483
What"s gonna sustain you then?

813
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,139
Where"s your heart?

814
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,452
Where is your passion for this?

815
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:38,731
Because that is what"s gonna
get you through the bad days.

816
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,940
You show me more of that,
and then we"ll talk.

817
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:50,018
What happened?

818
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:52,987
You had bleeding from an
ulcer in your stomach.

819
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:55,161
Dr. Webber went in with
a scope and stopped it.

820
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:01,961
I left school because
I was miserable.

821
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,963
When I thought about
being a civil engineer

822
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:06,690
for the rest of my life,
I couldn"t breathe.

823
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:09,348
I thought I"d work on
a boat for a few months

824
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:13,180
and come back
enlightened or whatever.

825
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:15,872
Instead, I got shot,
and now I"m stuck here.

826
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,046
We"ll get you out of here.

827
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,497
You just gotta
let us do our job.

828
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,775
That was pretty dumb, I guess.

829
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,156
Hey, you were tired.

830
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:25,720
I get it, you know, but
the best stuff is on

831
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,159
the other side of all this.

832
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,541
And you won"t get there

833
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:31,646
if you push away the
people who wanna help you.

834
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,062
And then can I eat?

835
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:37,169
I"ll bring the
cheeseburger myself.

836
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:40,621
âª You gotta wake it up
You"re going to the top âª

837
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,969
âª You gotta open
up The door... âª

838
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,973
âª It"s what They waited for... âª

839
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,872
We"ve notified the penitentiary
system of your condition

840
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,909
and provided
prescription refills.

841
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,393
And I sent documentation

842
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:56,326
for your compassionate
release application.

843
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:58,432
I appreciate it.

844
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,815
Wait!

845
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,679
Wait. I have something for him.

846
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,956
Let me see that.

847
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,580
Mm-hmm.

848
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,134
Here.

849
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,555
- Lemon-berry coffee cake.
- Yeah.

850
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,351
I haven"t had this
since I was a youngster.

851
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:23,560
Nurse Ashley"s son
goes to Fremont High.

852
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,252
So, she helped me out.

853
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,567
Thank you.

854
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,432
I"m really going to enjoy this.

855
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:37,850
âª You gotta open up the door âª

856
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,715
âª And when you Come back, Baby âª

857
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,131
âª It"s what they waited for âª

858
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,100
âª It"s what they waited for âª

859
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:52,313
âª It"s what they waited for âª

860
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:05,499
Dr. Webber?

861
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,227
- Thank you.
- Oh, what"s this?

862
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,159
You saved my son. Again.

863
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:13,369
Words will never be enough.

864
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,267
I"m hoping chocolate
fills the gap.

865
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,442
Oh, you didn"t need to do this.

866
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,547
Dorian"s a great kid.

867
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:22,654
With that said, I"ll never
refuse a box of chocolate.

868
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,142
Mm-hmm.

869
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:31,663
Ooh.

870
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,296
Do I need to tell that
woman to keep her hands

871
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,562
off my man?

872
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:35,943
I saved her son today.

873
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:39,257
Look at you saving
lives on your admin day.

874
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,259
Mmm. I still got it.

875
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,644
Yes, you do.

876
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:54,789
Hey.

877
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:58,345
Hey. I... I just needed to zone
out for a while. Don"t judge me.

878
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,692
Um. Well, your brain
is fully cooked.

879
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:01,969
I"m not concerned.

880
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:04,637
I heard your surgery went well.

881
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,353
Catherine was
practically dancing

882
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:07,802
through the hallways.

883
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:09,494
Thanks.

884
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,220
Are you okay?

885
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,500
I lost a NICU
patient this morning.

886
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:18,192
He had advanced
necrotizing enterocolitis.

887
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:20,643
His name was Jagger.

888
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,404
He was three months old.

889
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:25,268
And, um...

890
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,547
I swear every time I went
in to check on his belly,

891
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:33,034
he just looked at me with
these piercing blue eyes.

892
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,347
It was like he was looking
right into my soul.

893
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:36,555
I"m sorry.

894
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,870
So, you and Lincoln have a kid?

895
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,700
Yeah, he"s great... The kid.

896
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,219
The dad and I are not together.

897
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:46,703
Mmm.

898
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:49,223
Well, I will let you
get back to your game.

899
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:52,364
Or you could help
me crush some gems.

900
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,713
No matter where we live,

901
00:38:57,956 --> 00:39:00,303
we all wish for
long, healthy lives.

902
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,101
All right. So, how
does this work?

903
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:09,726
For our family, for our
loved ones, for our children.

904
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:13,040
Three, two, one.

905
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:14,628
Okay. Time to give
me the tablet.

906
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:16,871
Come on, buddy. Work with me.

907
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:20,185
Okay. We are r... Oh.

908
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:22,601
Oh, yeah. He got a hold of
it from under the stroller

909
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:24,362
before I could stop him.

910
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,744
Well, if Amelia shows up,
we"re leaving without you.

911
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,127
Okay.

912
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,725
This is gonna be hard.

913
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:34,579
- He"ll get over it.
- I meant on you.

914
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,753
But even if the odds
are in your favor,

915
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,860
predictions are only
part of the picture.

916
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,724
We live in a world where
everything can change

917
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:43,311
in the blink of an eye.

918
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,382
Hey.

919
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:46,487
Hey.

920
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,319
I"m sorry you got puked on.

921
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:53,529
If I could, I would give you
all the best assignments,

922
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:56,532
but I can"t play favorites.
I"ve got a job to do.

923
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:57,705
I don"t wanna fight.

924
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,120
Yeah, I don"t either.

925
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,227
So Adams finished
his procedure card.

926
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,367
You"re closer to getting
back into the OR.

927
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,956
It doesn"t matter.

928
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,614
Look, I... I just wanna
be alone right now.

929
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,276
Okay.

930
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,628
You could be on top of
the world one minute...

931
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,010
What is happening here?

932
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:29,772
I came home early.

933
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:31,359
Are you feeling okay?

934
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:35,881
Well, I tried to step up
the intern wellness program.

935
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:38,159
It was a huge failure.

936
00:40:38,194 --> 00:40:39,861
Yeah, I"m sure it's not
as bad as you think.

937
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:42,992
I"m not sure it
ever had a chance.

938
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,925
But the-the system
is-is designed

939
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,859
to push doctors
past their limits.

940
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:50,965
I"d say it was broken, but
I"m not sure it ever worked.

941
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,173
So you"re giving up.

942
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:54,279
I...

943
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:57,006
I am modeling for the interns.

944
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,525
Self-care and wellness.

945
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,631
I didn"t have patients
this afternoon,

946
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,668
so I decided to come home early.

947
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,222
Nice. Richard made you
come home early, didn"t he?

948
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,534
No.

949
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,328
Hunt.

950
00:41:09,363 --> 00:41:12,884
But, no, it was my idea to send
Tuck and Pru out for pizza.

951
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:14,402
- That is a good idea.
- Mmm.

952
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,716
In fact, um...

953
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,512
I could use a little
wellness myself.

954
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,514
Oh. Could you now?

955
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,998
But you never know

956
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,913
when the rug might be
pulled out from under you.

957
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,941
Anyone home?

958
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:38,288
Simone?

959
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,016
Hello?

960
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:44,743
Anyone?

961
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:48,298
When that happens, which
it inevitably will,

962
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,129
all you can do is hold on...

963
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:54,339
Hey.

964
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:55,582
You"re moving stuff?

965
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,860
Yeah, I got a lot of books,

966
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,379
and I"m thinking about
putting a shelf right here.

967
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:01,449
Oh.

968
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:04,452
You forgot this in the dresser.

969
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:11,770
And hope it won"t end you.
