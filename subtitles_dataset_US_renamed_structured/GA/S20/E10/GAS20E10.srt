Where's the fire?

00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,296
Fall City, spreading fast.

What? I meant that as
a figure of speech.

20
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,550
Well, we got paged.

It's the hospital.

34
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,500
They're asking for all
available staff to come in.

When you talked to
Catherine, did she tell you

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,677
you were no longer chief
or no longer a surgeon?

40
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,054
I don't know. I
kinda blacked out.

No, no. Get dressed.

43
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,310

I think that's the point.

49
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,696
There's an entire
cafeteria inside.

50
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,325
Well, Jason gives me
day-old pastries for free.

51
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,994
Oh, nice suit. Coming from
your career's funeral?

52
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,162
I had a video interview

53
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,663
with Chicago's program director.

54
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,789
How did it go?

55
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,624
Uh, they offered me the spot.

56
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,835
Oh. Congratulations,
Skywalker.

57
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,420
Hey, you owe me 20 bucks.

58
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,213
I bet that you'd be gone
by the end of the year.

59
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll give you 20
bucks to be gone now.

60
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,091
Did you accept it?

61
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,510
I said I'd think about it.

62
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,930
Dorian. What are
you doing here?

63
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,349
They needed my room,

64
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,850
too many patients from the fire.

65
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,226
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

66
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,519
No worries.

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,355
A bed opened at the
skilled nursing facility.

68
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,023
Oh. I'm being discharged.

69
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,399
That's great.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm hoping I won't
be here much longer.

71
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,736
Well, you've obviously
never been discharged

72
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,031
from a hospital before,
especially during a wildfire.

73
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,576
Bailey: And you've obviously
never <i>worked</i> at one in a wildfire.

74
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,746
I paged you <i>26</i> minutes ago.

75
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,040
If you're not dressed
in the next 4...

76
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,166
- Bye, Dorian.
- Oh!

77
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
See you!

78
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,755
I'll make sure and say goodbye.

79
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,388
Okay.

80
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,018
Let's push these
two laminectomies

81
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,437
and reschedule Ms.
Feuer's knee replacement.

82
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,149
So... move the whole ortho
schedule to next week.

83
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,735
Hey. Hey, I, uh,
I need some help.

84
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,404
Didn't you just finish
an overnight shift?

85
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,780
Well, tell that
to the wildfires.

86
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,073
Can I steal him?

87
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,825
Oh, I'm on ortho. Sure.

88
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,327
There are a hundred
other residents,

89
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,912
and you know how I
feel about birth.

90
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,747
And I know how you
feel about peds.

91
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,250
There are NICU transfers
coming in from Seattle Pres,

92
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,669
and Beltran needs extra help.

93
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,172
Bye. Thank you, thank you!

94
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,841
Woman over PA: <i>Charge
Nurse, call the...</i>

95
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,175
I just hope we
don't run into her.

96
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,677
Teddy. Teddy: Hey.

97
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,138
I'm so sorry. Oh, it was
my decision to fund you.

98
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,014
I'm just... I'm sorry that
your research is in jeopardy.

99
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,016
Well, we don't know it is.

100
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,643
Why wouldn't Catherine
just call you directly?

101
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,186
Oh, she knows once
I heard about Teddy,

102
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,479
I would jump right on a plane.

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,231
It's a pretty good power move.

104
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,653
Also a good power move.

105
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,822
I would think that Catherine
would have security

106
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,490
tackling us by now.

107
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,035
If I have access
to this building,

108
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,662
then that means there's
room to negotiate.

109
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,539
With what leverage?

110
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,957
Our research.

111
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,459
No matter what she thinks of us,

112
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,793
she will not stand in the way

113
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,545
of scientific progress.

114
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,672
Okay. So what are
you suggesting?

115
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,466
We present yesterday's findings.

116
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,342
The work speaks for itself.

117
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,053
She cannot deny that
with a power move.

118
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,263
When you have all the power,

119
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,182
I think it's just called a move.

120
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,184
Well, we have moves, too.

121
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,228
Taryn: Every resident came
in except Bradley and Kaneko.

122
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,563
They were evacuating
their apartments,

123
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,939
but they'll be
back when they can.

124
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,107
Oh, they're excused.

125
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,193
Uh...

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,694
Well, spit it out, Griffith.

127
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,404
I think Adams is gonna leave.

128
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,615
Oh, uh. Dr. Fox hasn't
decided that yet.

129
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,159
He got offered a
second-year spot in Chicago.

130
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,535
Woman over PA: <i>Any
available orderlies...</i>

131
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,953
Good for him. You
don't want him to stay?

132
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,039
It's not up to me or you.

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,832
Owen: Alright.
Listen up, everyone.

134
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,417
As of this morning,

135
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,586
Grey-Sloan is the only
level 1 trauma center

136
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,838
operating in the Seattle region.

137
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,799
Now, these fires are not
easy to extinguish...

138
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,091
and this wind is not letting up.

139
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,178
This could go on for
some time, maybe days.

140
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,764
If any of you need
help, ask for it.

141
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,099
Okay? Let's get to work.

142
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,393
Oh, Link, we have a helicopter

143
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,770
coming in with an
injured firefighter

144
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,813
with an open fracture.
A firefighter?

145
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,191
Oh, it's, uh, it's Theo
Ruiz, and Ben's with him.

146
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,151
Uh, Theo's family.
I'm coming, too.

147
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,698
Winston: I'm so
sorry, Garrett.

148
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,033
The operating rooms
are being held

149
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,327
for wildfire victims
and trauma patients.

150
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,204
But we're working on
getting your Triple-A repair

151
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,580
rescheduled as soon as possible.

152
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,873
Yeah. I get it.

153
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,667
I was at Woodstock '99,

154
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,169
so I know what
disaster looks like.

155
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,255
How high do you
think the AQI is?

156
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,216
Richard: Well, we can get you a
KN95 mask for your drive home.

157
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,634
Oh, I'm not worried about me.

158
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,636
It's that vinyl is
sensitive to, uh, changes

159
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,972
in temperature and
moisture and air quality.

160
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,598
Garrett manages Both Sides Now.

161
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,600
I love listening
to records there...

162
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,018
and occasionally buying one.

163
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,603
Cool.

164
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,481
Well, I'll stop by on my way
home and check on things.

165
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,941
I just hope traffic's
not too bad.

166
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,651
Apologies, I'm being paged.

167
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,902
But I will call you later

168
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,945
once we have you
back on the schedule.

169
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,030
Alright, cool. Alright.

170
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,865
Uh, your... your shop...

171
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,201
You got any Coltrane?

172
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,871
John or Alice? I got both.

173
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,125
Garrett, you feeling pain?

174
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,711
Some cramping in my
stomach and back,

175
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,254
but it's not that bad.

176
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,840
You have an abdominal
aortic aneurysm.

177
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,300
Change back into your gown.

178
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,926
Let's get some scans
just to be safe.

179
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,262
Hm. Alright.

180
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,976
Alright, Ben, what do we got?

181
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,644
Theo Ruiz, 37-year-old male,

182
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,146
crushed by a large tree branch.

183
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,440
Abdominal crush injury,
unstable pelvis,

184
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,275
femoral fracture with
tourniquet placed in the field.

185
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,193
BP dropped and we
intubated him en route.

186
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,654
Systolics now holding around
110 after 3 liters of NS.

187
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,115
Let's get him inside.

188
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,076
How is it out there?

189
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,037
We'll be lucky if this is the
worst that we bring in today.

190
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,012
Where's Beltran?

191
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,348
Can I give you some advice?

192
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,058
How is <i>that</i> answering
my question?

193
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,768
Beltran is a kick-ass surgeon.

194
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,853
She doesn't have time to
play 20 questions with you.

195
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,563
You need to chill
out around her.

196
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,066
You think I ask
too many questions?

197
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,651
I am showing interest.

198
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,528
You are sucking up to
get the peds fellowship.

199
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,405
Every candidate
has an advantage.

200
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,782
I think mine are my

201
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,950
pre-existing relationships
here at Grey-Sloan.

202
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,994
Schmitt, we've got seven
transfer patients on the way up.

203
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,371
Can you help with intake?

204
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,665
Yeah. Oh, one had a
biliary atresia repair.

205
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,708
I was just reading about
the Kasai procedure.

206
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,543
Have you ever done one of
those? Yes, I've done three.

207
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,337
Amazing. What
were the outcomes?

208
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,797
Did anyone get a transplant?

209
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,923
Schmitt, it's the NICU.

210
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,383
You can keep your voice down.

211
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,218
Um, if you were to...

212
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,719
Okay, hand your
tag to that nurse,

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
and they'll set you up.

214
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,722
Ann: Over here. E-Excuse me.

215
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,182
My son and his husband,

216
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,392
they were camping,

217
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,518
and I-I can't reach
either of them.

218
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,936
Can... Can you...
Can you tell me

219
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,187
if they're patients here?

220
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,271
Yeah. They'll help
you at the desk.

221
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,940
No, they don't know anything.

222
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,525
Their names aren't
in the system,

223
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,443
and... and they're too busy
to check on all the John Does.

224
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,696
Look, I know they're grown men

225
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,531
and cell reception
isn't great out there,

226
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,701
but I-I'm a mom, and I worry.

227
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,119
What are their names?

228
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,705
Thank you. Nathan
Bates and Andrew Smith.

229
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,541
Uh, also, all those people
are looking for people, too.

230
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,002
Man: Okay, ma'am.

231
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,298
Receptionist: I'm
doing the best I can.

232
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,925
Link: I can feel a
left femoral pulse.

233
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,094
Bailey: Okay, let's get
some more O-neg on standby.

234
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,804
Theo's lost a lot of blood.

235
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,597
We had to use a chainsaw to
get that tree off of him.

236
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,224
What? He didn't see
it coming? He did.

237
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,726
He pushed Montgomery
out of the way.

238
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,602
My badge was deactivated.
I was definitely fired.

239
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,645
I'm sorry. Wait, what?!

240
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,980
It's a long story.

241
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,398
Oh, damn it. That
does not look good.

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,607
Taryn: He's got
vascular compromise.

243
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,443
You've got to save his leg.

244
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,651
His job's his life.

245
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,777
Okay, there's free
fluid in his abdomen.

246
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,820
He... He needs an ex-lap.

247
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,447
Okay.

248
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,656
As... As long as his
BP continues to hold,

249
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,033
we can scan him.

250
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,117
Bailey, you said it yourself,

251
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,243
Theo is family.

252
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,953
You both need to step outside.

253
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,705
We will update you, okay?

254
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,123
Hey. The hospital
emergency coordinator

255
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,499
wants to talk to
you. What? Now?

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,960
I-It's about our
pre-evacuation plan.

257
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,503
I'll be a few minutes. Okay.

258
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,088
Alright, look, I'll take Ruiz.

259
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,882
He needs surgery and
you're short surgeons.

260
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,800
Catherine can't blame me
for saving a firefighter.

261
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,552
Owen: Thank you. Alright,
bring me up to speed.

262
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,720
Link: 37-year-old male,

263
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,846
crushed by a large tree branch,

264
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,514
blood pressure holding.

265
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,978
♪ What goes up
must come down ♪

266
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,732
♪ Spinning Wheel
got to go 'round ♪

267
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,234
Mika: Stay still,
please, Garrett.

268
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,069
You know, Maxine
loves that song.

269
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,988
Well, how's she doing?

270
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,032
She worried about the fires?

271
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,701
Uh, more like annoyed
that they might mean

272
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,121
her hot yoga retreat
is postponed.

273
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,290
Ah, I'm just in time.

274
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,042
Richard: Okay.
What do you see?

275
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,710
His aneurysm ruptured.

276
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,420
Fortunately, it's
still contained.

277
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,507
Let's book an OR and prep
him for an open repair.

278
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,009
You and Dr. Ndugu don't want
to go in endovascularly?

279
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,345
Well, Dr. Ndugu had to
run to an emergent CABG.

280
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,387
I'm flying solo.

281
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,181
As for Garrett, he's young,

282
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,183
surgically speaking.

283
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,101
An open surgery
has better outcomes

284
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,561
for someone with his history.

285
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,522
But we studied the
endovascular procedure.

286
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,691
Well, if you two aren't
confident retracting,

287
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,443
I'm sure someone
else can handle it.

288
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,111
Well, I'm confident.
I retract in my sleep.

289
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,530
Okay, well, then, page
me when he's ready.

290
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,948
And study up.

291
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,324
The one who's most prepared

292
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,409
will get to do
more than retract.

293
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,620
Woman over PA:
<i>Dr. Spence to Pediatrics.</i>

294
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,996
<i>Dr. Kendal Spence
to Pediatrics.</i>

295
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,593
How about you see patients

296
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,178
instead of updating
your socials?

297
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
How about you make
yourself useful

298
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,182
and post the link
I sent everyone?

299
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,268
Fall City Wildfire
People Locator.

300
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah, it's a shared database

301
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,395
put together on my phone.

302
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,771
There's over 100 people.

303
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,523
Yeah, might be more
if you post the link.

304
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,732
I'll post.

305
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,317
You have bed 3.

306
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,069
Woman over PA:
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

307
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,113
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

308
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:56,906
Molly Tran?

309
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,907
I'm Dr. Adams.

310
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,408
How are you doing?

311
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,951
Um, I have a small sprain
and what's probably

312
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,619
just smoke inhalation.

313
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,580
You have asthma and you
were wheezing in the car.

314
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,706
We should make sure
you aren't having

315
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,165
a major bronchospasm.

316
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,250
Okay. Mind if I listen?

317
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,794
Yeah.

318
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,379
Woman over PA: <i>Chief Ortho
Resident, call in patient services.</i>

319
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,090
Take a deep breath.

320
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,134
Are you doctors?

321
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,844
I'm in pharmacy school.

322
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,470
He reads too much WebMD.

323
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,181
How long have you had asthma?

324
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,225
Um, hang on...

325
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,979
Diagnosed at 17.

326
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,524
I was in a car accident
a few years ago.

327
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,234
Spent a month in a coma,
and when I woke up,

328
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,777
I couldn't remember my parents,

329
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,487
my cat, or medicine.

330
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,947
Well, now I'm back
in pharmacy school

331
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,449
and learning it all again.

332
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,242
As if it wasn't hard
enough the first time.

333
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,369
Yeah, thank God I
kept my flashcards.

334
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,038
Alright, I'm going
to run some labs,

335
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,415
uh, order a chest X-ray,
and nebulizer treatment.

336
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,042
I'll be right back.

337
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,211
And while we don't yet
understand the causality,

338
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,380
there is a clear correlation.

339
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,674
So you found a
correlation between things

340
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,259
I asked you not to study.

341
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,594
Well, we haven't
actually spoken about it.

342
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,971
Things you said to my face

343
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,723
you would stop researching.

344
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,184
We are this close to
being able to prove

345
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,103
that Alzheimer's
could be <i>preventable.</i>

346
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,980
You have to admit
that's a game-changer.

347
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,857
I don't have to admit anything.

348
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,069
You went behind my
back using my money,

349
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,322
two of my best and <i>formerly</i>
most trusted surgeons.

350
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,949
Give me one good reason

351
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,117
I shouldn't just end
your career right now.

352
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,995
I'll give you 6.7
million reasons.

353
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,497
That's the amount of Americans

354
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,290
living with Alzheimer's today.

355
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,667
And there's another
half a million

356
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,460
that will be diagnosed
by year's end.

357
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,212
And for every man that suffers,

358
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,964
two women suffer.

359
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,799
Think about what this could
mean for their children,

360
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,592
for their grandchildren

361
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,261
if we could diagnose them
before symptoms start,

362
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,721
or if we could tell them

363
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,307
that they're predisposed
to this disease.

364
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,768
I am sorry that I
went behind your back.

365
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,271
I honestly never did intend
to use Fox Foundation funds.

366
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,940
But we're here now.

367
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,692
Don't you want to be on the
forefront of fighting this?

368
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,115
You're right. This
changes everything.

369
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,160
Fox Foundation should
be leading the way.

370
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,913
Would $5 million help?

371
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,373
Yes. Yes.

372
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,500
Yeah, I mean, we could
expand the sample size.

373
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,585
We could do a 5-year
longitudinal study.

374
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,462
Great. Okay.

375
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,005
So...

376
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,507
I would like for you
to deliver your notes,

377
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,010
your data, all your models,

378
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,012
all of your work
to Tom Koracick.

379
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,346
Um, Koracick?

380
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,431
Yes, you know Tom.

381
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,932
Brilliant neurosurgeon,

382
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,142
insufferable know-it-all,

383
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,685
and tireless Lothario...

384
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,936
He'll be taking over.

385
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,855
Wait, I don't understand.

386
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,523
You said yourself.

387
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,276
Fox resources funded
all the research.

388
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,821
That means it all belongs
to the Fox Foundation.

389
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,657
So hand it over by end of day,

390
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,785
and the two of you
get to keep your jobs.

391
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,288
Same thing for Altman.

392
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,374
But this project
is no longer yours.

393
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,801
Link: His vein has
completely collapsed.

394
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,678
We've lost IV access
on his left side.

395
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,512
We can't lose Ruiz.

396
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,680
He might not work at 19 anymore,
but he's still one of us.

397
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,931
You should be in there.

398
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,808
Altman and Lincoln
are perfectly capable.

399
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,477
I need you in there.

400
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,478
I need to know it's your
hands trying to fix him.

401
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,438
Teddy: Did his repeat
H&H come back yet?

402
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,231
Please.

403
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,608
IO's placed.

404
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,234
Link: Alright, we need
to get him to CT ASAP.

405
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,319
Okay, then I'll
meet you in the OR.

406
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,112
You sure that's a good idea?

407
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,323
You'll need all the best
hands you have in there,

408
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,075
and mine are pretty damn good.

409
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,409
Alright. Let's
get ready to move.

410
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,954
Link: Let's get another
unit of crash blood.

411
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,416
Teddy: Have you put in
the trauma CT order set?

412
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,960
Robert: More traction
on your side, Millin.

413
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,587
Mm-hmm.

414
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,713
Okay. There, that's better.

415
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,215
Now, hypothetically,

416
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,509
If I clamp the aorta, and
there's still bleeding

417
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,010
from the posterior wall,
where's it coming from?

418
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,179
The... The lumbar arteries.

419
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,972
Correct. What do we do then?

420
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,599
You oversew it. You st...

421
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,559
Yasuda's right.

422
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,102
Alright.

423
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,437
The posterior parachute is done.

424
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,731
And shall I ask a tie-breaker

425
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,484
to see who gets to
suture the anterior wall?

426
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,985
Yes. Well, cou...

427
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,029
Could we both do some of it?

428
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,364
Well, I guess that'll work.

429
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,616
Okay, Millin, you take
the needle driver.

430
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,160
Yasuda, you follow her
with the anastomosis.

431
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,286
You need to keep it tight, okay?

432
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,538
And then you'll switch. Okay.

433
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,914
Yeah. Thank you.

434
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,249
Now, take healthy bites, Millin,

435
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,334
on both the aorta
and the Dacron graft

436
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,669
or the suture won't hold.

437
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,462
Am I following you okay? Yeah.

438
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,131
Um, thank you for asking.

439
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,507
Oh, I'm mostly bringing it up

440
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,758
so that you do a good
job when it's my turn.

441
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,468
Alright.

442
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,803
Ah.

443
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,971
How does that look?

444
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,140
Uh, still not enough artery.

445
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,933
You know, just go
with it, though, okay?

446
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,518
We poke too many needle holes,

447
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,728
and we'll have to deal
with suture line bleeding.

448
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,148
That's better. Okay.

449
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,941
I'm going to tie
it down for you.

450
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,984
We ready to continue?

451
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,153
Game on. You got it.

452
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,363
Get ready to
reload your needle.

453
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,365
We are already over capacity.

454
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,034
I have patients stuck in ORs
'cause the PACUs are full.

455
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,453
I don't have time to
this bureaucratic bull...

456
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,705
Hello?

457
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,914
Damn it.

458
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,332
We're running out
of IV pain meds.

459
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,293
How long till we
get more? No idea.

460
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,335
There's just too much red tape.

461
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,753
We're going to have
to start rationing.

462
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,630
How do you decide who gets
it and who has to suffer?

463
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,340
Well, if you can think of a
way, then, please, let me know.

464
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,383
What's the CT show?

465
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,551
BP started bottoming out

466
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,552
so we're heading
straight to surgery.

467
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,636
Okay.

468
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,976
Dr. Altman, where do
you think you're going?

469
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,228
To the OR.

470
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,606
Catherine, he's a firefighter.

471
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,066
Unless Grey has turned
in all of her research,

472
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,818
you still don't work
at this hospital.

473
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. If you need to
go on some power trip,

474
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,572
I can't stop you,

475
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,616
but I have too many
patients, not enough doctors.

476
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,534
So if this man dies
because your ego

477
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,661
won't let one of our
best doctors do her job,

478
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,622
then his blood will
be on <i>your</i> hands.

479
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,005
Let's go.

480
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,262
Lucas: How close
were you to the fire?

481
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,431
I saw flames on a hill,
which means too close.

482
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,310
You know, I'm using this to
get out of camping next time.

483
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,853
Who wants to spend
their vacation

484
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,313
sleeping on the ground?

485
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,898
Yeah, I went all
the time as a kid.

486
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,149
Hm. I wonder if I did.

487
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,734
I should ask my mom that.

488
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,694
It must be frustrating

489
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,655
not remembering your past.

490
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,448
It was at first, yeah.

491
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,991
I got pretty depressed

492
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,370
trying and failing at
getting back to my old life.

493
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,456
I mean, eventually, I just...

494
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,750
decided to stop stressing
and start fresh.

495
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,293
I reapplied to pharmacy school,

496
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,836
moved to California,

497
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,256
made some new
friends, got a dog,

498
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,758
met Dave.

499
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,261
Sounds like it worked out.

500
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,014
Yeah, it feels like it was
supposed to happen this way.

501
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,307
Alright.

502
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,684
I'll go check on
your chest X-ray.

503
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,561
Thank you.

504
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,021
Woman over PA:
<i>Dr. Trosclair to Cardiology.</i>

505
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,940
<i>Dr. Beth Trosclair
to Cardiology.</i>

506
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,027
Hey, I, uh, I just
said goodbye to Ruiz.

507
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,862
Well, he's in good hands.

508
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,531
Yeah, I know. I know.

509
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,700
I... I just wish
I could do more.

510
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,077
Um, you could stay.

511
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,664
Be here when he wakes up.

512
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,749
Dispatch already called.

513
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
I gotta get back.

514
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,631
Listen, um...

515
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
I promised Pru that we would do

516
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,760
root beer floats
tonight, but, um...

517
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,849
It might need to be tomorrow.

518
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,519
You be careful out
there, Ben Warren,

519
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,812
and... and you
keep me updated.

520
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,188
I will.

521
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,404
I love you, Miranda Bailey.

522
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,739
Always have.

523
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,823
Always will.

524
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,001
Okay. I'll meet
you in trauma 2.

525
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,294
Okay, show me.

526
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,295
Okay, the clinic.

527
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,756
Alright, triage tags.

528
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,549
We're using the
clinic for overflow.

529
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,302
So anything with a green
tag you take there, okay?

530
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,512
Need help? Neuro
check in trauma 2.

531
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,056
Yeah, sure.

532
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:01,974
- Have you ever had to make...
- Coming through.

533
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,641
A life-changing decision,

534
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,268
but couldn't talk it
through with anyone

535
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,062
due to its confidential nature?

536
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,439
I know about the secret
research. Thank God.

537
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,607
Catherine is holding it hostage.

538
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,068
Yeah, Teddy told me. Koracick.

539
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,277
Did she say what she
thought we should do?

540
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,653
She said it was up to you,

541
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
but she wouldn't mind
having a job, though.

542
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,365
I need to work, too,

543
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,491
but we're really getting
somewhere with the research.

544
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,242
What would you do?

545
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,036
Why are you laughing?

546
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,329
I don't remember one time

547
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,455
you took my advice
when we were married.

548
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,415
Well, I'm asking now. Come on.

549
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,626
I know you, okay?

550
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,294
Somewhere deep in your
gut and in your heart,

551
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,420
you already know the answer.

552
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,713
Trust yourself.

553
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,091
Thank you.

554
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,051
But, seriously,
what would you do?

555
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,302
I just wouldn't
give it to Koracick,

556
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,179
but that's just 'cause
I hate that guy.

557
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,685
OR 2 isn't cleared yet.
Then find us another one.

558
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,853
They're all full... between
multiple burn escharotomies,

559
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,647
maxed out PACU,
everything's backed up.

560
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,898
Alright, well tell
them the chief

561
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,316
has a severely
injured firefighter

562
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,526
whose BP is all
over the place...

563
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,444
Okay, don't tell them
chief, but tell them...

564
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,405
Oh, that needs to not happen.

565
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,825
JVD.

566
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,701
Muffled heart sounds.
No pulse, let's move.

567
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,246
Damn it. He's in PEA
from a cardiac tamponade.

568
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,372
Starting chest compressions.

569
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,249
Alright, he needs a thoracotomy.

570
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,749
How much longer
till this is clear?

571
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,626
They said five minutes.
He'll be dead in two.

572
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,961
Alright, do you have
a scalpel on you? Yes.

573
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,504
Go, go, go, good.

574
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,590
Alright. Stop compressions.

575
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,717
We're in a <i>hallway.</i>

576
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,718
Do you want him to die in it?

577
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,885
Stop compressions.

578
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,638
After I get in there,

579
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,223
I'll release the pressure
from around the heart.

580
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,599
What... What the
hell are you doing?!

581
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,355
Oh, my God, Altman!

582
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,234
What happened?

583
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,777
Jules: He said
his stomach hurt.

584
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,154
He became hypertensive and
then dropped his pressure.

585
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,905
We're trying to keep
systolics over 100

586
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,157
and we started a transfusion.

587
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,117
Alright, his anastomosis
might be leaking.

588
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,452
Dr. Webber said
we did a good job.

589
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,537
Webber let you do
it? He supervised us.

590
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,164
He was there the whole
time. Every step of the way.

591
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,623
Alright, we got to get
him back to the OR now.

592
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,001
Page Webber.

593
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,003
Neither one of you
come anywhere near it.

594
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,338
Alright. Let's go. Let's go.

595
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,091
Griffith, I need you and
Link to pull his chest open

596
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,259
so that I can see the heart.

597
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
One on either side.

598
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,179
Dr. Bailey? Altman.

599
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,972
We don't have a rib spreader.

600
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,391
It is the only way. Okay.
Ready? Pull. Alright.

601
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,559
Is that enough?
Oh, my God. More.

602
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,102
More. Pull. Altman...

603
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,021
Okay, there, there.
Pericardium is full of blood.

604
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,023
I need to release the
pressure from the heart.

605
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,649
Okay, come on. Come
on, there we go.

606
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,151
Is it beating?

607
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,819
There we go. Weakly.

608
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,987
Alright. BP's coming up a bit.

609
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,783
Come on, Theo. We
got you. Come on.

610
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,951
We need the damn OR!

611
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,334
Schmitt, can you make room?

612
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,668
Do the babies not know

613
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,837
that there's a natural
disaster happening right now?

614
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,758
Schmitt, how's Paloma Deshmukh?

615
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,676
Oh, her bilirubin's
a little high.

616
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,470
Do you think it could
progress to kernicterus?

617
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,554
How high?

618
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,181
Indirect bili is 15.

619
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,349
No, no, she's okay for now,

620
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,809
but just let's
keep an eye on her.

621
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,144
You know, I read an article
about the prevalence

622
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,188
of kernicterus in
South Asian children.

623
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,106
I don't know if you've
heard of that one.

624
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,608
I'm oddly fascinated
by jaundice.

625
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,485
Maybe 'cause my mom said
that I have jaundice...

626
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,153
I get it. You love kids.

627
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,988
You have a genuine,

628
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,074
maybe excessive interest in peds

629
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,867
and you did do a really good job

630
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,744
on that rectal biopsy today,

631
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,203
okay?

632
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,788
Pending your ABSITE score,

633
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,082
I will vouch for you to the
fellowship committee, okay?

634
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,875
Thank you.

635
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,210
Page me when you're
done charting.

636
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,003
Okay.

637
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,588
Congratulations. Thanks.

638
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,298
Your competitive advantage

639
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,551
is annoying people
into recommendations.

640
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,177
That felt unnecessary.

641
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,428
Well...

642
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,680
No. Ohh.

643
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,806
No, no, no.

644
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,600
Ah.

645
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,769
You made a dig, and the
power almost went out.

646
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,604
How bad would you feel
for all of these babies

647
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,981
if it hadn't have come back on?

648
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,528
Jo? Oh, my God. Hey, Jo?

649
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,238
Jo.

650
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,532
Hey, I need some help!

651
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,218
I just finished a...

652
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,304
I lost him.

653
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,347
By the time I opened him,

654
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,100
his entire blood supply
was in his abdomen.

655
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,810
I'm sorry.

656
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,228
Millin and Yasuda said

657
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,980
they did the anastomosis.

658
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,149
That's a lot of
responsibility for interns.

659
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,151
Repairing a ruptured aorta?

660
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,445
I barely let my
third years do that.

661
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,654
They were ready to step up.

662
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,780
Clearly, they weren't.

663
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,117
His posterior wall was a mess.

664
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,745
Posterior wall?

665
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,830
Yes. They need more practice

666
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
before I let them near another
one of my patients again.

667
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,965
Bailey: Have more
lap pads ready.

668
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,342
Link: Where is all this
bleeding coming from?

669
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,968
Teddy: Let's go
quadrant by quadrant.

670
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,845
Taryn: His company supervisor
is asking for an update.

671
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,805
Let's hold off.

672
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,766
I want to be able to
give them positive news.

673
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,141
And we are not there yet.

674
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,726
We can use an
extra set of hands.

675
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,728
Scrubbing in. Griffith,
check my phone.

676
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,146
You want me to break scrub?

677
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,231
No, I want you to
look at my phone

678
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,151
and see if I have any missed
calls or texts from Ben.

679
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,235
Nurse.

680
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,323
It's a new TED Health Podcast.

681
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,699
The SMA's avulsed
from the aorta...

682
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,409
he is bleeding out.

683
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,953
Link: Alright, if we don't
repair the blood flow

684
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,162
to his leg soon, I'll
have to amputate.

685
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,955
We are not amputating.
More suction.

686
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,874
All due respect, It's
usually the trauma surgeon

687
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,918
who reminds me life
comes before limb.

688
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,002
What about now, Griffith?

689
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,547
Dangerously close to
the point of no return.

690
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,840
Teddy: This man
live for his job.

691
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,843
If we can save both,
I'm taking that chance.

692
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,138
Griffith? John Doe
trauma, ETA 5 minutes.

693
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,017
Alright, we need to get
distal and proximal control.

694
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,271
About to die.

695
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,649
Our best bet is a saphenous
vein graft to reconstruct...

696
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,692
Ben: <i>I love you,
Miranda Bailey.</i>

697
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,151
<i>Always have.</i>

698
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,945
Teddy: Bailey,
what do you think?

699
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,529
<i>Always will.</i> Bailey?

700
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,738
Bailey.

701
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,365
I think, um...

702
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,784
I...

703
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,160
I think I-I shouldn't be here.

704

Thanks for asking.

on your bedside manner.

716
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,235

practically rent-free.

we're landlord-tenant?

00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:35,992
What's your deal?

721
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,053
Why didn't you tell
me you were pregnant?

722
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,415
I'm what?

723
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,376
Oh.

724
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,962

Before she got sick,

728
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,276
did she...

729
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,695
tell you about her last surgery?

730
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,989
No.

731
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,408
She was probably
in denial about it.

732
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,703
I'm sure there was no post-op
cake or retirement party.

733
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,371
Sounds like Ellis.

734
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,999
If I had to guess, I'd say
it was probably a Whipple

735
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,543
or definitely something
to do with the pancreas.

736
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,295
Oh, she loved the pancreas.

737
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,214
She said that was the one organ

738
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,715
that was more
stubborn than she was.

739
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,884
Sounds like Ellis.

740
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,095
You know, I've been
thinking about her

741
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,348
so much lately with my research.

742
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,351
And I've been wondering how
much of stubborn Ellis was Ellis

743
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,561
and how much of it was
Alzheimer's festering

744
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,314
before we ever even
knew she had it.

745
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Hm.

746
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,111

00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,323

I've said it before.

749
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,246
I know I've taken breaks
from the OR in the past,

750
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,290
but this time it
feels different.

751
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,501
It feels like...

752
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,962
I need to think about
putting the scalpel down.

surgeon a long time.

754
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,175

I won't know who I am.

00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,264

885
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,543
She can't breathe, and
I can't find her doctor.

886
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,586
Can you please help?

887
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,670
Look, I don't know
what happened.

888
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,713
We were just talking
a second ago.

889
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,549
You're asthmatic, right?

890
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,884
I'll give you some albuterol.

891
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,968
Okay. Hang on, honey.

892
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,595
Okay. Take a deep breath.

893
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,973
Good, good.

894
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,266
Take another one.

895
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,063
You feel better?

896
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,359
Do I know you?

897
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,403
It just...

898
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,031
It really feels like I know you.

899
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,575
No.

900
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,660
Here.

901
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,206
Adams, she's all set.

902
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,667
Make sure to get her another
inhaler before she goes.

903
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,044
Uh, can you monitor her for me?

904
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,047
Dorian's transport's here,
and I'd like goodbye.

905
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,966
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

906
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,842
You <i>do</i> know her, don't you?

907
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,427
What... you two hook
up or something?

908
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,639
She was my fiancée.

909
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,068
Hey, Bailey's low-key
taking a head count.

910
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,737
We might want to
get back upstairs.

911
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,700
Sorry.

912
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,202
I... I'm so sorry that I
ratted us out to Ndugu.

913
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,495
I know he's kind of your mentor.

914
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,789
No, he died.

915
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,542
Garrett died.

916
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,918
What?

917
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,295
Yasuda: Oh, my God. Yeah.

918
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,422
We... We sewed his aorta.

919
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,049
Jules: Yeah.

920
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,518
Okay.

921
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,980
Yeah, yeah, this isn't working.

922
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,356
This isn't working.

923
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,194
Okay. Come and sit
down. Hold still.

924
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,572
Okay. Here, alright?

925
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,160
Anything?

926
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,787
Not really.

927
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,833
Okay, what about now? Better?

928
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,724
Today did not go at all
how I thought it would.

929
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,017
Yep. Same.

930
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,519
Mm. Hey.

931
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,188
Come with me.

932
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,023

939
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,621
Griffith. How'd you do?

940
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,498
75th.

941
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,624
We all aced it.

942
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,793
Yeah.

943
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,379
Why does this feel...

944
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,089
weird?

945
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,370
That's why I was
looking for you.

946
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,471
Hey! We're gonna
miss you here.

947
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,807
Yeah, see if they'll stop for
a cheeseburger on your way.

948
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,016
Hey, doctor's orders.

949
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,644

951

953
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,401

A-And thank <i>you</i> for, uh,

957
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,995
I just helped get it out there.

958

Take care of yourself, man.

959
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,468
Your ABSITE score came in.

960
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,763
It was the highest
in your class.

961
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,564
I gotta go change for
my meeting with Dr. Fox.

962
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,776
So, how'd it go with Ruiz?

963
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,613
Oh, I had to reconstruct his
SMA, and he's stable now.

964
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,032
Link was able to save his leg.

965
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,534
Thank you for
standing up for me.

966
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,952
That might have been
my last surgery.

967
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,329
Or not. You did
save a firefighter.

968
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,498
Yeah. Is that enough to
change Catherine's mind?

969
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,125
Hm. Oh!

970
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,878

971

972
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,881

We want to urge you to reject

1064
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,842
the GME Council's
recommendation for Dr. Adams.

1065
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,344
And why would I do that?

1066
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,889
Well, Adams completed
Bailey's procedure logs,

1067
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,432
as did we all,

1068
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,310
and we think that should
count for something.

1069
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,813
Oh, we're human.

1070
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,314
We can't avoid mistakes.

1071
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,400
What's important is
learning not to repeat them.

1072
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,318
Look, we all push each
other to be better,

1073
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,570
and it wouldn't be
the same without him.

1074
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,030
Simone: You know
as well as we do

1075
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,532
how demanding intern year is,

1076
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,993
but we're working
through it together.

1077
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,912
We don't want to
leave anyone behind...

1078
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,455
or lose anyone.

1079
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,168
If Adams goes...

1080
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,169
What?

1081
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,588
You all go?

1082
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,717
Is that really a threat
you want to make right now?
