1
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:03,762
I didn"t get married.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,935
<i>You didn"t get married?</i>

3
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,223
Adams isn"t good enough for you.

4
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:07,110
<i>If you decide to be with him,</i>

5
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,294
<i>your whole trajectory changes.</i>

6
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:09,330
Congratulations, Dr. Ndugu.

7
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:10,389
Head of Cardio?

8
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,598
- You need a dentist.
<i>- Maxine.</i>

9
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:14,462
She has a DNR and DNI.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,568
Get me an intubation tray
so I can save her life.

11
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:19,950
We have to question everything we know
about Alzheimer "s if we" re gonna cure it.

12
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,884
This is huge. And you can"t tell
anyone outside of this room.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,199
I do believe that we have been
focused on-on the wrong thing.

14
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:28,476
Your vodka tonic, sir.

15
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:31,248
Oh, I was just coming
to check on you

16
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,446
but I guess you"re covered.

17
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:33,654
What the hell happened?

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,838
Chest tube started
pouring blood.

19
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,484
His aorta must have transected.

20
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:38,935
<i>I need you to work as
quickly as you can.</i>

21
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,386
Page Hunt. Page everyone.

22
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:44,113
I"m in love with you, Jo.
How do you not see that?

23
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,669
I want to live a whole life with
love and mess and pain and you.

24
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,981
You saved my favorite person.

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,432
So now I don"t get
to just hate you.

26
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,469
I have to love you too.

27
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,954
Teddy. Clear.

28
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:05,927
<i>Researchers say the average length
of a dream is two to three minutes.</i>

29
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,395
<i>Do not do anything until
an attending gets here.</i>

30
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,599
<i>Paged everyone, no one"s
coming and we don"t have time.</i>

31
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:14,660
<i>But many people experience
their dreams as hours.</i>

32
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,110
<i>I just lost her pulse.</i>

33
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:17,698
<i>"She" s DNI. Why
is she intubated?</i>

34
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:19,148
<i>Help me fight to get her back.</i>

35
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,528
<i>"Simone, he" s dying.</i>

36
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,116
<i>If they can remember
them at all.</i>

37
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:30,055
<i>The science of dreaming has been
questioned for hundreds of years.</i>

38
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,161
<i>Chief Altman, you
do not die on me.</i>

39
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,472
<i>Teddy, stay with me.</i>

40
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,025
<i>Clear.</i>

41
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,791
<i>Some hypothesize that dreams are
our way of processing real events</i>

42
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:43,275
<i>"that occur when we" re awake.</i>

43
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:49,385
<i>They may also serve as an outlet
for repressed hopes and desires.</i>

44
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,976
<i>Neuroscientists introduce a
new theory every few years.</i>

45
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,980
<i>But honestly, no one
knows why we dream.</i>

46
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,088
Gown and glove me.

47
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,814
<i>Or why we have nightmares.</i>

48
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,885
<i>"Dr. Altman, we" ve got you.</i>

49
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:08,680
<i>We just hope that
after the dream,</i>

50
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,752
<i>we wake up.</i>

51
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:14,824
Morning.

52
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,687
Morning.

53
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,899
So, which one of
you am I firing?

54
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,433
Owen, we are so sorry.

55
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,882
- Are you okay?
- I"m fine.

56
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,850
She collapsed in the
OR and went into V-fib.

57
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,887
We resuscitated her and an echo
revealed bacterial endocarditis.

58
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,025
Caused by what?

59
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,718
Most likely a dental infection.

60
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:50,204
The bacterial growths caused
severe aortic valve insufficiency,

61
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,586
so Beckman and Schmitt did an
emergent valve replacement.

62
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:55,105
We still need to follow up
on blood and tissue cultures,

63
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:57,004
consult ID and cardiology.

64
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,419
All right. Thank you.

65
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:00,421
Why don"t you go get some rest?

66
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,559
I"m not going anywhere.

67
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,022
Teddy"s now my patient and
you"re my patient"s husband.

68
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:08,326
I need to focus on her and I
can"t do that with you here.

69
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,363
Owen... we should
check on the kids.

70
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,055
Okay.

71
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,236
- You too.
- Oh.

72
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,445
All right. We might
as well stay and work,

73
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,343
but let us know the
minute something changes.

74
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:29,623
All right. I"ll need to
see her post-op CT scans.

75
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,625
- I haven"t scanned her yet.
- Why not?

76
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,627
I didn"t think that
was standard protocol.

77
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,422
The first 24 hours after surgery

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,640
are just as important as
the surgery itself, Schmitt.

79
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,081
It"s not about standard. It"s
about being hypervigilant.

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,083
- Get her to CT ASAP.
- Okay.

81
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,297
How long was I gone?
- You left in the morning and...

82
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:50,057
Nope. Not a real
question, Millin.

83
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,691
What I mean is, I approved you
all to attend Griffith"s wedding.

84
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,993
Yeah, it didn"t
happen. Ask Adams.

85
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:57,271
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Means home-wrecker.

86
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,445
Tell me what DNI means?

87
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,343
Stop, stop.

88
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,070
You all had specific assignments
for your shift afterwards.

89
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,660
But when I read the notes this morning,
no one was where they were supposed to be.

90
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,328
- Why were you with Sam Sutton?
- Yasuda and I switched services.

91
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:12,735
- Because Adams got punched by his patient.
- Griffith"s ex-fiancÃ©.

92
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,783
At least he didn"t conveniently forget
about someone"s medical directive.

93
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:17,464
Maxine is stable now...

94
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:20,018
Great, but Adams filleted
a patient. Okay, so...

95
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,985
Shut up. Shut up!

96
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:24,781
Shut up, all of you.

97
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,473
A patient died.

98
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,544
You understand?
Their life is over.

99
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:31,374
That and the disrespect of
someone"s medical directive,

100
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,343
you all just opened up this hospital
to about five different lawsuits

101
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:37,829
which, as your teacher, I could be
named. So now you"re risking my career.

102
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,141
And right now none of
you is worth that to me.

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,421
Wait, so you"re
firing all of us?

104
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,146
I just want to ex... I didn"t...

105
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,563
Stop. I"m needed in the
ICU, but we"re not done.

106
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,530
Stay here. Do not move.

107
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,877
Do not practice medicine.

108
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,645
You made me get on your plane
in the middle of the night

109
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,475
and fly across the country
for a conversation.

110
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,581
How long do I have to wait?

111
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,205
I"ve spent every minute on the
phone since your antics last night

112
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,241
doing damage control
with the donors.

113
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,933
I know. I sat by
you on the plane.

114
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,348
Oh, don"t be snide.

115
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:16,361
I haven"t had to dance
like that since the "80s.

116
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:20,250
I had to spin your lunacy into
dehydration and exhaustion.

117
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,529
- You lied.
- I saved your career.

118
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,772
You made my foundation
look like a joke.

119
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,224
You hired a batch of interns
that are clearly only interested

120
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,778
in sinking this
hospital"s reputation.

121
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,435
They"re foolish and dangerous.

122
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,611
And frankly, the only reason
they"re here is because of you.

123
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:41,548
In 12 hours you have potentially
caused me two PR nightmares

124
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,757
that would take thousands
of dollars to fix.

125
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,104
Firing you would just
add to a media storm,

126
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:48,624
so you have two options.

127
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,765
Shut up about your
theories on Alzheimer"s,

128
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,076
or I shut down your lab.

129
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,390
You can go back to Boston now.

130
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,290
But not on my plane.

131
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,574
I can "t believe you" re practicing
knots, when we might all be fired.

132
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,931
Well, can"t get rusty. We
might be looking for new jobs.

133
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:12,579
It"s Ndugu from the CCU.

134
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,108
Dr. Marsh said we
can"t leave the room.

135
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,479
So you want me to ignore
the new chief of cardio?

136
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,897
Yeah, I don"t need this.

137
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,736
What?

138
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,254
You said a thing last night.

139
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,601
I said a lot of things.

140
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:35,739
Wanna talk about it?

141
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,500
I wanna go check on Maxine,

142
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,502
see if she"s ready
to be extubated.

143
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,128
- Dr. Marsh?
- Yeah.

144
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:47,027
I wanna assure you,
I can carry out

145
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,005
whatever plan you have
in mind for the interns.

146
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,479
Ooh, that "s okay. I" ve got it.

147
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:54,172
Right, well, as chief resident,
or technically cochief...

148
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,795
- Yeah.
- If I could know what the plan is?

149
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:01,144
Well, I don"t know what that is yet.
And once I do, I will handle it myself.

150
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,388
I couldn"t be in three
places at once last night...

151
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,908
Excuse me. You"re a chief
resident. Act like it.

152
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,842
<i>Dr. Sally to Psychiatry.
Dr. Sally to Psychiatry.</i>

153
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:12,777
Lucas, can you wait?
Lucas, damn it.

154
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,331
You have barely said two
words to me since last night.

155
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,757
We need to talk
about what happened.

156
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,886
- I"m fine.
- I am not.

157
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,405
There"s gonna be
an investigation.

158
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,743
They"re gonna ask whose
decision it was to open Sam up.

159
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,868
- Tell "em it was mine."
- Hey, can you give us a hand?

160
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:29,414
Engine crapped out. Patient"s 43, male.
MVC. GCS nine. Intubated in the field.

161
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,554
Prominent seat belt
sign. Borderline.

162
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,763
We gave him 500 cc
bolus of LR en route.

163
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,939
We called for another rig, but SFD
is stuck in an industrial fire.

164
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,400
- Can you help us get him to the ER?
- We"re not technically... Hey.

165
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,624
Adams, no practicing medicine.

166
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:41,920
The longer this
patient has to wait,

167
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,335
the higher the chance
he could decompensate.

168
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,016
Do you mind bagging?
- Actually, I do.

169
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,678
Marsh cannot find
out about this.

170
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,166
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

171
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:11,111
Y-You okay?

172
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,457
Oh, it"s superficial.

173
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,080
Okay.

174
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,499
You"re doing good.

175
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,122
Thank you.

176
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,572
Okay.

177
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,195
Whoa, he"s desatting.
- Oh, crap, the Ambu.

178
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,577
What was that?

179
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:30,302
I don"t know.

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,753
Um, his blood pressure
is starting to drop.

181
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,548
- Can you open the doors?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,036
It"s stuck.

183
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,084
Oh, no. We ha... We
have to get out of here.

184
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,420
Help! Hey!

185
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,456
Somebody help! Hey! Hey!

186
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,741
Hey.

187
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,744
Did you get some sleep?

188
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,574
Um, a little bit, yeah.

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,328
What is it?

190
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,193
Sam Sutton"s mom is here.

191
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,646
Teddy is stable so far.

192
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,510
I"ll do a neuro exam on her
once they wean her off sedation.

193
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,753
I"ll go check on Owen.

194
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,282
- I"m gonna keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

195
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,411
- Meredith.
- Yes?

196
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,999
I read it all.

197
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,701
Your research. I went
through your data.

198
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,037
Transcripts on the
image tampering,

199
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:51,936
the inconsistencies
in the drug trials.

200
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:54,007
And? You see what I see.

201
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,562
Hey, sorry. Uh, I"m on my way to
the OR. How"d it go with Catherine?

202
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,115
I"m gonna check on Owen. Okay.

203
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:01,601
Uh, you know, if I don"t
shut up, I"ll be fired.

204
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,533
- Yeah.
- What about the interns?

205
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:06,552
Uh, no one"s giving me a straight
story and the notes are indecipherable.

206
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,573
Look, if they stay, the
whole surgical department,

207
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,068
they"re gonna need
to be evaluated.

208
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,772
You"re thinking about
getting rid of them?

209
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,279
Well, I don"t know yet, but none of
them will go near a patient today

210
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,857
and maybe even for a very
long time, especially Adams.

211
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:19,284
- What happened to second chances?
- Not a second chance anymore.

212
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,748
With Adams it"s
more like an eighth.

213
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,563
I"m gonna text you when
I"m out of surgery.

214
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:23,587
Okay.

215
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:27,627
Mer, come with me.
Interns are in trouble.

216
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:29,663
- Please tell me it isn"t Adams.
- Uh...

217
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,769
Leo, please, will
you just get dressed?

218
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:35,013
Well, tell Grandma that Dad said
you can wear whatever you want.

219
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,223
Oh, and remember that it"s
sharing day at school.

220
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,158
Soon. Yeah. Mommy
will be home soon.

221
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,173
I was on my way to Teddy"s
office to check her calendar.

222
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:48,855
- I don"t wanna miss anything for the kids.
- Does it matter?

223
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,340
It"s okay to miss
something today.

224
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:53,238
I mean, let the kids
stay home from school.

225
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,240
Let them eat ice
cream for breakfast.

226
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,243
Today is not a normal day. You
don"t have to pretend that it is.

227
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,903
When is the last time
you ate something?

228
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,424
Come on.

229
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
So, um,

230
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,639
I did a thing,

231
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:17,711
and maybe you already know
because you were in the room,

232
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:21,335
but I kinda told Blue that
I love him while crying

233
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,994
and not in a "oh, it"s just allergies"
kind of way, and I know what you"d say.

234
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,179
"Who cares what you did?
You"re getting a good lay."

235
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,274
But that "s not why I"m here.

236
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,692
I"m here to work. And
now my job is on the line

237
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,176
because of what he did.

238
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:36,868
But I am also really glad
that you"re still alive.

239
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,042
You about done?

240
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,044
I need to check her lungs.

241
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,493
Uh, yeah.

242
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,437
Her ABG has improved.

243
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:57,233
Well, hopefully we can
pull the tube soon.

244
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,383
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,202
Uh, Dr. Webber, um,

246
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,620
Dr. Marsh mentioned that there would
be consequences for last night.

247
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,656
I was not as involved
as the others.

248
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:09,195
You can check the charts, check
the nurses, check everything.

249
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:13,387
Well, Dr. Millin, your name is
all over this patient"s chart.

250
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,115
Doctors cannot make objective decisions
on care when it comes to family.

251
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,740
You are this patient"s
medical proxy and doctor.

252
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,328
You are absolutely involved.

253
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,467
Excuse me.

254
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:29,438
CT scans show no further
source of infection.

255
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:31,164
Blood cultures and
path report, Yasuda?

256
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,510
Both should be updated now.

257
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,650
- Did Marsh assign you to this case?
- I did.

258
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,583
Yasuda, let"s proceed
with vascular checks.

259
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,493
Dr. Ndugu, I should tell you that the
interns are under review at the moment.

260
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,002
That is not my problem. Dr. Altman
is in critical condition.

261
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,764
We need surgeons watching
this room at all times.

262
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,041
No. Damn it.

263
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,363
It "s cold. There"s no pulse.

264
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,733
Give me the Doppler. Uh-huh.

265
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,498
Nope. No signal.

266
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,614
- Should I call for a CT angio?
- No, there"s no time.

267
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:00,987
Schmitt, call up to IR. Tell them to
prep for an endovascular embolectomy.

268
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,205
We need to get her in there
before she loses her leg.

269
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,715
- What should I do?
- You need to find Hunt. Let"s move.

270
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,376
No one go near the car.

271
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,380
What in the world?
<i>Obstacle detected.</i>

272
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:18,256
We got three in the rig, one unstable,
and the car"s obviously malfunctioning.

273
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,360
Until we can deactivate it,

274
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,973
we can"t safely
extricate the patients

275
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,778
without putting them
or ourselves in danger.

276
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,021
- Okay. Well, where"s the driver?
- Why is he in the back seat?

277
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,564
No, no, no. I"m not the driver.

278
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,186
<i>Malfunction.</i>
- It"s a RoGo.

279
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,844
- A what?
- It "s a RoGo. It"s a driver less rideshare.

280
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:34,089
I work for the company and we"re
beta testing a new SUV model.

281
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,918
Can someone get me out?

282
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:39,922
My arm is throbbing and Wayne
locked the doors and the window.

283
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,029
What... Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, it"s happening again.

284
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:46,687
- Can you shut it off?
- The car"s name is Wayne.

285
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,386
- They all have names.
- Turn Wayne off!

286
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,277
I "ve tried. Clearly
he"s not listening.

287
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,072
Wayne, power down.
Okay. Call inside.

288
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,180
Tell them that we need someone on
standby for his head lac and his arm.

289
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,286
Griffith, Adams. Are you
okay? Can you hear me?

290
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:01,357
- Dr. Grey?
- Yes, unexpected visit.

291
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:05,845
We"re fine, but... Mr...
Mr. Campbell isn"t.

292
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,398
His blood pressure"s tanking.

293
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,883
Okay. Well, heads up! There"s
gonna be another impact.

294
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:14,577
- Hey, when are we getting out of here?
- Car company"s headed here.

295
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:17,349
This is the third accident we"ve
reported to them in the last week.

296
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,730
- No, how long?
- Maybe 20 minutes?

297
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,034
Okay, we don"t have 20 minutes.

298
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,033
Have either one of you
run a trauma before?

299
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:22,931
- No.
- Why?

300
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:24,104
You seen one?

301
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,657
Of course.
- Time to do one.

302
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,281
The ambulance is now
your trauma room.

303
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:36,634
It started as a small tear in his
aorta caused from his accident.

304
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:39,982
And normally these things only
need to be closely monitored,

305
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,469
but in rare cases, they can rapidly
bleed before we"re able to repair it.

306
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:49,095
I worried for years.

307
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,153
Every time the phone rang,
my stomach would lurch

308
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,997
and I"d wonder if it was the air force
calling to tell me that he was dead.

309
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,345
He spent his life doing
death-defying things.

310
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,900
I know. He seemed in-incredible.

311
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,385
Yeah. He was.

312
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:09,523
So when I hear that he died in a hospital
surrounded by medical professionals

313
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,463
because you didn"t catch a
tear in his aorta on time,

314
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,154
I just don"t understand.

315
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,812
Uh, Mrs. Sutton, I know this
is very difficult for you...

316
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,950
Do you two have kids?

317
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,332
I do. Yes.

318
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,059
Then I don"t need to tell
you how I ache inside,

319
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,200
knowing that I"m still
here and my son is not.

320
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,893
Sam hated being in the hospital.

321
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,860
But he mentioned the
two of you and...

322
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,486
When he did,

323
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:39,145
it was clear that the two of
you meant something to him.

324
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,285
But...

325
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,183
Um... Oh.

326
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:46,221
For you, he was just
another patient, wasn"t he?

327
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,327
I... I have to take this.
It... It"s an emergency.

328
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:53,400
Mrs. Sutton, I am deeply
sorry for your loss.

329
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,545
- Okay. I ate. Feel better?
- Do you?

330
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,203
- I will after I check on the pit.
- Owen, you can"t go to work.

331
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,940
I need to make sure
my department"s okay.

332
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,483
Your department is aware of what
"s happening. They" re fine.

333
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:09,830
The ER is never fine, okay?

334
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,178
Owen, you can"t treat
patients right now.

335
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,214
I-I gave her a smoothie, Amelia.

336
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,368
The last moment I had with Teddy
was I gave her a stupid smoothie.

337
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,497
- Owen.
- She had a toothache from an infection

338
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:24,155
that went directly to her
heart, and I gave her a smoothie

339
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,985
and now she could die.

340
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:27,676
Dr. Ndugu sent me to find you.

341
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:37,997
You"re still here?

342
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:39,895
I follow instructions.

343
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,241
Since when?

344
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,039
I"m not an idiot.

345
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,697
I wouldn"t have ignored
any other patient"s DNI,

346
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,355
but you love Maxine,

347
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,653
and I know what it feels like
to lose someone you love.

348
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,878
I don"t want you to
have to go through that.

349
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:05,541
What?

350
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,716
We"ll talk later.

351
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,065
<i>Pedestrian...</i> What is happening?

352
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,654
Stupidity. Brace for impact!

353
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,173
It"s happening again!

354
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,106
<i>Obstacle detected.</i>

355
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,901
Cones usually work by
blocking the sensors.

356
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,421
The signal"s interrupted,
and the system"s shut down.

357
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,942
His arm is swollen, but I"m not
sure how you"re gonna examine him.

358
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,117
I used to have to worry
about teenagers driving.

359
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,895
Now we have to worry
about nobody driving?

360
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,568
It has collision
avoidance systems.

361
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:34,846
- There is no driver.
- Hey, can I help?

362
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:38,126
Look, you get this RoGo to stop,
and you can do whatever you want.

363
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,128
Talk to us! He"s about to code.

364
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,681
Adams is bolusing
him with fluids.

365
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,097
Is his abdomen rigid, distended?

366
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,235
Uh. Y-Yes.

367
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,927
Okay, low BP, distended, rigid.

368
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,250
- He"s bleeding internally.
- Yeah.

369
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,345
Okay, he needs an
emergency ex lap.

370
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,657
You"re gonna have to
find a scalpel and...

371
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:55,143
Oh, damn it. How
fast can you cut?

372
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:58,318
Because it appears that you
have about 30 seconds between...

373
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:01,459
That!

374
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:05,601
You-You want us
to open him? Yes.

375
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:06,982
In here? Yes!

376
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,064
- And then what?
- You"re gonna buy us some time,

377
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,888
so we can get him to the
OR and save his life.

378
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:12,953
Okay.

379
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,092
All right.

380
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,795
It"s likely a vegetation
that showered off

381
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,097
from the infected heart valve.

382
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,478
So, we"ll do an angio
and locate the occlusion.

383
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,791
We"ll fish out the clot
and reestablish blood flow.

384
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,864
Obviously, there"s a risk that
the clot could break into pieces,

385
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:30,074
but we"ll do everything in our
power so that that won"t happen.

386
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,973
You don"t have a lot of time.

387
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,219
Owen, Winston
needs your consent.

388
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,326
Hunt.

389
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,362
I"ve done hundreds
of embolectomies.

390
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,468
And if you don"t trust
me right now, I get it.

391
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,539
So trust your wife.

392
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:48,886
She"s the one who made
me chief of cardio.

393
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,202
Do the procedure.

394
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,765
Sir! Oh, no.

395
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,906
I need you to keep your arm...
keep your arm as still as possible.

396
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,425
It"s most likely fractured.

397
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,703
These cars were supposed to
have an override function,

398
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,049
like a button you push.

399
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,085
Yeah, uh-huh. Wayne seems
to be malfunctioning.

400
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:19,365
I"ve honestly never had to use it. Wayne
has always stopped when I need him to.

401
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:22,161
- He must be going through something today.
<i>- Sensors offline.</i>

402
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,060
Okay, did you find any
towels or ABD Pads?

403
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,855
Yes, a whole box.
- Okay, good.

404
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:30,030
You"re gonna need to
identify the xiphoid process,

405
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,205
and then make an
abdominal incision.

406
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:34,276
And whoever cuts, the
other one has to alternate

407
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:35,967
between bolusing
fluids and bagging.

408
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:37,693
Wayne!
- Okay, impact.

409
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,557
In a true trauma ex lap,

410
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,560
you should be able to get into
the abdomen with three quick cuts,

411
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,183
but it"s going to
take you longer.

412
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,219
Because we"re not in an OR?

413
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,565
Because you"re an intern.

414
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,429
Uh, uh, right.

415
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,811
Um, of course. Uh,
yeah. Okay, I"m ready.

416
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,823
- Wait. I don"t think we should do this.
- He"s dying.

417
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,160
Okay, brace for impact.

418
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,378
Lucas, please. We don"t
have the right tools, light.

419
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:01,398
We don"t have blood. Think about Sam.
Think about what happened last night.

420
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,121
- If we hadn"t opened him, could he be alive?
- I can"t do nothing!

421
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,998
I can"t have another death
on my hands because of you!

422
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,450
No, no, no. Come on.

423
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,626
We designed the AI tech to
simulate human decision-making.

424
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:17,008
Um, but of course there"s the whole
ethical issue of the trolley problem.

425
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:18,734
It looks more like
a car problem.

426
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,426
No, the-the trolley problem.

427
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:24,464
Does the, uh, trolley stop
to save one pedestrian,

428
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,466
thereby risking the
passengers inside?

429
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,986
Or does it prioritize
the passengers

430
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,299
and kill the
pedestrian? You know?

431
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,337
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Grey?
He"s in hemorrhagic shock.

432
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:38,098
Can we keep buying him time
with fluids without cutting?

433
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,893
If he codes, we"ll start CPR.

434
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,591
Okay, only you two can answer
that. You have eyes on the patient.

435
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:45,249
Well, he"s bleeding out. We have
to open him to try and stop it.

436
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:46,935
Impact!

437
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:48,833
Lucas.

438
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,870
If you"re gonna cut, do it now.
- Lucas.

439
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,045
No.

440
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,678
<i>Obstacle detected.</i>

441
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,852
You"re going to
encounter a lot of blood.

442
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,785
Don"t panic. Just keep packing.

443
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:11,304
Everyone, heads up!
- Okay, impact!

444
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:18,484
His BP"s bottoming out. He"s... He"s not
perfusing. I"m starting compressions.

445
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,945
Don"t put too much pressure on
the small bowel. You can injure...

446
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,889
It doesn"t matter if he"s
bled out before then.

447
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:26,146
Uh, bleeding"s coming from the liver,
but holding pressure isn"t helping.

448
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,605
Okay, then do a
Pringle maneuver.

449
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,218
- You ever done one?
- No. Have you?

450
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:31,082
Do they know how to
do a Pringle maneuver?

451
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,085
Okay. Clamp the
hepatoduodenal ligament.

452
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,398
It runs from the
duodenum to the liver.

453
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:39,194
- We have no clamps.
- Uh, two fingers can do it.

454
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,750
- All right. Just...
- I got it. Take over.

455
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:50,930
Okay.

456
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,727
Okay.

457
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,594
Portal vein, hepatic
artery, common bile duct.

458
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,630
I think I"m there. How
do I know if I"m there?

459
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,668
Well, once you apply pressure, the
BP should slowly start to rise.

460
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,877
There it is. Okay. Impact! No.

461
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,913
No! Turn the engine off.

462
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,538
Systolic"s holding in the 90s.

463
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:19,959
"You doin" okay?

464
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,109
Sensors in the tires.
- I won a Fox Award last night,

465
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,551
and today, I"m in the damn parking lot
teaching interns how to do an ex lap.

466
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,208
Well, as someone who learned
how to do an ex lap from you,

467
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,451
you"re very good at it.

468
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,937
Wait. What is...
What is he doing?

469
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,872
<i>Low tire pressure.</i>

470
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,116
Hey! <i>Low tire pressure.</i>

471
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:41,946
The sensors work!
- That worked?

472
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:44,432
Somebody get a gurney over
here. Right here. Come on.

473
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,295
Okay, we"re gonna
get you out of there.

474
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,586
- Say something.
- What?

475
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,909
Anything. Because I"m obsessing
over every possible complication,

476
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:06,315
so please just say something so I stop
visualizing Teddy having a stroke,

477
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:07,454
whatever"s in your head.

478
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:13,461
An infection in Teddy"s mouth led
to severe damage to her heart.

479
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,291
Two parts of the body completely
separate from one another.

480
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,363
You told me to say whatever
"s in my... I"m sorry.

481
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:26,750
I... It was making me think that
maybe Meredith isn"t insane.

482
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,855
This is not making
me feel better.

483
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:32,825
Meredith is hypothesizing that Alzheimer"s
might not be singularly connected

484
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,654
to plaque formation
in the brain.

485
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,208
What if it"s not caused by
anything in the brain at all?

486
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,466
- So what"s it caused by then?
- Well, I don"t know.

487
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:44,181
And the person I want to talk
to about it is not here anymore.

488
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,048
Let go of the smoothie, Owen.

489
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,779
I said awful and frustrating things
to Derek the last time I saw him,

490
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,160
and I agonized
over it constantly

491
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,475
until someone
convinced me to stop.

492
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,513
Yeah.

493
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:20,528
There. The clot"s causing a cutoff
at the right common femoral artery.

494
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,771
Is it? It"s huge.

495
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,325
It "s too big. I can"t get
it in there vascularly.

496
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,362
It"s too risky. We need
to do an arteriotomy.

497
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,675
I"m opening up her leg.
Yasuda, take the catheter out.

498
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,973
Please don"t die. Please
don"t die. Please don"t die.

499
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,058
Yasuda.
- Can... Can you repeat what you said?

500
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:37,096
No. Schmitt, take out the
catheter and hold pressure here.

501
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:40,030
- Yasuda, step back, take the vest off and go.
- Where?

502
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,768
Once I get into the artery, I"ll
need a Fogarty catheter, Schmitt.

503
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,517
Yasuda.

504
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,534
I"m gonna do this fast. If I don"t,
there won"t be a happy outcome.

505
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,837
So, if you"re feeling distracted by
personal feelings about this patient,

506
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,528
I need you gone too.

507
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,463
- I"m good.
- Scalpel.

508
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,543
Okay. Griffith, as soon
as we get in there,

509
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,761
they will place a vascular
clamp, and you can let go.

510
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:15,203
Type and cross for
blood and activate MTP.

511
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:18,482
We"re probably looking at
a high-grade liver injury.

512
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,866
So we"ll need a hybrid room
for possible angioembolization.

513
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,453
Hey, you scrubbing in?

514
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,562
- I am scrubbing in.
- Ah!

515
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,805
Okay.

516
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,893
I really don"t
understand what happened.

517
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,090
Wayne failed the test.

518
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,747
But the algorithms were working.

519
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:43,485
Well, your arm is
fractured into pieces,

520
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,411
and it"ll be weeks of
recovery after surgery.

521
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,556
Also, does your company know
how many car accident victims

522
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,020
pass through the
hospital every day?

523
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,653
Actually, it"s part of our
research. Very depressing.

524
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,277
Well, that number will significantly
increase with self-driving cars.

525
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:58,280
- More people will be injured, if not dead.
- Or the opposite.

526
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:02,181
Automation doesn"t just bring improved
customer satisfaction and efficiency.

527
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,460
It"s about safety. How many drivers
get in accidents because they"re tired,

528
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,428
distracted, angry at someone
who just cut them off?

529
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,191
Humans have feelings and feelings
don"t belong behind the wheel.

530
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,297
I-It only leads to bad
decision-making, errors and pain.

531
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,610
No, it leads to
compassion and connection.

532
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:19,308
Nobody cares about
those things anymore.

533
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,717
They do if they save lives.

534
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:23,340
Do you think you"ve saved more
lives than surgical robots?

535
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,138
- OR"s prepped and ready.
- Could someone check on Wayne?

536
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,356
Because no one has told me
where they"re towing him.

537
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,797
Kwan, track him down.

538
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,040
It"s not a "him." It"s a car.

539
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,354
It"s a car.

540
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:38,527
Thank you.

541
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,391
<i>Dr. Lloyd to Radiology.</i>

542
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,532
Um, I finished the rest of
your patient"s progress notes.

543
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:47,847
- Oh. Thank you, Millin.
- I also removed my name from Maxine"s chart as her doctor.

544
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:49,265
It was completely unprofessional

545
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,246
and I used bad judgment.
It won"t happen again.

546
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,967
Is there something
else you needed?

547
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,822
I was wondering if
you had reconsidered

548
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
putting in a good word
for me with Dr. Marsh.

549
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:01,654
No. I mean, you"re
taking accountability.

550
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,243
That"s not an easy thing. I
know that more than you know.

551
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:07,487
Accountability is what will allow you
to move forward after the mistake.

552
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,904
Ideally, you"ll never make
the same mistake again

553
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,631
because if you do, your
career might not survive it.

554
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,598
After what Kwan and Adams did,

555
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:17,325
I might not have a career.

556
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:19,983
You know what goes hand in hand
with accountability, don"t you?

557
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,157
Forgiveness.

558
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,918
Could you maybe tell
that to Dr. Marsh?

559
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,989
Dr. Webber, she"s ready.

560
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,576
Maxine"s ready to be extubated.

561
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,717
Oh, I-I-I will... I
will stay out here.

562
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:31,373
Okay.

563
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,758
Teddy"s in IR. Clot
in the femoral.

564
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:39,071
Well, I trust Ndugu.

565
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,806
Marsh doesn"t know what he
wants to do with these interns.

566
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:45,180
Been there. That job
is like parenting,

567
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:48,183
but interns won"t take care
of your things when you die.

568
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:52,394
Oh, I"m sorry, you think your
class wasn"t as bad as this one?

569
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:56,882
You all cut an LVAD wire
and that"s just one example.

570
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,781
You sabotaged clinical
trials. And look at me now.

571
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,541
Remember how you got there.

572
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,612
Hey! I "m lead,
you" re assisting.

573
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,615
The patient"s prepped and ready.
Massive transfusion protocol activated.

574
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:09,101
- After you place the clamp, you want us to leave?
- No.

575
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:11,931
Dr. Marsh said we weren"t
to... Forget about Marsh.

576
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:15,048
How are you supposed to learn to do
better if you"re not in the room, right?

577
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,152
Grey, you don"t work here.

578
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,696
Adams, go scrub.

579
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:20,284
Still giving me trouble.

580
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,804
Let me get in here.

581
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:26,705
Okay. Hold that there. Good.

582
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:28,603
All right, let"s get a clamp.

583
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,054
All right, on my
count, Griffith.

584
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:32,917
Here.

585
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,021
One.

586
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:35,472
Two. And three.

587
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:37,093
Got it.

588
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:43,480
<i>âª When the truth is
wrapped Around my neck âª</i>

589
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:45,240
<i>âª What happens now âª</i>

590
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:46,517
Fogarty catheter.

591
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,003
<i>âª What happens then âª</i>

592
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,341
We don"t have much time. We
have to reperfuse this leg.

593
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:53,904
Deploy the balloon.

594
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:02,948
<i>"âª It" s a cruel game
Of cause and effect âª</i>

595
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:06,606
<i>âª Such a cruel game âª</i>

596
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,816
<i>"âª But it" s not over yet âª</i>

597
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,306
Ah! There. You were
right. Liver lac.

598
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:19,102
Griffith, suction.

599
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,450
We need to try to do a
primary vascular repair.

600
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:26,626
<i>âª No stopping it, stopping
it Once it starts âª</i>

601
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,765
Hey.

602
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:29,388
Hey.

603
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,148
Are you okay?

604
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,360
- Mika?
- I... I don"t think I can sit.

605
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:40,226
<i>âª It gets me high
Yeah, it gets me low âª</i>

606
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,816
<i>"âª It" s a war Between
my head and my heart âª</i>

607
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,238
<i>"âª It" s a war âª</i>

608
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:56,380
<i>âª Between my head And my heart âª</i>

609
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:59,521
<i>"âª It" s a war âª</i>

610
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:02,179
<i>âª Between my head And my heart âª</i>

611
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:07,219
Yasuda. Is-Is Doctor
Altman... Is-Is she...

612
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,565
Where were you?

613
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,155
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

614
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:14,329
No. No, I"m not okay.

615
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,159
Where have you been?

616
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,402
You were one of Sam"s doctors.

617
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,060
You constantly reminded me
of it, and you weren"t there.

618
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,786
- Yasuda, I"m...
- No!

619
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:25,168
Where were you? I-I
genuinely want to know.

620
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:26,652
I need to know.

621
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,585
His blood is still on my shoes.

622
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:33,590
And my hands... my hands kept
Dr. Altman"s heart beating last night.

623
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,608
And I don"t even know
if she"s alive right now

624
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:37,421
because Ndugu kicked
me out of the IR suite.

625
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,975
I... I can"t focus.

626
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:43,738
I... I can"t think, and
I also might be fired.

627
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,120
From the only place that
would hire me as a surgeon.

628
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,743
We are interns.

629
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,540
You were supposed to be there when we
called, but we-we called and we paged,

630
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:54,887
and we hoped that someone
would come through those doors

631
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,855
and no one did until
it was too late.

632
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,187
People keep asking
me what"s next.

633
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:22,846
I thought I"d at least get
24 hours of taking it all in.

634
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:26,850
Well, how about taking over my
surgical cases for the next few days?

635
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,301
Uh. Everything okay?

636
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:34,202
You knocked a drink out of my
hand, yesterday on the plane.

637
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,965
And then last night I
ordered one after the awards.

638
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:40,036
I didn"t drink it.

639
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:43,660
I almost did. And it"s been in my
mind ever since it happened, and...

640
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:47,491
I don"t trust myself
in the OR right now.

641
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:48,941
I"m not sure I ever will.

642
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,529
Oh, you will.

643
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,463
And you"ve been here before,
and you know how to get back.

644
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,431
And starting over can be hard,

645
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:04,198
but it"ll remind you why
you have made it this far.

646
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,269
And don"t worry
about your surgeries.

647
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,166
Thanks, Bailey.

648
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:20,179
I successfully removed the clot and
restored circulation to her leg.

649
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:23,872
So we"ll keep her on heparin for now,
and then we"ll monitor her closely.

650
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,463
Thank you, really. Thank you.

651
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,638
I"ll go get you
some coffee. Okay.

652
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:41,383
All right, I"ve got the cue on vascular
checks and the coags, so you can go home.

653
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:44,376
Oh, but I"m the resident on
the case, and it"s Dr. Altman.

654
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,999
And you"ve been up all night,
so go home and get some rest.

655
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,520
Are you going to?

656
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:52,315
Go home before I change
my mind, Schmitt.

657
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,749
Hey.
- Hey.

658
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:13,992
How"s Teddy?

659
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,614
Uh, she still
hasn"t woken up yet.

660
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,133
You"re mad?

661
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,618
No.

662
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:21,344
Now you "re lying,
and you" re mad.

663
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,795
Look, I told them
not to move, okay?

664
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,153
I said they couldn"t touch
patients or practice medicine,

665
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:29,766
but instead of listening to
me, they screwed up again.

666
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:31,319
And this was different.

667
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:34,081
Yeah, right, this time, they
actually performed an ex lap.

668
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,083
Right, because the
patient was dying.

669
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:38,021
And I was right there
guiding them through it.

670
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,431
Yeah, Meredith,
you don"t get it.

671
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,709
If they keep screwing up
over and over and over again,

672
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,538
I can"t move to Boston.

673
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,782
What?

674
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
If the program"s falling apart,

675
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:49,234
I can"t leave in good
conscience. Okay?

676
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:51,270
Even if it is to be
with you, I can"t do it.

677
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,789
You hate Boston.

678
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes, I do. But, you
know, second chances.

679
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:03,489
Well, I don"t even know if I
still have a job in Boston.

680
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,629
Well, you do if you shut
up about your research.

681
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:08,701
Look, hey, you"ll find
a way. You always do.

682
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,980
You just talked two interns through an
ex lap inside of a crushed ambulance.

683
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,706
- You"ll find a way.
- I had help.

684
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,432
Mmm. Mmm.

685
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:21,300
What"s happening?

686
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:22,784
I have an idea. Oh.

687
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,371
Okay.

688
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,488
Dr. Webber extubated Maxine.

689
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,767
She is hungry,
talking and annoyed.

690
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,841
Hey, uh.

691
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:47,031
You wanna come over tonight?

692
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,638
I said I hated you.

693
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:51,434
I mean, I also said that I love
you, but I said that I hated you.

694
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:52,987
So what?

695
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,609
One cancels the other out?

696
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,336
What I"m saying is that I
clearly wasn"t making sense.

697
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,614
I was an emotional
mess because of Maxine

698
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:02,376
and vulnerability leads
to emotional extremes.

699
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,619
And I say both of those
things to a lot of people.

700
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,828
Like, as in now?

701
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:09,348
I don"t subscribe
to mononormativity.

702
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,626
And also I... I can"t
be walking around

703
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:14,974
worrying about disappointing the
one person I"m supposed to love.

704
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,011
I"m sorry if I gave
you the wrong idea.

705
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,047
No.

706
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,982
It "s... It"s a relief.

707
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,331
You know, that"s what I wanted to talk
to you about. I agree. It"s better.

708
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:27,539
Hmm.

709
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:29,920
You know, so things
won"t be weird.

710
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,543
Oh.

711
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:33,717
Well.

712
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,547
Great.

713
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,031
- Great.
- Mmm.

714
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,000
Do you or do you not
check your texts?

715
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,539
Marsh"s on his way
back to the lab.

716
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,532
Hey, uh, Bailey wants us to check
on the patient"s labs in an hour.

717
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,849
I"ve wanted one
thing my entire life.

718
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:05,403
This.

719
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,198
To be a surgeon.

720
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,064
And I could lose everything.

721
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:13,550
All I"ve worked for...
once again... because...

722
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,690
Say it, Simone.

723
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:19,073
Because of me.

724
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:22,007
Why did you agree to
help me last night?

725
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,216
You could"ve said no.

726
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,401
You could"ve run out of the
room and grabbed an attending,

727
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:28,065
but instead you grabbed
a pair of gloves.

728
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:29,739
Because I can"t say
no to you, Lucas.

729
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,881
We killed a man in
less than two minutes.

730
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:38,126
Good surgeons own their
failures. They apologize.

731
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,094
Why can "t you? Why can"t you

732
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:42,795
admit that what
we did was wrong?

733
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,960
Because it wasn"t.

734
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,376
I won"t apologize
for it, Simone.

735
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,276
I... I won"t ever
apologize for trying.

736
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:53,107
I don"t live with regrets.

737
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,045
I guess that"s where
you and I are different.

738
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:58,422
Do you regret us?

739
00:36:58,526 --> 00:36:59,526
No, I just...

740
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:02,634
You and me last night...

741
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:08,295
Everything"s happened so fast,
and I think I need a minute.

742
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:18,995
Yeah.

743
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:44,883
Do you feel guilty about Sam?

744
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,991
I feel badly about him.
Sam was our patient.

745
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:53,823
I know that I could"ve been
a better version of myself

746
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,480
around him, at moments, but...

747
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:56,618
But

748
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,930
we weren"t there.

749
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,485
We weren"t.

750
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:06,387
But Sam didn"t die because of
something we did or didn"t do.

751
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,147
He had a terrible complication

752
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,462
that some of the most talented
cardiothoracic surgeons can"t fix.

753
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,636
It just feels,

754
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:21,333
so wrong to be this happy when other
people will never get that chance again.

755
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:25,579
Why... Why do I
deserve all this?

756
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,890
Deserve you?

757
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:29,858
It"s just...

758
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:35,105
You have had a lifetime of hard.

759
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:39,351
And every time I"ve seen you go through
something awful, it broke my heart.

760
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:43,942
Because you are the fiercest,

761
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:45,737
kindest

762
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,329
smartest, most loyal
person. You"re...

763
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:59,440
Those years when we weren"t in each
other"s lives, those were dark years.

764
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:02,374
And I thought of you
every single day.

765
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:05,688
So we"ve been through too
much, together and apart.

766
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,898
You deserve this.

767
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,694
We deserve this.

768
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,076
And what if we don"t work out?

769
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,252
Uh, we"re gonna work out.

770
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:23,153
I just wasted 20 years of
my life not acting on it.

771
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,781
<i>Some people spend their lives
trying to make a dream come true.</i>

772
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,438
<i>âª Ooh, time is âª</i>

773
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,957
On the outside, um...

774
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:35,890
<i>âª Always on the run âª</i>

775
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,754
I didn"t break my sobriety.

776
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:41,068
But it feels like I did.

777
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:44,623
So I"m here to ask for
your help with a reset.

778
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:46,936
Tonight...

779
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:49,732
I"m one day sober.

780
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,810
<i>We set a goal and make a
plan on how to achieve it.</i>

781
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:12,168
Catherine. I"ll focus the
research back on the black.

782
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:13,549
Excuse me?

783
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,758
You gave me an opportunity
to make a difference,

784
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,691
and that is what I will do.

785
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,451
I will stick with
what"s being funded.

786
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:21,280
You win.

787
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,214
<i>It works for some people.</i>

788
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,494
I always do.

789
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:31,187
<i>"But for others,
it" s not so easy.</i>

790
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,504
Hey.
- Hi.

791
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,195
Well, I got your text.

792
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,853
What is this mysterious favor?

793
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,164
My research.

794
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:47,583
I have, uh... I have
papers, I have proposals.

795
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:52,001
I have notes from phone calls with
neuroscientists from around the country.

796
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:54,728
I"ve gotten a little further
than I"d led you to believe.

797
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,215
And what do you want from me?

798
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:01,148
I need you to help
me keep it going.

799
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:04,254
But nobody can know.

800
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,084
<i>As hard as you work
toward the dream,</i>

801
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:09,432
<i>it can feel like the whole
world has plotted against you.</i>

802
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,643
<i>âª We only go in One direction âª</i>

803
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:16,819
<i>As you get further away from it,</i>

804
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>you cling to any sign of hope.</i>

805
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,894
Hey. Teddy.

806
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,760
<i>âª Hold me steady âª</i>

807
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:29,589
What, um...

808
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,179
What happened?

809
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:40,498
<i>âª Hold me steady âª</i>

810
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:42,292
Hey.

811
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:48,851
<i>And the longer it takes and
the more it costs you...</i>

812
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:50,438
Hey. Hi.

813
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:52,786
<i>You start to consider
whether you should give up.</i>

814
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:02,554
You all still work
here. Oh, thank God.

815
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:07,801
Uh, but I no longer do. I"m leaving,
but it"s not because of you.

816
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,941
I, uh... Despite what
I said this morning,

817
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,943
I-I still believe in
you. I always will.

818
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:15,084
And I "m not worried because I"m
leaving you in very capable hands.

819
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:19,537
Who? <i>Do you find a new dream?</i>

820
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:25,404
<i>Or do you stick to the one that started
you on this journey in the first place?</i>

821
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:31,272
I have five rules.
