1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:04,156
<i>The human brain contains
roughly 100 billion neurons.</i>

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:07,506
<i>Alone, these neurons
would only allow us to retain</i>

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,695
<i>about as much information
as a flash drive.</i>

4
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:16,287
<i>Fortunately for us, our
neurons connect and combine,</i>

5
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:20,507
<i>creating a web that exponentially
increases the brain's storage capacity.</i>

6
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:22,546
It is so peaceful up here.

7
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,763
Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:25,328
It's great.

9
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,330
Yeah. According to the map,

10
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:30,267
- the waterfall is just around the bend.
- Okay.

11
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,981
<i>In fact, this
process creates so much space</i>

12
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:36,948
<i>that we can store the equivalent of
three million hours of video content.</i>

13
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,475
Um... No waterfall.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,345
Did I read this wrong? I
mean, that is a waterfall, right?

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,508
Yeah, yeah. But the map also
rates this trail as moderately difficult.

16
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,993
I'm sorry. This was
supposed to be a fun day off.

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,167
No, I am having fun.

18
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,909
Mud on the boots, fresh air.

19
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:56,671
It's the great outdoors, right?
Let's go. Okay.

20
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:00,416
<i>So, why can't we remember
everything we try to commit to memory?</i>

21
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,669
"Following
resection of the ileum,

22
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:09,503
a patient is most likely to require
supplementation of which vitamin?"

23
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,503
B12.

24
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,597
Round starts in five minutes.
Coffee takes longer.

25
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:18,048
Yesterday, she yelled at me
for going to the bathroom.

26
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,408
Well, everyone is on edge
because the ABSITE's tomorrow.

27
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,868
Or because she's
not getting laid.

28
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,654
I'm not getting any either.

29
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:26,448
That'll be 4.85, please.
- Wow.

30
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:27,768
Oh. Uh, yes.

31
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,963
I swear my wallet is
in here somewhere.

32
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:33,271
Hey, let me get it.
Do you want breakfast?

33
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,465
I'm in an unhealthy relationship
with these almond croissants.

34
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:37,104
Uh. No, you
really don't have to.

35
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:38,605
I know. I want to.

36
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:40,604
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,234
What?

38
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,376
She bought me coffee.

39
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,594
Yeah. Maybe she was being nice.

40
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,467
Or weird.

41
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,149
I don't have time
for whatever this is.

42
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,579
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

43
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,276
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

44
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:03,093
I've been texting.

45
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,659
I'm on your service today.

46
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:07,954
- I think we can downgrade Mr.
- Quint from... -Just...

47
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,690
I'm practicing my
speech to Altman in my head.

48
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,339
I am quitting general
as soon as she gets here.

49
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:14,511
Altman's off today.

50
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:15,772
No. What?

51
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:18,022
I was up all night rehearsing.

52
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:22,032
You could channel all that energy into
signing off on Mr. Quint's step-down room.

53
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,716
Also, Mrs. Valenti still looks distended,
so you might wanna order a CT.

54
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,411
Also, did you review the
nurse's notes from last night?

55
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,200
Did you forget how this works?

56
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,065
I tell you what to do.

57
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:36,058
- Now, go do all that.
- Then what are you gonna do?

58
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,253
I'm gonna stew thinking about how
long it took my resident to do what I asked.

59
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,620
Crap rolls downhill,
Schmitt. Go.

60
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,407
And they wonder where I get
my tone of voice.

61
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,058
Out of my way.

62
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:53,285
I was here until 11:00
last night doing rectals.

63
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,245
A heads-up would have been nice
before dumping Helm.

64
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,656
I didn't dump anyone.
I just needed space.

65
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:59,516
Walk faster.

66
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,727
- She's like a pissed off bee.
- I finished my procedure log.

67
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,654
Sorry it took a minute.
I was studying for the ABSITE...

68
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,281
Just hand it to me, Griffith.

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,258
You're supposed to
submit that to me or Schmitt,

70
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,951
but why start
following the rules now?

71
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,831
Well, congratulations.

72
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,625
In under two months,

73
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:17,267
you have collectively done
dozens of A-lines,

74
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,502
chest tubes and other
critical procedures.

75
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,865
And I know it is not how
you wanted to spend your time,

76
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,382
but you went back to basics,

77
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,709
worked together, and
you're ready to move forward.

78
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,558
Does that mean we're allowed
back in the OR?

79
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,051
Effective immediately.

80
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:33,316
Wait, can I please
scrub in on Dorian's...

81
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,176
I was on his case
from the day he got here.

82
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:37,541
Have I given the impression
that this is a democracy?

83
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,023
Helm.

84
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:41,666
Griffith and Adams,
you're with Dr. Bailey.

85
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,060
Millin, with Shepherd.

86
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,575
Yasuda, Ndugu. Kwan, Lincoln.

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,602
Oh, uh... And study
when you can today.

88
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,053
If you don't score above
the 30th percentile

89
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,913
on your exam tomorrow,

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,525
Joe's is hiring.

91
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,757
I actually loved that job,
so joke's on her.

92
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,396
Keep up with your notes and pages
and please don't kill anyone in the OR.

93
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:00,677
Yeah.

94
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:01,736
Go.

95
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,042
How we doing this morning?

96
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,726
My lung is still collapsed,

97
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,854
but I'm having
a great hair day, so...

98
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,526
I'll take it. Yasuda.

99
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,125
Emmy Chen, 16,
born with cystic fibrosis.

100
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,570
Admitted for a persisting
left pneumothorax.

101
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:21,698
Currently on Mucomyst
and two-liters nasal cannula.

102
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:23,000
I've had way worse.

103
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:25,239
Tomorrow, she will
undergo a VATS pleurodesis

104
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,035
to irritate the outside lining
of the lung and chest wall.

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,514
No way I'm consenting to that.

106
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:31,906
We've talked about this.

107
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,527
- You and your parents agreed.
- My body, my choice.

108
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,594
For the tenth time, that's
not how you use that phrase.

109
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:39,222
And your body is leaking air
from your lung into your chest.

110
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,684
So listen to Dr. Ndugu.

111
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,957
- Hi, Caroline.
- Hi.

112
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,084
I'm Dr. Beltran.
This is Dr. Millin.

113
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,662
And I'm Emmy.

114
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,838
And unfortunately,
peds is a full house today,

115
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,065
so welcome to Emmy's world.

116
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,525
- We're just living in it.
- Hi.

117
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:54,327
- Hi. You must be Diane. How was your trip?
- Easy.

118
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,456
And thank you again
so much for seeing us.

119
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,612
We've heard great things about
you from our support group.

120
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,639
Well, I hope I can
live up to the reputation.

121
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,341
Can I take a look?

122
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,476
You're better than
the first doctor we saw.

123
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:07,686
He was super judgy.

124
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,545
Safe space here.

125
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,255
We can hear you, Emmy.

126
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,490
That doctor judged
me for being trans.

127
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,952
Yep. Most doctors suck.

128
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,809
Thank you, Emmy.

129
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:18,864
Millin, present.

130
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,702
Uh, Caroline Early, 14,

131
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,163
presents with progressive
discomfort behind the left knee.

132
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:26,191
Diagnostic ultrasound at an
outside facility showed a lipoma,

133
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:28,032
scheduled today for an excision.

134
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,765
Your last scans
were a couple months ago,

135
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,210
so I wanna get an MRI
and just repeat ultrasound

136
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:34,071
just to make sure
nothing was overlooked, okay?

137
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,211
- Okay.
- We'll be back for you soon, okay?

138
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,271
Thanks.

139
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,538
Dr. Griffith, present.

140
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:47,249
Dorian Cardenas, hospital
day 55, transferred back...

141
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,776
Fifty-six.

142
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:54,058
Fifty-six. Transferred back to
the ICU after recurrent sepsis

143
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,702
and high-output enterocutaneous
fistula. Treated with IV antibiotics.

144
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:59,396
Has since recovered
from the infection.

145
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,893
Scheduled today for a laparotomy
and takedown of the EC fistula.

146
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,102
Hey, it's a good day.

147
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:06,268
You ready for surgery?

148
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,597
Does anyone answer "yes"
to that question?

149
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,541
You okay with an abdominal exam?

150
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,734
Whatever.

151
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,279
It looks like 320 ccs overnight.

152
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:17,514
Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,280
How exactly does
this surgery work?

154
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:23,475
As you know, Dorian's skin
and small bowel are connected.

155
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,891
So today, we are going to remove
that connection

156
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,819
and while we're at it, we're going
to try and reverse his ostomy.

157
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,395
Wait, really?

158
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,089
You are young.

159
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:36,706
Your nutritional markers are where
we want them, so we're gonna try.

160
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,767
One step closer
to a cheeseburger.

161
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,794
I'll believe it when I eat it.

162
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,033
Maybe we should
just give up on the waterfall.

163
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:48,593
Wait, I... I've
seen this tree before.

164
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:50,938
Are we... Are we
going in a circle?

165
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,050
Rosie!

166
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,971
- Rosie!
- Dad, help me, please!

167
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,421
Please help me. My ankle.

168
00:06:58,588 --> 00:06:59,589
What happened?

169
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,291
My daughter fell. Please help.

170
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,620
Did people
come? Can they help us?

171
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,585
Rosie, my name's Owen.
This is my wife, Teddy.

172
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,542
We're both doctors. We're
gonna figure this out, okay?

173
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,001
All right. No service.
I'm gonna go down and call 911.

174
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,543
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Rosie,

175
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,636
can you move your
arms and your legs?

176
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,105
Yeah, but my ankle
really hurts though.

177
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,323
Okay. Try to keep your
weight off it and stay calm.

178
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:17,640
Is that a joke?

179
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,317
Sense of humor's still intact.

180
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:21,378
Okay. Once we get
the park rangers on the phone,

181
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,847
there'll be help
in less than ten minutes.

182
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,481
- I'm on a ledge!
- Try not to move too much, okay?

183
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,753
- Dad!
- I'm here, honey! I'm here!

184
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,215
Hold on. We're
trying to get help.

185
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:28,953
How am I gonna get out of here?

186
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:30,511
Hold on!
I'm gonna get you out!

187
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,339
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm coming, Rosie!

188
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:33,456
- Sir, wait!
- Dad, no! Dad!

189
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,025
No, no, no!

190
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,847
- Joseph, are you hurt?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

191
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,044
I cut my leg.

192
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,444
It's... It's pretty bad!

193
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,113
- Rosie, I need you to take a look.
- Okay.

194
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:58,085
No, I don't... I don't think I can.
We're on the edge of a huge drop!

195
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,088
- I need you to tell me what you see.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

196
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,193
Oh, my God.
He's gushing blood.

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,195
When you say "gushing," do
you mean it's slow and steady?

198
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,864
I mean gushing!

199
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,133
We're gonna need to try
and stop the bleeding, okay?

200
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,102
Is help on the way?
- Not yet.

201
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,705
Until then, you're gonna need to
try and help him yourself, okay?

202
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,140
Now, there are three steps
to controlling bleeding:

203
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,976
apply pressure, pack the wound,
and applying a tourniquet.

204
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:25,578
God, I didn't even want to come
on this stupid hike!

205
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,115
Right now you need to listen to me.
Do you have a shirt that you can use?

206
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,650
You need to take that off and use it
to apply pressure in your dad's wound.

207
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:32,720
Okay.

208
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,823
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay. Okay.

209
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,144
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

210
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,564
It's not helping!

211
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,967
Pack the wound with some kind of
fabric. You can use the same shirt.

212
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,335
You need to stuff that
completely inside the wound.

213
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,670
Pack it as tightly as possible.

214
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,075
This doesn't seem sanitary.

215
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,642
- You don't have any options.
- Okay.

216
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,244
- Rosie.
- Okay.

217
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,480
- Okay, it's in.
- Okay, good.

218
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:04,151
Now, press down as hard as you can.
We need steady and direct pressure.

219
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:05,351
Okay.

220
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,520
Okay. Okay.

221
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:09,823
Are you still there?

222
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm still here. I'm
not going anywhere.

223
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,493
Come on, Teddy. Come on.

224
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,765
You're almost done.

225
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,599
Could you try not to
move around as much?

226
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,301
How are we not done
yet? This is torture.

227
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,305
Caroline,
are you a betting woman?

228
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,942
I don't know. Maybe.

229
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:32,512
All right. If this scan isn't done
by the time you count to a hundred,

230
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,614
I will give you $100.

231
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,682
I could buy
so much embroidery floss.

232
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,384
Are you into crafting?

233
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,988
I make friendship bracelets.
Usually during my study hall.

234
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,825
I can focus on tying all these tiny
knots and it's like I'm not even there.

235
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:48,028
Well, your friends are lucky that your
hobby makes them such cool accessories.

236
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:52,365
- I'm gonna start counting!
- Too late. We're done.

237
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:53,533
You can relax now.

238
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:56,737
Okay. What are we
looking at here?

239
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,873
Well, there's not enough
fat deposits for a lipoma.

240
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,843
There's a nerve running through
it. Is that a neurofibroma?

241
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,577
That I did not bet on.

242
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:19,059
Which of the following is an absolute
contraindication to administration of TPA?

243
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,728
Uncontrolled hypertension,
recent spinal surgery or the...

244
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,163
Yeah. I don't
wanna study right now.

245
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,868
Calms me down. Think I'm
nervous to be back in the OR.

246
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,169
Are you?

247
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,369
No.

248
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,112
Kwan, our hip replacement
got pushed a few hours,

249
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,881
so you can go ahead
and keep studying.

250
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:42,783
What are you doing?

251
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,253
I, um, am fixing a sock.

252
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,922
- You're taking the ABSITE tomorrow.
- Yes.

253
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,458
You asked me not to do op notes so
that you could have time to prepare.

254
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,194
And I appreciate the time.

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,231
Which you're
using to fix a sock.

256
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,300
Yeah, it's... Um...

257
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,971
- It's...
- Lucky?

258
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,939
Would it be weird if I said yes?

259
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,876
- You're Serena Williams.
- I'm not following.

260
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,444
She's got a thing about socks. She
won't change 'em during a tournament.

261
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,479
She won't even wash
'em if she's winning.

262
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:17,718
You know how many athletes have
lucky socks or shorts or beards?

263
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,954
You're in good company, Kwan.

264
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,789
You just got one problem.

265
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,324
You need your op notes sooner?

266
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,424
No.

267
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,492
The gauze.

268
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,895
It'll never hold up.

269
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,898
Let me see that.

270
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,735
So the lesion
looks benign, but...

271
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,303
There is always a "but."

272
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:38,338
Hey!

273
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:42,943
Unfortunately, it's not a lipoma
like your primary doctor thought.

274
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,477
It's most likely a neurofibroma,

275
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:47,247
which is a spontaneous growth
in the nerve tissue,

276
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:48,849
and it can damage
the nerve itself.

277
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,416
Which is why you're
experiencing pain.

278
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,418
- So, can you still remove it?
- Yes.

279
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,021
But we need the help
of the neurosurgeon,

280
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:55,989
which is why my friend
Dr. Shepherd is here.

281
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,190
Hi, Caroline.

282
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:58,859
Hi.

283
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,195
Is... Uh...

284
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:03,764
I'm sorry. With all due respect,

285
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,667
we came here from Texas
to work with Dr. Beltran.

286
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:12,873
We discussed limiting the number
of physicians for Caroline's comfort.

287
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,044
Yes, I know. But we need someone
extremely skilled at preserving nerve tissue

288
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,879
to do the actual procedure.

289
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,547
Dr. Shepherd and I have
collaborated on a number of patients,

290
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:25,484
so I know she's the best. If I needed
a neurosurgeon, she's who I'd choose.

291
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,955
Plus, she's really good
at <i>Gem Crush.</i>

292
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,456
I don't know.
This wasn't the plan.

293
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:31,657
You can say no.

294
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,698
Can... Can we just have a second?

295
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,234
Please don't take
this personally.

296
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,804
- No, of course.
- Yeah. We'll give you some time.

297
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,044
Almost through the fascia.

298
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:54,348
Okay.

299
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:56,183
Let's see what we've got.

300
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,384
Damn it.

301
00:12:58,584 --> 00:12:59,920
Griffith, Adams.

302
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,855
What is that?
Are those adhesions?

303
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:04,490
- It's like one giant massive scar tissue.
- Which is known as?

304
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:07,327
Frozen abdomen. But why
didn't we see this on the scans?

305
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,996
Sometimes you don't see
a frozen abdomen

306
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,064
until they're
staring you in the face.

307
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,003
Okay. This is going
to be a long ride.

308
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,238
If the two of you feel the need
to step out

309
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:21,942
and study for your exam, no
one in here will question that.

310
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,276
But I need to know now.

311
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:26,113
Dorian cannot have
distraction in here.

312
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,206
I cannot have
distraction in here.

313
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:31,787
Then buckle up.

314
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,395
Right angle.

315
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,888
I'm gonna need traction.

316
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:37,909
- How's it looking? Any improvement?
- Oh, God.

317
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:40,263
It's better, but he's still
bleeding through the packing.

318
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:41,973
I finally got
through. Help is on its way.

319
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:43,667
Where is the dad?

320
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,944
You have got to be kidding me.
Is he injured?

321
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:48,470
Well, I can't see from this angle,
but Rosie says it's a leg wound.

322
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,315
Lot of blood,
possible femoral injuries.

323
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,809
There's blood everywhere!
How does he have any left?

324
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:54,945
Maybe I should just try
to slide down there and...

325
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:57,948
And gravely injure yourself so the
EMTs have to send another team? Hell no.

326
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,317
He could die. He needs a...

327
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,193
Rosie, do you have a belt?

328
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,187
I'm wearing yoga pants.

329
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,925
Okay. That would be a "no."

330
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,967
- Anything with a strap?
- Yeah, I have a small fanny pack.

331
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,135
Does the strap come off?

332
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,695
- Yeah.
- Okay, that'll work.

333
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,470
You're gonna make a tourniquet
for your dad's leg.

334
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,974
You'll rap it around his leg
right above the wound,

335
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,335
and you're gonna tie it
as tightly as you can.

336
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,154
It's okay.

337
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,023
Okay.

338
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:24,708
Okay.

339
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,451
I'm sorry. I'm done.

340
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,045
Okay. Now, can
you see any sticks?

341
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:30,823
Uh... Uh...

342
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,158
- Yeah. Yeah, there's one right here.
- Okay, now take the stick,

343
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,327
and tie it to the tourniquet
right where the knot is.

344
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:38,029
You're gonna twist that stick
and it'll tighten the strap.

345
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:39,089
- Rosie.
- Okay.

346
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:43,523
Okay, I'm twisting.

347
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,021
- It's getting tighter.
- Great. You're doing great.

348
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:48,882
Just keep going
until the bleeding stops.

349
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,392
I think...

350
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,302
I think it stopped.

351
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:54,737
Great work, Rosie.
Now hold that in place.

352
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,103
Help is on the way.

353
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,408
Just hang tight, okay?

354
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,943
Okay.
Griffith, get the Metz.

355
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:07,057
You're gonna take
down the adhesions.

356
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,120
I'm not sure I can see where the
adhesions end and the intestine begins.

357
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,014
You want me to change my mind?

358
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,155
Metz, please.

359
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,050
All right.
Nice and easy.

360
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,944
One layer at a time.

361
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:22,528
Never go any deeper than what
I show you with my right angle.

362
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:23,599
Okay.

363
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:26,582
- Good.
- We've barely made a dent

364
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:27,442
in this dissection.

365
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,389
Griffith is doing just fine.

366
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:30,882
Do you think we should continue?

367
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,706
Dorian's had complication
after complication.

368
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:37,284
We can't even see. If you go further,
you could cause even more damage.

369
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,581
He was dead on
the first day here.

370
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,942
Kwan held his heart
in his hands.

371
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,745
He's had multiple
cases of sepsis.

372
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,475
I've opened him bedside as he
was dying, but he's still here.

373
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,228
He's holding on. So,

374
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:53,707
I am too.

375
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,730
I see things through.
I am seeing this through.

376
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:58,534
Okay.

377
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:02,939
Okay.

378
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,824
All right, Griffith.

379
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,743
They came a long way to see you.

380
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,811
That must be flattering.

381
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,046
It's enraging.

382
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,609
Caroline shouldn't
have to travel

383
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:15,971
to see a doctor
who treats her with respect.

384
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,389
You didn't wanna stay in Texas,
try to help more kids there?

385
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,291
You know, as much as I hate it,

386
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,229
I think maybe it is safer
for them to come see me here.

387
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:29,898
I mean, it's just
gotten so hostile.

388
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,670
Forget the awkward
stares and the microaggressions.

389
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,774
One family was talking about
putting a bulletproof vest on their son

390
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,642
just to come see me
because he's trans.

391
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,244
That is...

392
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,446
Yeah, there's no
words to describe it.

393
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,150
Hopefully Caroline's
mom will talk to her.

394
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:48,818
And Emmy won't.

395
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,188
Have you seen Emmy Chen?
She's not in her room.

396
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,590
- Yeah. She's kind of a wanderer.
- Well, thanks for the heads-up.

397
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,826
- You two wanna help me find her?
- We're about to prep a patient.

398
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,529
Oh, you won't be if it's
Caroline. She's also gone.

399
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,697
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Okay.

400
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:08,838
The elastic bandage
is the most underrated dressing.

401
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:14,677
It controls swelling, eases
pain, and it's durable and flexible.

402
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:17,613
Everything you
could want in a sock.

403
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:20,216
How's your
continuous suturing skills?

404
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,686
- Even distance. Decent tension.
- Great. What kind of suture?

405
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:27,790
2-0 silk. Strong and permanent.

406
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,492
Yeah, works for me. Let's do it.

407
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,497
They're moving Mr. Quint now.

408
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:37,066
So once he's settled, make sure
you check his white count again.

409
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,801
And track down Dr. Wilson.

410
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,904
Make sure she sees that we
schedule Mrs. Price's chole.

411
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,872
Can I scrub in on that?

412
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:46,334
Did you hear anything I said
before "chole"?

413
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,016
Technically I'm on
Dr. Ndugu's service.

414
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,779
Crap rolls downhill, Yasuda.

415
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,148
Yasuda, did you
see Dr. Ndugu's text?

416
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:53,983
Gotta go. Sorry.

417
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,754
- Emmy and Caroline are missing.
- Oh? Maybe they scrubbed in on a surgery.

418
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,715
All the cool kids are doing it,
except for me.

419
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,660
Well, at least you have
more time to study.

420
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:06,301
I have a photographic memory.
I don't need to study.

421
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,228
I need to cut. I deserve to cut.

422
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,387
Entitled much?

423
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,504
I finished my
procedure log weeks ago

424
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,402
and then I had to wait patiently
for everyone else to finish theirs.

425
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:16,105
- That was you being patient?
- Yeah.

426
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,399
And now that all the
bottom-feeders are finally done,

427
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,105
I can't scrub in
to save my life.

428
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:21,973
I... I am dying here.

429
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,568
Well, on behalf of all the
bottom-feeders, my sincerest condolences.

430
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,185
Did Ndugu check
the attendings' lounge?

431
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,353
What, you think
they'd let themselves in?

432
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,645
I put nothing past Emmy Chen.

433
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,672
She's been my problem
child since day one.

434
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:35,934
You sound like my mom.

435
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,261
I was not an easy kid.

436
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,096
I thought she was hazing me
my first week here.

437
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:43,766
She paged me 20 times just
to look at one TikTok video.

438
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,035
And it turns out
her parents work,

439
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:48,871
and they have two other kids,
so she's alone a lot.

440
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,806
I've spent more than a
few dinners in her room.

441
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:53,276
She's a headache,
but she's my favorite headache.

442
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:55,478
Reminds me of me at that age.
Stubborn as hell.

443
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:56,947
We probably
would have been friends.

444
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,649
Hmm. Probably not.

445
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:02,752
Seriously? You know you're not
supposed to eat before your procedure.

446
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:05,111
She knows. We're not idiots.
They're for later.

447
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,753
- And you shouldn't be out of your bed.
- It's my fault.

448
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,705
I just wanted to take a snack,
and we didn't have time...

449
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:12,356
- Emmy! Emmy?
- Emmy! Emmy, Emmy.

450
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,597
- Emmy, are you okay?
- We need oxygen and a gurney.

451
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,432
Give me
her head. Come on.

452
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:17,291
Stay with me.

453
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,403
Emmy.

454
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:25,233
Hunt?

455
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:28,120
Joseph Scott, 47 year-old male. 
Status: post fall into a cave

456
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,082
Sustained a left leg
puncture wound from a rock.

457
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,433
Arterial bleeding
with significant blood loss.

458
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,327
Controlled with a tourniquet
and packing in the field.

459
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,122
No other injuries
or head traumas.

460
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,382
And Altman.

461
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:38,757
Right. What do we got?

462
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,017
Rosie Scott, 19-year-old female.

463
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,130
Status: post fall
into the same cave.

464
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:46,832
Isolated left ankle injury.
Awake and alert. Vitals are stable.

465
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,101
- How's my dad? Is he okay?
- He's tough. He's hanging on, okay?

466
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:51,169
Let's do a workup on her ankle.

467
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,138
Gonna get him straight up to the
OR, okay? Rosie, he's in good hands.

468
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:54,640
We'll update you
as soon as we can.

469
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,475
Hell of a way to
spend your day off.

470
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,244
All right. Kwan,
let's get her inside.

471
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:02,915
What if she hates me? It was
my idea to leave the room.

472
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,750
It's gonna be okay.
She's getting help.

473
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,252
Take a deep breath for me, okay?

474
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,687
Good, good. Okay.

475
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,689
Welcome back. Welcome back.

476
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,025
All right. Let's go.

477
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,694
We gotta get your chest tube
hooked back up to suction, okay?

478
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,464
What's wrong?
You're scared? It's okay.

479
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:22,302
No, no, no. Leave it on.
I'll try to name it. What is it?

480
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,970
The pneumothorax?
You're scared it's worse?

481
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:28,173
Okay. You're scared
you won't recover?

482
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:29,875
You will. I got you.

483
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,177
I'm here. So is Caroline.

484
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,179
We're all here. We just
want you to be safe, okay?

485
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,316
But I swear
I'm gonna put a tracker on you.

486
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,463
- That's all connected to the... -Stop talking.
- I'm thinking.

487
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeah, it's not gonna work.

488
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,135
We'd have to take
too much of his bowel...

489
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:00,138
- Wait. But you said that...
- Yeah, I know what I said.

490
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:04,176
But the amount of bowel he has
is far less than what we thought.

491
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:07,145
Look, there's friable bowel
around the fistula.

492
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,417
After we resect this area and
get to healthy bowel...

493
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,485
he'll be worse off
than when we started.

494
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,322
Could we put him on medication
for short bowel syndrome?

495
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:21,159
That could help, but he still doesn't
have enough bowel to keep him off TPN.

496
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,096
We did all this, and now Dorian's
gonna have to get all his nutrition

497
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,164
from an IV bag for
the rest of his life?

498
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,066
- He's 23.
- Adams.

499
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:29,935
No, no. He'll end up in liver
failure by the time he's 30.

500
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,437
Do you think I don't know that?

501
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:34,539
Do you think I'm at
all okay with that?

502
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,612
In pediatric cases
of short gut syndrome,

503
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,915
which of the following techniques
increases residual bowel by 20%?

504
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:48,587
Dr. Griffith, the OR is not a place to
quiz yourself on your ABSITE exam.

505
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:52,958
A serial transverse
enteroplasty procedure.

506
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,560
A STEP procedure.

507
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,363
Tell me what it is, Griffith.

508
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,898
You cut the residual
intestine in a zigzag fashion.

509
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,367
And why do we do that?

510
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,068
To lengthen it
and help increase absorption.

511
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,405
But it is not the standard
of care for an adult.

512
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,275
Because most of the research
on it focuses on pediatric patients.

513
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,645
And nothing this man has
gone through has been standard.

514
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,415
Change of plans.

515
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,483
Adams, switch with Dr. Webber.

516
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,819
We are converting
to a STEP procedure.

517
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,155
Follow my lead. Do
exactly as I say.

518
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,892
I'm gonna need a GIA stapler
and multiple reloads.

519
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:34,933
Hi. Put a rush on these and
text me their BPs every two hours.

520
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,503
I thought you were meeting me
in the ICU to remove drains.

521
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,339
Yeah, I'm just checking on a few
postpartum moms from yesterday.

522
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,007
But you're in navy scrubs.

523
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,342
Oh, right. I forgot.

524
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,010
When I change my scrubs,

525
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,280
I just forget about all my
patients from the day before.

526
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:48,947
Also, I checked your notes.

527
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,350
Half the things I told you to do
you gave to the interns.

528
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:54,186
I supervised them because
I'm a supervisor. Are you?

529
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:55,821
If you need help
removing drains,

530
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,090
we have bigger problems
than you just being annoying.

531
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,193
Bailey and Webber are still in surgery,
so I'm also covering their patients,

532
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,794
and studying for the ABSITE.

533
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,796
Okay. Are you having
the same conversation with them?

534
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:06,998
You haven't quit yet.

535
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,436
You made this decision, like,
48 hours ago,

536
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,037
and you've already checked out.

537
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,611
Hey. Your mom said
you wanted to see us?

538
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:22,681
Yeah. I still haven't decided
on the surgery, though.

539
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,149
Mmm.

540
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:25,951
Well, that's okay.
Do you have questions?

541
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:28,153
Emmy's been gone a while.

542
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,689
Oh, yeah. She just
needed to get some tests done.

543
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,791
I'm making her a bracelet.

544
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,627
I didn't know her favorite
colors, so I chose mine.

545
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:36,695
Green and purple.

546
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,531
Caroline, we do wanna help you.

547
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:43,668
That thing Emmy did,
can I do that?

548
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,338
Where you say what
you're scared of?

549
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,739
Oh, sure.

550
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:51,643
Emmy and I usually take
turns though, so I'll go first.

551
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,480
Um...

552
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:58,850
I am scared of forgetting
my patients' parents' names.

553
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,554
So I write them on my hand.

554
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,323
I'm scared

555
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,725
I won't recover from surgery
in time for the spring dance.

556
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,427
Mmm.

557
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:11,531
I'm scared of
the hospital basement.

558
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:13,232
Actually, any basement.

559
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:17,102
I'm scared of
going under anesthesia.

560
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,571
I've never done it.

561
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:19,771
Yeah.

562
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:25,578
I am scared of

563
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,881
not living up to
my patients' expectations.

564
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,850
I know that
they're counting on me.

565
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:38,591
I read online that when
you're on the operating table,

566
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,026
you're naked.

567
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,962
I've never been
naked in front of anyone,

568
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,198
let alone an entire room
full of strangers.

569
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:50,015
I'm scared they
won't be able to...

570
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,912
I'm scared they
won't understand.

571
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,296
I'm scared they won't see me.

572
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:00,490
Caroline.

573
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:01,976
Hey.

574
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:04,928
We see you.

575
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,819
You're an amazing girl,

576
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:12,658
and we are gonna make sure that
everyone in that operating room knows that.

577
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:17,580
Okay.

578
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:20,280
I'll do the surgery.

579
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:23,540
We will get you prepped.

580
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,119
And I will go tell Diane.

581
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,193
Okay. This will be
more comfortable.

582
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,034
I'll be back to
check on you later.

583
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:40,818
Can we talk?

584
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:44,268
Usually I'd say yes, but you've
been ignoring me all week.

585
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,196
Yeah, because you screwed with
my ability to become a better surgeon,

586
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,298
which honestly,
I rank as high as cheating.

587
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,633
But I am coming
to you as my boss.

588
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,969
I need surgery.

589
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,004
It's our first
day back operating,

590
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,572
Ndugu is not in the OR today and I
finished all my work on his service.

591
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,375
Study for the ABSITE
like the rest of us.

592
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,543
Put yourself in my shoes.

593
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,146
When you worked at Joe's, weren't
you dying to get back into the OR?

594
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,415
- No.
- How are you my boss?

595
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,990
Beckman could use
an extra set of hands on a TAVR.

596
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,224
OR 4.

597
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,194
- You better run.
- Thank you.

598
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,694
Oh, I mean it.

599
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,031
And... And we'll talk.
Eventually.

600
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:23,498
Thank you.

601
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,771
Punctured the SFA.
We could do a primary repair.

602
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,539
- Mmm.
- We just need to clean the edges.

603
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:33,742
You know, this is not how I
thought our day was gonna end.

604
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,111
You're telling me.

605
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,213
I had a cheese
and charcuterie plate ready

606
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,414
for when we got to the top.

607
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,548
Irrigation.

608
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:43,919
You know, when I was standing
up there I couldn't see anything,

609
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:47,923
and I thought for sure
that he'd lost his leg or worse.

610
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,591
Some people are
just lucky, I guess.

611
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,394
What's lucky is that we
were hiking the same trail.

612
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,962
Geralds, please.

613
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,232
Hey, thank you for today.

614
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,566
- It was great.
- Speak for yourself. I want a redo.

615
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,971
I don't know. Reminds me of the
old days. Me, you, out in the field.

616
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,873
- Lots of blood, no supplies.
- Adrenaline likes us.

617
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,244
I mean, but would a bed-and-breakfast
on Whidbey Island be so terrible?

618
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:12,214
- Any fracture to the lateral malleolus?
- No.

619
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,648
If there was?

620
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,650
Well, it depends if it
was stable or displaced.

621
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,420
Good. Displaced?

622
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:18,921
Plate and screws.

623
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,322
Exactly.

624
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:21,790
Why don't you take this?

625
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,727
Is my ankle broken?

626
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,129
It's a bad sprain.

627
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,131
You need to rest it,
use ice and compression,

628
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:30,732
and keep it elevated.

629
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,235
Any word on my dad?

630
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,669
He's still in surgery.

631
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:39,607
He... He left me and
my mom when I was six.

632
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:42,411
Got remarried,
started a new family.

633
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,413
We just reconnected last year.

634
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,816
And he invited me to go on this
hike, and I didn't wanna go.

635
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,851
And then he...
he told me to stay on the trail,

636
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,455
but I wanted to see
inside the cave, and just...

637
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,123
I needed some space.

638
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:56,325
So he has to be okay.

639
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,194
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear more.

640
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:05,101
Thank you.

641
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,272
Another reload, please.

642
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,508
Excellent solve.

643
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,945
I think this is
gonna work out nicely.

644
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,313
Deploying the staple.

645
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:23,152
He's coding.

646
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,786
- Wh-Why? What happened?
- No, no, no.

647
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,288
We're losing him. Okay. Move.

648
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,957
You two, out of the way now.

649
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,394
Okay. Starting compressions.

650
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:35,697
Push epi. Okay. Come on, Dorian.

651
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:37,799
You've come way too far
to give up on us now.

652
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,068
Come on.

653
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:40,369
Come on.

654
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,040
Hey.

655
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,708
- How's Emmy doing?
- Hey. She's good.

656
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,911
Her O2 sats are up.
She's pretty much her old self.

657
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:51,013
So, on her phone,
and wondering where I am?

658
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,249
Something like that, yeah.

659
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:56,185
- Uh, sounds like Caroline's surgery went well?
- Yeah, thanks to Dr. Shepherd.

660
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:59,687
All right. Well, I gotta go check on a
patient, but I'll round on Emmy later.

661
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,392
Hey.

662
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,228
Still waiting for mine.

663
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,098
They weaned her off oxygen in
the PACU, and vitals are great.

664
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:11,766
- Well, how you feeling, Caroline?
- A little tired.

665
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:14,836
Not bad for someone
who just got a tumor removed.

666
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,871
So how long will
it take to recover?

667
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,943
Well, she will need follow-up
care, but I expect a quick recovery.

668
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,844
Yeah, that school
dance is gonna be fire.

669
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,580
No one says that anymore.

670
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,349
You can just say she'll
have fun, like a normal person.

671
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,617
Thank you.

672
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,619
- I'll text you pics.
- You better.

673
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:34,590
Thank you... both of you... for
taking such good care of my daughter.

674
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,059
- Of course.
- I think we make a pretty good team.

675
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:43,098
Hey, Rosie.

676
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:45,935
He should be awake soon.

677
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,441
You know, we...

678
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:55,044
we fought about that fanny pack
this morning before we left.

679
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,581
He said that hikers need
backpacks so they can bring supplies

680
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:00,916
and be prepared for anything.

681
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,585
But I was stubborn,

682
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,654
and I brought it anyway
because it went with my outfit.

683
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,592
Well, I bet he'll feel differently
about that fanny pack now.

684
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,299
Thank you for saving us.

685
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,969
Rosie, you did all the saving.
All I did was talk.

686
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,904
I mean, what you taught me
wasn't hard.

687
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,974
It's just... I just didn't know
it was what I needed to do.

688
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:30,145
But if you hadn't been there,
my dad wouldn't be here now.

689
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:38,454
Push more epi, please.

690
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,356
Come on, Dorian.

691
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,259
Adams, take over compressions.

692
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,129
Good. Good.

693
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,796
Come on.

694
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:51,934
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Griffith, what do you see?

695
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,270
Hold.

696
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,105
V-fib. It's a shockable rhythm.

697
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,306
Okay. Uh...

698
00:30:57,473 --> 00:30:58,674
Paddles, please.

699
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,776
Check his pulse.

700
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:03,878
- Anything?
- Nothing.

701
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,514
No pulse.

702
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,849
All right. Charge to 150. Clear.

703
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,119
Adams, clear!

704
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,688
Adams, clear! Adams!

705
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:15,391
Lucas! Hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

706
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:16,692
It's okay.

707
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,461
And clear.

708
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,730
Charge to 170.

709
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:23,565
Clear.

710
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,335
Charge to 200.

711
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:27,403
Clear!

712
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,405
- Bailey.
- Again. Clear.

713
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:53,865
Oh, Millin. So I have
good news and bad news.

714
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:57,202
The good news is
I found a surgery.

715
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:03,475
The bad news is now Ndugu needs
someone to pull wires on one of his patients.

716
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:06,445
So, could you just do
me a huge solid and pl...

717
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:09,947
Are you okay?

718
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:12,784
I haven't gotten
a single question right today.

719
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,620
- I'm going to fail.
- No, no. You're not going to fail.

720
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:17,689
Yeah, and then
I'm gonna be unemployed.

721
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:20,659
I'm gonna have to crash with my
hippie parents or my stupid brother.

722
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:21,992
You're gonna do fine.

723
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,695
I know all of this.

724
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:25,797
I know it
backwards and forwards,

725
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:30,535
but every time I look at the
test, my mind just goes blank.

726
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,037
I love my job.

727
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:33,572
I don't wanna get fired.

728
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:39,411
Sounds like you need
the Yasuda technique.

729
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:40,978
What is that?

730
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,582
My patented study method.

731
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:46,485
It has a 100% success rate.

732
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:48,854
By 100%, do you mean just you?

733
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,322
Do you want my help or not?

734
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:51,923
And what about your surgery?

735
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:56,228
I'll get on one tomorrow.

736
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:58,597
Okay. So...

737
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,234
Here we go.

738
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,605
Okay.

739
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,543
I saw you updated Rosie's chart.

740
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,678
Uh, yeah. I thought I'd try
to get some of your notes done

741
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,347
before I get back to studying.

742
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:16,882
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

743
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,684
Kwan.

744
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:22,187
I've watched you work all day.

745
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,756
I know you're gonna ace the
ABSITE, and not because of luck.

746
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:28,426
It's because you work hard. You're
prepared. You know your stuff.

747
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:31,396
Remember that when
you're in the exam.

748
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:33,031
Thank you.

749
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:35,734
But I should still wear
the socks though, right?

750
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,202
Yeah.

751
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:40,572
And if you have to clean them,
hand-wash only.

752
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,207
Oh, yeah.

753
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,317
You're still here?

754
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,319
I'm monitoring him myself.

755
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:55,787
I sent the interns home.

756
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:58,223
ABSITE's tomorrow.

757
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,060
You've done a good
job with them, Bailey.

758
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:04,729
Him too.

759
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,632
Yeah, it doesn't feel like it.
And he's hangin' on,

760
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,736
but who knows... if he'll wake up...
what his functional output will be.

761
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:13,438
And the interns...

762
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:16,575
And I thought I did a good job
with them too.

763
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:21,112
I thought the repetition
and the focus

764
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:24,082
would prepare them
for anything. But this?

765
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:28,286
I mean, shot point-blank
on his way home from work.

766
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:32,624
And he's just one of the
thousands of gun violence victims

767
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,793
who show up in
hospitals every year.

768
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,532
One of thousands who have to undergo
surgery after surgery after surgery.

769
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,468
I don't know
how to prepare them for that.

770
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:45,937
I don't wanna have to
prepare them for that.

771
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,441
I'm still not prepared for that.

772
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:54,145
No one is, Bailey.

773
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:55,614
No one is.

774
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,994
- Hey.
- Hey.

775
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:11,196
How's Rosie?

776
00:35:11,363 --> 00:35:12,964
She's good. You know,
shaken up, but good.

777
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:15,533
Listen. If we were
just able to teach

778
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,536
a 19-year-old how to stop
her father from bleeding out,

779
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,972
why couldn't we
teach that to everyone?

780
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:23,375
Think of how many traumas occur
every single day

781
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,911
and how many lives are lost because
someone with medical training just isn't there.

782
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,649
I mean, we could make videos, hold
classes, build websites. I don't know.

783
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:34,519
But if stopping a bleed
was taught just like CPR,

784
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:36,721
we would save so
many more lives.

785
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,391
I mean, what do you think?

786
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:40,992
I think it's a great idea.

787
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,360
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

788
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:47,599
I mean, would you
be able to fund it?

789
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:50,602
I mean, even just the research
and development?

790
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:52,337
Um... I...

791
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,906
Well, I just... I'd have to
see how much I have left.

792
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,207
Okay.

793
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,778
This is gonna be great.

794
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:03,915
Come on.

795
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,295
That's me apologizing.

796
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:20,532
You could just say,
"I'm sorry, Levi."

797
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:21,966
Fine. I'll give it to Helm.

798
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:23,201
Okay.

799
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:29,441
I almost lost a pregnant mom
the other day.

800
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,585
And now I can't get
her out of my head.

801
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:36,356
And now I'm literally worrying
whether all of my patients

802
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,982
are still breathing
in the middle of the night.

803
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,984
- Jo...
- Link found me at 2 a.m. last night

804
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,486
logging into the hospital system

805
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:44,123
just to see
everyone's blood pressure.

806
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,291
So, no, I'm not checked out.

807
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:50,162
I'm just... freaked out.

808
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:53,732
You are an amazing surgeon.

809
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:55,900
You're so good both
specialties want you.

810
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,072
Mistakes happen. You've
told me that, like, 20 times.

811
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:02,440
Why are you still making mistakes
after the first time I told you?

812
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:04,843
You can go to OB now.

813
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,078
I'm good.

814
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:14,252
Oh, hey. No dinner
with Emmy tonight?

815
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:18,023
Nah, she has a new bestie.
I'm old news.

816
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,692
Oh, hey. Um, thanks for earlier.

817
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:23,261
You said nice things to Caroline
and her mom.

818
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:25,330
Hmm, well, I lied.
You suck at Gem Crush.

819
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,365
I'm never letting you
near my phone again.

820
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:30,702
- But you would let me operate on you.
- Well, I've seen your hands.

821
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:37,976
So I, uh, wanna say
a thing. Uh...

822
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:39,677
and I'm a little
afraid to say it.

823
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:43,515
So I'm just gonna blurt it
because that is what I do.

824
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,485
Would you want
to go out with me sometime?

825
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:56,995
Clearly I misread
the situation. Um...

826
00:37:57,163 --> 00:38:02,067
You were just very complimentary
today, and you bought me a coffee, uh...

827
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:05,837
Please forget that I
said anything ever.

828
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:10,142
No, it's just, um...

829
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:13,645
I am going through a
really messy divorce.

830
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:16,215
And my wife's
still in Texas, so...

831
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,649
Hey.

832
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:19,384
Emmy's parents are
in the family room.

833
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,154
I'm happy to talk to them, or...

834
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,688
No. No. I'll come with you.

835
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:24,856
Okay.

836
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,567
Hey, you okay?

837
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,102
I'm fine.

838
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,048
I've been there. It's hard when the
person on the table is more than a patient.

839
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:50,282
I couldn't stop.

840
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,934
Bailey was
right there telling me,

841
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:54,751
and I still couldn't.

842
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:57,689
I guess it's been my
problem all along, right?

843
00:38:58,423 --> 00:38:59,691
I don't know when to let go.

844
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,428
You know how I thought of
the STEP procedure today?

845
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:05,130
You're an ABSITE genius?

846
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:07,599
I thought of you.

847
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:13,938
You're fearless when you
advocate for your patients,

848
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:15,874
no matter who's in the room.

849
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:19,311
I've been afraid to take chances
when I might be wrong,

850
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,746
thinking that's putting
my patients at risk,

851
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:25,150
but it's riskier not
to take the chance.

852
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:26,584
And you taught me that.

853
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,288
I'm a braver doctor
because of you.

854
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:32,224
I'm a better
doctor because of you.

855
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:26,945
<i>Our brains are constantly
adapting to the present moment.</i>

856
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:34,953
Hi.

857
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:37,622
What time is it?

858
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:40,825
The test starts in five minutes.

859
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:42,194
No, that's impossible.

860
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:44,529
We literally just fell asleep.

861
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:46,698
- The test starts in five minutes!
- I know!

862
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:47,899
Oh, my...

863
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,003
Just run!

864
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,972
<i>Our brains can override
information we no longer use</i>

865
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,873
<i>with newer, more relevant ideas.</i>

866
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,575
So this is a class?

867
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:01,380
We'll also have video tutorials,
community outreach.

868
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:04,482
Well, it sounds like the kind of thing
the Fox Foundation can get behind.

869
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:06,551
We could start this at
Grey-Sloan, and if it goes well,

870
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:09,587
we could branch it out to all
of the Fox Foundation hospitals.

871
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:12,224
Have you spoken to
your chief of surgery?

872
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,826
I don't wanna be the cause
of any marital discord.

873
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:17,029
Yeah. Teddy likes it.

874
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:19,831
I just... I didn't wanna put her in an
uncomfortable spot asking for money.

875
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,933
- So...
- No, you don't. Church and state.

876
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:23,835
- Exactly.
- Okay, Dr. Hunt.

877
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:27,672
I will look into our discretionary
fund and see what I can find.

878
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,743
<i>Our brains make these decisions
for us, whether we like it or not.</i>

879
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,246
You will have
a total of 240 questions

880
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:37,383
divided into two
150-minute blocks.

881
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:43,188
You have a
45-minute optional break

882
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:46,425
and cannot go back to
section one after submitting.

883
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:52,364
Please enter your
authorization codes and begin.

884
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,134
<i>They help us hold onto
the things that matter</i>

885
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,070
<i>and make space for
whatever the future may hold.</i>
