1
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,880
[Grey] When an infection
destroys a cell,

2
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:22,505
the surrounding cells signal
each other to wall it off.

3
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:26,296
Help. I just had a Nissen
fundoplication and I can't swallow.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,547
- What's happening to me?
- Are you you,

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,588
or are you still a 50-year-old
man with achalasia?

6
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,797
- It doesn't say.
- [sighs]

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,338
[Grey] They isolate the infected
cell to prevent it from spreading

8
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:38,422
and harming other parts
of your body.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,731
[Helm] You think they'll ever
talk to each other again?

10
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:42,981
[Yasuda] Don't know, don't care.

11
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,797
As long as they finish
their procedure logs.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,839
Besides, I'm too busy
rushing you back to the OR

13
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,964
to loosen the wrap
of your stomach.

14
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:54,296
Correct. You get a fry.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,714
[Meredith] The isolation is
temporary, but important.

16
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,338
I prefer the study technique
you used the other night.

17
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,338
I'm not taking
my clothes off here.

18
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:04,902
[Meredith] It gives your body
time to trigger your immune system

19
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,922
and stop the infection
from spreading.

20
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,481
Did you pick up those yogurt
things that Leo loves this morning?

21
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,588
Sorry. An MVC came in.

22
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:16,314
Hey, does Pru go through those phases
where she'll only eat two things?

23
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:19,088
We're at yogurt
and graham crackers.

24
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:23,171
We are at "I'm going to shove food under
my plate and pretend that I ate it."

25
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:26,005
-[chuckles] Any plans tonight, Bailey?
- I have plans.

26
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:27,505
I have plans to take a bath,

27
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,046
and not think about interns
for seven hours.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,964
And then
I'm also going to... the pit.

29
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,338
I'm going to the pit.
Multiple traumas?

30
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,505
Yeah, me too.
I'll page the interns.

31
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,588
All right, I'll pick up the yogurt.
Good luck.

32
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,380
[Meredith] Until isolation
is no longer needed.

33
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,171
Ready for tonight?

34
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:48,505
"I'm gonna make you an offer
you can't refuse."

35
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,130
- What is that?
- The Godfather.

36
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:51,714
- Oh.
- It's movie night.

37
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:55,130
[grunts] We're on call.
We should sleep when we can.

38
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,147
Every time I pick the movie,
you're too tired to watch.

39
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,171
Not true!

40
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,255
I sat through
that whole baseball movie.

41
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:02,773
- I should get extra points for that.
- That was five weeks ago.

42
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:04,422
- [chuckling] No, it was not.
- Yeah!

43
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,088
It was three Screams,

44
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,296
one Jason Bourne
and Pride of the Yankees ago.

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,547
Five weeks.

46
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,797
Then I'm late.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,296
For what?

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,547
My period.

49
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,880
[phones buzz, chime]

50
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:23,296
- It's the ER.
- Should we ignore it?

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,505
It's 911.

52
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,547
- So is this.
- [scoffs]

53
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,231
[Shepherd] I never thought
I'd mean this literally,

54
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,630
but I'm reading about
a bunch of random people's crap.

55
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:37,296
Are all of these adult children
of people with Alzheimer's?

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,505
Well, we need to confirm
certain bacteria in the gut.

57
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,588
Our hypothesis will be
even more solid.

58
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:46,046
I'm going to need hard data if I'm
ever going to approach Catherine again.

59
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,463
How can you eat while we're
analyzing these results?

60
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,672
Becoming my mother
terrifies me that much.

61
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,797
- [chuckles]
- [phone chimes]

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,338
[Meredith] Zola.
"Can Ellis have ice cream?"

63
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:58,130
No, she can't have ice cream.
It's so late.

64
00:02:58,213 --> 00:02:59,672
Parenting by text.
I'm impressed.

65
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,964
Well, it only works because
Zola's honest and mature.

66
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,630
That's the part
that's impressive.

67
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,046
[phone chimes]

68
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,755
Nick is supposed to read Ellis a story.
Well, ask Nick.

69
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,964
Do you think fried rice
is an anti-inflammatory?

70
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,213
[phone chimes]

71
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:13,755
What if it's brown rice?

72
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,880
Nick took Bailey
to the hospital.

73
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:30,547
I worked two nights ago and I'm the only
person with my procedure card filled out.

74
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,338
I should be at home
studying or sleeping...

75
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,463
Ask your co-chief resident
for an exemption.

76
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,147
-[transporter] Coming through.
- Nice try.

77
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,213
Oh, wow. Man.

78
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,171
[Helm] What happened?

79
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,422
Second floor deck collapsed,

80
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,606
mostly minor lacerations
and musculoskeletal injuries,

81
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,064
but we're still waiting
on a few rigs.

82
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,630
- They're all med...
- Medical students.

83
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:49,898
They were having a white coat party.
They just got theirs.

84
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,547
- I remember that party. I got super dr...
-[clears throat]

85
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,088
Dramatic about reaching
another milestone in my career.

86
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,463
Everybody grab a chart.
It's gonna be a long night.

87
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,380
- [medical student] Come on.
- [groans]

88
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:04,422
Hey, someone get him a CBC,
type and screen, and hemoglobin.

89
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,839
- Stat.
- It's okay. I'm okay.

90
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:08,588
- Mr. Oliver?
- That's me. Eddie.

91
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:10,773
- It looks like he dislocated his left shoulder...
-[Wilson clears throat]

92
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:15,130
So reduce it, get an MRI
and page me with the results.

93
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,296
- So the X-ray showed it's not broken?
- Exactly.

94
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,314
We'll do a local block
and then I'll adduct your arm.

95
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:20,338
[Adams] Need any help?

96
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:22,964
- Uh, Kwan said he'll help me.
- What?

97
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,046
Oh. Yeah, I... I got it.

98
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,755
Adams, rigs coming in.
Grab a gown.

99
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,964
[groans]

100
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,588
- What are we doing?
- Thank you.

101
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,380
[phone ringing]

102
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,839
[exhales heavily]

103
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,714
Hey. I was just gonna call you.

104
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:44,797
Where's Bailey?

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,755
Okay, so we're at the hospital.

106
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,422
He has early appendicitis.

107
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,422
They gave him antibiotics
and morphine for the pain.

108
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,755
He's a little out of it.

109
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,130
- He needs an appy. Who's on call?
- Ankrom.

110
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,922
She's gonna call you
about consent.

111
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,773
Well, at least someone
was thinking about that.

112
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,171
Yeah, look,
I was gonna call, but...

113
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,398
I don't wanna talk about this now.
I have to change my flight.

114
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,672
Tell Bailey I will be there
as soon as I can.

115
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,755
Okay...

116
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,547
Meredith?

117
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:09,547
Mer?

118
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:19,755
[Hunt] What do we got?

119
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,856
[paramedic] Sophia Valdez, 26,
impaled by a wood beam.

120
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,046
Oxygenating at 96% on room air,
hemodynamically stable.

121
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,422
Bilateral neuro deficits
in both lower extremities.

122
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,255
[sobbing] Please,
you have to help me.

123
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:32,338
- Sophia, I'm Dr. Hunt. I know you're in a lot of pain.
- This is killing me.

124
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,773
We're gonna do everything in our
power to make sure that won't happen.

125
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:36,880
No, no. My coat...
They took my white coat.

126
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:39,088
The one that lets everyone know
I'm gonna be a doctor.

127
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,630
I'll... I'll try to
find it for you.

128
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,964
I didn't even get to wear it
at an actual hospital.

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,463
I can't feel my right leg,

130
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:49,046
and I'm only a first-year,
but that's really bad, right?

131
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,964
Trauma three, page neuro.
Let's go.

132
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,672
- Dr. Winston Ndugu?
- Yes?

133
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,714
All right,
let's make this quick.

134
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,964
I've got CCU rounds and a
consult in a bit, all right?

135
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:19,880
Gilbert, sorry for the delay. I've
had a lot of emergent cases today.

136
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,171
It's okay.
I don't go anywhere anymore.

137
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,130
Strange places, loud noises,
sudden movements,

138
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:26,171
they all make my heart go...
[clicks tongue]

139
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,630
All right. We'll take care
of that tonight, all right?

140
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:30,213
Dr. Millin?

141
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:33,338
Uh, Gilbert Quincy, 41, intermittent,
rapid and irregular heart rate

142
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:34,731
accompanied by
shortness of breath.

143
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,005
Initial diagnosis

144
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:41,380
is SVT with AVRT
that is resistant to medication.

145
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,547
The patient is scheduled
for a, um...

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,005
The patient is scheduled
for a cardiac ablation.

147
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:51,505
[exhales heavily]

148
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,171
You know we can see you, right?

149
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,505
Angela's a professional cuddler.

150
00:06:55,588 --> 00:07:00,046
When the anti-anxiety meds stopped
working, I had to get creative.

151
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,005
[stammers]

152
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,422
You charge people to hug them?

153
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:07,130
Cuddling releases
endorphins and oxytocin,

154
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:10,547
which lowers stress and anxiety.

155
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,046
That's fascinating.

156
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,630
Or a racket.

157
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:18,130
Okay, Gilbert, we gotta check
on your labs, all right?

158
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:21,380
[sighs]

159
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,880
This is the worst possible time
to consider having a baby.

160
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:30,964
Work never stops, my written exams are
coming up and Luna's starting preschool...

161
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:32,046
Oh, my God, the diapers.

162
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,380
Do you know how many diapers
we would need

163
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,338
if we had three kids
who aren't potty trained?

164
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,630
Try not to panic.
This could be nothing.

165
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:42,213
Six diapers a day per kid. That's,
like, a thousand diapers a week.

166
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,755
- Not even close.
- How could this happen? I'm ob-gyn.

167
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,880
Half my job is to help women
not get pregnant.

168
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,797
- Oh, my God, here it is.
- You're spiraling.

169
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,213
How are you not?

170
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,046
It won't be easy,
but we'll figure it out.

171
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,255
Also, we live in a state
where we have options.

172
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,714
If that's what you want,
or not. I...

173
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,922
I just mean

174
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,839
we're in this together
no matter what.

175
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,797
- [phone buzzes]
- Oh.

176
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,922
[groans]
Patient with abdominal pain.

177
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:14,380
You do realize this doesn't work
if I take the test.

178
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,964
Sorry I'm late.
Sophia, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

179
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,296
How are you feeling?

180
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,005
This isn't exactly
how I pictured my first trauma.

181
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,505
How are my X-rays?

182
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,380
Okay, no visible injury
around the lungs,

183
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,231
no free fluid in the abdomen
or around the heart.

184
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,005
- She's a first-year med student.
- Got it. Um...

185
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:35,505
Wiggle your toes for me.

186
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,213
[Sophia] Are they moving?

187
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,630
Okay. Can you feel it
when I touch here?

188
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:46,547
Mm-mmm. [breathes shakily]

189
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:50,880
- We need a CT right now.
- Okay.

190
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,839
[Sophia] I've wanted to be a
surgeon ever since I can remember.

191
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:56,964
I watched Whipples
on YouTube as a kid.

192
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,547
Have you ever done one?

193
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,714
Oh, my God. Is that...

194
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:03,714
Yeah, the paramedics were gonna toss
it, but I got there just in time.

195
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:06,255
- [breathes heavily] It's so...
- [Hunt] Sophia. Hey, hey, hey.

196
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,588
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Deep breaths, okay?
Stay still. -[sobbing]

197
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:11,672
Deep breaths.
I'm gonna take you up to CT now.

198
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:14,880
Okay? Right now.
We're going up. Let's go.

199
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,588
[Grey]
I don't think you understand.

200
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,714
My son is in the hospital.
I need a flight tonight.

201
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,797
Yes, I can hold.

202
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,255
Meredith?

203
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
What's going on?

204
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,630
Bailey needs an appendectomy.

205
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,588
He's with Nick in Boston.

206
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,505
- Can I help?
- Can you fly a plane?

207
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:42,422
- No. But let me call Catherine.
- No, I don't want to bother Catherine.

208
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,005
He's your son. Now, come on.

209
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Excuse me.

210
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:54,964
Dr. Schmitt, I finished the arm
lac in bed three. What's next?

211
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:58,463
We set up a fast track near bed
seven for the simpler cases.

212
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,714
You should be able to move
through that pretty quickly.

213
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:03,088
I was the fastest pre-rounder
in medical school.

214
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,171
[Schmitt] Hmm.

215
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,213
All right.

216
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:12,171
Hi. I'm Dr. Yasuda...

217
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,588
[chuckling]

218
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:16,463
[sighs]

219
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,630
[Sophia] Do you have any idea
how much I wanna be you?

220
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,064
[Adams] I haven't slept in two days.
You might wanna rethink that.

221
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,672
Have you ever wanted a thing
so much, it hurts?

222
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:30,422
Like... Like you can feel it in your
body when you're so close to getting it?

223
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,255
Yeah, I, uh...
I think I understand.

224
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:40,463
[breathing shakily] Then
you know you have to fix me.

225
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:41,547
Please.

226
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:43,672
[Hunt] Adams, let's go.

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,505
When you see a deck
collapse on TV,

228
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,380
are you thinking,
"Gee, that's sad,"

229
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:51,839
or are you happy because
of all the traumas? Be honest.

230
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,755
[inhales, clears throat]

231
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,255
Are you okay?

232
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,547
Yeah, I'm fine. [chuckles]

233
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,547
[monitors beeping]

234
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,630
Scans are up. Adams.

235
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:07,005
[Adams] It looks like the wood
partially severed her spinal cord

236
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,463
at T4 and T5.

237
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,547
Brown-Séquard syndrome.

238
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,463
It's an expanding hematoma
in her spinal cord

239
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,107
which means the blood supply
is tenuous.

240
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,171
So what do you do?

241
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,964
We remove the foreign object,

242
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,505
we irrigate the hematoma,

243
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,296
we close her,
and we hope for the best.

244
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,005
- Hope?
- [Hunt] Mmm.

245
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:25,505
What... You just... You just hope that
she's gonna be able to walk or stand?

246
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:28,171
Doing more could cause her
entire spinal cord to stroke out.

247
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,797
Or she could die
from complications.

248
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,338
[breathes heavily] This is her best option.
Let's book an OR.

249
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:35,505
Mm-hmm.

250
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,005
[sighs]

251
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:46,296
[yawns]

252
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:49,296
Tired, Griffith?

253
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,797
- A little.
- You should be.

254
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,255
I checked your hours. You're
almost at your max. Go home.

255
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,463
I'm just waiting
for Eddie Oliver's MRI results.

256
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,755
You know
what exhausted interns do?

257
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,463
Make mistakes.

258
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:05,422
Which makes my life messy. You
want my life to be messy, Griffith?

259
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,714
I will pass it off to Kwan
and then go home. [chuckles]

260
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,130
[sighs] I have to
give you my patient.

261
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:16,088
Uh, if his MRI is clear, he can
be discharged. He's in bed four.

262
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,338
[Kwan] That bed's been empty
for a while.

263
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,588
And you did nothing?

264
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,032
[scoffs]
He wasn't my patient then.

265
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,839
Bailey will kill us

266
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,463
if we let a drunk medical
student loose in the hospital.

267
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,839
- Find him.
- Uh... You lost him.

268
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:30,964
Shut up and help me.

269
00:12:40,714 --> 00:12:42,839
- [phone rings]
- Hi.

270
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,422
[Grey] How is he?

271
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,588
He's good.
Uh, they took him to pre-op.

272
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:49,463
And not before he lobbied the nurse
for Popsicles after he wakes up.

273
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,964
- Well, I should be there by then.
- Good.

274
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,255
He'll be happy.

275
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,231
Well, I could have
been there sooner had I known.

276
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,797
Mer, we're gonna have
this conversation now?

277
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,005
Well, you took my kid
to the hospital.

278
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,797
Yeah. He said his stomach hurt on
the way home from hockey practice.

279
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,755
I did a quick exam.
He had rebound tenderness.

280
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,630
I called Ankrom. She said
to bring him in. I mean...

281
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,213
You should have called me.

282
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,922
Yes, I could have.

283
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,505
I wanted to see what the doctor
said before I worried you.

284
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,672
- I am a doctor.
- Yes.

285
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:16,880
So am I.

286
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,213
I'm his mother. You call me.

287
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:20,296
Okay, copy that.

288
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,213
- The next time this happens...
- No next time.

289
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:26,171
If any decisions need to be
made, call me immediately.

290
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
Sounded like that went well.

291
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,630
[Yasuda] Track this for me.

292
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:37,296
This side.

293
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:39,839
- Okay, good.
- Dead. Alive.

294
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:43,130
Dead. Alive.

295
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:46,755
- Dead. Alive.
- Don't do that.

296
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:47,964
Dead.

297
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,547
I've been running
the fast track area solo.

298
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,839
I heard. That's awesome.

299
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,130
Oh, is it?

300
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,547
'Cause so far, I've been
peed on, spit on, and hit on.

301
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,338
I mean, the first two
were accidents, but still.

302
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,547
Someone hit on you?

303
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,171
That's what
you're concerned about?

304
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,547
Can you please swap me out?

305
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,505
- Let me see what I can do.
- Okay.

306
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:12,748
- Can I have a sandwich?
- No.

307
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:14,547
Back.

308
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,880
Wheelchair not a toy.

309
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:23,797
Hey. Gilbert Quincy
still isn't prepped.

310
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,964
His heart rate kept going up
while she was doing the echo.

311
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:30,755
I suggest we wait another 30
minutes before trying again.

312
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,839
Look, I've been on my feet
since 5:00 this morning

313
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,380
and I've got eight hours
ahead of me.

314
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,463
I'm not going to shift
around my schedule

315
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,797
because my patient needs
a human weighted blanket.

316
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,797
Uh, Angela, would you please
go check on Gilbert?

317
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,463
We'll be in with you
in a minute.

318
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:46,171
Thank you.

319
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:53,005
You're an intern. I give you
a task, you do it. Understood?

320
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,088
Get the echo.

321
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:56,630
I will try again.

322
00:14:58,588 --> 00:14:59,839
You know, actually, no.

323
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,773
You can do it intraoperatively
while he's asleep.

324
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,547
Excuse me?

325
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,630
I know what I'm about to say
is way out of line,

326
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:08,380
but it's late
and I think you need to hear it.

327
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,338
You used to
be the coolest attending.

328
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,005
Everybody wanted to
be on your service.

329
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,005
But lately,
you've kinda been a jerk.

330
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,213
Correct.
This is way out of line. Yes.

331
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:20,005
Okay, I am desperate
to learn from you,

332
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,964
but not if it means
being disrespected

333
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,755
or standing by while you
disrespect our patients.

334
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,922
Gilbert is in pain.
He is scared.

335
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:30,672
And if paying someone to hug him helps
him with that, who are we to judge?

336
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,714
I want the patient prepped
within 20 minutes.

337
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,588
[Shepherd] Are you okay?

338
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,505
I've never been in an OR before.

339
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:49,422
Um... My... My dad said the OR
had an invisible energy.

340
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,922
[chuckling]
Like the Force in Star Wars.

341
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,296
[Shepherd] Hmm.

342
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Now I get it.

343
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,380
What kind of surgeon
is your dad?

344
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,422
Trauma.
But he died two years ago.

345
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,355
[Shepherd]
We are gonna start anesthesia.

346
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,213
Are you ready?

347
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,714
Can you make sure
my coat is with my stuff?

348
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:10,547
I don't care if it's ruined.
I still wanna keep it.

349
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,110
- [Hunt] Of course.
- [Shepherd] Mm-hmm.

350
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,338
Okay.

351
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:15,755
I'm... I'm ready.

352
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,630
[chuckles] Eddie's MRI is clear.

353
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:35,797
[stammers] Maybe he went home.
Did you try and give him a call?

354
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,964
I have been with you.

355
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,505
[sighs] Okay.
Give me the number.

356
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:40,630
Thank you.

357
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,171
- You have reached the voicemail...
- Voicemail.

358
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,088
I can't believe I lost a patient.
Bailey is going to fire me.

359
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:51,005
Is he in a plaid shirt
with a sling?

360
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,768
Is your missing patient wearing a
plaid shirt and a sling on his arm?

361
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:56,005
- Yes.
- Yeah, I saw him near the stairwell.

362
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:00,672
Ah. The one by the west elevator.
Goes to the roof.

363
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,171
[both sigh]

364
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:16,255
Great. A windy outdoor version of
what we've been doing all night.

365
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,922
[Kwan exhales heavily]

366
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:23,547
- Hey.
- What?

367
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:25,964
Eddie.

368
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:31,797
Can you come down from there?
We've got your MRI results.

369
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,005
Am I dying?

370
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,797
No, you're fine.

371
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,380
Let's go back in.

372
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,714
Yeah, we'll discharge you
and you can go home.

373
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:45,213
Eddie? [breathes heavily]

374
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,338
What if I didn't go home?

375
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:51,536
You thought losing him was bad?

376
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:52,880
How about the headline:

377
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:54,922
"Drunk Med Student
Falls off Hospital"?

378
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,088
He's completely sober
according to his labs.

379
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,338
Or if I just...

380
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,171
let the wind decide?

381
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,505
[phone chimes]

382
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:19,588
[Webber] Oh.

383
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,964
[grunts] Anything new?
[clears throat]

384
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:24,255
Still in surgery.

385
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:27,672
I wish I could see into that OR.

386
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,755
The last thing a surgeon needs
is to have the patient's mom

387
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,296
looking over their shoulder.

388
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,130
Even more so
if it's Meredith Grey.

389
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,171
Even the best hands
make mistakes.

390
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,630
Bleeding. Perforations.
It's the middle of the night.

391
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,505
They're tired. Mistakes happen.

392
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,308
They could, but most
of the time they don't.

393
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,588
And most of the time, people who
need craniotomies get head CTs.

394
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,005
I'm sorry. I'm fine. I just...

395
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:55,255
It's just when things like this
happen, I know it's not Derek. I...

396
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,588
I understand.
No apologies needed.

397
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:05,880
[Griffith] It's cold. Let's go in,
get some coffee. Find your friends.

398
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
I'm fine here.

399
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:09,839
We can't leave you here.

400
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,046
Hey, Eddie. Did you...

401
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,255
Did you come up here
to hurt yourself?

402
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:23,714
I don't know.

403
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,588
- Are you having thoughts of suicide?
- I, uh...

404
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,046
I guess.

405
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Sometimes.

406
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:40,130
I'm here if you wanna talk.
We both are.

407
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,839
Maybe you could sit down.
You've had a long night.

408
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:07,755
[Eddie] Seems darker up here.

409
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,630
The city.

410
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,672
Text Bailey.

411
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,922
Did you move here for med school
or is Seattle home?

412
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,523
[medical student]
You know, you're really pretty.

413
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,130
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

414
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:25,463
You like me?

415
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:26,797
Sure.

416
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,130
Don't touch that 'cause
you're gonna open the sutures.

417
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,797
Okay?

418
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,130
Stop. Stop.

419
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,880
- Okay. You know what?
- I'm not doing...

420
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,046
Your hand is contaminated
and if you're not gonna listen,

421
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,022
- I have to do this. I'm sorry, I have to.
- What...

422
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:43,296
This is just what has
to happen right now, okay?

423
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,755
This is malpractice.
Hey, she's malpracticing me.

424
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,422
Um, can... can I get another
banana bag, please?

425
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,547
[medical student 2 chuckles]

426
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,463
No.

427
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:04,422
[scoffs]

428
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,422
Hey, baby.

429
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,755
Ah... I thought you weren't
working tonight.

430
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,648
[chuckling] Well, I could say
the same thing about you.

431
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:12,797
- [stammers]
- Yeah, they needed a sub.

432
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,588
Wow. That med student party
was a real rager, huh?

433
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,797
Yeah, I caught one of 'em trying
to order pizza over at bed four.

434
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,296
- [chuckles]
- Wait, Tuck's at home?

435
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,547
Uh... Did you remind him to lock
the door and turn on the alarm?

436
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,797
- You didn't think I remembered.
- [stammers, chuckles]

437
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
[phone chimes]

438
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:34,880
- Oh. Uh-oh. [gasps]
- What? What happened?

439
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:38,714
Interns, uh, found a missing
patient on the roof.

440
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,547
They're worried
that he wants to jump off.

441
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,088
- Okay, well, tell 'em we're on the way.
- Okay. Uh...

442
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,157
Do you remember how it felt to
be that excited about surgery?

443
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:49,839
[Shepherd]
Yeah, it was like a drug that,

444
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,272
-unlike the other drugs I was into,
couldn't kill me. -[Hunt chuckles]

445
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:53,880
[Shepherd]
Prepare for the specimen.

446
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:56,922
I don't remember the last time
operating gave me that kind of rush.

447
00:21:57,005 --> 00:22:00,130
Okay, removing the
foreign object in three.

448
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:03,046
One. Two. Three.

449
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,296
- [Shepherd] Bovie.
- [Hunt] Irrigation.

450
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,856
[Shepherd] Let's get this
bleeding under control.

451
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,690
- Wash her out and get ready to close.
-[Hunt] Okay.

452
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,880
- And let's hope for the best.
- Okay.

453
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,898
[Hunt] These edges are cleaner
than I thought they'd be.

454
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:17,755
No significant tissue loss.
Bleeding's subsided.

455
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,964
You're gonna ask me to do a
primary repair, aren't you?

456
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:21,588
That's not the standard of care.

457
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,731
I saw a lot of penetrating
injuries like this in Iraq,

458
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:26,630
and I've seen primary repairs
work on nerves and extremities.

459
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,755
It doesn't come close
to a spinal cord.

460
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,547
But if you were going to do it?

461
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,338
I would need an ORBEYE.

462
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,005
I'd use 10-0 nylon.

463
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,463
Layer by layer I would need
to expose the spinal cord...

464
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:39,880
I can't guarantee the outcome.

465
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,422
There's risky,
and then there's this.

466
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:43,463
[Adams] She'd want you to do it.

467
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:47,255
Sorry. [stammering] But
she'd want you to try.

468
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:50,505
It would kill her to know there was
a chance and you didn't take it.

469
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,880
All right. This is gonna
be long and tedious.

470
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,213
I need an ORBEYE.

471
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:58,839
I need everyone in lockstep.
Are you in?

472
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:01,547
- [Hunt] I suggested it.
- All right.

473
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,463
Okay.

474
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:07,839
[sighs] I can't look at it.

475
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,547
- Did you pee on this?
- Just read it.

476
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:14,714
It's negative.

477
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,964
[exhales sharply]

478
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:21,463
What happened
to we're in this together?

479
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,672
You... You were spiraling.

480
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:26,588
Short of traveling back
and getting a vasectomy.

481
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,106
It was the only thing I could
think of to make you feel better.

482
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,380
The idea of having a baby
with me is so awful

483
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,296
you would rather have
a vasectomy?

484
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,296
No. [stutters]

485
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,547
- A thousand diapers a week!
- That was an exaggeration!

486
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:40,338
Hi.

487
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,547
I love being a dad.

488
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,422
And as much as I would love to
do it all over again with you,

489
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,505
and only with you, I...

490
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,797
I'm tired. It's hard.

491
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,422
Just give me this.

492
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:59,255
It's not negative.

493
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:01,588
You... You're pregnant?

494
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,422
- It's not positive either.
- Is there a third option?

495
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:06,463
One line is negative,
two is positive.

496
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,880
- There's no lines.
- It's a dud.

497
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,672
Oh.

498
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
[coughs]

499
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:21,380
[exclaims]
Can... Can we slow down?

500
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:24,255
If we go any slower, we'll have
to push your surgery to tomorrow.

501
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,171
[exclaims] Stop! Stop! I can't do this.
I can't. I have to get off.

502
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:28,505
- I have to...
- No, no, no.

503
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,130
You can do this.
You can do this.

504
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:31,439
- Should we call Angela?
- No! No.

505
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,630
She charges by the hour.
I'm sorry, I'm really trying.

506
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,797
But my relaxation techniques aren't
even working and I'm... I can't breathe.

507
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,088
And my fingers are tingling. I'm... I'm
alone and I'm hot. Why is it so hot?

508
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:42,380
- Dr. Ndugu. What are you doing?
- May I?

509
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:44,703
If his heart rate doesn't slow
down, he can go into defib.

510
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:46,815
- [exhales sharply, exclaiming]
- Just relax. Breathe.

511
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,213
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.
Breathe with me. Breathe with me.

512
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:52,296
- Breathe with me.
- [breathing heavily]

513
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Yep.

514
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,505
Okay, nice and slow.

515
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,171
Let's go.

516
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:02,672
Here you go.

517
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:15,213
I remember my white coat
ceremony, my dad flew in.

518
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,005
But it was raining,
so traffic was awful.

519
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:20,296
He walked in right as I
was reciting the oath.

520
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:24,213
I barely passed my biochem test.

521
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,338
It's okay.

522
00:25:27,338 --> 00:25:28,380
I studied.

523
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:30,839
I even went to see a tutor.

524
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:35,255
I busted my ass and I still
couldn't even catch up.

525
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:39,463
Biochem is like learning
another language.

526
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,171
So much reading.

527
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:47,547
So many tests.

528
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,380
You know, it's like I try
to sleep, but I can't.

529
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:55,755
I think, uh...

530
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:00,046
Say it.

531
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:02,964
Sometimes just saying it helps.

532
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,130
[scoffs]

533
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
I think I'm broken.

534
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,338
I don't deserve this anymore.

535
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,630
Eddie!

536
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:20,839
[sighs]

537
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:24,588
[sighs]

538
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:33,380
[Bailey gasps]

539
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:36,130
Damn it, Griffith.
I... I told her to go home.

540
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,588
- Well, it's a good thing
she didn't listen. -[sighs]

541
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:42,922
Has he said anything
about wanting to jump?

542
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:44,547
[stammers]

543
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,880
- No.
- Good.

544
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,463
All right, well then, keep...
Keep doing what you're doing.

545
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:51,338
He's standing on a ledge.

546
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:54,171
There's a difference between
a suicide attempt and ideation.

547
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,895
All right.
Right now, he's talking to her.

548
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:58,046
He's engaging with her
and answering her questions.

549
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,505
But he's inches away
from a seven-story drop.

550
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,428
And if we abruptly change
the situation on him,

551
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:03,964
we might make it worse.

552
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:06,922
So calm down. Keep him talking.

553
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,922
[sighs]

554
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,547
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
- Hmm?

555
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:21,380
- Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
- [sighing]

556
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,171
Okay?

557
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,171
Any sign this becomes unstable...

558
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:26,296
We will intervene.

559
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,839
Hey.

560
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:42,255
Surgery went well.
The appendix didn't rupture.

561
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,797
- He's still out?
- You know him.

562
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,130
He could sleep through a monster
truck rally without anesthesia.

563
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:49,922
You can go.

564
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,630
I... I don't need to.

565
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,714
You can go.

566
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:58,630
Okay.

567
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,213
His, uh... His vitals look good.

568
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,463
I'll let you two have some time,

569
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,922
but I'll be close
in case you need anything.

570
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:11,547
Thank you for getting me here.

571
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,088
And for listening to me.
And being there for me.

572
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:16,046
You know I would do more
if I could.

573
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,880
I really am fine.

574
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,964
I mean, of course I miss him.
I...

575
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:28,755
It's... It's just really only when the
kids wake up in the middle of the night.

576
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,296
And I don't have
anyone to talk to. And...

577
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,547
Anyway, you helped me
more than you know.

578
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,046
I was glad to do it.

579
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:42,338
But, uh, you know I wasn't the
only one you had to talk with.

580
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:48,005
- Mom?
- Hi.

581
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,088
How do you feel?

582
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:52,213
Where's Nick?

583
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,046
[Shepherd]
Pia mater has been approximated.

584
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,213
Cut please.

585
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,922
- Wait. There's bleeding.
- [Hunt] Suction.

586
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:04,965
[Shepherd] Wait, no suction.
No, it's too friable.

587
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:07,588
If we suction, we could
lose spinal nerve tissue.

588
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:09,523
- We need to stop the bleeding.
- We can irrigate

589
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,463
and then use Gelfoam
soaked in dexamethasone.

590
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:13,630
[Hunt] Let's keep it quiet.

591
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:14,815
We know it's been a long night,

592
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,672
but we're on the homestretch,
okay?

593
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,588
Bleeding has stopped.
Gelfoam, please.

594
00:29:25,672 --> 00:29:26,940
[Hunt]
Do you need a dural patch?

595
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,422
No, I'm good.

596
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:31,839
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but we can prep to close.

597
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,088
[Hunt chuckles]

598
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,171
- You did it.
- We did.

599
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:39,046
[Shepherd] All right, wait to see that
work before you start gloating up there.

600
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,005
[Hunt] Hmm.

601
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:41,714
[Shepherd] Okay. Irrigation.

602
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,588
How'd it go?

603
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:56,797
Good. Yeah.
He's gonna wake up a new person.

604
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,840
I don't think we would have
gotten him into the OR

605
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,839
if you hadn't jumped
on the gurney when you did.

606
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:05,130
Yeah, well, gotta be honest,
it's not my usual strategy.

607
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:08,338
Uh... Dr. Ndugu.

608
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:13,839
Um, I wanted to say that I am really
sorry for what I said earlier.

609
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:16,338
Not only was it inappropriate
and disrespectful, but...

610
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:17,588
It was right.

611
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:20,255
I haven't been bringing
my best self to work lately.

612
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,714
[inhales heavily]

613
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:26,213
Things in my personal life are
complicated, but it's no excuse.

614
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:28,213
You... You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

615
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:32,755
No, I know. But I'm the
coolest attending. [chuckles]

616
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,088
You did good work today.

617
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,171
[sighs]

618
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:42,922
[Griffith] You hungry?

619
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:45,922
Cafeteria has pretty good fries.

620
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:49,046
When did you feel
like you were a doctor?

621
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,005
I don't know. Maybe a couple
of weeks into residency.

622
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,088
Someone called me doctor
tonight.

623
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:01,296
Patient in the elevator.

624
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,547
Guess he just saw the coat
and assumed.

625
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,171
I didn't correct him.

626
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:10,672
That's okay.

627
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,338
It's a shame.

628
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,005
Not even sure what I am anymore.

629
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,255
I'm a guy just...

630
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,839
just going through the motions.

631
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,547
I take light-rail to school.

632
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,171
And every morning, I think...

633
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,714
what if I just fell
onto the tracks?

634
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,922
Everyone else
has it all figured out.

635
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:38,588
But I don't.

636
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:44,922
I don't know how to live
with all of the, um...

637
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,213
Pressure and all the pain?

638
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:52,046
I didn't either.

639
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,338
A lot of people don't.

640
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,547
Doesn't matter
how they make it look.

641
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:00,255
You're not alone.

642
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,130
And on most days,

643
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,380
I still don't feel
like a doctor.

644
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,296
But I'm still here.

645
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,588
Let us get you some help.

646
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:25,130
[sighs]

647
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,964
[breathing shakily]

648
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,130
[Grey] Hi.

649
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,171
Do you have a minute?

650
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:06,463
Two days.

651
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:10,088
- Excuse me?
- I've been with your kids for two days.

652
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:13,005
I got them to school. I got
them to practice and rehearsal.

653
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:14,714
I made sure they ate,
they slept.

654
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:15,964
When one of them felt sick,

655
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:17,690
out of an abundance of caution,
I brought him here.

656
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,634
Now, yes, I guess
I could have called on the way,

657
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:22,046
but I was busy making
arrangements with your nanny

658
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,922
to take care of Zola and Ellis.

659
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,130
My kid was sick,
and I wasn't here.

660
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:30,463
And I feel really guilty
about that.

661
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:32,213
I'm all they have.

662
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:33,547
But you're not.

663
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,547
I mean, yes, you're their mom.
Of course.

664
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,588
But they have so many
people that love them.

665
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,380
Look,
I know I'm not their father.

666
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:45,296
I know that,
but I care about them a lot.

667
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,580
- And I want you to trust me with them.
- I do trust you.

668
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,088
It doesn't feel like it.

669
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:50,463
I'm sorry.

670
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,755
I panicked.

671
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,213
I actually came here
to say I'm sorry.

672
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,839
Because I know I panic.

673
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,922
And I was tired.

674
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,964
But I know
that I said some things

675
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,630
that were probably
pretty unnecessary to say.

676
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,005
- So...
- A few things.

677
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,839
Okay. I've been doing
this a long time alone,

678
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:18,839
so it may just take me
a minute to adjust.

679
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,088
Hey, come here.

680
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,714
Look, I got a minute.

681
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:25,922
Okay?

682
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,422
Okay.

683
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,463
I'm not pregnant.

684
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,463
Are you disappointed?

685
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,839
I think I want another kid.

686
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:58,213
I thought you said
you didn't want biological kids.

687
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,672
I didn't,
but this would be with you.

688
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:04,130
And you don't have to
decide right now,

689
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:07,171
and I wouldn't want to do it
until Luna is a little bit older.

690
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:10,171
But I wanna do this right.

691
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,964
Us.

692
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:15,463
Which means I want you to know
everything that's in my head.

693
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,422
No matter how terrifying
it might be.

694
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:27,338
If you want to
have a baby together, then...

695
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,046
I can get there.

696
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,922
[chuckles] It's just gonna
take me some time.

697
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:35,714
Okay.

698
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:42,130
[sighs] We still have to pick up
the babies we do have.

699
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:44,046
Right.

700
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,922
I smell like puke and I
haven't had time to change.

701
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:00,296
Hmm. Too tired to notice.
[grunts, sighs]

702
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:03,523
Did you know fast track
was going to suck that much

703
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:04,880
when you assigned me?

704
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,463
My night wasn't much better.

705
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,005
Well, I should probably go back
to the hellish life I've chosen.

706
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,296
[scoffs] At least you're done
with medical school.

707
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,171
- Amen to that.
- [chuckles]

708
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,296
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

709
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,630
I tried to put you on that impalement
but my "co-chief" overruled me.

710
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,296
You actually repaired it.

711
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,088
Like, I'll be able to walk.

712
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:40,463
Our hope is you will regain
full function.

713
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:42,130
[chuckles]

714
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:43,964
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

715
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,088
[Sophia] Am I doing it?

716
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,130
- [Shepherd sighs]
- Looks like it.

717
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:54,547
[sighs] I never thought
performing a basic motor function

718
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,797
would make me so happy.

719
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,797
Well, we will let you
get some rest.

720
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,797
Let's do Q2 neuro checks and
an MRI in the morning. Mm-hmm?

721
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,130
Maybe I should be
a neurosurgeon.

722
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,130
Yeah, um, about that.

723
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,088
I got some bad news.

724
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,839
- Third year of med school is
gonna break you. -[chuckles]

725
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:19,922
Bring it.

726
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,505
How's he doing?

727
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,588
He's okay.

728
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,255
Psych's evaluating him now.

729
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,922
What you said up there...

730
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,350
- If you ever want to talk about...
- I don't.

731
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,046
[sighs]

732
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:11,922
You being quiet
is very unsettling.

733
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:14,630
Typical night shift
or something specific?

734
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,171
Taryn, uh, betrayed me.

735
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,922
Helm cheated on you?

736
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:22,964
She blocked me
from getting a really good case.

737
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:26,213
That is... That is so much worse.

738
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,046
Yeah.

739
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,755
I haven't talked to her yet.

740
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,672
I am trying to stay calm.

741
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:35,839
- But I just...
- Can you give me your hand.

742
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:39,338
- Why?
- Just give it to me.

743
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:45,255
Okay. [inhales heavily]

744
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:47,630
- [inhales sharply]
- [inhales heavily]

745
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:49,880
[both exhale]

746
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,880
It's acupressure.

747
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:56,130
My mom used to do it for me
when I was stressed,

748
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:59,338
and it's like one of only
three things she ever did

749
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,505
that actually helped me.

750
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,505
[Grey] Much like the cells
in our body,

751
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:04,755
humans often isolate
to avoid harm.

752
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:06,213
What were the other two?

753
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:10,130
I can't think of them right now,
but I'm sure they exist.

754
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,046
Somewhere.

755
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,130
[Grey] The truth is, no single part
of the body can thrive on its own.

756
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:20,046
Your organs work together
as a system.

757
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,672
They'll compensate for each
other when one gets weak.

758
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:26,046
- Hey. How're you doing?
- Hey.

759
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,922
Maggie told me that the divorce
papers are coming in today.

760
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,714
Hey, Sophia is doing well.

761
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:33,380
I haven't had a rush
like that in a long time.

762
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:36,171
- We should do that more often.
- You mean more tragedy?

763
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,630
I don't get trauma surgeons.

764
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:41,255
Hey. Morning. Are you exhausted?

765
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,880
Strangely, no.

766
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,880
Chief,
you're on the schedule tomorrow.

767
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:47,964
TAVR. I emailed you the case.

768
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:49,755
- I'm cleared?
- You're cleared.

769
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,588
And I need some time off.

770
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,171
- Right.
- Congratulations.

771
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:54,338
Thank you.

772
00:39:54,422 --> 00:39:56,755
All right.
I'm gonna go check my emails.

773
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:59,130
I left the laundry in the washer
and Leo's at a playdate,

774
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,272
but your mom's car is acting up,
so you need to pick him up.

775
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,922
Copy that.

776
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:04,672
[sighs] Back down to earth.

777
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:06,588
[Grey] People can do
the same for each other.

778
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,463
Stepping up
when someone else is down.

779
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:09,714
You waited for me.

780
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:13,130
After that night,
of course I did.

781
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,630
Come on.

782
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:19,880
There was a girl in my med
school that took her own life.

783
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:23,547
I didn't know her well,
but she was top of our class.

784
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,422
Like, a real overachiever.

785
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,422
Isn't that
what medical schools want?

786
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,588
Overachievers
and perfectionists?

787
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,046
Yeah, put them
in a pressure cooker

788
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,505
and add
unrealistic expectations.

789
00:40:35,588 --> 00:40:38,088
That's a recipe
for mental illness.

790
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,797
Especially
if you're already struggling.

791
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,964
[chuckles] It's a good thing your
residents have you looking out for them.

792
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,964
It's a good thing.
I have you looking out for me.

793
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:54,505
[Grey] Isolating ourselves
often makes us feel more alone.

794
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,505
- Hey.
- Hey.

795
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,672
Can we talk?

796
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:15,338
- I just had... I had a really long night.
- Right.

797
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,422
Um...

798
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:18,463
I'll go.

799
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,588
Wait.

800
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,005
[Grey]
We're usually better together.

801
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:53,672
Even when we're struggling.

802
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:03,213
You are not alone.

803
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:07,588
If you or someone you know
is in crisis or needs support,

804
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,797
there are resources
that can help you.

805
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:13,630
