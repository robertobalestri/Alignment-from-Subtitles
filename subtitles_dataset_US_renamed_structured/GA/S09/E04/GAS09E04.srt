1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,510
Mm.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,083
<i>The clothes a surgeon wears</i>

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,973
<i>help to present an image.</i>

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,231
<i>The lab coats and
badges and scrubs...</i>

5
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:23,605
<i>All work together to indicate
a person of authority...</i>

6
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,076
<i>Someone you can trust.</i>

7
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,581
<i>When the clothes come
off, that's a different story.</i>

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,833
<i>We're sensitive,</i>

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,668
<i>vulnerable...</i>

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:38,970
<i>Human...</i>

11
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,608
<i>And just as prone to
questionable judgment</i>

12
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,309
<i>as anybody else.</i>

13
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:48,246
Yes.

14
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,816
His hemoglobin is what?

15
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,553
Okay, so just, just do an MRI.
And a hemoccult, and I'll be right in.

16
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,986
My idiot intern thinks she found
a rare retroperitoneal tumor.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,422
So now I have to go in
and tell her that she's wrong.

18
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:05,047
Well, I'm sure she'll still
be wrong in 20 minutes.

19
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,759
I can take care of
Zola this morning.

20
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,467
I don't have to
lecture until 10:00.

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,371
Still not sure it justifies
the size of my paycheck.

22
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,141
You're a great teacher.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,987
I should know. I was
hot for teacher in my day.

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,156
Oh, really? MEREDITH: Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,345
Mmm.

26
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,969
So what is on the
ol' agenda today?

27
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,672
Ah! Just catching
up on, Thomas' plan

28
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:34,209
for tomorrow's open PDA
ligation and left main bypass.

29
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,277
I've never seen one before.

30
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,108
Yeah, that's because nobody's
done it that way since 1993.

31
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,909
How long do you
suppose that's gonna take?

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,266
Seventeen hours give or take.

33
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,681
That's perfect.

34
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,705
What does that mean?

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Nothing.

36
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,901
I have 20 minutes.
Want to go again?

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,896
I guess so.

38
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,721
That was the last time.
We can't do this anymore.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,353
No, no, we won't, because
this is the last time, ever.

40
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,609
Okay.

41
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,996
I'm gonna get some
coffee. I'm gonna go pray.

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,180
Cool.

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
Ah, morning, Hunt.
It's beautiful out there.

44
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,320
Webber, what's with the tie?

45
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,578
Oh, just thought I'd
up my game a bit today.

46
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,024
Yeah. Where's yours?

47
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,349
Oh! I had kind of a rough night.

48
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,983
Oh! Oh!

49
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,420
Got a spare. Oh, thanks.

50
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,209
Don't mention it. Yeah.

51
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,863
Good morning, Bailey.

52
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,998
What's with the tie?

53
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,845
It felt like a tie kind of day.

54
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,335
Oh, well, does it also feel like

55
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,437
a small bowel
obstruction kind of day?

56
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,355
I'd be happy to
have you scrub in.

57
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,036
Not this afternoon. I'm busy.

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,593
Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,461
You have an appointment
with your haberdasher?

60
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,507
Now what is so wrong with a man

61
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,091
taking a little pride
in his appearance?

62
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,096
Hello, handsome.

63
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,138
Catherine, there you are.

64
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,140
Yes, here I am.

65
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,042
Mmm. Nice tie.

66
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,329
Yeah, whatever's
wrong, that'll fix it.

67
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,737
Barnett decided everyone
should create new passwords.

68
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,383
You do it in the settings menu.

69
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,525
But I can't access the settings
menu without a new password.

70
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:32,427
So you're trying to break in?

71
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,163
Hey, probably gonna need to
go back in and do a redo ORIF

72
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,709
on Brody Wright's
humerus fracture, okay?

73
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,500
When the hell is
Robbins coming back?

74
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,737
Uh... Wait, did you see
her? Did she see you?

75
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,450
Robbins is here?

76
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,474
Oh, damn it.

77
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:49,377
What? Uh... Um, she's...

78
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:51,357
She's being fitted for
her first prosthetic today,

79
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,876
which I wasn't
supposed to tell you,

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,077
because the only way I was able

81
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,394
to get her to agree
to come in at all

82
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,719
was to promise that no
one knows she's here.

83
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:00,689
Which makes two promises I've
broken, if you count the time I said,

84
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,736
"I promise you won't lose your
leg," which she certainly does.

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,075
I didn't see her.

86
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,410
Good. Don't.

87
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,399
Tell her I hope it goes well.

88
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,058
No, I can't,

89
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,026
because then she'd
know I told you she's here.

90
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,884
Yeah, right.

91
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,895
Do you need me
to write this down?

92
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,064
Hey, Dr. Robbins.

93
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,600
Good morning. David
Moore. I'm your prosthetist.

94
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,420
Um, you know, we're gonna
be working together for a while.

95
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:36,024
You can call me David.
Can I call you Arizona?

96
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,809
What's a while?

97
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,411
Well, till one of us dies
or your leg grows back.

98
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,586
Yeah, that joke's always a risk.

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
Which one of these is mine?

100
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,688
Uh, none of those, actually.

101
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,659
Today we're just gonna get
you started on a post-op socket,

102
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,272
and that'll give us a good idea

103
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,497
of what's most
comfortable moving forward.

104
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,365
May I?

105
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,768
Mm.

106
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,353
Oh! Excellent.

107
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,422
You see how there's
no scar tissue?

108
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,641
That means it's healing well.

109
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,992
Oh, great.

110
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,713
Yeah, it is.

111
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,966
All right. Let's get to work?

112
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,120
Just stop having sex with him.

113
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,890
<i>I am trying to fit
in. I live here now.</i>

114
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,293
I have to just, you know, adapt.

115
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,506
So I'm making friends.

116
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,107
<i>But you don't even like him.</i>

117
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,648
Who says I have to like
him? He's my sex friend.

118
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,083
Eww!

119
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,151
Well, what about the
ancient guy? What about him?

120
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,998
You want me to be sex
friends with the ancient guy?

121
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,490
No. I want you to be regular
friends with the ancient guy

122
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,826
and stop having sex
friends in general.

123
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,111
<i>I am regular friends
with the ancient guy.</i>

124
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,814
He, frankly, is my bestie.

125
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,123
He's my you here in Minnesota.

126
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,884
Well, how does the
ancient Minnesota me

127
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,114
feel about you being
sex friends with Parker?

128
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:57,789
You know, it's no big
deal. Parker is fine.

129
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,058
<i>A little reptilian, a
little chatty, but fine.</i>

130
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,342
This is a cry for help.

131
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:02,956
It's a cry for an orgasm.

132
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,390
<i>And how's that working out?</i>

133
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,697
Meh!

134
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,578
Dr. Grey, the radiologist report

135
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,263
does indicate a
retrocrural mass,

136
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,720
which means I could
be right, right? Or not?

137
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,188
Holy crap. What?

138
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:15,817
I gotta go.

139
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,961
Holy crap.

140
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,648
Is it a big surprise?

141
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,849
It's very big.

142
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,385
Will I need to use two hands?

143
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,620
Two hands won't be enough.

144
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,338
Ooh!

145
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,553
Dr. Webber, does
this bed go down at all?

146
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:38,746
Bryan, this is the urologist
that I was talking to you about.

147
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,465
This is Dr. Catherine Avery.

148
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,085
Before you say anything, no, these
aren't basketballs in my pockets,

149
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,372
and, yes, I am very
happy to see you.

150
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,193
Surprise.

151
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,963
I don't understand why
you've let it get this bad

152
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,498
before seeking treatment.

153
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,077
He's using it as
an excuse to avoid

154
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,546
our 10-year high school reunion.

155
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,547
Paula, I am not. He is.

156
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,870
It wasn't this bad before.

157
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,484
I mean, I've seen other doctors

158
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,942
who prescribed pills that
never seemed to work.

159
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,354
Then a few months
ago, everything

160
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,595
sort of just blew up.

161
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,231
He wouldn't even have
come if I hadn't dragged him.

162
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,444
I would have. When?

163
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,454
After the reunion.

164
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,122
Bryan, there's no need to fear.

165
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,669
By the time we get
finished with you,

166
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:43,378
you'll be hitting that reunion
with 98% less scrotum.

167
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,866
Dr. Thomas, the
PDA was one thing,

168
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,129
but now with the blockage,
does that mean two surgeries?

169
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:51,936
No, it means two procedures,

170
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,022
both of which I propose to
perform during one surgery.

171
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,737
We'll fix your PDA from
the side, then flip you over

172
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,923
and then open up your
blocked arteries from the front.

173
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,097
Flip me, spin me...
Whatever you want.

174
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,598
If it means not feeling like

175
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,585
I'm trapped in the body
of an 80 year old anymore,

176
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,315
I'm in. THOMAS:
Janet, believe me.

177
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,838
I know exactly how you feel.

178
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,341
Because he's old.
He's very, very old.

179
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,054
Don't mistake Dr. Yang's

180
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,706
disrespect for a sense of humor.

181
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,812
She hasn't got one.

182
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,398
No, no, no. I respect you.

183
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,782
You're a historical landmark.

184
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,151
Case in point.

185
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,219
Like the Grand
Canyon. Keep it up.

186
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,620
Only older.

187
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,956
All right. Enough.

188
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,368
Just a smidge. Oh, my God.

189
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,673
A smidge older than that.

190
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,048
I work out all the time.
I read <i>Men's Health.</i>

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,768
And I don't eat
anything I actually want.

192
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,219
And you're telling
me I'm gonna die?

193
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,184
This tumor is difficult to
resect. It's not impossible.

194
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,345
Rob, you're in
private security, right?

195
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,046
Yeah, I'm a bodyguard.

196
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,350
All right. Well, that's my
job, too. I have your back.

197
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,118
Yeah, you know what?

198
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,304
This tumor is
just a little punk.

199
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,591
Can I have some tissue, please?

200
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,433
Any questions?

201
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,614
When you performed
that transcranial resection

202
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,271
of clival chordoma in 2003,

203
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,984
did you realize you'd
become a major influence

204
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,158
on surgeons around the world?

205
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,859
Any questions
about central lines?

206
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:27,160
Okay, look, I get that you
went over this in med school,

207
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,761
but as interns,
you're gonna be asked

208
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,265
to insert central
lines every day.

209
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,620
Do it incorrectly, and
the patient could die.

210
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,267
I could be watching
a whipple right now.

211
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,802
I heard that Dr. Webber has a
patient with scrotal lymphedema.

212
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,960
- Scrotal lymphedema?
- Ladies.

213
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,207
Dr. Shepherd. I have a
question about central lines.

214
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,513
Great. Go ahead.

215
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,243
In learning to insert
your first central line,

216
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,512
did you develop any of
the skills that contributed

217
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:49,254
to your influential clival
chordoma resection in 2003?

218
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:53,842
Dr. Yang, can I see you
for a second, please?

219
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,176
You know, I'll be right back.

220
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,343
Is this gonna take long?
Just a quick question.

221
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,451
Did you even try to suggest
a less invasive approach?

222
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,853
Uh, yeah. Of course I
did. A hybrid surgery.

223
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,716
Only one incision,
done in half the time.

224
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,741
When? When did you suggest it?

225
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,176
I don't know. Yesterday.
What did he say?

226
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,997
He said, "Are we a hospital
or a pizza delivery service?"

227
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,177
He asked if we needed it
done in 30 minutes or less.

228
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,917
He is so stubborn.

229
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,303
Yeah. But he's not wrong.

230
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,972
I mean, his way minimizes
the risk of recurrent shunt.

231
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,902
I mean, it's old school, but
I never would've thought...

232
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,960
Got it. Sounds great.

233
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,189
Okay. So I can go back?

234
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,096
Yeah, go, go. Enjoy
it while you can.

235
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,773
What does that mean?

236
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,078
Will I be off probation soon?

237
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,252
Just go.

238
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,957
Most men would just
bring a girl flowers.

239
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:48,829
You know, this is a very
dangerous game we're playing.

240
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,943
I've done my best to
keep Jackson in the dark

241
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,334
about the further adventures
of Catherine and Richard.

242
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,371
Which is why I made sure to
grab Dr. Quaid for the skin flap.

243
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,919
There's no reason Jackson
needs to be in that OR.

244
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,259
Maybe that's a mistake.

245
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,745
I come into town
to work on a case

246
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:06,180
that has a large
plastics component

247
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,282
and don't bring him in?

248
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,671
You saying it seems suspicious?

249
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,204
Maybe. Oh, maybe not.

250
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,607
It's just like high school.

251
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,676
I know. Isn't it fun?

252
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,125
Ooh, when you said you
were busy, you weren't kidding.

253
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,350
Dr. Bailey, how
nice to see you. Hi.

254
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,730
What happened to your
small bowel obstruction?

255
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:28,887
Cleared up.

256
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,366
Hey, you wouldn't
need an extra set

257
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,173
of hands on those
puppies, would you?

258
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,609
Uh, well, actually, I was hoping

259
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,055
that April Kepner
could come aboard.

260
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,446
Kepner?

261
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:41,215
Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm
taking her under my wing.

262
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,984
She's fragile. You understand.

263
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,920
That is a giant scrotum.
I do not understand.

264
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,423
I'm sorry, Bailey.

265
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:50,733
Next time.

266
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,118
Hey. You're the prosthetist?

267
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,421
Yeah. I've always thought that'd
make a good title for a movie.

268
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,368
Hey, David Moore.
Alex Karev, peds.

269
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,270
Uh, if you're looking for
Dr. Robbins, she's over in the clinic.

270
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,594
We're about to do a plaster
cast of her residual limb.

271
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,896
But you've got a few minutes.

272
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,664
Oh, no, that's cool.

273
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,310
I was just hoping that you
could tell me how she's doing.

274
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,402
Any scar tissue or contractures?

275
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,187
No. So far, so good.

276
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,021
All right.

277
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,635
How soon before she's
back up on her feet?

278
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,425
That's a little harder to say.

279
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,127
I should have a better
idea after tomorrow, though.

280
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,412
Tell her you stopped by?

281
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,298
No, no, don't, because I didn't.

282
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,872
All right. Keep trying, folks.
Nobody gets it the first time.

283
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,658
Or the 40th time, apparently.

284
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,262
I just can't seem
to locate the vein.

285
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,663
Okay, give it to me.

286
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,931
I...

287
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,171
Um...

288
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,338
Close your eyes.

289
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,374
Visualize the anatomy.

290
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,288
Subclavian vein is
what you're looking for.

291
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,023
Okay, walk it up the clavicle.

292
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,247
Okay. Watch on the
angle. Not too deep.

293
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,410
I see it.

294
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,866
Mmm. Watch your angle.

295
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,837
Boom. That's arterial blood.

296
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,146
He's gonna bleed to death.

297
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,724
So not boom?

298
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,027
No. Not boom.

299
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,269
You've gotta work around the
azygos and the hemiazygos veins.

300
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,940
There's fatty tissue, lymph
nodes, lymphatic tissue

301
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,508
and the sympathetic chains,

302
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,576
not to mention the fact

303
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:36,647
that the tumor has lifted
up the inferior vena cava

304
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,283
and is adherent to the aorta.

305
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,585
This is a mess.

306
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,853
I know.

307
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,122
So how do we get the entire mass

308
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,341
without having to
resect the aorta?

309
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,426
I have no idea.

310
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,339
Yeah, I'm happy to
take this off your hands.

311
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,683
I called you for an opinion,
not to steal my surgery.

312
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,936
No first-year attending
in her right mind

313
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,832
is gonna want to take
on something like this.

314
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:02,151
I mean, not when
full responsibility

315
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,375
for every decision
made in the OR

316
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,977
falls on her shoulders...

317
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,795
Mine.

318
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,478
Don't come crying to me when a
man's bleeding out on your table

319
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,696
just 'cause you think you bad.

320
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,569
Oh, she's bad.

321
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,070
Yeah, we'll see.

322
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,960
I still don't understand
what it is I'm looking at.

323
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,211
Those are testicles, Dr. Kepner.

324
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,659
Don't worry, sweetheart.

325
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:27,910
They're not supposed
to look like that.

326
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,045
I know what testicles are...

327
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,782
Jackson didn't mention
that you were coming.

328
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,822
He didn't know.

329
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,302
He made it very
clear, he would like me

330
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:39,059
to stay out of his
personal business,

331
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,812
so I am doing my best.

332
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
Well, I think that's great.

333
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,266
I've made no such
promises to you.

334
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:48,235
You need to start prepping
for next year's boards.

335
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,237
There's a fellow in our
gynecology department

336
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,107
that's an excellent
tutor. And he's cute.

337
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:55,426
That's not really even...

338
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,495
I said it before, and
I will say it again.

339
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,597
You're just too uptight, baby.

340
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,933
You need to get L-A-I-D.

341
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,067
Dr. Avery.

342
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,585
Look at me.

343
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,320
Look at me.

344
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,657
I am having the best
sex I have had in years.

345
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:10,936
Mm-hmm.

346
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,728
And it's just opened
me up like a flower,

347
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,797
blossoming towards the sun.

348
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,131
Mm.

349
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,440
That's a powerful image.

350
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,919
I bet that fellow knows
his way around a woman.

351
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,872
Oh, relax. I'm kidding.

352
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,841
See that? That's what I mean.

353
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:28,642
Uptight.

354
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:32,513
But I will give you his
number, just in case.

355
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,621
Hey, Dr. Webber.

356
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,973
Dr. Webber.

357
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,108
Um, yes, sir.

358
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,944
Why is my name on
tomorrow's OR schedule

359
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,379
for a scrotal lymphedema
surgery with you?

360
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,493
Got the wrong Avery. I'm doing
the surgery with your mother.

361
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,003
My mother's here
performing a surgery with you?

362
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:59,573
But we were hoping that you'd
be available to do a skin flap.

363
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,260
Actually, she sent me
to find you for a consult.

364
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,995
O... Okay, sure.

365
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,984
Yeah, I'll just be
a minute. Great.

366
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,169
Just a few more minutes, okay?

367
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,504
It's fine.

368
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,476
Oh! Uh...

369
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,924
Sorry. I thought you'd be ready.

370
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,582
That's because you didn't
check your voice mail.

371
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,250
You just looked
to see who called.

372
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,652
If you had checked
your freakin' voice mail,

373
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,549
then you would know that I
was still gonna be here a while,

374
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,573
because you would've
gotten the freakin' message!

375
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:35,877
I'll come back.

376
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,254
You know, my brother, he
never checks his voice mail either.

377
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,956
It's maddening.

378
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,277
Derek must be so proud.

379
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,557
You'll be, like, Mr. and
Mrs. Impossible Tumor.

380
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,781
But that's the problem.

381
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,695
I mean, he's not
Mr. Impossible Tumor anymore.

382
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,145
<i>And I don't want
to rub his nose in it.</i>

383
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,036
<i>He's trying to be so
cheery about teaching.</i>

384
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,838
Aw. That's so sad.

385
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,940
It's not sad. It's
just an adjustment.

386
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,903
<i>Can you imagine never
doing surgery again?</i>

387
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,928
I can. I do. I mean, he
didn't see this coming.

388
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,531
<i>So I just try to
enjoy it while I can.</i>

389
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,334
Oh, my God. He
doesn't see it coming.

390
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,863
Oh, my God. Thanks,
Mer. I gotta go.

391
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,620
Okay.

392
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,143
Oh! I hate teaching.

393
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,411
You love teaching.

394
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,140
I just never realized
how much I rely on

395
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,841
just having them be able
to watch me do the thing.

396
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,694
Well, I used to love it
when you stood behind me

397
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,450
and whispered
instructions in my ear.

398
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,079
Well, I can't do
that with all the kids.

399
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,155
How are you? How are you?

400
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,724
Yes, I know.

401
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,503
So I'm guessing your
intern didn't like finding out

402
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,567
she was wrong about the tumor.

403
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,963
No, she didn't like it at all.

404
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,238
This is the last time.

405
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,517
The last time was the last time.

406
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,453
Yeah, but this is
the last last time.

407
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,761
I have to be in the OR all
day tomorrow with your mom.

408
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,095
You're in that surgery, too?

409
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,515
What do you mean "too"?
Wait. You're gonna be there?

410
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,217
Yeah. No, no, no.

411
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,185
We cannot both be in that OR.

412
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,620
She's gonna figure it out.

413
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,239
She is obsessed
with my sex life.

414
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,207
She's having amazing
sex, so I have to, too.

415
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,643
Ga... Wh...

416
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,778
Sorry. Sorry. You
don't want to hear that.

417
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,208
Webber's still banging my mom.

418
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,232
That's who she called
the best sex of her life?

419
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,420
Ohh.

420
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,636
And we're done here.

421
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,486
White wine. MAN: What kind?

422
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,976
The big kind?

423
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,778
Torres, it's late.

424
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,079
Yeah.

425
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,480
Well, you know how they say

426
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,583
one of the biggest things
couples fight about is money?

427
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,080
Turns out money fights ain't got
nothing on an amputation fight.

428
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,337
I can imagine.

429
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,905
Yeah, but I can't
get mad or yell,

430
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:47,758
because then I'm the woman
yelling at her one-legged wife.

431
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,394
So I've been
sleeping at Mark's, but

432
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,448
I don't think I can take another
night in my dead best friend's bed.

433
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,217
It just reminds
me that he's gone,

434
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,968
and I end up having
the worst dreams.

435
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,948
It's getting so bad, I even
considered asking Shepherd

436
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,812
if I could crash in his
trailer in the woods.

437
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,051
Mm. That's pretty bad.

438
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,175
Yep.

439
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,095
Sorry. That was a lot.

440
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,497
Oh, I asked.

441
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,998
I'm not sure you did.

442
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,266
It's fine.

443
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,937
Honestly...

444
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,239
I haven't been
sleeping too well, either.

445
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:22,577
Want another?

446
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:23,756
Uh, yeah.

447
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,290
Yeah? Yeah.

448
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:28,348
He'll have another.

449
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,217
Not to add insult to injury, but
that's the worst tie I've ever seen.

450
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,604
I'm sorry.

451
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,129
Yeah, coming.

452
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,719
Well, hey there.

453
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,887
Uh...

454
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,783
I didn't know we... We're not.

455
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,585
What's your deal
with Dr. Thomas?

456
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,009
You came here to talk
about Craig Thomas?

457
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,396
Well, color me disappointed.

458
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,784
You said, "Enjoy him while
you can." What does that mean?

459
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,218
Come on in.

460
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,820
It's cold.

461
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,106
Are you firing him?

462
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,377
We can't fire him.

463
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,546
We can

464
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,498
force him to retire, though.

465
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,401
Listen, telling you this

466
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,938
breaks a whole bushel
of board regulations.

467
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,584
Tell me one mistake he's made.

468
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,275
He hasn't. Not yet.

469
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,943
But when he does,

470
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,512
his age will make it an instant

471
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,664
malpractice suit
that we will lose.

472
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,999
He's years behind the
medical education curve.

473
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,752
You said it yourself.

474
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,521
He refused to try a
minimally invasive technique.

475
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:41,622
Why,

476
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,824
because he's stubborn

477
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:46,093
or because he doesn't know how?

478
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,374
That's why you've had
me working with him.

479
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,700
Well, yeah, you represent
everything that is new

480
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,968
and smart and
advanced in our field.

481
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,420
You're his opposite.

482
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,223
And when the time
comes to make a case,

483
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,025
it won't hurt to have
you help us do it.

484
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,271
You should've told me.

485
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,827
Ethically, no.

486
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,362
Ethically, yes.

487
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,533
You should have.

488
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,322
Honestly, I never would've
thought you'd have a problem with it.

489
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,876
I can't see anything.

490
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,156
You described them as,

491
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,681
"So big, a sheet
couldn't cover them."

492
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,432
I may have exaggerated.

493
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,460
Okay, ladies, this
isn't a sideshow.

494
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,255
Gentlemen, step right up.

495
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,477
That's it?

496
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,080
Okay. That's not okay.

497
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,335
Oh, great. Karev's here.

498
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,603
Here to make us all
laugh with funny jokes

499
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,850
about my hands on a man's parts.

500
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,691
This isn't funny. That poor guy.

501
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:53,994
I know.

502
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,981
Can you imagine
becoming so swollen

503
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,317
that a surgeon
needs to use a scalpel

504
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,352
to dig out all
that excess tissue

505
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,789
until the testicles and
cords hit the open air?

506
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,236
I mean, who even knows what
happened to his penis in all that mess?

507
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,660
That's not okay.

508
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,347
Nice.

509
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,412
Your mother won't stop
asking me why I look so tired.

510
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,219
Why do you look so tired?

511
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,741
They look so cute
together. Shut up.

512
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,654
Think they look
tired? Go to hell.

513
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,134
The hybrid surgery
was a good pitch.

514
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,263
Yes, it was.

515
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,916
So why aren't we doing it?

516
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,086
Because we have a
surgical plan. Hmm.

517
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,766
Do you have a problem, Dr. Yang?

518
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,290
Nope. But I think you do.

519
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,393
I think you reject my pitches
because they scare you.

520
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,273
I thought you were
learning something from me.

521
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,663
I have.

522
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,876
I have learned that mortality
is breathing down your neck,

523
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,195
and you are running from the
future like a scared old chicken.

524
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,864
I won't change my
plan just because...

525
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,771
Won't or can't?

526
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm perfectly capable of
threading a catheter, Dr. Yang.

527
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,459
Prove it. Prove me wrong.

528
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,902
Take a deep
breath for me, Bryan.

529
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,853
Good. And let it out.

530
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,994
Um, what about my recovery time?

531
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,098
I mean, is there any chance I
won't be able to walk for a while?

532
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,101
God, Bryan. Stop
hiding from Amy Miller.

533
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,753
I'm not. She probably
won't even be at the reunion.

534
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,156
She will. Sheryl
Thompson told me so.

535
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,858
Also said she's single.

536
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,221
You're not that skinny kid
from rocketry club anymore.

537
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,146
You're smart. You're funny.
You're good enough for Amy.

538
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,742
Actually, you're
too good for Amy.

539
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,784
You would be the
perfect guy, except...

540
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,285
Except I've got giant balls?

541
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,502
No!

542
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,339
Except that you don't.

543
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,987
<i>It's a good trade, Grey.</i>

544
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,495
My two leisurely
abdominal surgeries

545
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,181
for just one retrocrural tumor.

546
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,733
This is getting a little sad.

547
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,813
No, I'll tell you what's sad.
Meredith Grey flaming out

548
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,481
'cause she doesn't know a
good bargain when she sees one.

549
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,025
Stop, Mr. Mays.

550
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,873
Mr. Mays!

551
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,776
Mr. Mays, stop!

552
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,544
Should've made the trade.

553
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,497
Dr. Bailey. Hey, I might
be interested in a trade.

554
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,401
He's right over there.

555
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:15,931
I mean, do I call for backup?
Do I get a net or what?

556
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,221
Forget it.

557
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,660
I would operate out here,

558
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,340
but I don't think it's
particularly sterile.

559
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,180
You lied to me. I didn't.

560
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,828
That intern was in the hallway
bragging to all her little friends

561
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:32,519
about my once-in-a-career tumor.

562
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,938
She said you didn't even know
where you were gonna start.

563
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,865
With a tumor like
this, no surgeon would

564
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,667
until you're open
and on the table

565
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,435
and I can get a
look at the thing.

566
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,965
Yeah, well, that's terrifying.

567
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,889
I know. That's
why I didn't tell you.

568
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,357
You're an emotional guy.

569
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,314
Not usually.

570
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,827
I mean, at work, I'm in
dangerous situations all the time.

571
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,546
But then, you know,
it's all about the client.

572
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,204
So I'm not allowed to freak out.

573
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,750
But right now, I'm freaking out.

574
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,125
Okay. Well, today you're
allowed, because I won't.

575
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:15,440
That intern's got a big mouth.

576
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:16,980
Yeah. Tell me about it.

577
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,087
Dr. Torres.

578
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,890
Um, did you hear anything
about Robbins' fitting?

579
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,425
I mean, Moore said...

580
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,027
You spoke to Moore?

581
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,057
I told you not to do
that. If she'd seen you...

582
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:33,775
Look, I'm the one
who cut off her leg.

583
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,444
If she has a problem
adjusting to the prosthetic

584
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,078
or if it turns out she's
gotta have more surgery...

585
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,730
I mean, what if I screwed it up?

586
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,198
She even blames me
for being on the plane.

587
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,833
She doesn't blame you, Karev.

588
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,168
She doesn't even
know you made the cut.

589
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:45,253
I made the call, okay? I
was supposed to protect her.

590
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,357
I'm the bad doctor, the bad
person. Your name never comes up.

591
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,220
Now if this doesn't feel right,

592
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,622
I can adjust it or we
can try a whole new cast.

593
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,890
It's fine.

594
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,459
Don't rush this.

595
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,872
If it's not right, you're the
one that suffers, not me.

596
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,542
Okay, let's get
you up on your feet.

597
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,910
No, that's fine.
I don't need to...

598
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,834
I need to see you
take a few steps.

599
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,114
Let's see how it feels when you
put some weight on it, all right?

600
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,688
No. Hey, let go!

601
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,194
Arizona, you can't
do this on your own.

602
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,012
You need help.

603
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,893
If we do this right and we... And
we get you on a prosthetic that fits,

604
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,084
you'll need less, but
you are not there yet.

605
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,131
And, you know, you're very lucky

606
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,666
to have people in
your corner that care.

607
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,022
You should let them help.

608
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,459
You're like a gift from God.

609
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,727
I was talking about
me. I barely know you.

610
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,831
I'm here because this is my job.

611
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,044
I have plenty of other things
I could be doing right now.

612
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,908
Yeah? Well, why
don't you go do them?

613
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,487
You know, I think I will.

614
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,535
Okay, folks. Let's get started.

615
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,320
Dr. Shepherd?

616
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,772
Yeah.

617
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,668
We were wondering
if, instead of a lecture,

618
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,170
we might be able to watch
Dr. Grey remove that rare tumor.

619
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,695
Dr. Grey is not
removing a rare tumor.

620
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,141
Yeah, she is. No, she's not.

621
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,966
But she and Dr. Brooks
are in OR one right now.

622
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,994
What did you say to him?

623
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,097
Who?

624
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,865
Thomas.

625
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,434
Because, you know, legally,

626
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,447
I could get in a lot of trouble
for telling you about the...

627
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,398
I didn't say anything.
It was his idea.

628
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,722
Really?

629
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,301
He just suddenly
changes his mind

630
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,675
and goes with an approach
he rejected two days ago?

631
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,211
I know. I was surprised, too.

632
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,463
I was, like, "Whoa!
What a surprise."

633
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,068
Okay.

634
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,304
No, actually, maybe
we lucked out.

635
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,274
I've never seen him
use one of those.

636
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,777
I wouldn't even allow it if I
didn't know you'd be in there

637
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,712
to take over when he craps out.

638
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,499
When he does, it might
just be all the board needs

639
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:07,067
to proceed with his dismissal.

640
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,172
<i>Dr. Yang.</i>

641
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,614
Suction.

642
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,360
I'm sorry. You're
just such a badass.

643
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,162
And I shouldn't
have been bragging,

644
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:25,947
but I liked feeling
like one, too.

645
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,599
If I was a real
badass, I would've just

646
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,284
kept my mouth shut,
been stoic, silent.

647
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,624
Yeah. Why don't you try that?

648
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,216
<i>More suction, please.</i> Mm.

649
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,185
Hey.

650
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,688
<i>I can't get good visualization.</i>

651
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:45,867
That's a big tumor.

652
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,907
Yeah, it is.

653
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,671
She didn't even
tell me about it.

654
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,495
I found out through
one of my interns. Huh!

655
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,109
My wife is bubble wrapping me.

656
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,918
Shepherd, you have a reputation

657
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,565
for needing to be
bubble wrapped.

658
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,256
Excuse me?

659
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,226
You fight for your patients
against the worst possible odds,

660
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:09,929
but when things get messy
personally, you're gone...

661
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,666
Off to the woods to
drink and grow a beard.

662
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,367
And with everything
that's happened

663
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,003
and this lawsuit
keeping it all alive,

664
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,570
maybe she just

665
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:19,272
worried that the
slightest little thing

666
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,985
is gonna make you
run off to that trailer

667
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,543
and leave her alone

668
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,194
in the house you gave her,

669
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,181
not sleeping at night because
whichever room she lays down in,

670
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,117
she just can't get away from
the fact that you're just not there.

671
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:36,376
Sounds like you had that
all teed up and ready to go.

672
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,076
Yeah. Yeah,
well, a version of it.

673
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,722
It's meant for somebody
else, you know,

674
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,274
but, it kind of works here, too.

675
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,498
You don't think
she's coming back.

676
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,551
No. No, I don't.

677
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,138
<i>Here it is.</i>

678
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,333
Where do we start?

679
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,862
We need to identify the
testicles and the cords.

680
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,319
Don't want to damage them.

681
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,322
Yes, ma'am. I'll
keep my eyes peeled.

682
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,341
I'm having the best time.

683
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,826
Forceps.

684
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,540
What's with the face?
I'm not making a face.

685
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,975
I've spent a few thousand hours
looking at you with a mask on.

686
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,127
I know when you're
making a face.

687
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,583
Bailey, I'm not making a face.

688
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,470
Just so you know, I did
not bully April Kepner

689
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,622
into giving up this surgery.
She approached me.

690
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,423
So... Nuts to her.

691
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,360
Get it? Nuts to her?

692
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,881
Oh, come on. You get it.

693
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,917
I'm a urologist, Dr. Bailey.
Of course I get it.

694
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,153
Hey, I spend most
of my day in a bowel.

695
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,121
Doesn't mean I
don't laugh at a fart.

696
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,195
Oh! Tough room.

697
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,747
Oh, hey, Avery, knock, knock.

698
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,760
I think I just located
the left testicle.

699
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,084
Yes, you have.

700
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,588
I will continue to excise
the surrounding tissue.

701
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,923
If someone can just
get a hand underneath...

702
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,953
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.

703
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,604
No, no, no. Please.
Go ahead. No, I insist.

704
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,606
For Pete's sake. It's
just a little testicle.

705
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,280
Somebody get up in there.

706
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,561
Of all the organs in the body,

707
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,025
of course it had to be this one.

708
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,473
Damn.

709
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,308
Damn it.

710
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,988
You know, I'm pretty sure
no one's ever closed a PDA

711
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,227
by swearing at the catheter.

712
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,191
I don't need any
tips, thank you.

713
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,215
I've used a guide wire before.

714
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,162
Really? Was that before

715
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,981
or after you learned to use
sheep's blood to lift a witch's curse?

716
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,421
Would you be quiet?

717
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,558
Damn.

718
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,126
Just relax.

719
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,328
Ahh.

720
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,811
I can't pass the wire.
You better take over.

721
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,270
Here.

722
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,556
Your right wrist.

723
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:50,857
What about it?

724
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,225
Just turn it in, like this.

725
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,105
I don't have time for
this. Just try it. Try it.

726
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:56,009
All right. All right. All right.

727
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,053
Oh! That's all, huh?

728
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,504
That's pretty neat.

729
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,283
If you'd like, I can advance
the balloon for you...

730
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,974
Back off, sister.

731
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,743
Eyes on your own work.

732
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,213
Oh!

733
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,497
Ohh!

734
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,368
You okay?

735
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,618
What are you doing here?

736
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:54,204
I was looking for Moore.

737
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,822
Wow!

738
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:06,494
It looks great.

739
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,451
Incision's healed
well. No edema.

740
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,158
You haven't completely destroyed
my department, have you?

741
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,426
Me?

742
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,623
I'm the one thing that's
kept that place together.

743
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,447
This guy Barnett's a
one-man wrecking crew.

744
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,134
We need you back.

745
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,923
I'm trying.

746
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,762
You know, Callie's trying, too.

747
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,630
Hey.

748
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,846
Boy, that went like
gangbusters in there.

749
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,268
It did, huh?

750
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,972
You could look a
little less disappointed.

751
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,541
The guy's a historical treasure.

752
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,650
That's funny. No, it's not.

753
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,297
You're right.

754
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,749
But on the bright side,

755
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,737
you're out of surgery
sooner than expected.

756
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,427
What do you say to a little...

757
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,031
I'm meeting a friend for drinks.

758
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,107
Nice.

759
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,954
That's nice. You're
making friends.

760
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,528
Good night. Well...

761
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,313
It's a little loose.

762
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:10,022
And it... And it
pinches right here.

763
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:12,958
And it hurts a little there.

764
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,578
Okay.

765
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,727
Well, let me see what
we can do about that.

766
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:27,190
Dr. Shepherd. I was visualizing
the anatomy all wrong.

767
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:29,523
But if I just do it the
way you told me...

768
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:34,997
Excellent work.

769
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,167
Keep going.

770
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:41,599
It's not so hopeless after all.

771
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,307
Hey, you got a second?

772
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,775
Yeah.

773
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,894
Good news, Bryan.

774
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:50,963
The procedure went as planned.

775
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,266
Amy Miller's got a
lot to look forward to.

776
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:56,686
You know, it's
really not about Amy.

777
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,334
But Paula and I have
been friends for so long,

778
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,718
I've never really
known how to say it.

779
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,747
Son, it's none of my business,

780
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,311
but I don't think you oughta
be ashamed of your feelings.

781
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,369
Seems to me we just
surgically removed

782
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,887
the only thing you had
to be embarrassed about.

783
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,005
Hey.

784
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,571
There's a whole lot less
of you under that blanket.

785
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,126
Would you mind?

786
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,150
No, not at all.

787
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:29,268
Hi.

788
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,980
Think we'll get
invited to the wedding?

789
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:43,949
Hey.

790
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,803
I need a moment to talk
to Dr. Webber, man to man.

791
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,099
Oh, no. No, you don't.

792
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,306
Mom!

793
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,975
It's all right.

794
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,242
It's all right.

795
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,912
Well, all right, then.

796
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,833
All right, here's the deal.

797
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,568
I understand

798
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,839
how two people can
be drawn together

799
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:08,474
even though they know
it's incredibly wrong

800
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:10,793
and it's something that
shouldn't have happened.

801
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,863
Sex is a powerful force.

802
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,600
All right, look...

803
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,853
You hurt my mom, and I hurt you.

804
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,489
I wouldn't hurt your mom.

805
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:23,673
I like her.

806
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,262
And I don't like
that you like her.

807
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,064
Well, man to man,

808
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,453
you're just gonna
have to deal with it.

809
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,530
You don't want a piece of this.

810
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:40,206
Not today.

811
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,442
I'm watching you.

812
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,187
I hope you like the view.

813
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,468
I know what you're thinking.

814
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,404
I'm married.

815
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,591
I haven't forgotten that.

816
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:19,295
Actually, I was thinking
that all of that over there

817
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,998
took some pretty big balls.

818
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,742
How was your day?

819
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,644
Fine.

820
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,381
How about the tumor? Hmm?

821
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,649
I was in the gallery.

822
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,068
That was no big deal.

823
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,781
I'm not gonna grow
a beard and run off

824
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,416
and live in the woods anymore.

825
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,880
If you have a good day,
I want to hear about it.

826
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,776
It was amazing, actually.

827
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:51,461
I didn't know where
the hell to start.

828
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,780
I stood there staring
at the thing forever.

829
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,833
I knew that supraceliac aorta
was gonna be a bitch to get around.

830
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,279
And I couldn't risk
clamping without

831
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,647
killing off the gut
and the kidneys.

832
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,571
And then finally,
it just came to me.

833
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,417
Mattox Maneuver.
That's a trauma move.

834
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,521
Right, and it exposed the
other side of the kidney,

835
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,760
and wham... I had
perfect visualization.

836
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,716
What is that for?

837
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,945
Contact high. I might
not come down for hours.

838
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,845
Okay, Sofia's
down for the night.

839
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:28,864
And I'll be at Mark's
if you need anything.

840
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,933
<i>American Bake Off</i>
is on in a few minutes.

841
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:43,429
<i>It might be hard for
a surgeon to admit...</i>

842
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,316
<i>But there's no shame
in simply being human.</i>

843
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,086
<i>It can be a relief
to stop hiding...</i>

844
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,568
<i>To accept who you really are</i>

845
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,704
<i>and let the world
see you that way, too.</i>

846
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:09,955
Mom.

847
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,496
You okay? I'm fine.

848
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,038
Are you sure? Yeah.

849
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,937
Want to have sex?

850
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,966
Yeah.

851
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,728
<i>A little self-awareness
never hurt anybody.</i>

852
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,331
I know they're
trying to push me out.

853
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,284
Got this watch at a
surprise retirement party

854
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,887
four years ago.

855
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,421
I mean, it's a piece of junk,

856
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,050
but I wear it just
to screw with them.

857
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:47,159
They are so polite.

858
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:50,780
They don't dare say
anything directly, you know?

859
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,281
Yeah.

860
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:57,069
It's been a while
since I've had anyone

861
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,972
who cared enough
to give me grief.

862
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,197
Mm.

863
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:08,881
I'll have another tequila,

864
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,850
and something that
contains actual alcohol

865
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:14,253
for my friend
here. No, it's late.

866
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:16,722
It's, like, 10:15. Have a drink.

867
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,235
Okay. Yeah.

868
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,592
I'll have...

869
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,962
An old fashioned.

870
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:24,997
What?

871
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,243
Really? An old... You know what?

872
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,911
I'll have two. Two. Make
it two old fashioneds.

873
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,302
There you go.

874
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,003
