1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,608
<i>Work keeps our minds active.</i>

2
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,712
<i>It keeps us out of trouble.</i>

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,515
Thirteen seconds to
run a low-exposure,

4
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,251
high-resolution,
full-body x-ray.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,503
When this ER reopens tomorrow,

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,089
this thing is gonna save
us time, money, and lives.

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,390
Say that first part again.

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:29,845
What, 13 seconds
for a full-body x-ray?

9
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:31,708
We're gonna be able to
do a complete evaluation

10
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,433
of GSWs, stabbings,
crush injuries,

11
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,535
without ever having
to leave this ER.

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,203
Do you like your new toy?

13
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,554
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,873
Then shut up and
thank me for it.

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,548
<i>When we're not working,
our hands are idle,</i>

16
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,418
<i>and the devil will find
work for idle hands to do.</i>

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,586
Need any help?

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,671
Nope.

19
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,539
It's on. You ready?

20
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,157
Mmm-hmm.

21
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:10,896
Obviously I won't be wearing it

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,081
with a t-shirt and underwear.

23
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,805
Oh, no, no, no.

24
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,708
You should only wear it
with a t-shirt and underwear.

25
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,495
Or nothing would be even better.

26
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:23,098
Okay, I have to practice
walking on it for a while,

27
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,487
if I want to wear it to work.

28
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,654
Ooh!

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,890
Yeah, totally.

30
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,459
<i>And when you have an idle mind,</i>

31
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,961
<i>well, that's the devil's
playground, too.</i>

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,164
It was wet and
cold. I got the flu.

33
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,333
And I couldn't wait to go again.

34
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,436
That was the first
time I went fly-fishing.

35
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,548
Has he stopped kicking?

36
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,650
For the moment.

37
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:49,357
Her eyesight is
developing this week.

38
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:52,144
Unless it's not.
Unless she's blind.

39
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,028
She's not blind. Or he's not.

40
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,181
Or if he or she is
blind, that's fine.

41
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,566
Blind is fine.

42
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,102
What do we call it, "it"?

43
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,648
One of us can
say "he," one of us

44
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,099
can say "she,"
and we're covered.

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,123
Well, no, because
then it's gonna be

46
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,312
born thinking one of
us is always wrong.

47
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,705
Well, maybe it
can't hear anyway.

48
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,412
Maybe it's deaf. Deaf is fine.

49
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,098
Helen Keller went
to Harvard, Meredith.

50
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,780
Okay, well, what
if it's not fine?

51
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,638
What if it's absorbed
a twin body?

52
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,900
Two heads, extra arms...

53
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,056
Stop.

54
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,269
I'm just saying,

55
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,838
if anyone's gonna
have a baby with

56
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,372
two heads and three
arms and 11 toes,

57
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,812
it's gonna be me.

58
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,516
Would you just go
to sleep? Please.

59
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,817
Sleep.

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,509
And we own a hospital.

61
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,078
Yeah, we have for
several weeks now.

62
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,579
Yeah, but today it has an ER.

63
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,015
And coffee sleeves with
the new logo on them.

64
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,328
We needed the coffee sleeves,
right? They're a good expense?

65
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:52,553
Oh, yeah, for branding. We
had a 17-hour meeting about it.

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,225
I love the new logo. It
really catches the eye.

67
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,061
And these coffee sleeves,
excellent thermal retention.

68
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,663
What's up with the sheet?

69
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,860
I thought you guys put it
there for some kind of unveiling.

70
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,016
No.

71
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,312
Well, somebody should
say a few words, right?

72
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:07,519
I mean, it's unlucky not to.

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,450
Hey, why are you
guys staring at the wall?

74
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:14,792
Oh, we're waiting
for the big unveiling.

75
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,662
Mmm. Well, you should
be staring at my wife.

76
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,146
New haircut?

77
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,515
No. It's her leg. She's
wearing high heels.

78
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,819
Because she has a sexy high-heel
leg that makes her ass go pow.

79
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:24,948
Ooh, wow!

80
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,254
Hey.

81
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,606
Whoa. Okay.

82
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,223
Baby got back.

83
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,324
Mmm-hmm. Come on, guys.

84
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,638
You can comment, too.
You have permission.

85
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,205
It's the one time in
your life you can say it...

86
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,225
No. And not be gross.

87
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,976
Well, I think it's
a fine gluteal...

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,611
No. Yeah. Let's
just do the unveiling.

89
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,151
No. Yeah.

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,704
Guys, I think the painters
actually just left that there.

91
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,844
Oh.

92
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,122
Let's get back to work.

93
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,457
Okay. End of speech.

94
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,952
Awesome. We are awesome.
Did you see our picture in this?

95
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,206
I'm at 28 weeks and I am
worried about DiGeorge syndrome.

96
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,876
DiGeorge? There's, like,
what, a one in 100,000?

97
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,361
It's too rare.

98
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,508
More likely it'll have a
cleft palate or a heart defect.

99
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,199
Wait, if your baby has
a heart defect, I will fix it.

100
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,734
What about phenylketonuria?

101
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,120
No, we screen for that at
birth and treat it with diet.

102
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,555
What about a giant hemangioma?

103
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,501
Like a huge,
out-of-control bloodsucker?

104
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,824
Now that's a possibility.

105
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,061
Or maybe a congenital cystic
adenomatoid malformation.

106
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,881
Again, I will operate
and do a lung transplant.

107
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,065
We own a hospital...

108
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:30,368
"A cutting-edge,
research-oriented hospital

109
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,365
"with an advanced
Level I trauma center."

110
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,451
Whatever's wrong with
your baby, we will fix it.

111
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,235
But you agree, there's
definitely something wrong?

112
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,842
Oh, my God. Marcus Cho?

113
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,411
Who's Marcus Cho?

114
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,224
He's like a
high-functioning moron

115
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,942
who was a year
behind me at Stanford.

116
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,099
And he just got published
with his attending for...

117
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,168
No. No. For what?

118
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,288
Robot-assisted surgery
for mitral valve regurgitation!

119
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,691
He looks kinda smart.

120
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,359
He's a moron.

121
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,578
I heard there was an OB using
forceps during a breech delivery.

122
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,464
Pulled a little too hard and...

123
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,899
Pop.

124
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,378
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

125
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,820
We'll let these fluids
go in for a few hours

126
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,322
and then set you up
for chemo this afternoon.

127
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,543
Who's gonna set me
up, you or Dr. Wilson?

128
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,722
Dr. Wilson.

129
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,240
She's been begging
for more time with you.

130
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,558
Did you cry?

131
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,398
I have that effect
on the ladies.

132
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,733
I'll bet you do.

133
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,364
Hey. Hey, sorry. You got a sec?

134
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,538
Yeah. Pablo, this is Dr. Myers.

135
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,690
Hey, what's up, Pablo?

136
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,870
I just want to say, I
have that C-section in 20

137
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,306
if you wanted to watch,
unless you're busy.

138
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,279
Watch you actually
do a real surgery?

139
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:34,649
Yeah, you can criticize my scalpel
technique, which is awesome.

140
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:35,984
Dr. Karev?

141
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,185
Uh...

142
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,004
We're slow. I don't care.

143
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,338
Whoa!

144
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,657
Oh! Oh! Whoa.

145
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:45,793
Uh... This popped
out. Is that bad? Sorry.

146
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,679
Hey, don't sweat it, little man.

147
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,497
I'm not little. I'm 12.

148
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,849
My growth was stunted
by a lifetime of cancer.

149
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,589
I'll check in later. Okay?

150
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,853
Did you do that on purpose?

151
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,305
Is she going out
with that nozzle?

152
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,863
I hate him.

153
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,399
Well, the guy's a
doctor. You can't do that.

154
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,311
You know what else we should do?

155
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,571
What?

156
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,033
And get to know the
new electronic board.

157
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,658
It automatically updates
the location of your patients

158
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:18,137
and any labs that
have been ordered.

159
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,889
And we now have
workstations at every bed,

160
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,008
which are fully integrated
with the new charting system.

161
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:25,066
And the beds are now numbered
differently, so just pay attention.

162
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,286
And now what you have
all been waiting for...

163
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:33,124
The Lodox, low-dose
radiation x-ray statscanner.

164
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,443
It provides full-body
anterior and lateral views.

165
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,157
The low radiation
makes imaging safer

166
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,925
for children and pregnant women.

167
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,584
It is our most cutting-edge
tool in diagnostic technology.

168
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,197
Murphy. When can we use it?

169
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,461
Oh! I'll volunteer.

170
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,566
When I was six, I stuck a marble

171
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,818
up my nose, and
it never came out.

172
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,270
We checked my
stool for over a year.

173
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,742
Listen, this is not a toy.

174
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,612
I know we all want to
see this thing in action.

175
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,414
But be patient. The
last thing we need

176
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,161
is some line forming when
some real trauma comes in.

177
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,914
Chief Hunt, we've got an
ATV accident two minutes out.

178
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,104
And here we go.

179
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,718
Oh! Dr. Avery.

180
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,086
Hey, I know you've
been thinking about

181
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,590
raising the profile
of the hospital.

182
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,511
Not today, Dr. Bailey.

183
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,309
Today I am going to the ER
to find something to operate on.

184
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,018
Well, I have a proposal for a Grey
Sloan human genome mapping program

185
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,714
that'll cost less than
Chicago's program.

186
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,349
No money. We spent
it on the new ER.

187
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,751
Okay, if you and the
other board members

188
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,907
would just read over the...

189
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,257
I am a doctor today, Bailey.

190
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,879
Okay. Okay.

191
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,440
What have we got?

192
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,399
16-year-old female.
ATV collision. GCS is six.

193
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,312
Open depressed skull
fracture with active bleeding.

194
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,602
Let's take her to Lodox.

195
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,248
Get a statscan before
we take her to trauma.

196
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,017
They're using the
Lodox. The Lodox?

197
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,608
Oh, someone say "Lodox"?
Got here just in time.

198
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,610
Sweet. This is gonna be great.

199
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:46,130
All right, everyone. Let's
get ready for this transfer.

200
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,933
All right, on my count.

201
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,684
Hold on.

202
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,504
She's bleeding
through these bandages.

203
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,872
Ross, ABP pads.

204
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,190
Got it.

205
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,926
Uh... It looks like it's
a branch of the MCA.

206
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,695
Pressure's not
gonna tamponade it.

207
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:02,396
We need to get her
straight to the OR.

208
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,516
Page Shepherd.
Ross, you're on this.

209
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,728
She's right here.
What about the Lodox?

210
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,051
She needs an intraoperative CT.

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,553
It'll only take 13 seconds.

212
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,065
We don't have 13
seconds to spare.

213
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,951
She could stroke out at
any second. Let's move!

214
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,308
Let's go!

215
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,813
You guys want to
look for my marble?

216
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:32,877
Mr. Kramer.

217
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,662
Our best neurosurgeon,
Dr. Shepherd,

218
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,025
just started operating
on your daughter.

219
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,399
You're gonna fix her, right?

220
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,878
Well, she sustained a
lot of damage to the brain.

221
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,312
Since she wasn't
wearing a helmet...

222
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,669
She was wearing a helmet.

223
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,384
We have been riding every
weekend since she was 13 years old.

224
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,552
I would never let her
near a bike without one.

225
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,188
We stopped to take a picture.
She took her helmet off for a minute,

226
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,607
and that idiot comes
flying out of nowhere.

227
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,963
I swear to God,

228
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,275
I am gonna hunt that
son of a bitch down

229
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,511
and I am gonna
crack his skull open.

230
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,778
We're gonna do
everything we can...

231
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,013
So what are you
standing here for?

232
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,169
Get in there!

233
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,042
Dr. Yang, you got a sec?

234
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,631
I don't. I'm looking
for Dr. Russell.

235
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,123
Well, I'm looking for funding.

236
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,147
You're pitching me now?

237
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,392
Yeah. You're on the board.

238
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,626
And I have been
postponing research

239
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,184
to write policy to
become, like, a lawyer,

240
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,520
while people like Marcus
Cho are out there doing it.

241
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,289
We should be doing it.

242
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,768
Don't you want
this hospital to be on

243
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,169
the cutting edge of
medical research?

244
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,659
Exactly. We're on the same page.

245
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,495
Okay. Then you'll fund
my genome project.

246
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,964
What? No.

247
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,377
I need to find some badass,
earth-shattering cardio research

248
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,578
I can get in on. Okay...

249
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,381
I can't tell you how
happy I am to hear that.

250
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,039
Dr. Russell, I need
to be put to work.

251
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,036
I need to know what research
projects you have pending...

252
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,370
Great. What are you
doing this afternoon?

253
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,478
Oh.

254
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,580
I think I have just
the procedure for you.

255
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,298
I got a page.

256
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,968
I'm sorry. Do you know
who needed a GYN consult?

257
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:48,569
No, I don't know.

258
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,672
Dr. Grey.

259
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,357
Do you need a GYN? Nope.

260
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,193
Then who paged me?

261
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,018
Can I help you?

262
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,848
Well, I noticed your patient
has acute abdominal pain.

263
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,921
Any chest pains?

264
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,835
Because if you wanted to put her

265
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,669
through the Lodox
for a full body scan,

266
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,226
you could.

267
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,557
If you wanted, you
know, to use the Lodox.

268
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,046
Do I need a full body scan?

269
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,548
It only takes 13 seconds.

270
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,584
No, you don't.

271
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,602
No Lodox. Thank you.

272
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,973
Oh...

273
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,686
So recently,

274
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,360
the pain has been getting worse?

275
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,573
I thought I had the stomach flu.

276
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,779
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,026
I drown myself in
that sanitizer stuff,

278
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,986
but when you're teaching
kids, they're just little germ bags.

279
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,122
I've been out for a week.

280
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,557
Oh, I'm sorry.

281
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,027
It's been great for me. I haven't
taken a day off in 28 years.

282
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:50,076
You know how many
cooking shows they have now?

283
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,432
I don't.

284
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,013
It turns out, I love
watching people cook things.

285
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,654
And then this morning,
the pain was so bad,

286
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,290
I couldn't move, so I
called the ambulance.

287
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,377
Okay, Madeline, so from what I'm
seeing here, it looks like gallstones.

288
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:03,756
Oh, God. Does that mean surgery?

289
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,046
It does.

290
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,110
But the good news is, we
can do it laparoscopically,

291
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,051
which means no big incisions
and very little recovery time.

292
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,160
And I'll take them out,
and you'll be on your way.

293
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,705
Well, I get to watch some
more people cook stuff.

294
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,402
Okay, so I'm gonna get
them started on admitting you.

295
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:19,461
You just sit tight.

296
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,878
Great. Thank you.

297
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,744
Did you just update
your patient file?

298
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,011
Mmm-hmm. Watch this.

299
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,023
So cool!

300
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,069
You do get excited about things.

301
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,960
Yes, I do. Hey, how's that baby?

302
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,509
It probably has
three arms and a tail.

303
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,109
How's your paramedic boyfriend?

304
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,532
Terrible.

305
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,451
I mean, great.

306
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,136
Perfect. Just not... I probably
have to break up with him.

307
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,338
Why?

308
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,290
Okay, are you really asking?

309
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,293
Because I really
need to talk about this.

310
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,723
Well, now I'm not
sure I'm asking.

311
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,979
Okay.

312
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,283
Matthew's never
been to the carnival.

313
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,496
And he thinks
that I haven't either

314
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,613
because that's what I told him,

315
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,521
but I have. I'm sorry.

316
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,050
And you want to go to
the carnival together?

317
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,610
Because I've been
already and I rode the rides.

318
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,912
Oh. You went to the
carnival with Jackson.

319
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,183
I have ridden the
rides and they are good.

320
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,496
The tilt-a-whirl

321
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,797
and then that one
that spins around

322
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,164
when your back is
up against the wall

323
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,983
and then the floor falls out
from underneath your feet.

324
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,792
And I want Matthew to go
with me, but he wants to wait,

325
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,646
which is why he's perfect,
because that's what I want.

326
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,015
I always wanted to
wait, but I didn't wait.

327
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,219
And now I just, every night,
push him closer and closer.

328
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,122
And I feel like
I'm just gonna slip

329
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,667
and buy him a ticket and
shove him on the tilt-a-whirl,

330
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,286
and then he's gonna love it,
and I will have corrupted him.

331
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,293
And I'm not a corrupter.

332
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,106
Well, I don't know why
you're talking to me about this.

333
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,298
I am a big fan of the carnival
and I go every chance I get.

334
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,749
Yes, I know, but...

335
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,986
Okay, so your whole thing
is, God has a plan, right?

336
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,121
Yeah.

337
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,151
Well, there must be a reason why

338
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,035
God let you go to
the carnival already.

339
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,044
Maybe you're supposed
to take Matthew.

340
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,463
You're right, I should not
be talking to you about this.

341
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,953
Fancy new ER, and all
I've done is splint a pinkie?

342
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,865
This is why we
bought a hospital?

343
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,756
Hey. If we get off at a decent

344
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,659
time, and we put
Sofia down early,

345
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,411
and I could make
dinner, and we could...

346
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,877
Really?

347
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,050
Really.

348
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:28,222
So, you think tonight?

349
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,124
Is definitely the night.

350
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,909
For sex, right? We're
talking about sex?

351
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,845
The sexy night. Okay.

352
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,163
Ladies, hey, just the two
people I was looking for.

353
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,464
Walk away, Bailey.

354
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,994
No, no, I need to speak
to board members,

355
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,880
and I remember you all
giving me some kind of crap

356
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,231
about how the door's
always open, so...

357
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,438
But right now it's closed.

358
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,473
One minute. It's
the wrong minute.

359
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,008
Are you kidding me?

360
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,310
Okay, what happened
to the new hospital,

361
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,395
run by doctors,
all about doctors?

362
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,197
Okay, well, it...

363
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,960
What happened is, my wife's
new leg is making her feel sexy.

364
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,968
And we haven't had
sex in a long time.

365
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,146
I mean, we've done stuff,

366
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,248
don't get me wrong.

367
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,916
But we haven't done other stuff,

368
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,551
and other stuff is
happening tonight.

369
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,037
So that's what we were talking
about when you interrupted us...

370
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,210
Walking away.

371
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,775
- You warned her.
- I did.

372
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,666
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:19,274
Meredith Grey, I want to talk to
you about human genome mapping.

374
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,236
Right now? Yes, right now.

375
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,493
I'm operating.

376
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,279
Exactly. I have you
cornered. You can't walk away

377
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:26,988
or start talking about
the sexual antics

378
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,549
you're going to
engage in tonight.

379
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,783
But you can listen.

380
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,263
Bailey. Now!

381
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,571
Genetic mapping can lead us to

382
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,140
developing targeted
therapies for diseases.

383
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,975
Oh, no. Oh, yes,

384
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,913
precision medicine, where we
treat illness at its molecular source

385
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,425
instead of just dealing
with the consequences.

386
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,966
What's this?

387
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,952
What it is is the future of
medicine. It's a way that we...

388
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,653
No, Bailey. Shut up.

389
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,050
Please. You're removing a gallstone.
You can do that in your sleep.

390
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,924
No, it's not gallstones.

391
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,645
Oh. It's calcified.

392
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:01,198
Okay, well, you'll need to do a
biopsy and maybe open her up.

393
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,633
But don't think the worst.

394
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,651
This is a hard mass.

395
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,223
This is cancer.

396
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,810
Crap. It's spread to the liver.

397
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,368
If she was teaching until
last week, it can't be that bad.

398
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,455
All right, if we resect part of
the liver maybe we can get it all.

399
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,764
It's worth a try.

400
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:28,409
Mmm. Oh.

401
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,860
Look at that.

402
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,442
It's encasing the hepatic
artery and the bile duct.

403
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,268
We could continue, but
we can't take the artery.

404
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,422
It's unresectable.

405
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:46,561
Well, let's finish up and close.

406
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,577
You have to take that much off?

407
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:53,934
I need the exposure.

408
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,137
There's more damage
than we could see on the CT.

409
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,389
It's been a few hours.

410
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,102
I'd really like to get
an update to the father.

411
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,976
Okay, but just so you know,
he's kind of a big, angry maniac.

412
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,929
You can handle it.

413
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:08,077
Of course. I'll just make
sure security's close by.

414
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,634
Look, Ross, this is an arena
in which I know you excel.

415
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,505
Just start with the
positive news, be confident,

416
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,391
and don't make any
promises you can't keep.

417
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,826
You're my voice out there.

418
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,146
I'll channel you.
It'll be fine. Yes.

419
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,359
I'm Derek Shepherd.

420
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,100
It's a beautiful
day to save lives.

421
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,430
I'll channel you
in my own voice.

422
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,971
Thank you.

423
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,293
This is the lotus valve.

424
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,295
We're doing a lotus valve.

425
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,041
This is the lotus valve.

426
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,899
50% of people with
aortic valve defects

427
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,718
don't survive a
year after diagnosis.

428
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,105
But the lotus valve
is noninvasive.

429
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,972
It minimizes aortic regurge,

430
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,493
doesn't need balloon inflation
or rapid pacing of the heart,

431
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,546
so less stress on the
body, less blood loss, less...

432
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,193
Well, you're
obviously up to speed.

433
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,394
I've been dying
to get in on this

434
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,528
ever since you started testing.

435
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,918
Outstanding.

436
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,748
The results of phase
two have been amazing.

437
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,339
Phase three should be a hoot.

438
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:09,093
God, you can retract and
resheath before you deploy.

439
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,839
Exactly. That's the
best thing about it.

440
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,781
You have total control
over the entire procedure.

441
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,146
It's incredibly flexible if you
don't get it right the first time.

442
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,002
But I imagine you will.

443
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,806
Me?

444
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,486
I wondered if you might like to

445
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,055
try your hand at
placing the valve.

446
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,612
Oh, my God. Yes.

447
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Thank you, sir.

448
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,448
<i>Dr. Jason Myers to the ER.</i>

449
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,916
<i>Dr. Jason Myers to the ER.</i>

450
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,607
Nobody's tried it yet?

451
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,308
No, not yet.

452
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:44,745
That is sad. This is
a beautiful machine.

453
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,614
It is sad.

454
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:50,167
It's like a carnival ride
with all the lights turned off,

455
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,336
just sitting there
going to waste.

456
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,338
It would be so fun...

457
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,591
And it cost us a lot of
money just to be pretty.

458
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,428
Why would God present
us with this gorgeous thing,

459
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,375
just put it right
in front of us,

460
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,394
and then want us not to use it?

461
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,853
I don't think God was involved.
The board paid for it, so...

462
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,723
And we definitely
want it to get used.

463
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,209
Okay, one of you
two paged me, right?

464
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,161
No, I didn't. Nope.

465
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,718
He went to the ER.

466
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,453
Then ortho, then back to the ER,

467
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,139
and then he went
to the cafeteria.

468
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,508
The cafeteria? What a tool.

469
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,976
Yeah.

470
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,488
<i>Dr. Jason Myers to proctology.</i>

471
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,528
Wait. Listen.

472
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:35,797
<i>Dr. Jason Myers to proctology.</i>

473
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:42,853
All right. Well, that was fun, but
I have actual doctor work to do.

474
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,083
Damn.

475
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,701
I got a great idea
for the next one.

476
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,175
Come on.

477
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,362
But if you want to deny
my dying cancer wish...

478
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:58,019
So I'm gonna die from this?
Is that what you're saying?

479
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:02,773
There is no cure for nonresectable
late-stage gallbladder cancer.

480
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,076
Chemo may give
you more time, but

481
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,294
it has not been shown
to provide a cure.

482
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,663
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,167
Ms. Skurski?

484
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,271
You guys, what
are you doing here?

485
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,658
Mr. Arnold said you
were in the hospital.

486
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,827
Dr. Grey, these are
some of my students,

487
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,946
who are supposed to be at their
after-school study session now

488
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,381
with their substitute.

489
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,911
What are you doing
here? Mr. Arnold sucks.

490
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,784
Lucas, we don't say "sucks."

491
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,653
Sorry. He's just a jerk.

492
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:35,267
He sends, like, five people
a day to the principal's office.

493
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,753
And we never get free time,
even after we finish our homework.

494
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,304
And his breath
smells really bad.

495
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,462
You're coming back soon, right?

496
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,536
Of course.

497
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,646
Don't worry.

498
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,089
I'm...

499
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:54,909
I'll be good as new really soon.

500
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,661
Isn't that right, Dr. Grey?

501
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes.

502
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,903
Yes, that's right.

503
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,643
The good news is her
vitals have been stable.

504
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,323
But her injuries are extensive.

505
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,957
We'll be operating
for several more hours.

506
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,417
Wait. What does
that mean, extensive?

507
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,570
It's hard to say.
Susie's suffered damage

508
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,773
to the parts of her brain that
control speech, motor functions...

509
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:29,477
She's paralyzed? My
little girl is paralyzed?

510
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,312
No, no, I mean,
paralysis is a possibility,

511
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,726
but we can't tell what kind of
deficits she'll have until she wakes...

512
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,579
What kind of things are
you expecting? How bad?

513
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,685
There might not be any.

514
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,247
Which one is it, are
there or aren't there?

515
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,498
At this time, it's too early...

516
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:41,716
You said she might
not be able to speak.

517
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
We don't know...

518
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,057
What the hell do you know?

519
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,876
I know this must
be scary for you...

520
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,040
Damn right, because
you don't know anything.

521
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:51,215
Don't talk to me till you
know what's going on,

522
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,417
or get me someone who does!

523
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,008
I know I shouldn't have
lied right in my kids' faces.

524
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,793
I kinda pride myself
on not doing that.

525
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,813
I just couldn't tell
them. I just couldn't.

526
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:11,418
Maybe there's a way
to help prepare them.

527
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,897
Maybe it would
make you feel better.

528
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,788
I teach them science and math.

529
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,925
I teach them things that make
sense, and this doesn't make sense.

530
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,193
I...

531
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,063
Yesterday, I was watching TV.

532
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,531
I was happy to have a little

533
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,951
break from school,
and today, I...

534
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,989
I'm probably not even
gonna make it to finals.

535
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,442
Their parents will
have to tell them. I...

536
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,063
I... Or Mr. Arnold. I just
don't know what I would say.

537
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,802
This sucks!

538
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:51,675
We don't say
"sucks," but this sucks.

539
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,666
I only have a dog bite and
two patients with the flu.

540
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,001
I have a sprained ankle.

541
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,865
Yeah, let's do that.
Get him in the machine.

542
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,504
He doesn't need
a full body scan.

543
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,973
It's a really bad sprain.

544
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,168
I have a stomachache.

545
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,232
Stomachache could be
a tumor, kidney stones.

546
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,839
No, I have a stomachache.

547
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,657
We spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on that thing,

548
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:13,801
and it's just sitting there.

549
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,597
Okay, how bad is the sprain?

550
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,205
What?

551
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:24,074
Ow.

552
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,783
That ass does not quit.

553
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,170
These heels are killing
me. What was I thinking?

554
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:39,189
I mean, heels were a pain
even before I had a plastic leg.

555
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,024
Why'd I think it'd
be better now?

556
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,860
Can I take a look? Nope.

557
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,762
Oh. Well, I just
might be able to help.

558
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,334
You're not my
doctor. You're my wife.

559
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,531
Here we go.

560
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,648
What?

561
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,579
We're not gonna
have sex tonight.

562
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,319
I... Who said...

563
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:53,999
Who said that we're not
gonna have sex tonight?

564
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,918
That's what you're saying.
You just told me your leg hurts

565
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,352
so that tonight when I put on my
drop-dead gorgeous underwear,

566
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,720
you're gonna tell me to
change into my sweats.

567
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,205
And then when I
look disappointed,

568
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,706
you're gonna say, "Please
don't make that face, Callie.

569
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,708
"You know that my leg's
been bothering me today,"

570
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:05,599
and...

571
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,846
What kind of manipulative
bitch do you think I am?

572
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,348
You're not manipulative
and you're not a bitch.

573
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:11,004
Okay? I'm a bitch. Yeah.

574
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,301
You are uncomfortable like you
have been for a very long time now,

575
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,653
and if I were a
really good person,

576
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:16,087
I would continue to be patient,

577
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:19,213
but apparently, I'm not.

578
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,587
A GYN patient just came in.
This time I have a name. Talia.

579
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,991
If you can find her,
you can treat her.

580
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,327
I'm looking for a Ms. Talia.

581
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,129
A Jenny Talia.

582
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,765
I'm here to see Jenny Talia.

583
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:43,353
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

584
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,206
Yeah.

585
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:47,440
Karev.

586
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,075
A moment.

587
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,276
Uh-oh.

588
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,526
What the hell are you doing?

589
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,083
Dr. Webber, I was...

590
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:58,414
Out of all the childish, sophomoric
things to do to someone,

591
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,237
this may be the most pathetic.

592
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,372
Come on. Look at the kid.

593
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,925
He lives in this hospital. He
never gets to have any fun.

594
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,793
What's the big deal?

595
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,706
The big deal is, I thought
you were better than this.

596
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,314
Jenny Talia?

597
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,601
You need to up your game.

598
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,766
You're cutting right
into her frontal lobe.

599
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,189
Calm down, Ross.

600
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,119
Her whole personality
could be affected.

601
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,238
Her memory could be gone, and
that man out there is gonna kill me.

602
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,473
Did I ever tell you about the
first time I went fly-fishing?

603
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,014
No.

604
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:30,066
Yeah, I went out to the Hoh
River to fish winter steelhead.

605
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,053
For hours, I tried to
cast like I'd practiced.

606
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:36,156
But if you over try,
it'll never happen.

607
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,711
And then just once,
the rod loaded perfectly.

608
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,413
The line formed a tight loop,

609
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,232
and the fly just danced out
over the river about 70 feet.

610
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:47,434
It had a life of its own.

611
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:49,836
See, the key was to relax,

612
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,172
feel the rhythm, and
let the rod do the work.

613
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,558
Just one perfect cast.

614
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:56,421
Why'd you tell me that?

615
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:58,211
Did it calm you down?

616
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,747
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

617
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:05,118
Right now I am about to remove
a hematoma from broca's area.

618
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:08,989
And if I am not careful,
she'll never speak again.

619
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,685
There is a lot to be afraid of.

620
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,545
Patients will be afraid.
Parents will be afraid.

621
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,415
And the only way to get
through it is for you to stay calm.

622
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,219
The brain is swelling.

623
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,605
What are we gonna do about that?

624
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,540
We're gonna...

625
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,671
We're gonna give
her more Mannitol.

626
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,312
Good.

627
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,015
That was amazing.

628
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,262
The valve started operating
before I fully released it.

629
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,396
Incredible, right?

630
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,120
And almost no
paravalvular leakage?

631
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,855
Revolutionary technology,

632
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:45,086
and the rate of success with
phase two has been astounding.

633
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,793
Well, when do we
start phase three?

634
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,542
Well, that's up to you, really.

635
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,014
Up to me?

636
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,668
You're giving phase three to me?

637
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,404
No. No. It's my trial.

638
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,790
I don't need another surgeon.

639
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,437
What I need from you is $12
million so I can keep it going,

640
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,829
for patient recruitment,
research staff, lab space.

641
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:10,684
I want to make Grey Sloan the
premier destination for this procedure.

642
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:13,887
I thought you were
bringing me on to this.

643
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,155
You're pitching me.

644
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:16,951
It's nice to finally
have someone

645
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,637
on the board who
gets what I'm doing.

646
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,928
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

647
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,319
The administrative crap
is taking over my career.

648
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,404
Russell called me
"someone on the board."

649
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:33,417
I mean, he doesn't even
see me as a surgeon.

650
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,388
I'm just someone
who cuts budgets.

651
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:38,211
Stop kicking in there.

652
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,209
I mean, what are you, choking
on your cord or something?

653
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,815
Cristina, please talk to it.

654
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:44,462
He or she. Who?

655
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:45,847
The baby. No.

656
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,422
The sound of my voice
only makes it kick harder.

657
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,285
For some reason,
Derek can calm it down.

658
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,525
Maybe you can, too.

659
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:53,527
You know, I'll talk
to it when I see it.

660
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:56,115
When she gets her first
period. I'll take that off your plate.

661
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:59,700
Or if it has a penis, I'll
tell him not to think with it.

662
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,319
Ow! Cristina,
please just talk to it.

663
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,125
Hello.

664
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,226
This is Cristina.

665
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,529
Yang.

666
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:13,842
I don't know. What do
you want me to say?

667
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,215
Anything. Just talk.

668
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,600
Get up.

669
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,153
Hey, this is Miranda Bailey.

670
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,256
I am an excellent surgeon
and a forward thinker.

671
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:26,176
Your mother's a surgeon.
Your father is a surgeon.

672
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,512
You'll very likely
want to be one, too.

673
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,131
But I'm hoping by
the time it's your turn,

674
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,717
there will be very
little surgery left

675
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:37,888
because human genome mapping
will have given people information

676
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,692
so that they can fight their
diseases before they happen.

677
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,909
Keep talking. It's working.

678
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,850
Armed with information, people will
be able to live longer, healthier lives.

679
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,788
Now I know this is a very
expensive undertaking,

680
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:57,257
but maybe if you
hadn't spent so much

681
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:59,660
money on coffee
sleeves and new logos,

682
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:03,080
there'd be money in the budget
to fund a forward thinker like me.

683
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,731
I think she's talking to us now.

684
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,520
Look, here is my proposal,

685
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:15,025
which I've made to you
because you're in charge.

686
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,359
Which is messed up,

687
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,863
but I'm not gonna go there
because I want your money.

688
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,688
We are in charge.

689
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,358
I am in charge.

690
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:34,994
I am gonna crush Marcus
Cho because I am in charge.

691
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,290
Wait. Don't leave. I...

692
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,476
Hey, Cristina,
please talk to it.

693
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,982
Ow.

694
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay, right.

695
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,619
Okay.

696
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,888
That was the
ambulance from earlier.

697
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,901
They thought they left one
of their backboards here.

698
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,737
They found it.

699
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,695
All right. Brooks.

700
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,626
What are you doing? Hop in.

701
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,617
Really? Mmm-hmm.

702
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:59,165
Let's find that marble, and the
rest of you, line up and watch.

703
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,499
At the very least,
we're going to

704
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,003
figure out how to
run this damn thing.

705
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:05,503
Chief, we got a motorcycle
accident coming in.

706
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:06,738
Extensive crush
injuries. Hop out.

707
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:08,590
But it only takes 13
seconds. Out now.

708
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,492
And the rest of you,
let's prep for incoming.

709
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,345
<i>Dr. Marsha Lowe to the ER.</i>

710
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,601
<i>Dr. Marsha Lowe to the ER.</i>

711
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,223
Is that a specimen cup?

712
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,557
Yeah.

713
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,959
Did you place a warm
cup of pee next to me?

714
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,189
It's my urine sample. What,
should I go put it on your desk?

715
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,697
If you want to die.

716
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,042
But the memo says
that you're in charge

717
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,306
of the random drug test policy.

718
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,752
Okay, whatever drugs
you are doing, stop!

719
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,428
Mmm-hmm.

720
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:43,830
Ew.

721
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:45,943
What was that about?

722
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,017
That's what happens
when the hospital's slow.

723
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,397
The doctors start
punking each other.

724
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:52,522
Oh. Well, I just
wanted to let you know

725
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,625
that we found funding
for your project.

726
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:56,726
Oh, I get it.

727
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,778
You popular kids are punking me,

728
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:01,498
like this is some high
school volleyball team.

729
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,150
Well, I do not want to play
varsity that bad, Kimberly.

730
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,448
Bailey, you get your
genome lab, for real.

731
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,871
Yeah, right.

732
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,517
Yeah, Cristina just assembled
a quick board meeting.

733
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,453
Now we haven't dotted all
the I's or crossed all the T's yet,

734
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,687
but it looks like you're
gonna get your funding.

735
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,439
But Avery said there
wasn't any more money.

736
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,875
Yeah, well, one of the other
departments cut their budget.

737
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:20,845
<i>You're cutting my budget?</i>

738
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,080
Just by a couple million.

739
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:24,054
I asked you for
more money, not less.

740
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,589
I'll have to lose a resident,
a research assistant...

741
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,169
Probably two

742
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,526
of each. Sorry.

743
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,977
Wait. Wait.

744
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,246
What does that leave me with?

745
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:33,458
It leaves you with me.

746
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,214
To do the work of four people?

747
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,896
I am the best four people you
will ever have working for you.

748
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,370
I will treat your patients,
take your surgeries,

749
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,124
and assist in research, including
projects I find on my own.

750
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,592
Feel free to pile it on.

751
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:46,827
But I can't possibly...

752
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:49,195
The board believes you can.

753
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,288
<i>Dr. Sanchez to Oncology.</i>

754
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,824
Well...

755
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,826
I told Bailey she's
getting her genome lab.

756
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:06,096
She was so happy.
She looked great.

757
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,614
That's fantastic.

758
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:11,101
Hey, are you okay?

759
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,364
Yeah. I'm just... I'm
really happy for Bailey.

760
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:15,388
No, you're in pain. You've
been standing all day.

761
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,806
Here. Sit down.

762
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,521
You know, I really... I don't...

763
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,656
I don't want to keep
saying yes and then

764
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,957
not following
through with it, okay?

765
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,058
I really don't.

766
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,426
No,

767
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,878
I'm a jerk for putting
pressure on you.

768
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:29,135
You know what? I think
that I can try. I can try.

769
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:30,247
It's just... I need
to adjust this thing.

770
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,315
Let me help.

771
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:32,405
Callie, don't.

772
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,714
I am an orthopedic surgeon.

773
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:35,308
Let me try.

774
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,497
Give me your hands.

775
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,485
Now. Can you remove
your pants, please?

776
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,085
Yeah.

777
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,496
Okay, I got you.

778
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:57,814
Okay.

779
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,091
Whoa! That's not fixing
it. That's taking it off!

780
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:17,667
Look at me.

781
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,269
Look at me.

782
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,516
I'm gonna put my
hand on your leg.

783
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,040
No, Callie. Don't.

784
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,103
The prosthetic is not the
problem. Your leg's your problem.

785
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,327
I deal with residual
limbs every single day.

786
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,963
It's... They get sore.

787
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,098
Yeah.

788
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,424
Is that okay?

789
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,428
It feels better.

790
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:12,406
You know I could... I could
give you a massage, too.

791
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,719
With your girlie
hands? Forget it.

792
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,400
Thank you, Callie.

793
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,871
Hey. Right now I'm Dr. Torres.

794
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,967
This came for you.

795
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,307
But I don't know if you
want to see it. It's not my call.

796
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,743
They're here, aren't they?

797
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:52,245
A lot of them.
They're in the lobby.

798
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:55,865
But I can also say that
you can't have visitors.

799
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,884
Three, two, one.

800
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,822
All right. He's all set.

801
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,109
Avery, would you do the honors?

802
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,771
Six, seven,

803
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,274
eight, nine,

804
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,610
ten, 11, 12...

805
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,764
Thirteen.

806
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,161
Look at that.

807
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,769
It's worth every penny.

808
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,138
You can see the
fractures of both legs

809
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:55,174
and of the proximal aspect
of the right radius and ulna

810
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:56,493
all in the same x-ray.

811
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,881
It would've taken,
like, 15 scans

812
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:01,292
to get that much
information before.

813
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,032
It's freakin' magical.

814
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,542
It was definitely
worth waiting for.

815
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,072
Yeah.

816
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:13,176
Okay. Let's get
him out of there.

817
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,751
Are you ready?

818
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,521
Good news first, stay calm.

819
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,167
Can I hear the fishing
story one more time?

820
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,790
Come on.

821
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,162
What took you so long?

822
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,447
Mr. Kramer, the good news
is, your daughter's alive.

823
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:35,999
Until she wakes up...

824
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,195
No, no, no. No, don't,
don't, don't, don't you do that!

825
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,397
Hey! Whoa! Look, sir, please!

826
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,115
You're not gonna tell
me that. You do not...

827
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,122
No! Listen!

828
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:45,069
Your daughter is
alive, you hear me?

829
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:48,645
Listen to me. Your
daughter is alive.

830
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,167
She's alive.

831
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,647
And we hope she's gonna wake up,

832
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:57,048
but we don't know
what's gonna happen.

833
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,200
Okay? Her vitals are stable.

834
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,469
But it doesn't do
you or her any good

835
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,411
to be afraid of
what we don't know.

836
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,714
Let's get cleaned up, and
you can go see her, okay?

837
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:10,283
She always wears a helmet.

838
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,718
She...

839
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,021
I make sure...

840
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,329
I know.

841
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,142
I always...

842
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,843
I know.

843
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,683
I know.

844
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,322
Mr. Arnold always yells.

845
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,991
Well, he's probably frustrated.

846
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:37,093
I know you don't like
him because he's not me,

847
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,375
but you didn't like
me at first, did you?

848
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,144
But at least you gave us free
time if we finished our homework.

849
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,669
Maybe you should
tell him that that's

850
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,204
how I did it and
that it motivated you.

851
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,421
Right?

852
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:59,416
If...

853
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,919
If...

854
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,956
Mr. Arnold were going to be
your teacher for the rest of the year,

855
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,526
what else could
you do to help him?

856
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,811
Someone could offer him a mint.

857
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,264
That's a great idea.

858
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,167
But not in a mean way.
Just casually, right?

859
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,347
What else?

860
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,948
Don't skip after-school
study sessions?

861
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,472
You got it.

862
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,421
But he's not gonna be our
teacher for the rest of the year.

863
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,244
Is he?

864
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,520
You're not gonna come back...

865
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,572
Are you?

866
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,215
What...

867
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:51,501
What would happen if I didn't?

868
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,138
It'd suck.

869
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,127
Sorry.

870
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,297
No, you're right.

871
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,484
It'd suck.

872
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,707
Now...

873
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:17,256
What else can we
do to help Mr. Arnold?

874
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,345
Come on. Help me think.

875
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,106
What happened to cool and calm?

876
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,603
Yeah, well, that never would've
worked with a guy like this.

877
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:35,194
Sometimes you gotta
shake the hell out of 'em.

878
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:36,407
Hey. You ready?

879
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,564
Yeah.

880
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:39,598
Page me with updates.

881
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:42,802
Rough one? Very.

882
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:44,837
Me, too.

883
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,773
How's the baby, still kicking?

884
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,719
Quiet now. Probably dead.

885
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,209
Oh, Meredith, stop.

886
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:51,728
Well, I'm just kidding.

887
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,630
Mostly.

888
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,830
Really, I need you to stop.

889
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,816
Bad things happen,

890
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,595
and it just makes me feel better
to be prepared when they do.

891
00:38:58,619 --> 00:38:59,913
But you don't know how
things are gonna turn out.

892
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,938
Right. Exactly what I'm saying.

893
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:09,328
We own a hospital
full of machines.

894
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:12,015
Let's go find out
everything we can.

895
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,652
He actually gave
Dr. Bailey his pee.

896
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,516
Anybody find out about this,
I'm throwing you under the bus.

897
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,923
You're not scared of this guy.

898
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,324
No, I'm scared of Dr. Bailey.

899
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,627
Hey, Karev.

900
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,481
Think he's onto us?

901
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,884
That was pretty funny today.

902
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,255
The pranks, the
drug test, the pages...

903
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:37,940
You guys, you really got me.

904
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,004
Yeah, well, the kid's got
a little crush on Wilson.

905
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,305
We were just
having a little fun.

906
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,630
The kid does. Right.

907
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:46,449
Well, you two kids have
fun laughing about it later

908
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,252
while I'm nailing Jo in
the bathroom at the bar.

909
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,489
Hey.

910
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,258
<i>At first, idleness can seem
like a welcome distraction...</i>

911
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,878
<i>The troublemaking and the fun.</i>

912
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,917
She is asleep.

913
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,137
Holy mother of...

914
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,289
Could you massage my leg again?

915
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,527
Uh-huh. Yeah.

916
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,801
A little higher.

917
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,854
There?

918
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,374
Nope. Higher.

919
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:32,962
<i>Everyone needs some idle time to
focus on something other than work...</i>

920
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:40,252
<i>even if it means focusing on
something that's a little bit scary.</i>

921
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:41,616
Are you nervous?

922
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,751
No. Just take a look,
and then we'll know.

923
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,393
Ugh. Is there a huge teratoma
growing out of its head?

924
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:49,879
See for yourself.

925
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,748
Aw, hey.

926
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,833
Look at you.

927
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:05,928
"Avery's too young," I said.
"He's too inexperienced," I said.

928
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,581
"He has no business
running this hospital."

929
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,461
Where you going
with this, Bailey?

930
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,968
I was wrong is where I'm going.

931
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:16,372
You all made a
smart decision today.

932
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,509
I'm not gonna disappoint
you. Thank you.

933
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,647
<i>Stepping back from work is
the only way to get perspective.</i>

934
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,197
Hey.

935
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,287
What's all that?

936
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,167
Russell put me on
the lotus valve trials.

937
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,935
I have to get through
most of this tonight.

938
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,160
Is he piling it
on a little heavy?

939
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,645
Yes, he is.

940
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:42,014
Are you gonna stay late
and play with your new toys?

941
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,749
They're not toys.

942
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:47,003
One, two,

943
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,088
three, four...

944
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,790
But they are pretty fun.

945
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:52,341
Five, six...

946
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,327
Oh! I see the marble.

947
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:57,630
Seven, eight...

948
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:58,965
Nine, 10.

949
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,866
See? 10 fingers.

950
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,703
<i>And it's only after we have
everything in perspective...</i>

951
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,187
Eleven.

952
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,139
That's not a finger.

953
00:42:08,977 --> 00:42:11,043
It's a boy.

954
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,850
<i>That we remember where
our hands truly belong.</i>
