1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,519
<i>To a critically ill patient,</i>

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,689
<i>an organ transplant
means a new start,</i>

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,391
<i>a second chance.</i>

4
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:13,162
<i>But the body is designed to
fight off any outside invader,</i>

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,875
<i>even one that's
trying to save it.</i>

6
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,814
Jackson Avery
really has a bigger say

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,794
than any of us in
running this hospital?

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,058
That can't be true. Can it?

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,320
Well, he's a voting member
of the management team

10
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,039
and he also represents the
Harper Avery Foundation.

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,425
And their 175 million bucks.

12
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,422
As opposed to our $15 million apiece.
- Huh.

13
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,141
According to Stan, not only
does he have the deciding vote,

14
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,648
he can veto ours.

15
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:36,467
<i>Because a transplant doesn't
guarantee that it's an easier life.</i>

16
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,837
That is ridiculous.
He's a fellow.

17
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,105
So are you.

18
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,674
But he's a plastics
fellow. And I'm me.

19
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,309
Well, let's not overreact.

20
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,289
I mean, it's Jackson. He's
not some corporate stranger.

21
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,412
He's one of us.

22
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,809
No, you're right.
He's a smart kid.

23
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,073
He's gonna follow our lead.

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,484
No. No. We made this plan.

25
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,052
We pulled it together.

26
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,266
Look, I'm grateful to Harper
Avery for an infusion of cash,

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,717
but I'm not gonna
let some, some...

28
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:58,907
Plastics fellow?

29
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,770
Plastics fellow tell me
how to run my service

30
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,971
'cause his mommy said he could.

31
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,661
Preach.

32
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,109
<i>There's a threat that the body
will reject the organ outright.</i>

33
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,800
It was your idea.

34
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,913
It was pillow talk. And
suddenly, it's a business plan.

35
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,114
You were all for it at the time.

36
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,116
You investing in
the hospital, sure.

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,851
Anointing your son boy king?

38
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,552
What on earth makes you
think that young man's prepared

39
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,021
to take on this kind
of responsibility?

40
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,878
He's my son. I know
what he's capable of.

41
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,524
And he's my student. I do, too.

42
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,593
You know, actually,
I should revise that.

43
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,996
Now he's my boss, and my
girlfriend is my boss' boss.

44
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,264
What could possibly go wrong?

45
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,089
You are forgetting who
you're dating, Richard.

46
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,658
I'm the chairman of the
board of a large foundation.

47
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,461
I have made an extremely
savvy investment.

48
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,498
And I will manage my
investment as I see prudent.

49
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,366
I've placed at the
top of the organization

50
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,335
an individual that is energetic,

51
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,386
motivated, and responsive.

52
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,908
There's only one room in which
I take orders from my boyfriend.

53
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,446
This is not it.

54
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,059
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,243
Good morning.

56
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,734
Shall we?

57
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:03,271
Okay, so we're agreed
that the peds and adult ERs

58
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,018
will be combined to save on personnel?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,326
I'm sorry, guys.

60
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,577
I was running on time,

61
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,163
and then my last rounds'
patient turned into a crier.

62
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,866
Pow.

63
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,609
We were discussing
the reopening of the ER.

64
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,126
And the trauma department.

65
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,561
Oh, yes.

66
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,397
I'm not ready for that just yet.

67
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,377
If you need more time with
the material, we can go ahead...

68
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,346
No, no, I've... I've
read it. It's just that

69
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,556
the foundation feels like the
ER is not a forgone conclusion.

70
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,920
They need a site visit, a
chance to look over the numbers.

71
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,387
It could be a month
before a decision.

72
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,573
Okay. The foundation
knows we plan on getting

73
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,725
our Level I trauma
designation back, right?

74
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,959
They know that's the idea, yeah.

75
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,600
It's the fact.

76
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,930
I think we should table this
until we can bring in Owen.

77
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,498
He'll have a lot of
thoughts on this, too.

78
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:53,621
Yeah...

79
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,884
That's the other thing.

80
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,828
What thing?

81
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,646
Okay.

82
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,483
Since we are starting fresh,

83
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,254
the thought is that new leadership
would be good for morale.

84
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,025
What, like, chief of surgery?

85
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,677
Oh, no way. Firing Owen?

86
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,490
Okay, we're not firing Owen.

87
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:18,975
Thinks that... Your mother.

88
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,393
The Harper Avery Foundation...

89
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,750
Your mother, Avery. Just say it.

90
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,068
It's a recommendation.

91
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,452
It's an inappropriate one.

92
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,087
Tell your mom
that. This is bull...

93
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,834
And this is going
nowhere. I have surgery.

94
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,175
Yeah. Me, too. We
should come back to this.

95
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,391
You know, I don't care who's
giving you your marching orders,

96
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,099
this thing with Owen
is not happening.

97
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,101
Well, say what you want,

98
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,015
but without the Harper Avery
Foundation, none of us are here.

99
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,972
And we appreciate that.

100
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,275
But no one expected them to
come in and start dictating policy.

101
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:48,743
Yeah, well, no one asked you

102
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,052
to sue the hospital
into bankruptcy either.

103
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,565
For the plane crash
that killed Lexie?

104
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,415
If we put Kepner's
donor to OR One,

105
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,018
that moves Bailey's
hernia to OR Five.

106
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,036
Robbins is in Five. Okay, Six.

107
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,483
We don't have enough
nurses to staff Six.

108
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,284
I thought you said you
were getting them back.

109
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm trying. Some of them
are bitchier than I am.

110
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,526
Chief.

111
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,995
Yeah. UNOS just called.

112
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,524
They got a kidney that's a
match for Jaelynn Donovan.

113
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:25,825
Yeah, we have no
room today, Karev.

114
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,593
No OR staff. Half
the nurses have quit,

115
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,345
including the
transplant coordinator.

116
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,880
You may need to
decline this one.

117
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,521
This girl's 16. She's been
on dialysis for three years.

118
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,989
Okay. All right.

119
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:37,339
Well, we'll figure it out, okay?

120
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,078
Okay, so...

121
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,407
Owen. Just a second.

122
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,626
Owen, they're talking
about replacing you.

123
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,966
Ruth, excuse us, please.

124
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,902
What? Why? Who is?

125
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,015
Avery.

126
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,683
But we're not gonna
let that happen.

127
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,585
I just didn't want you to hear
a rumor and think I didn't tell...

128
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:55,476
Dr. Yang, it's UNOS. They
have a heart and lungs.

129
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,945
I'm gonna talk to
Catherine Avery.

130
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,077
You're not gonna do
anything. I am. Take your call.

131
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,602
Dr. Yang here.

132
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,605
Bradley Parker, 31
years old, end-stage ALS.

133
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,775
Trach-dependent. Had a
lap-chole three weeks ago.

134
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,477
Now presents with a chief
complaint of hematochezia.

135
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,313
He actually used the
word "hematochezia."

136
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,359
Yeah, he was an
internal medicine resident

137
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,910
at Mercy West while I was there.

138
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,734
He did a residency with ALS?

139
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,381
He was diagnosed second year
and worked till he couldn't anymore.

140
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,050
He's an amazing guy.

141
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,807
Is that coming from...

142
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,367
Hey, could you turn that down?

143
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,046
Hey, guys. What the
hell is going on here?

144
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,510
This is a hospital. There
are very sick people here.

145
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,991
That includes you, too, Brad.

146
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,987
Okay, everyone out.
Let's go. Out. Come on.

147
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,744
It's all right.

148
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,007
I invited them.

149
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,497
Uh-huh.

150
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,734
Well, Dr. Edwards and I need
to discuss your next steps.

151
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:55,420
So maybe if
everyone could leave...

152
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,390
I already know my next step.

153
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,059
I'm donating my organs.

154
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,229
We do organ donation
after a patient's brain dead.

155
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,358
You're nowhere
close to brain dead.

156
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,683
I'm doing...

157
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:10,462
Mom.

158
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,386
He's doing DCD.

159
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,106
Donation after cardiac death.

160
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,391
He can give if his heart stops.

161
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,847
I'm being kept alive

162
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,550
by this vent.

163
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,285
Once we disconnect it...

164
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,104
Booyah.

165
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,641
Chief Hunt signed off.

166
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,711
Welcome to my funeral.

167
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,768
Avery... Am I in or out?

168
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,048
What? That's...

169
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,571
Word is I might be out of a job,

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,106
so I'd like to hear it from you.

171
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,244
Yeah, there was a thought that

172
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,091
a change in leadership
could be good for staff morale.

173
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,264
For morale?

174
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,566
I've been killing myself
to keep morale up

175
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,769
for the past three weeks,
to keep this place open.

176
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,448
And no one is saying
that you haven't...

177
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,021
Nobody's saying anything.

178
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,935
I've been shut out of every
decision that you people make.

179
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,303
And now I hear this?
All right. Calm down.

180
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,077
Don't tell me to calm down!

181
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,207
Guys, guys, guys. Let's
take this somewhere else.

182
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,943
This is coming from you, too? You're
all just talking about a new chief?

183
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,867
No. No.

184
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,046
It was brought up,
and we tabled it.

185
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,103
Oh, you tabled it?

186
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,870
You shouldn't even
be talking about it.

187
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,250
Listen, this is a
decision that we have...

188
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,836
Avery, enough. I'm
just trying to explain...

189
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,809
Avery, go!

190
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,318
You know as well as I
do there are politics here.

191
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,319
We're trying to find
our way. Just sit tight.

192
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,272
I am through sitting tight.

193
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,018
I am through looking like
an idiot while you all lie to me.

194
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,241
No, we're not lying to you.

195
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,021
When you said that
we were in this together,

196
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,124
I thanked you, and then
one hour later, you quit.

197
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,143
You're a liar. You lied to
the staff. No, no, no, no.

198
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,433
We are doing the best we can.

199
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,612
And then I'm this poor
sucker running around

200
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,114
trying to fix this mess
that you all made!

201
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,737
You don't!

202
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,041
You do not want to get into
whose responsibility this is.

203
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,043
You don't want to get into
who's responsible for all of this.

204
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,512
You don't!

205
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:09,304
Well, I can make this
decision easier for you.

206
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,572
I quit.

207
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,906
Whoa.

208
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,188
Right there.

209
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,723
Owen, what happened?

210
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,872
Did you get the
heart and the lungs?

211
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:33,896
Yes.

212
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:35,096
That's great.

213
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,405
Talk to me.

214
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,984
Nothing happened, I'm just...

215
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,352
I'm done.

216
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,732
I should've been
done a long time ago.

217
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,033
Okay, what are
you talking about?

218
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,141
Shepherd is right.
This is all on me.

219
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,390
No one blames you.
Well, somebody does.

220
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:53,014
And as long as that's true, I...

221
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,450
I don't see how I
can be effective here.

222
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,140
Depending on when
the organs come in,

223
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,775
you might need to
adjust the OR board,

224
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,347
move things off until tomorrow.

225
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,397
Sweetheart. Owen...

226
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,952
Not the same.
Surgeons save lives.

227
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,699
You just catch it when
it falls out of someone.

228
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,239
OBs do surgery.

229
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,676
If a baby is not coming
out, I go in, and I get it.

230
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,044
It's not the same.

231
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,463
Plus every patient that I
have is two patients in one.

232
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:26,709
So beat that.

233
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,016
You wear pink scrubs.

234
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,085
Yeah.

235
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,365
Yeah, you win.

236
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,588
I have no response for that.

237
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,641
You really pull it off, though.

238
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,025
Thank you.

239
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,410
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,582
Alex, do you know Jason?

241
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,111
Yeah, Chest
Peckwell. Jason Myers.

242
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,780
Have you seen where
Jaelynn Donovan's parents are?

243
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,270
Isn't Jaelynn up in dialysis?

244
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,033
I know where she is. I
asked about her parents.

245
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,202
Excuse me. Are you
getting on or what?

246
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,626
I'll take the stairs.

247
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,910
I'm going up there, too.

248
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,696
Are you?

249
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,297
Turn to page six,
everyone, the...

250
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,982
Dr. Avery, could you...

251
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,433
Come on in, sweetheart.

252
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,368
We're just going over
the purchase agreement

253
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,971
you'll be signing tonight.

254
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,284
I'm sure you've
read through them.

255
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,641
Can I speak with you
outside for just a moment?

256
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,770
Of course. Excuse me.

257
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,827
Of course.

258
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,295
Yeah, it's right here.

259
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:20,246
No, I did not read through them,

260
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,514
as I couldn't possibly read through
them as they are not in English.

261
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,637
I understand.

262
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,251
I am not a lawyer and
I am not an accountant.

263
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,308
Stop. Breathe.

264
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,045
Nobody understands
those documents.

265
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:33,748
That's why these smart people
are here to explain them to us.

266
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,151
All you have to do is
hear what they have to say.

267
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,520
Ask a couple of questions,
and trust your gut.

268
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,975
Now put on your game face and
go in there and listen to the suits.

269
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,762
Try not to nod off when they start
talking about debt-to-equity ratios.

270
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:48,974
It's like a sedative. Go on.

271
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,176
Okay, one more thing.

272
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,568
When we are in there,
I am not "Sweetheart."

273
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,319
Okay, baby.

274
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,521
Okay...

275
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,712
What the...

276
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,248
Who is this?

277
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,534
God. It's Thelonious, Dad.

278
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,880
We've only been getting dialysis

279
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,204
for, like, an entire
year together.

280
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,134
I'd be more comfortable if
you were in your own chair.

281
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,186
It's bad enough to
be in kidney failure.

282
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,804
Now you're gonna
suck all the fun out of it?

283
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,211
I'm just asking...

284
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,607
Honey, let's not fight. Not now.

285
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,231
It's too big a day.

286
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,034
Oh, no. What?

287
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,469
We found a kidney, Jaelynn.

288
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:29,787
No more dialysis.

289
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,060
Oh, my God, Theo.
I'm getting a kidney.

290
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,128
Sweet.

291
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,965
Yeah.

292
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,683
Sweet.

293
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,180
Did anyone call
Jackson for this?

294
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,139
Who cares? I mean,
this is, this is his fault.

295
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,818
Why do we need an
emergency meeting?

296
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,420
Hunt quit. What?

297
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,589
You can't keep throwing
that plane crash in his face.

298
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,979
Don't make this my fault.

299
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,192
He walked out. You
shouldn't have told him.

300
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,648
Wait. Wait. You told him?

301
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,062
That he might be getting
fired? Of course I did.

302
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,479
Nothing was
decided, and besides,

303
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:01,813
we weren't gonna let
Avery get rid of Hunt.

304
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,037
Avery has his own agenda.

305
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,239
No, warning Owen
is the least we can do.

306
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,919
We went behind his
back long enough.

307
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,543
Cristina, we should probably
keep what's said in here private.

308
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,157
Well, then count me out.

309
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:12,842
I have a heart-lung
transplant coming in.

310
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,960
Oh, well, Karev's kid just
got a kidney from UNOS.

311
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,317
Two transplants in one day?

312
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,802
Three with Kepner's DCD.

313
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,187
Three? That doesn't happen.

314
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,856
Well, it did, okay? And
the ORs are fully booked.

315
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,253
We have half the nursing staff
and no transplant coordinator.

316
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,105
Who was handling all that? Hunt.

317
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,428
Oh.

318
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,382
Nurses' station.

319
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,739
Avery. Hey, what are you all
doing about the Pegasus protocols?

320
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:38,907
The what now?

321
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,042
Pegasus put all these
protocols in place,

322
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,438
one of which is telling me
that I have to do hernia repairs

323
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,923
using their stupid
Varner technique.

324
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,547
Now I have a
hernia repair today.

325
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,217
I would like to do it the way
I've been successfully doing it

326
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,530
since you were
sucking your thumb.

327
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:51,597
We'll look at that.

328
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,687
Well, when?

329
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,706
There's all sorts
of idiotic rules here,

330
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:00,611
like the OR layout and organ
transports, bariatric centers.

331
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,279
Isn't that why
you're the boss now,

332
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,908
so the place won't
be run by idiots?

333
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,110
Thank you, Bailey.

334
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,200
You're welcome, boss.

335
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,302
Hey, have you guys
seen Chief Hunt?

336
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,871
I would like to
know why he signed

337
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,417
a death warrant on
one of my patients.

338
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,319
Well, good luck.
He's gone. He quit.

339
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,593
He... What? Hunt?

340
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,673
Ask boss man over here.

341
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,417
There was a
disagreement about policy.

342
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,215
Yeah, well, then
change the stupid policy.

343
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,604
Not before he changes
my stupid policy first.

344
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,686
My hernia's this afternoon.

345
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,370
They're going to get the donor
heart and lung as we speak.

346
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,761
We should have you in the
OR sometime this afternoon.

347
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,396
Not a minute too soon.

348
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,743
You should've seen what
I coughed up this morning.

349
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,401
I swear to God,
the thing had hands.

350
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,870
Dr. Yang. I was
hoping I'd catch you.

351
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:46,640
Hey, you get your fat
head out of my door.

352
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,027
Bad enough I gotta watch
you go by my window

353
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,375
eighty times a day while
you walk your stupid laps.

354
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,749
I just want to know
if Dr. Yang knows

355
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,551
about the pepperoni pizza
you've been smuggling in here.

356
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:00,549
Snitch all you want. I'm not
gonna be here much longer.

357
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,257
No kidding? You're dying.

358
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,143
Hey, there is a God, and
he's heard my prayers.

359
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,529
Mr. Schultz is getting
a heart-lung transplant.

360
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,198
A heart? Well, he
doesn't need a heart.

361
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,384
He's got junky lungs.

362
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,452
I've been on this
machine for three months,

363
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,538
and you're giving
that bastard my heart?

364
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,301
You're not looking
too good, Herman.

365
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,103
Somebody might be dying today.

366
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,260
Shut up.

367
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,544
Mr. Crump, please calm down.

368
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,179
Mr. Schultz's heart
is compromised

369
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,099
because of the stress caused
by his pulmonary hypertension.

370
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,595
So a heart-lung
transplant is the...

371
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,618
You're gonna have
pulmonary hypertension

372
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,721
unless you get a
supervisor down here.

373
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,139
That doesn't make any sense.

374
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,424
A supervisor, now!

375
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,109
Absolutely. Right away.

376
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,744
Yeah.

377
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,993
So why do they hate
each other so much?

378
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,449
They were neighbors.

379
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,262
Crump's wife left him for
Schultz, like, 30 years ago.

380
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,953
No. Yes.

381
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,734
She ended up leaving him, too, for
some other guy in the neighborhood.

382
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,101
No. No. Yes.

383
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,225
Can your mind be
blown on your own time?

384
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,511
Right now I have to
talk with my supervisor.

385
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,916
Um... Well, you
own the hospital now.

386
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,025
So doesn't that make
you the supervisor?

387
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,319
It does.

388
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,228
So I will have that
conversation with myself.

389
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,707
Well, should I, like,
stick around for that or...

390
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,510
Oh.

391
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,545
You're pushing all
of our surgeries?

392
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,158
There's no place to do them.

393
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,450
Mer, I need you to do a
kidney procurement in Missoula.

394
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,531
I gotta stay here and do the
transplant, and Robbins is in surgery.

395
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,921
I can't. Hunt is gone,

396
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,534
and I have to sort out where
all these patients are going.

397
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,691
Come on. I'm not gonna
risk some Missoula hack

398
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,273
screwing up the dissection and
giving me some unusable kidney.

399
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,546
Jaelynn got a kidney?
Can I do anything?

400
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,055
I said I need a surgeon.
You're not a surgeon yet.

401
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,512
And I forgot. Neither are you.

402
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,405
Upper management's too
busy to get a kid a kidney.

403
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,575
<i>Dr. Immerman to peds ICU.
Dr. Immerman to peds ICU.</i>

404
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,345
Call Dr. Shepherd and
ask him to fix this board,

405
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,534
and book me a plane to Missoula.

406
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,269
The patient's this
really sweet kid...

407
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,272
Whatever. You can come, too.

408
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:07,815
I've heard your plan, but
you still haven't heard mine.

409
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,650
I can see not wanting
a colonoscopy,

410
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,452
but that's not the only option.

411
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:14,688
We could do radionuclide
scans, angiography.

412
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:18,759
I mean, there's a bunch of
endoscopic procedures that we could try.

413
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,662
This is why I didn't tell you.

414
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,132
I knew you'd disagree.

415
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,513
And I didn't want
to have to spend

416
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:31,839
valuable minutes of
my life convincing you.

417
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,801
You're depressed,
but we can treat that.

418
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,736
I'm not.

419
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,254
I'm...

420
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,807
ALS...

421
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,278
Is 100% fatal.

422
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,766
If I donate my organs, my
death can mean something.

423
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,170
If I keep fighting,

424
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,939
I get an infection

425
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,175
and can't donate.

426
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,176
I've decided

427
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,778
to stop fighting it.

428
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,380
So...

429
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,881
We're extra careful

430
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,050
and we just make sure that
you don't get an infection.

431
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,853
Come on. Please let me help you.

432
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,889
There are people who love you,

433
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,008
who need you.

434
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:28,996
Come on. You are
still alive and so...

435
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:30,765
So you.

436
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,007
April.

437
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,242
Yes.

438
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,295
You're fired.

439
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,469
This is where you should check
your meds off every day. Okay?

440
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,671
You'll start your
mornings with prednisolone

441
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,639
and mycophenolate at 8:00 am.

442
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,909
Then follow that with
fk-506 at 10:00 am.

443
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,106
And 10:00 pm those
are for every day.

444
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,609
Then you'll also be on
trimethoprim-sulfa three times a week.

445
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,994
Now you're just making up words.

446
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,568
Look, you have to take
them no matter what, all right?

447
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,898
Or you'll lose the kidney.
You can't miss a dose.

448
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,422
She won't.

449
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,910
Fine. I'll do whatever
you just said.

450
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:19,230
Okay, the meds, they can cause
pretty dramatic mood swings,

451
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,316
hair thinning, weight
gain, diarrhea, acne.

452
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,529
I mean, they don't
always happen,

453
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,913
but if they do,
don't be alarmed.

454
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,042
If you were dying, would
you donate your organs?

455
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,277
Of course.

456
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,466
Even if you still had time?

457
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,815
This the DCD guy?

458
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,463
I have a plan. He just
won't even listen to it.

459
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,131
You know, he's a
doctor. He knows the deal.

460
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,132
He's not gonna get
any better. Yeah, but...

461
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,857
He's gonna save a crapload
of people. I think it's awesome.

462
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,459
He's got perfectly good
organs. Might as well use them.

463
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,347
Oh, my God.

464
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,616
He has good organs.

465
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,451
That is genius. I am a genius.

466
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,925
So you'll have to pick up Zola.

467
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,561
Did you sort out the OR board?

468
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,696
I started, but I have a surgery.

469
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:11,810
I have Torres looking at it right
now. Why are you on a plane?

470
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,034
<i>Because Alex
wants his kid's kidney</i>

471
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,337
mobilized before perfusion, and
he's being a giant baby about it.

472
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,617
All right. Well, call
me when you get back.

473
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:19,690
<i>Okay.</i>

474
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,844
He doesn't mean
to be a giant baby.

475
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,648
Karev, I think he just hates feeling
like you guys left him in the dark.

476
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:30,012
You don't have to teach me
how to speak Alex. I'm fluent.

477
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,669
I'm just learning.

478
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,843
I shouldn't take it personally that
he's acting like he hates me, right?

479
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,745
I mean, he's just
feeling abandoned

480
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,658
by everyone in
his life right now,

481
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,493
and the fact that
I'm dating a guy

482
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,462
and not available to go to
Joe's Bar every night is just...

483
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,789
He's feeling hurt and lonely.

484
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,225
Or he hates you.

485
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,910
Thanks.

486
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,261
You're welcome.

487
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,881
What's wrong?

488
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,449
She locked herself in there.

489
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,286
Jaelynn, sweetie. It's
okay. Come on out.

490
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,172
Jaelynn, it's Dr. Karev.

491
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,052
Look, Jaelynn, come
on. I know it's scary.

492
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,756
Just come out and we'll talk. You
can ask me whatever you want.

493
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,678
It's the silent treatment.

494
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,230
She won't crack.

495
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,843
Once we took her phone from her.

496
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,361
She didn't speak
to us for seven days.

497
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,154
Oh, she's talking to somebody.

498
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,220
She texting you?

499
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:33,397
Maybe.

500
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,381
Tell her to come
out of the bathroom.

501
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,560
I don't tell her what to do.

502
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,184
Just do it. Make me.

503
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,738
Are you for real?

504
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,955
"Dr. DF"?

505
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,107
Dr. Douche Face.

506
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,236
Who's that supposed to be?

507
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,237
Who do you think?
Now give it back.

508
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,763
Make me.

509
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,610
It's called a domino transplant.

510
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,578
Because you guys are
the same blood type,

511
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:56,803
we will put the new heart
and lungs into Mr. Schultz,

512
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,592
and then take
Mr. Schultz's original heart

513
00:20:58,641 --> 00:20:59,735
and give it to Mr. Crump.

514
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,744
So his heart in my
body? Nothing doing.

515
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,757
It's the best
solution in this case.

516
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,115
The best solution
is a 62-year-old

517
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,251
getting a 70-year-old's
hand-me-downs?

518
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,487
Technically, all donor
hearts are hand-me-downs.

519
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:17,069
Mr. Schultz's heart is 80%
functional. Yours is only 10%.

520
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,926
Yeah, you hear that? 80%.

521
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,056
You'd be lucky to get
a ticker like this one.

522
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,646
I'd be lucky if you dropped dead

523
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,275
right now and I
got the fresh heart.

524
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,828
Mr. Crump, you should
really consider this op...

525
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,151
Look, I would rather croak

526
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,137
than have this bastard's
old lump of meat in my chest.

527
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,505
Hey.

528
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:34,025
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

529
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,533
Yeah, right. It's great.

530
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,038
Okay, sir. You need to sit down.

531
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,356
No, I need to get
out of this room.

532
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,325
Sir, calm down. Just...
Please. Get out of my...

533
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,662
So he's rejecting
the heart out of spite?

534
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:44,919
Yeah.

535
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,431
I can't figure out how
to talk him into taking it.

536
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:47,499
Have you talked to Owen?

537
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:48,523
<i>No. But I know him.</i>

538
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:49,940
He just needs time.

539
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,448
What is your
husband's deal anyway?

540
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:52,893
Oh, Cristina.

541
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,339
<i>You know, it's like
everyone has gone crazy.</i>

542
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,713
Owen and Derek are
at each other's throats.

543
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,748
Avery's on some
kind of power trip.

544
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,062
You know, I am supposed to be
prepping for a major transplant,

545
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,538
and Callie's left me with an OR
board that's like a Rubik's cube.

546
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,218
<i>Wow. In charge
one day, and already</i>

547
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,786
<i>the hospital's
spinning out of control?</i>

548
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,360
Okay, I gotta go. We're here.

549
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,139
You need to stop listening
to my conversations.

550
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,430
Is the place really
spinning out of control?

551
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,233
What? No, of
course not. Shut up.

552
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,235
Everything's perfectly fine.

553
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,090
Where is everybody?

554
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,125
They've gone. We're
pretty much done here.

555
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,511
What do you mean
done? Where's our kidney?

556
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,532
Why do you look confused?

557
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,034
Where is our kidney?

558
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,590
Hands off my kidney!

559
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,308
I'm telling you, this
isn't your kidney.

560
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,839
And I'm telling you, show me
the paperwork to prove that,

561
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,144
or I'm gonna reach down your
throat and take one of yours.

562
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,532
I found our kidney.

563
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,978
Great. Now call
off your attack dog.

564
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,451
Wilson, stand down.

565
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,382
Where is it? It hopped
a flight to Seattle.

566
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,800
All by itself? How'd it do that?

567
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:56,824
I don't know. We gotta get
home. Come on. Let's go.

568
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,515
You sent her an emoticon
of a bee and an ice cube?

569
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,710
It means "be chill"

570
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,233
And come out of the bathroom.

571
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,766
I know it's you.

572
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,317
Theo would never text emoticons.

573
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,658
Just... Give me five minutes,

574
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,162
and then I will never
bother you about it again.

575
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,630
Okay. Five minutes, but in here.

576
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,073
I know you're scared,
but you need this kidney.

577
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,577
At least with dialysis, I won't go
bald, get fat, and poop my pants.

578
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,624
That's not the solution,
and you know it.

579
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,649
Can't I, like, take
the next one?

580
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm, like, not ready for this.

581
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,404
Yes, you are.

582
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:46,673
Look, Jaelynn,

583
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:50,076
there's this girl, and I didn't
tell her that I was into her,

584
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,679
and now she's with
some dude with big arms.

585
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,594
Um... Are you,
like, hitting on me?

586
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,400
'Cause you're, like, old.

587
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,103
God. No. No.

588
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:03,023
No, my point is, is that
this kidney is a good thing,

589
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:05,025
and that you need to
take the good things

590
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:08,195
when they're in front of you,
because if you don't, someone else will.

591
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,931
So you're saying,
take this kidney

592
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,285
so some dude with
big arms doesn't get it?

593
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,785
Yeah.

594
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:26,080
Let's get her prepped.

595
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,592
Don't leave her side.

596
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,149
Got it.

597
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,934
Hey. How's it looking?

598
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,186
<i>You sent me all the way
out here to get a kidney</i>

599
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,995
that's already flying coach to
Seattle as an unaccompanied minor?

600
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,109
What? <i>I don't even know
who's coming to pick it up.</i>

601
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,711
Find out. <i>Alex, I...</i>

602
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,400
Look, just deal with it, okay?

603
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,557
Are you okay there? You
look a little overwhelmed.

604
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:54,892
Anything I can help you with?

605
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,538
Can you read everything in
my arms and own this hospital?

606
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,823
You actually gonna
look at those protocols

607
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,575
or just keep
carrying 'em around?

608
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,861
Right. Your hernia. I'm gonna get
you an answer just as soon as I...

609
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:04,696
Too late. I already
did it, my way.

610
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,570
That's not... Bailey,
you shouldn't...

611
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,034
Well, you couldn't make a
decision, so I made it myself.

612
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,069
You gonna get rid of me
now like you did Hunt?

613
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,821
I didn't get rid of
Hunt. Why... Sign this.

614
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,127
What is this?

615
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,206
Authorization for a
domino transplant.

616
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,413
Yes, why am I...

617
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,360
Because when you
anoint yourself king,

618
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,729
it comes with certain
responsibilities. You have to sign this.

619
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,997
I need to know
what this is first.

620
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,631
Well, I could take the
time to explain to you

621
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,433
how a heart-lung
domino transplant works,

622
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,274
but by then, both my
patients will be dead.

623
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,992
I know how a damn domino works.

624
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,261
Hey, April. Here, take these.

625
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:31,745
What are they?

626
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:33,758
Hunt left before he could
coordinate the recovery teams

627
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,982
for your DCD patient.

628
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,061
So it's just a list of which
organs are going where.

629
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,736
Yeah, well, he's not my patient
anymore, per his request...

630
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,854
Just sign this.

631
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:42,163
Just handle it, please.

632
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:47,188
Hey, make sure you sign
your own name, not your mom's.

633
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,345
Really?

634
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,808
Avery. What?

635
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:51,125
I want to know who the hell sent

636
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,377
my kidney flying
coach to Seattle

637
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,079
when I sent two
surgeons to pick it up.

638
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,414
Wait. What are
you talking about?

639
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,282
He's talking about
the protocols.

640
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,605
Look...

641
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,524
Pegasus policy states, look,

642
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,311
"Donated kidneys coming
from outside a certain radius

643
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,631
"will be flown unaccompanied,
saving personnel hours."

644
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,011
So when the other
hospital called,

645
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,845
the nurse just told
'em to put it on a plane.

646
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,981
Told you they were stupid rules.
You should read 'em sometime.

647
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,271
Oh, great.

648
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,659
Does anybody know
what's going on?

649
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,620
Tough day, boss?

650
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,028
He is drowning,

651
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:22,857
and he is taking my
hospital down with him.

652
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,509
Where is all this
drama coming from?

653
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,511
He will handle this.
Just give him time.

654
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:27,662
He's paralyzed.

655
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,486
Decisions are like
building blocks.

656
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,149
He'll make one, then
another will follow.

657
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,218
You do not do
this job one calmly

658
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,253
thought-out decision at a time.

659
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:36,521
You're spinning
plates, 10 at a time,

660
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:37,755
and you're doing it at a sprint.

661
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,346
He will get there.

662
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:41,526
You act like I don't have any
idea what I'm talking about.

663
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,661
When I was Chief, I worked
hand in hand with the board.

664
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,152
So I know what it takes to...

665
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,665
You are not doing
it now, Richard.

666
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,541
I am not thinking
of myself, Catherine.

667
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,143
I'm thinking of your son.

668
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,041
Look, if he fails at this, it
will follow him his whole life.

669
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,615
It'll define his entire career,

670
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,217
this failure, and he
didn't even choose it.

671
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,136
His mother chose it for him.

672
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,593
Ca...

673
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,270
You find me a real heart yet?

674
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,739
I've got a real heart for you.

675
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,187
You just have to get
over yourself. Move on.

676
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,188
Whatever it is that happened
between the two of you

677
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,762
is so far in the past...

678
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,865
It's like it was yesterday.

679
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,402
Okay, fine.

680
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,937
You can't forgive him. So don't.

681
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:40,073
Beat him.

682
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:42,576
Take his perfectly good
heart and outlive him with it.

683
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:45,779
There's, uh...

684
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:50,584
Really enough juice left in that
heart to get me to his funeral?

685
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:53,773
There's enough juice to
get you dancing on his grave.

686
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,126
Then my heart will stop.

687
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,864
The monitor will flatline.

688
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,685
And you guys will
have to get out of there.

689
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,888
Because the docs...

690
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,991
Will only have five
minutes to open me up

691
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,811
or my organs will be no good.

692
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,264
Are you sure?

693
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,101
Are you sure?

694
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,655
Don't do this now, Mom.

695
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,474
I know it's selfish,

696
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,243
but I want more minutes.

697
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:37,064
The closer it gets...

698
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,299
I will support you either way.

699
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,703
But if you want to stop...

700
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:47,273
We can end this right
now and go home.

701
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,725
Mom.

702
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,789
She just wants to make sure
that if you have any doubts...

703
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,579
Your son is still a doctor.

704
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,449
And...

705
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:59,585
He wants to save a
17-year-old girl in Idaho

706
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,421
who is gonna get
one of his kidneys.

707
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,058
The other one is going to

708
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,927
a 44-year-old
councilman in Nevada.

709
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,097
His kidney could be
president one day.

710
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,202
You get it now.

711
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,655
I do.

712
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,261
Keep going.

713
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,929
Okay.

714
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,666
Um...

715
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,935
Half of your liver is going to

716
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,054
a 50-year-old artist right
here at Seattle Grace.

717
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,558
And a 10-year-old in
Oregon will get to play

718
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,707
on his little league team
'cause of the other half.

719
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,900
Did you get the OR
straightened out?

720
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:50,548
The place doesn't run without
Owen, Derek. You know it.

721
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,239
I didn't force him to leave.

722
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,386
But once he started talking
about who's to blame...

723
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,376
Because he feels the blame,

724
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,945
every day since it's happened.

725
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,365
And you remind
him again and again.

726
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,766
You say you forgive
him, but you don't

727
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,968
or you won't.

728
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,338
So what is it?
What is this about?

729
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,939
'Cause it's not about him.

730
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,827
Where are you going?

731
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,096
Surgery. Remember that?

732
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,692
No, I'm in Two.
No, you're not. I am.

733
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,043
Move. I've got a
domino transplant.

734
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,078
And I'm getting
a kid off dialysis.

735
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,080
I can totally wait.
No, you can't.

736
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,632
Well, I can't. Let's get
this show on the road.

737
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,274
This kid's a flight risk.
Find someplace else.

738
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,076
This OR's the only
one that's staffed.

739
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,289
Could you guys please shut up?

740
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,607
My patient is
trying to die in here,

741
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:57,908
and he'd like to
do it in silence.

742
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,516
Oh, God. He's dying in there?

743
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,618
Maybe you should go first.

744
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,926
How long is he gonna be?

745
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,195
Because Yang needs the OR.

746
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,422
I've got an OR.

747
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,368
Shut up! Hey,
all of you shut up.

748
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,312
All right, here's what
you're gonna do...

749
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,312
Okay, just give me one second.

750
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,988
Kepner, go back to your patient.

751
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,935
He can take as long as
he needs. We will wait.

752
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,542
Yang, you're in OR Two.

753
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,556
What? No. Heart and
lungs trump kidneys.

754
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,125
Take the patient
back to holding, and

755
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,659
the next OR that's
available is yours.

756
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,443
You can't... That is it.

757
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,990
Well, you heard the man.
He's the boss. Now move.

758
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,008
It's about time.

759
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,644
You mean "Thank you, Meredith

760
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,846
"for carrying a kidney
across state lines for me."

761
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,548
Whatever. Hand it over.

762
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,826
Can I scrub in? I'd love to...

763
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,090
I got Murphy.

764
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,679
You want me to apologize, Alex?

765
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,066
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
we bought the hospital.

766
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,202
I'm sorry you have to think
of us as your bosses now.

767
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,937
But we didn't do it for just us.

768
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,640
We did it for everyone,
for you, for Wilson,

769
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,893
who, by the way, fought
so hard for you today,

770
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:35,201
I thought she might cut
someone to get you that kidney.

771
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,797
So drop the attitude
before nobody

772
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,377
wants to work with you anymore.

773
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,054
There's nothing to talk
about, Shepherd. Move on.

774
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:52,395
Come on. This is costing me gas.

775
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,896
You can afford it.

776
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,045
Nobody blames you
for hiring the plane.

777
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,425
Not me, not anybody else,
and you shouldn't either.

778
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,146
You never would've
signed that paper

779
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,282
if you knew what
was gonna happen.

780
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,239
Let it go. You blame me.

781
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,329
You said it, Shepherd. You
said it again this morning.

782
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:25,786
I was pissed.

783
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,910
I've been pissed,
but not at you.

784
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,701
The world.

785
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,170
Yeah.

786
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,940
Yeah...

787
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,827
I'm pissed at Mark.

788
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:52,772
You gotta let that go.

789
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,980
It's almost time.

790
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:03,516
When the monitor
goes, when he's gone.

791
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,513
They'll have to
start operating, so...

792
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,657
We should probably
pay our respects now.

793
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,380
Time of death, 1846.

794
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,832
Start the clock.

795
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,567
No. No.

796
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,408
Hazel, we only have five minutes

797
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,944
or this will all have
been for nothing.

798
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,803
Come on.

799
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,408
Okay. I'm sorry.

800
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,609
No!

801
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,311
Honey, we've been
preparing for this. Let's go. No.

802
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,658
Come on. No!

803
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,162
Come on, dear. No.

804
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:31,054
Okay, I am... I am sorry, Hazel.

805
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:34,524
I'm so, so sorry.
Come on. Come on.

806
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,604
No. Sweetie.

807
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,928
Come on.

808
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:42,449
No.

809
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,099
Was he there? No.

810
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,550
Move over.

811
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:19,285
Um, hi.

812
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,165
Yeah. I heard you
almost killed somebody

813
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:23,267
trying to get
Jaelynn her kidney,

814
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,192
and I was kind of a
douche face, and...

815
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,828
Anyway, I'm, I'm
sorry. And thanks.

816
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,998
Okay.

817
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,078
Can I buy you a
beer or something?

818
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,370
Um, I'm all set.

819
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:40,339
Yeah, we both
are. We're all set.

820
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,408
Yeah.

821
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,129
Well, that was, uh...

822
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,232
What were we talking about?

823
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,067
I'm sorry. What?

824
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,648
Okay, thanks. Thank you, Doctor.

825
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,506
He stepped up, didn't
he, my reluctant son?

826
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,409
If I were the kind of
woman to say "I told you so,"

827
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,611
this might be the time.

828
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,790
He got through the day.

829
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:03,924
Oh, come on.

830
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,859
Can't you just say
that I was right once?

831
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,083
No, not when the
stakes are this high.

832
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,020
You want him to step up,
but the steps are too high,

833
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,323
and the consequences
for his career are too grave.

834
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,457
It's not fair to him.

835
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,976
Don't you tell me
what's not fair for my son.

836
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,297
You want to give
professional advice? Fine.

837
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,343
But you're wandering
into parenting advice,

838
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,634
and that is not your place.

839
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,869
Yeah, you're right. I'm
sorry. I overstepped.

840
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,005
Yes, sir, you did.

841
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,779
You ever...

842
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,316
You ever say something
and then a minute later,

843
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,786
realize you sound like
a complete imbecile?

844
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,588
Um... That's never
happened to me.

845
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,093
I've been a single
mom for 28 years,

846
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,829
ever since Jackson's dad
ran off to God knows where

847
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,634
because he couldn't stand
the pressure of being an Avery.

848
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,637
And I've been looking for a
man who cared about Jackson

849
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,174
the way a parent would,

850
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:07,343
and the moment I find
him, I bite his head off.

851
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,773
You're always gonna know
what's best for Jackson.

852
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,209
Yeah?

853
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,311
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

854
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,682
Yeah, right there.

855
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:32,885
Okay, thank you.

856
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:33,954
Well...

857
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,288
That's it, then.

858
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,423
We're officially the
new board of directors.

859
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:39,153
For better or worse. Thank you.

860
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,576
Congratulations, everyone.

861
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,824
Actually, I'd like
to share a list

862
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,559
of a few things I think
are our top priority.

863
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,784
You mean that the
foundation thinks...

864
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,668
No, I don't, actually...

865
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:54,307
Mean the foundation or my
mom or these stupid protocols.

866
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:58,744
I mean me.

867
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,147
Okay, well... Let's just listen.

868
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:04,216
Okay, I'll listen.

869
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,405
All right.

870
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:10,106
Number one, I move that
we reinstate Owen Hunt

871
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,019
as chief of surgery,
effective immediately.

872
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,283
Dr. Hunt has agreed to this.

873
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,644
There were some conditions.

874
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,190
Which brings me
to my second point.

875
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,047
We are reopening the ER.

876
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,984
We will be a Level I
trauma center again.

877
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,119
That will be top priority

878
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,039
once Owen Hunt is
here to share his input.

879
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:30,193
From now on, the
foundation will follow our lead.

880
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,190
We will tell them our
decisions as we make them.

881
00:40:33,214 --> 00:40:34,713
Well, hear, hear.

882
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:36,248
Yeah. No, that sounds good.

883
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:37,600
I've got one more thing.

884
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,018
Maybe you shouldn't push it.

885
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,567
<i>The transplant
process is very scary.</i>

886
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,340
We are building a new hospital.

887
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,310
And that was your
vision, not mine.

888
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,929
My priority is to make
sure your vision comes true.

889
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,997
And while it is important
that we become

890
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,101
a leading center for
research and innovation,

891
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,903
we have to remember something,

892
00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:01,457
we are now officially a
hospital run by doctors.

893
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:02,959
That should mean something.

894
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,527
It is our responsibility

895
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,613
to be the best doctors
we can possibly be

896
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:11,200
so that those who come after
us can strive to be their best.

897
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:13,652
So...

898
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,288
With that in mind,

899
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:17,373
I move to rename the hospital.

900
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,508
Again?

901
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,792
Why would we do that?

902
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:21,027
To, to what?

903
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:23,412
Let me guess. The
Harper Avery hospital?

904
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,630
No.

905
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,799
I propose that we give
this hospital a name

906
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:29,835
that can honor the very
reason we've come together

907
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,454
and been able to do this,

908
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,591
a name that exemplifies
the spirit of this hospital,

909
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,660
but also the depth
of our dedication.

910
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,296
<i>A patient goes from worrying
about getting an organ</i>

911
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
<i>to worrying if the
organ will be rejected.</i>

912
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,415
All in favor?

913
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,467
Aye.

914
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:03,970
Mmm-hmm.

915
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,159
Aye.

916
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,244
<i>The anxiety continues</i>

917
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:15,281
<i>until they can finally open
their eyes after surgery</i>

918
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,184
<i>and see that their gift
has been accepted.</i>
