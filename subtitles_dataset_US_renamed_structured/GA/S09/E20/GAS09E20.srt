1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,268
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,777
Aah!

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,522
Superman here broke protocol

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,069
and ran into the crash to
shield a kid from the blast.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,387
Ethan. Dad.

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,105
Stay with Mom, all
right? Where is my mom?

7
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,024
Who are you? It's
me, Mom. Ethan.

8
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,647
No, it's not. Who is he?

9
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:16,956
No, I'm not going anywhere!

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,528
How about we set
you up in a room,

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,202
and you can stay with him there?

12
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,303
Brooks, why don't you
step up? Switch with Ross.

13
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,788
God, you have
fast hands, Brooks.

14
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,318
<i>I know what you're doing.</i>

15
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,604
Just so we're clear, I'm not
going down without a fight.

16
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:28,938
I want you to map me.

17
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,842
I want to know if I'm
gonna get Alzheimer's.

18
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,344
<i>Patients say it all the time.</i>

19
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,836
<i>"Tell me straight up. I just
want to know what's going on."</i>

20
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,256
Okay, so I've got the results of
your genome sequencing here.

21
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,685
Now we weren't able to get
a clear read off Zola's sample.

22
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,377
Sometimes we just
have to run it again.

23
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,061
But yours came out.

24
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,480
And?

25
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,998
<i>"Tell me. I can handle it."</i>

26
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:54,119
And, oh, uh, first off, I just
need to ask you a few questions.

27
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:58,189
We have a couple of different
kinds of, um, information here, so...

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,591
I have the gene. Just say it.

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,761
Look, this test gives
us tons of information.

30
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,180
Some of it's clear.
And some of it isn't.

31
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:08,116
So, you know, we don't
want to jump to anything

32
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,718
without careful
consideration of...

33
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,264
Yeah, I've carefully considered.

34
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,021
Do I have the Alzheimer's gene?

35
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,751
You gonna let me get
through this questionnaire?

36
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,207
Bailey, you're my mentor

37
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,221
and my friend, and
I respect your work,

38
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,223
but I'm telling you, if you
don't answer my question,

39
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,963
I will punch you in the face.

40
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,800
<i>We don't dodge your
questions 'cause we're mean.</i>

41
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,521
Okay, you have tested positive

42
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,359
for more than one of the
genetic markers for Alzheimer's.

43
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,612
<i>We do it because when
you say you want the truth,</i>

44
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,281
<i>you have no idea what
you're talking about.</i>

45
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,535
Shepherd says his wife's
still unconscious, too.

46
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,037
Oh, what did you
do with her kid?

47
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:05,073
Oh, he was in peds
overnight, just so

48
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:08,076
social services
didn't haul him off.

49
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,611
His grandmother comes today.

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,491
You know what? I thought I
was gonna see you last night.

51
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:12,692
Oh, I got caught
up with a patient.

52
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,349
Ah, that's too bad.

53
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,002
I put on that T-shirt

54
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,798
you said I'm not allowed
to wear when we're arguing

55
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,484
'cause it makes you
forget what your point was.

56
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,757
I can't believe I missed it.

57
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,323
I can throw it on again tonight.

58
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,279
I mean, why is he still out?

59
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,783
You said that he would wake up
when you reversed his hypothermia.

60
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,117
Yeah, I said he might.

61
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,120
Or he might eight hours
later or eight days later.

62
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,701
If it's any more than that, we
have a problem, but not until then.

63
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,626
You talk to Russell about it?

64
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,362
He knows about
the eight days thing.

65
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,526
Maybe you should
just check in with him.

66
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,262
You said yourself that he's not

67
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,981
supervising you
that much lately.

68
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,637
There's no news.

69
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,901
If I go to him with this information,
he'll think I've lost my mind.

70
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,365
Well, then he can
come talk to me.

71
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,661
Your hair looks
really nice today.

72
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,918
My hair looks nice every day.

73
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,536
I'm on Bailey's... No.

74
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,601
Last time I was with her, I
ordered the wrong test, twice.

75
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,403
If she has a three-strike
policy, I'm out.

76
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,737
I'm on Jackson's service today.

77
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,456
So even if I cared,
I wouldn't trade.

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,813
What is this?

79
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,332
I don't know what that is.

80
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,719
It is a crumb, and it
was stuck to my laptop

81
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,222
after you used it to update my
notes right next to a splotch of

82
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,610
what could either be
pizza sauce or blood.

83
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,061
I think it's pizza.

84
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,075
I was hoping it was
blood, and you were dying

85
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,166
and not just getting pizza
all over my computer.

86
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,813
I'm so sorry. I was
doing my notes late,

87
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,147
and I hadn't eaten...

88
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,204
I'll go clean it off.

89
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,839
These interns are sloppy.

90
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,753
You people are
training sloppy interns.

91
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:47,987
And I trained you,

92
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,451
which means you're bringing
shame to the whole family.

93
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,180
I just got here.

94
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,699
Swag bags for the Syrians.

95
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,836
Some, um, sweatshirts
and baseball caps, Post-its.

96
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,383
Really cool penlights.

97
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,639
Ooh, those are nice.

98
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,136
You're sending
Post-its to Syria?

99
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,305
Yeah, I'm working with
Doctors Aid International.

100
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,739
We've flown in
two Syrian doctors.

101
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,883
They're general practitioners,
but now with the war,

102
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,866
they've been recruited
to staff the field hospitals.

103
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,480
They're getting
advanced trauma training

104
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,432
with Seattle Pres,
and they're here

105
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,856
for a crash course
in basic surgical skills.

106
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,425
They need to learn what
they can do quick and dirty.

107
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,010
They rope you in?

108
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,646
Mmm-hmm. Which must mean that...

109
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:27,215
Yeah. Yeah, they're
losing a lot of kids.

110
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,737
Godspeed.

111
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,317
All right, let's get this stuff

112
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,002
with the boxes of supplies
we're sending back with them.

113
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,537
So Bailey got her
genome thing funded.

114
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,801
You got this thing funded.

115
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,607
I need to get my
cartilage project bankrolled

116
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,791
while we still got bank.

117
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,645
Dr. Hunt? Hmm?

118
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,497
Dr. Avery's recommendation
on your burn patient.

119
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,721
Oh. Oh.

120
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,373
Hey. Have you rounded
on Matthew Taylor yet?

121
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,086
He was one of Avery's
patients yesterday.

122
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,471
He was here overnight
for observation.

123
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,672
They were worried
about a concussion.

124
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,073
He'll probably
leave this afternoon.

125
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,140
I think his mom's
coming to get him.

126
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,192
Tell Avery that is fine.

127
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,082
Ready? Yeah.

128
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,267
Um, wait.

129
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,352
His mom is coming
to pick him up?

130
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,987
What, can he walk?

131
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,372
You'll have to ask Dr. Avery.

132
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,526
Joyce Basche.

133
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:14,212
You and I put in a dialysis
graft two weeks ago.

134
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:17,210
She's had fevers to 102
and the site is red and tender.

135
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,100
It looks infected.

136
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,554
Maybe you dropped a
pizza crust on her wound.

137
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,523
I told him it's normal, right?

138
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,007
It's red and swollen.

139
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,060
She said come in if
it was swollen or red.

140
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:31,363
He loves doctors,
you in particular.

141
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,426
You do like spending
time with me.

142
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,894
Get her healthy, we'll
have you over for dinner.

143
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,768
Okay, well, he's right.

144
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,370
So give her a gram of Cefazolin.

145
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,184
It's probably a
post-operative infection.

146
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,792
Dr. Murphy is gonna run some
labs and get an ultrasound.

147
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,239
We'll figure out
what's going on.

148
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,561
Okay.

149
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,981
You tested positive
for the risk factor genes.

150
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,377
It doesn't mean
you're gonna get it.

151
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,667
I know what it means.

152
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,036
It's entirely possible
it means nothing at all.

153
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,737
We need an updated will.

154
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,239
I want you to call the lawyer.

155
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,786
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Slow down.

156
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,871
Even if you get the
disease, it's decades away.

157
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,412
It might not be.

158
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,215
We have a child and
we're having another child.

159
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,951
Look, right now, it says that
Lexie is Zola's legal guardian

160
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,420
if anything happens to
us. That's not going to work.

161
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,822
No, but...

162
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,339
Derek, we were in a plane crash.

163
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,808
We don't need Alzheimer's...

164
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,393
Potential Alzheimer's.

165
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,745
We need an updated will.

166
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,281
Okay. You're right. I
will contact the guy.

167
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,598
Okay.

168
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,313
Okay, we're gonna
try as closely as we can

169
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,349
to replicate your circumstances
in the field hospital.

170
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,887
The most important skills
you need in a wartime situation

171
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,310
is controlling bleeding.

172
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,813
Normally we'd use lasers
and argon beam coagulators,

173
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,148
but as you can see, for now,

174
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,367
we're only using

175
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,454
the contents of this tray.

176
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,561
Is something wrong?

177
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,531
We... Before had
all of these things,

178
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,017
but recently the supply
trucks cannot reach us,

179
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,003
and the electricity
is unreliable,

180
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,922
so many of our
instruments we cannot use,

181
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,559
so if you want to replicate
our circumstances,

182
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,928
we may need to
adjust this slightly.

183
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,642
Please. We're here to
make this work for you.

184
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,232
Thank you. Um...

185
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,712
This is more right.

186
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,232
Also...

187
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,277
Now we go.

188
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,788
Mmm.

189
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,567
Dr. Shepherd, hey.

190
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:06,979
I wanted to follow
up on the patients

191
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,615
we saw yesterday, 'cause I care.

192
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,617
Ross, you should be learning
something else from someone else.

193
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,951
Oh, I am. I'm covering the pit,

194
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,015
which I can do and
manage your post-ops.

195
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,376
Also, I brought you a latte.

196
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:16,940
It's not your job
to bring my coffee.

197
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,997
Sorry. I'm here. I had
to get a piece of gum.

198
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,231
I had epically bad breath.

199
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,299
I didn't want it to bowl
you over in the OR,

200
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,618
but I'm all set. See?

201
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,170
I didn't need to see it.

202
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,166
Okay. Well, I'm going
to check your post-ops.

203
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,823
Anything you'd
like me to look for?

204
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,391
Ross already did it.

205
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,810
Spectacular.

206
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,178
Anything we should know?

207
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,196
Yeah, Rachel Dawson's awake.

208
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,383
Um...

209
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,019
Tell Hunt she's up.

210
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,527
We're gonna send you back
with a bunch of equipment,

211
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,035
but if supplies aren't reaching
you and there's no electricity,

212
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,654
then we're gonna have
to figure out another way.

213
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:49,110
Yeah, so take a look around

214
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,879
and see what items you do
have left in the field hospital,

215
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,848
and, uh, put it in the box.

216
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,769
Mmm-hmm.

217
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,072
Dr. Hunt. Can I borrow you?

218
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,943
I don't think I
should go in there.

219
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,510
She's okay now, Ethan.

220
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,741
She was really mad
when she saw me before.

221
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,631
She wasn't mad at
you. She was confused.

222
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,900
There's something in her
head that they needed to fix,

223
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,068
and they've done that.

224
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,171
She's back to
her old self again.

225
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,576
You sure?

226
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,481
I don't know 100%, Ethan,

227
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,134
but I think we should try, okay?

228
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,887
All right.

229
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,312
Ethan?

230
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,981
You're okay?

231
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,751
Come here.

232
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,906
Oh.

233
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,140
Oh, God.

234
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,992
I love you so much.

235
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,362
Did you get hurt?

236
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,731
No?

237
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,834
You look really good.

238
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,622
My car crash mom woke up.

239
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,758
And the lawyer sent over
an e-mail with the forms.

240
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,994
We need two names, a
guardian and a backup.

241
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,762
Before it was Lexie,
Cristina, and Owen.

242
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,509
So Cristina and then
which one of your sisters

243
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,773
do you want as a backup?

244
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,267
Cristina doesn't want children.

245
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,696
This isn't children.
It's Zola and fetus.

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,921
Stop calling the baby fetus.

247
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,390
Well, she will love him
whatever his name is.

248
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,408
All right, talk to her
and see what she says.

249
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,893
I know what she'll say.

250
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,585
And I'll be wrong, and
that'll be good for everybody.

251
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:41,222
My talk was a viral sensation.

252
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,986
Cartilage is trending.

253
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,275
Because of me.

254
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,361
I couldn't be happier.

255
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,441
A cartilage regeneration lab would
be a huge boon for the hospital.

256
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:50,882
I am not an ATM.

257
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,517
I have one vote just like you do

258
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,051
and Arizona does.

259
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,882
Oh, no. Arizona has to vote
for me 'cause she's my wife.

260
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,516
And your vote is
like a vote and a half.

261
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,684
Uh-huh. I'll vote for myself.

262
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,825
Now that is a
solid voting block.

263
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,588
You put a lot of
thought into this, huh?

264
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:03,878
Is this how it works?

265
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,591
You all whisper to each
other in your board meetings

266
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:07,360
about your pet projects, and
that's where all the money goes?

267
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:08,511
That's exactly how it works.

268
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,884
That is not how it works.

269
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:12,098
Everybody's supposed to
submit their proposals in writing.

270
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,850
You can't have people
bugging board members

271
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,406
while they're trying to work.

272
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,025
Uh... You're sitting in a chair.

273
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,189
I need money for my orphan
thing. I want to take it global.

274
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,612
You see what you've done?

275
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,314
Who canceled my
valve replacement?

276
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,161
Hunt canceled half
of everybody's day.

277
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,900
Thank you for coming, everyone.

278
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,086
Sorry we had to
rearrange your schedule,

279
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,421
but this is important.

280
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,050
We've got two
Syrian doctors here.

281
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,508
They used to be GPs,

282
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:35,103
but now they're
operating in a field hospital

283
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,544
in a war zone.

284
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,690
We were planning on teaching
them surgical procedures

285
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:40,092
they could do with
limited resources,

286
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,150
but it turns out they
have way less to work with

287
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,401
than we anticipated.

288
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,152
Just give 'em more stuff.

289
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,216
When it runs out in two weeks,
they'll be right back where they started.

290
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,569
He wants to help them function
with what they know they have.

291
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:50,859
Which is this.

292
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,760
So, we need to

293
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,363
be able to do the
procedures on this list

294
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,565
using only what is in this box.

295
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,579
Are you kidding
me? There's no way.

296
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,837
There has to be.
We gotta figure it out.

297
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,776
Joyce Basche's labs.
She's in ultrasound now.

298
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,946
Her white count's pretty high.
And her electrolytes are off.

299
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:15,249
Um, I think we err on the
side of caution and admit her.

300
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,629
And, uh, this is kind of weird.

301
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,932
Um, we have another
post-op complication

302
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,533
on the same day as Mrs. Basche.

303
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:24,258
And, uh, I scrubbed in
on both of them with you.

304
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,077
And you managed
their post-op care?

305
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:31,660
Okay, you better go through all
your notes on both these charts

306
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,362
and figure out what
the hell went wrong.

307
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,663
Edwards, you're with me today.

308
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,053
I'm with Dr. Avery today.

309
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,055
Ditch him. Murphy's
having a time-out.

310
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,543
What did you do?

311
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,372
So the second post-op
infection was your patient, too?

312
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,985
Kathy Dong. Mmm-hmm.

313
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,837
Does she need surgery? Probably.

314
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,789
And Bailey got Medusa to
scrub in with her this afternoon

315
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,991
on the first lady that
came in with an infection.

316
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,426
They've gotta
take out her shunt.

317
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,260
It's got this huge
abscess under it.

318
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,444
It's a mess.

319
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,152
They're gonna kill me.

320
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,937
What did you do?

321
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,802
Did you forget the pre-op
antibiotics or scrub too fast?

322
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,109
I was sick. I had
the flu or something.

323
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,255
And you came in?

324
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,478
Of course I did.

325
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,267
We all work when
we're sick, all the time.

326
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:22,049
Patients have post-op
infections all the time, right?

327
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,050
Okay, so they can debride the
wounds with a basic instrument set,

328
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,936
but now they're faced
with a huge risk of infection.

329
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,788
Well, I guess wound vacs
are out of the question then.

330
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,132
Simple wet-to-dry
dressings might work?

331
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,512
Mmm. No.

332
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,293
They'd have to change
those out three times a day.

333
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,344
They would use their entire
gauze supply with one patient.

334
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,436
Sugar.

335
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,971
Excuse me?

336
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,683
It's not in the box, but
they may have it around.

337
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,023
It's an osmotic dressing

338
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,220
that allows you to avoid
multiple dressing changes.

339
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,628
Okay. Well, somebody go
find out if they still have sugar.

340
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,446
Okay.

341
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,193
Anything? DEREK:
You've barely made a dent.

342
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:55,344
It's gonna take forever.

343
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,846
Well, you try
using this hand drill,

344
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,790
Mr. Backseat Driver. Let me try.

345
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,599
If they had an infrascanner,
it would be a lot easier.

346
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,868
Well, they don't. I think
whoever it is, you just killed him.

347
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,153
You know, start
with a fresh one.

348
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,321
Does anybody have any Betadine?

349
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,610
I just have bleach.

350
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,629
Yeah, that'll work. Sure.

351
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,980
All right.

352
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,549
So anybody ready
to start teaching?

353
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,245
Uh, me. I can do
fracture repairs.

354
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,636
Yeah, you can put me down.

355
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,199
I got a blade I can
use for skin grafting.

356
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,722
Great. Get to the lab.

357
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,568
Uh, Shepherd, how long till
Rachel Dawson's out of the ICU?

358
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,808
Oh, check with Ross.

359
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,188
He's tracking her
through post-op.

360
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,840
Wait. I thought Brooks
was on your service today.

361
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,641
Ross gets connected
to the patients.

362
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,905
He likes to follow through.

363
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,634
Owen, peds just called.

364
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,635
Ethan Dawson's grandmother
got stuck back east.

365
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,903
Her flight got canceled,

366
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,767
and she's not gonna
make it here until tomorrow.

367
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,511
So I think you should
call social services

368
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,319
and see if they can
take him for the night.

369
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,682
But this is pretty
standard, right?

370
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,183
This must happen all the time.

371
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,687
It's an unusually
aggressive infection.

372
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,299
But we're gonna take care of it.

373
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,902
She said it was
nothing, and I knew it.

374
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,675
Steven... No.

375
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,145
I waited a whole day.

376
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,333
I am going to take care
of her, you hear me?

377
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,158
And now even if you don't
have an electric dermatome,

378
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,460
you can still do skin
grafts using blades.

379
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,040
But you want to be very careful

380
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,509
about how much
pressure you apply.

381
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,694
You don't want to cut too deep.

382
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,850
Is that okay?

383
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,619
That's good. But no deeper.

384
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,288
Yeah, that's better.

385
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,436
Okay, so you want to place the
screws medial to the tibial crest

386
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,059
so you don't interfere
with intravascular bundle.

387
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,528
Medial to the tibial crest.

388
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,642
Mmm-hmm. Now advance
the screw by hand. Yeah.

389
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,150
Until it's anchored
in the far cortex.

390
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,914
Don't be afraid
to push too hard.

391
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,271
Sorry. I'm just... I'm
trying to figure out

392
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,707
how to hold down the patient
to keep him still while I do this.

393
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,376
Oh, the patient's sedated.

394
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,959
Not when you don't
have anesthesia.

395
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,570
Okay.

396
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,371
Um...

397
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,774
Let's go at this another way.

398
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,455
I am so sorry I
wasn't here earlier.

399
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,479
It's okay.

400
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,923
We've got these two
Syrian doctors here

401
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,124
and we're trying to
get all the surgeons

402
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,393
to figure out how to
do these procedures

403
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,328
with, like, a piece of
gum and a matchstick,

404
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,296
and this was our
first pee break.

405
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,765
And meanwhile, you're sitting
here and you can't even walk?

406
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:13,587
I thought it was just
a small laceration.

407
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,922
It is. I'm fine.

408
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,819
But is it infected? Because
you should be able to walk.

409
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,120
April. April. I don't
know why you can't walk.

410
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,577
April, I can walk. I'm...

411
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,567
You can?

412
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,431
Yeah.

413
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,983
They said that you...
You couldn't leave

414
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,279
till your mom came
to pick you up.

415
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:30,003
Oh, uh... I, um...

416
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,073
My mom's not coming here
because I can't get myself home.

417
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:36,444
She's coming here because
I wanted her to meet you.

418
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,597
Oh...

419
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,203
I had a low-grade fever.

420
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,854
I felt bad the night before,

421
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,222
but when I woke up, I figured
I could muscle through it.

422
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,524
So I came in.

423
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,821
I felt okay for most of the day,

424
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,144
so I figured it wasn't...

425
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,743
Of course I'll take
Zola and fetus.

426
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,200
That's what I told Derek.

427
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,202
You're not shipping
them off to Ohio

428
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,048
or wherever his
stupid sisters are from.

429
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,338
I knew you would say that.

430
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,518
I will oversee the
most competent herd

431
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,587
of child care
professionals ever.

432
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,539
I'll get only German nannies.

433
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,579
They're super organized.

434
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:16,951
I'm not sure a herd of German
nannies is what I had in mind.

435
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,822
Wait. You don't want me
to be a stay-at-home mom?

436
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,006
No.

437
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,608
Yeah, 'cause you're not.

438
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:28,312
Right, but Zola is at the day
care here when we pick her up.

439
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,183
Yeah, and you do 30%
less surgeries than I do

440
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,246
'cause you're not putting
in the hours anymore.

441
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,888
You don't want to do this.

442
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,673
Hey, I love Zola.

443
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,191
I know you do.

444
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,021
But you don't want
to be her mom.

445
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,962
No.

446
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:48,694
You really hate those sisters?

447
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,085
Kind of.

448
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,319
Mmm.

449
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,587
Not all of them.

450
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,367
Kathleen seems like a good mom.

451
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,269
I mean, I don't want to
hang out with her all the time,

452
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,592
but her kids seem sane.

453
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,556
Yeah, well, that's not nothing.

454
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,046
Okay, how about this?

455
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,581
You write in the will

456
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,400
that I get your children
three weeks every year.

457
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,902
We'll travel.

458
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,949
I'll take them to
get their first tattoo,

459
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,789
someplace clean.

460
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,508
And I'll teach 'em how to
put a condom on a cucumber.

461
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,822
Come on, Sierra! Come on!

462
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,445
Okay.

463
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,725
I will be the coolest
aunt in the world.

464
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,382
I just can't be a mom.

465
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,884
Oh.

466
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,184
They deserve a mom.

467
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,503
They already have a mom.

468
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,040
I know.

469
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,244
You're not dying right
now. You know that, right?

470
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,233
Dr. Webber. I paged you.

471
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,347
Can you check out bed
three? Patient is Seth Lepik.

472
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,654
Erythema and swelling
along a surgical site.

473
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,004
Febrile. Looks pretty sick.
Probably needs to be admitted.

474
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,058
Sorry.

475
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,377
I'll be right back.

476
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,231
Dr. Shepherd just ordered
an MRI on one of his patients.

477
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,426
I thought you were
covering the pit.

478
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,616
Oh, I am.

479
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,735
My generation's all
about multitasking, sir.

480
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,264
<i>Dr. Horowitz...</i>

481
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,622
<i>Dr. Horowitz...</i>

482
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,742
Mr. Lepik, I'm Dr. Webber.

483
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,656
I understand that
you're not feeling well.

484
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,213
Yeah, um...

485
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,881
I've been dizzy for
a couple of days,

486
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,116
and they said to come
back in if I didn't feel good.

487
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,318
"They" who?

488
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,452
You guys.

489
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,288
I had surgery here a
couple of weeks ago.

490
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,292
Here it is. Dr. Bailey
operated on you.

491
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,627
Yep.

492
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,129
Okay, well, let's
see what we have.

493
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,856
So you want to
stop the bleeding,

494
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,025
but you don't want to do a
blind clamp in a bloody field.

495
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,732
Your goal is to get
control of the hilum.

496
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,081
Since you won't have a stapler,

497
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,913
you can get control by
using finger pressure,

498
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,102
like that.

499
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,971
So, just reach in here?

500
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,618
Yeah, you want to
feel for the bronchus

501
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,336
and then you'll know
you're near the hilum.

502
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,505
Matthew's mother is coming here.

503
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,362
I can't meet her.

504
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,671
I can't lie to a mother.

505
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,265
Don't sell yourself short.

506
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,727
You thought you couldn't
lie to Matthew either,

507
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,151
but somehow you had it in you.

508
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,955
What kind of grown man gets
his mommy to pick him up?

509
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,706
They have a good relationship.

510
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,742
He respects women.

511
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,293
He has good values.

512
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,478
I think I'm there.

513
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,480
Okay, so if you
don't have a clamp,

514
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,032
you can just use your hand

515
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,534
and twist the lung
on the hilar axis.

516
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,854
That's it. I see it. Thank you.

517
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,901
You know what? He
doesn't make fun of me.

518
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,165
He thinks I'm brave.

519
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,009
He likes it when I babble.

520
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,527
He's a unicorn.

521
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,529
He's an amazing guy.

522
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,049
Well, then you should
tell him the truth.

523
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,887
I have this really cool
technique for autotransfusion

524
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:42,489
that I would love to show
you when you're done here.

525
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:43,558
Mmm.

526
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,526
Not bad, huh?

527
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,757
Who needs a fancy splint
when you have duct tape?

528
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,931
It holds quite nicely. Mmm-hmm.

529
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,704
Twenty-seven new e-mails about
where my research goes next.

530
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,074
It should sound like
a cash register to you.

531
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,238
Can you go bug Shepherd
for his vote, please?

532
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,695
Oh, I plan to, and
I'm sure I'll get it.

533
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,081
Shepherd knows we
bought this hospital so that

534
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,050
we could all be the
doctors we want to be.

535
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,335
I'm not living my dream.

536
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,088
My dreams are big and bright

537
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,857
and filled with
extremely shiny machines

538
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,843
that grow cartilage
out of thin air.

539
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,382
I have that dream all the time.

540
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,337
Since you have limited
blood supply, you do this,

541
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,935
and you're giving your
patient their own blood back.

542
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,103
Do you want to give it a try?

543
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,359
Sure.

544
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:36,411
Mmm.

545
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:38,512
So,

546
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:40,931
are you going to
tell this man the truth

547
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,493
or include his
mother in the lie?

548
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,902
Because I cannot get on that
plane without some closure.

549
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,039
Uh, I am so sorry.

550
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,209
You do not need to bother
with my stupid problems.

551
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,894
You have real problems.

552
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:56,464
Courtship troubles
are everyone's troubles.

553
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,032
Wooing my wife was very tricky.

554
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,734
Well, how'd you win her over?

555
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Ahh.

556
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,357
A picnic of spiced lamb

557
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,275
under the cypress trees,

558
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,561
almonds dipped in honey,

559
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,897
the words of my heart.

560
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,153
Dr. Kepner,

561
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,739
we went to see <i>Terminator 3.</i>

562
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,584
You were right. Cristina
only wants to be the cool aunt.

563
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,147
I'm sorry. I wish I was wrong.

564
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,620
That's okay. What
about Kathleen?

565
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,066
What about Lizzie?
You two got along.

566
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,301
Oh, I forgot about Lizzie.

567
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,669
You know, I don't
want to leave our kids

568
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,953
with somebody you forgot about.

569
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,310
Well, she's the alternate.

570
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:45,912
Well, it's a disaster plan.
Most disasters don't happen.

571
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,164
They do to us.

572
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,299
That's true.

573
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,486
We have survived an unusual
number of very bad things.

574
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,438
At this point, it ups our odds.

575
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,134
Just send the papers.

576
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,142
Uh, apparently we have never
filled out a health care directive.

577
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,844
The lawyer wants that, too.

578
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,280
Oh, well, I mean,
you know all of this.

579
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,865
I don't want to be a potato.

580
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,245
No extraordinary measures
taken if it's obviously at the end.

581
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,335
He wants it in writing.

582
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:10,103
It doesn't matter.

583
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:11,716
We both know you're gonna
give me a lethal dose of morphine

584
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,652
the second I start to
forget where my keys are.

585
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:14,819
I'm not kidding.

586
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:16,655
Before we knew
my mother was sick,

587
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,841
she couldn't remember
anything I'd ever said to her.

588
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,009
And I thought it was because
she didn't give a crap about me.

589
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,677
I don't want to put
my kids through that.

590
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,701
You'll give me a lethal
dose, we'll hold hands,

591
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,114
and I'll fade off
into the night.

592
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,639
We will cross that bridge
when we come to it.

593
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,177
More irrigation.

594
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,630
Looks like I'm gonna
have to open this all up.

595
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,699
You doing okay? I'm fine.

596
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,001
You sure?

597
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,397
Dr. Bailey, don't
get all weird on me

598
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,932
because you think you
shattered my psyche.

599
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,022
I knew what I was asking
when I took that test.

600
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,403
Well, if you ever
need to talk...

601
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,427
Stop it.

602
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:50,527
All right. Fine.

603
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,080
How about we talk about
the sloppy job you're doing

604
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:54,448
raising those crappy interns?

605
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,716
There you go.

606
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,762
What, she sneezed
all over my patients,

607
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,187
now I have two
post-op infections?

608
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,722
They have no judgment

609
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,674
or common sense.

610
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,593
Mmm. Sorry to butt in, Bailey.

611
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,262
I saw a patient of yours
from a couple of weeks back.

612
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:10,380
Post-op infection,
pretty extensive.

613
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,610
He's on IV, antibiotics, but
he's gonna need surgery.

614
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,612
You have time today or
you want me to handle it?

615
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,054
What do you mean, "he"?
He's a she, and I saw her.

616
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,968
I'm dealing with her after I
deal with this post-op infection.

617
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,775
It's not a she.

618
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,144
Seth Lepik.

619
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,891
It's not the same patient.

620
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:27,748
It's a third one.

621
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,211
Three? Have you spoken to Hunt?

622
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,057
No, not yet. I thought
it was just two.

623
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,493
Look, I'll take care
of your third patient.

624
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,316
You need to find Hunt.

625
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:50,178
Which intern was it?

626
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,404
It's Leah Murphy.

627
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,585
Dr. Darwish, can I
get you something?

628
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:09,472
Oh, no. I'm just looking.

629
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,178
It's quiet.

630
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,882
We don't have a
lot of quiet anymore.

631
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:26,290
So there's been a big
rainstorm back east,

632
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,657
and your grandma's flight

633
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,587
isn't gonna be able
to get in until tomorrow,

634
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,279
so Carol here
from social services

635
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:35,482
is going to take you to a
place that you can sleep tonight.

636
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:38,268
Why can't I stay here
like we did last night?

637
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,582
Well, that's not
going to work out.

638
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,023
I don't want to go with her.
My mom and dad are here.

639
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:44,457
It's gonna be fine, okay?

640
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,454
They're gonna give
you a great dinner.

641
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,406
And they'll probably give
you ice cream for dessert,

642
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,809
and they're gonna let
you play video games, so...

643
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,867
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

644
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,069
It's going to be
fine. I promise.

645
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,309
Okay, is that

646
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:04,945
better?

647
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:07,125
Yeah, uh... But, uh, practice
it a bunch more times.

648
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,417
The faster you get in and out,
the better your outcomes will be.

649
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,132
Promise me you'll kill
me with a lethal injection

650
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,934
before I start to forget
where my keys are.

651
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,958
Of course.

652
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:18,141
Early.

653
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,821
Not when I set the house on fire

654
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,373
because I forgot
to shut the stove off

655
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:22,757
or when I'm sitting
in the rocking chair

656
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,693
in the corner of
the nursing home.

657
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,311
I don't want my kids to go
through what I went through...

658
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,236
Mer, you had me
at "lethal injection."

659
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,091
Wow. Is that my door prize?

660
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,022
Okay, so you know I was working

661
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,528
with these two
Syrian guys today?

662
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,363
They barely get any
supplies anymore.

663
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,076
I mean, this is all
they have to work with.

664
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,001
But the attendings
all pitched in,

665
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,685
and we figured out a whole bunch

666
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,338
of lifesaving
procedures they can do.

667
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,823
That's great.

668
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,509
Yeah. Um...

669
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,712
My point is,

670
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,716
you think you need everything,

671
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,051
but you don't.

672
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,454
We could get by without
a lot of stuff, right?

673
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,557
Sure.

674
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,326
What exactly are we
getting by without?

675
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,765
Uh...

676
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,485
My virginity.

677
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,340
I was...

678
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,443
I was a virgin for
a really long time,

679
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,044
and then I wasn't.

680
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,616
I really wanted to wait

681
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,819
for someone like you,

682
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,721
for marriage, but I screwed up.

683
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,158
And I was just... I was
so scared to tell you.

684
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,226
But then I was watching
these guys today,

685
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,262
and they... They
literally have nothing left,

686
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,797
and they're making do.

687
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,232
And then I just felt like
I was being so stupid

688
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,335
to worry about
this one little thing,

689
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,972
like you couldn't
even get over it.

690
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,742
So,

691
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,789
I guess I would be
an ungrateful jerk

692
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,624
if I worried about
your virginity

693
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:05,744
while there's a war going on
somewhere and people are dying?

694
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,128
That what you're saying to me?

695
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,937
No, no. I didn't...

696
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,366
You didn't think I'd be
more hung up on the lying?

697
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:18,511
'Cause I bet even in a war,
people still value honesty.

698
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,839
He's still not awake?

699
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,148
Uh, no, not yet.

700
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,355
I gave him a bolus of
D50. We'll see if that helps.

701
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,562
Why didn't you talk to me first?

702
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,426
Because I talked to Russell
about it, like you asked me to.

703
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,461
But you knew that I was
concerned about this case.

704
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,069
You really want me to have
three highly trained surgeons

705
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,832
supervising one man's recovery?

706
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,740
It shouldn't be news to you that
we work as a team at this hospital.

707
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,094
Yes, and the entire team is
helping you save Syria from itself.

708
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,326
I came up with, like, 14 ways
of doing thoracotomy procedures

709
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,715
without a chest tray.

710
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,295
I didn't have time
for a groupthink

711
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,386
on perfectly
straightforward post-op care.

712
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:00,598
Tomorrow, you, Russell, myself

713
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:01,933
will round on Paul
together, all right?

714
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,223
Are you serious? I am.

715
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,203
Uh, Dr. Hunt, I need
to speak with you.

716
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:06,309
Could you give me moment?

717
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,345
It has to be now.

718
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,847
And Webber's in
the OR with the third.

719
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,184
So we have no idea
how extensive this is?

720
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,120
All right.

721
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,533
You and I are gonna need
to talk to infection control,

722
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,868
let them know
what we know so far.

723
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,870
I need you to find all
your charts from that day,

724
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,288
figure out every patient
you touched in post-op,

725
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,679
or anywhere, for that matter.

726
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:27,158
We're gonna need to
call every one of them,

727
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,960
have them come in,
and examine them.

728
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,265
This is going to be a nightmare.

729
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,651
They're gonna
fire me, aren't they?

730
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,075
Just go.

731
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,103
Still unconscious?

732
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:55,358
Bummer.

733
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,038
It's okay. He'll wake
up in a couple of days,

734
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,229
if we can all relax
and be patient about it.

735
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,314
Good. Yeah, tell that to Owen.

736
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,917
We may be losing Leah
Murphy from the program.

737
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,485
Did I like her?

738
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,921
I think you said once
that she didn't suck

739
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,822
as much as you
expected her to suck.

740
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,524
Oh. That's too bad.

741
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:13,943
You know, maybe Owen
doesn't like being Chief.

742
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,178
What makes you say that?

743
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,496
I thought he did,

744
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,276
but lately, he's had
a bug up his butt

745
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,212
about Russell not
supervising me.

746
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,536
You know, maybe it's
because he misses teaching.

747
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:25,083
I mean, Derek, he hated
all that administrative crap

748
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,517
when he was Chief,
right? Mmm-hmm.

749
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,470
Owen's had nothing
but that for weeks.

750
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,056
Maybe he feels like he's
losing touch with the medicine?

751
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,365
Or maybe it's because
Russell's not supervising you.

752
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,064
Okay, I just agreed to off you
the minute you started acting dotty.

753
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,816
Shouldn't you be on my
side for the rest of the day

754
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,572
just as a courtesy?

755
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,421
Ross was working
the pit today? Yes.

756
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,945
Okay, I just took out
an infected dialysis graft.

757
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,659
Mmm-hmm. He saw
the patient before I did...

758
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,427
Right. but he didn't
scrub in with me

759
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,163
because he wanted to make sure
your MRI was just the way you liked it.

760
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,947
Hey, Dr. Webber.

761
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,583
Someone just put a
glioblastoma resection

762
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,906
on your schedule for tomorrow.

763
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:02,959
Did you want to do that
before or after your aneurysm?

764
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,830
Shane, you have to stop.

765
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,499
I am working with Brooks now.

766
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,485
Yeah, but she annoys
you, doesn't she?

767
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:14,883
Mmm. I mean, you
and I kind of get along.

768
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,269
Brooks has an instinct
for this that you don't have.

769
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,271
You make up for it
with a ton of work.

770
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,811
Well, if I'm making up
for it, who cares how?

771
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,314
I care.

772
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,682
And you should, too.

773
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,735
You should find a
specialty where you shine.

774
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,837
This is what I'm
passionate about.

775
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,689
Doesn't that count for anything?

776
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,903
She's better at
this than you are.

777
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,995
And that means, to me, I
have to teach her, not you.

778
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,540
You're gonna be a great surgeon.

779
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,298
Go figure out where.

780
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,832
Hey.

781
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,777
Guy can't take a hint, huh?

782
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,214
Mmm-hmm.

783
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,915
Where are we going, sensei?

784
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,519
We are going to check
in on Rachel Dawson,

785
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,349
see if her neuro
exams have improved.

786
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:05,767
You went with
spearmint gum this time.

787
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,357
Yeah. You can smell it?

788
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,546
Mmm. I can.

789
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:09,676
Do you like spearmint?

790
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,177
Not really, no.

791
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,929
Just use peripheral
vascular instruments

792
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,675
if you don't have
stuff for peds. Mmm.

793
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,267
Okay, so pass the umbilical
tape around the vessel.

794
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,402
And then thread both ends

795
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,471
through the short
rubber catheter

796
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,039
and place the hemostat.

797
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,258
There.

798
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:26,955
Uh, could I borrow
her for a moment?

799
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,711
Yes, but not for long, please.

800
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,796
Uh, I would like to admit Ethan
Dawson to peds for the night.

801
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,215
Oh, he'll be fine with social
services. Kids go with them every day.

802
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,466
This kid doesn't have to.

803
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,206
Owen, there's
protocol for a reason.

804
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,103
Yeah, but we're
human for a reason.

805
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,544
I know that you've taken a
special interest in this kid...

806
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:46,891
Why is everybody acting like this
is some kind of a character flaw?

807
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:48,081
He ought to stay. He's sick.

808
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,083
I got a look at him
when I checked his wrist.

809
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:51,517
Short limb syndrome.

810
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:52,835
Karev.

811
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,488
Right. He's right.

812
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,824
Uh, limited growth,
excessive sleeping, and eating.

813
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,242
Impulse control problems.

814
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,244
These are all the
symptoms of childhood.

815
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,745
Can't be sure.

816
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,448
Not until we confirm it
with testing and observation.

817
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,018
Guys, guys, I love
the enthusiasm,

818
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,919
but it's not gonna happen.

819
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,739
All right.

820
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,247
Hey.

821
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:23,182
Cristina said she would pull
the trigger if it comes to that.

822
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,119
You're my wife.

823
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:27,665
Can we make the
decision together

824
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,809
if we're gonna
throw in the towel?

825
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,408
That sounds fair.

826
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,597
It's not gonna be easy
on you if I start to lose it.

827
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:34,911
Oh, don't worry.

828
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,063
You're a project even
with all your marbles.

829
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,911
I brought you
something. You did?

830
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,613
I had Bailey do my genome.

831
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:43,670
You did? Yeah.

832
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:46,956
High-risk for liver cancer
and prostate cancer? Whoa.

833
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,308
Yeah. You're telling me.

834
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,827
Male pattern baldness?

835
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,597
Late onset, apparently.

836
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,698
Mmm-hmm.

837
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,082
Heroin addiction?

838
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:57,294
I'm a real prize. Oh.

839
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,718
It's all a crapshoot.

840
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,331
We didn't get
one single definite.

841
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:01,471
We only got maybes.

842
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,972
Ah, maybe we live forever.

843
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,958
Maybe we do, and maybe I
become a bald heroin addict.

844
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:28,798
Honey, I'm gonna take
these bags down to the car.

845
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,867
Thanks, Mom.

846
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,246
Wrapping it up for the day?

847
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,214
Yep.

848
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,949
How about you let
me buy you dinner?

849
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,230
I want to bend your ear about
a project I'm thinking about.

850
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,787
You and everyone else

851
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,106
are free to submit
your proposals in writing

852
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,574
to the entire board.

853
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:56,154
And then I will vote
like everyone else does.

854
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,455
Hell, maybe I'll
submit one myself.

855
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,861
Maybe I have an idea,

856
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,841
but I'm not out here
hawking it to people at work.

857
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,610
'Cause I'm gonna
write a proposal

858
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,033
like you're supposed to.

859
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,121
Um... Son,

860
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,908
nobody's ever saying
yes to your proposal.

861
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,910
You're the most powerful
vote on the board.

862
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,124
You're the person who says
yes to other people's ideas.

863
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,947
We still let you be a surgeon.

864
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,833
Nobody wanted to
take that away from you.

865
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,652
But your project
is this hospital.

866
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,523
Yeah, it's exhausting sometimes.

867
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:28,507
Yeah.

868
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,080
You know something I
learned when I was the Chief?

869
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,049
What?

870
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:38,167
Somebody offers
to buy you dinner

871
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,102
while they talk
your ear off about

872
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,988
something you
don't want to hear...

873
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,342
You say yes.

874
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,129
Look at that. You're a natural.

875
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,294
Oh, looks like you got this.

876
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,667
Yes,

877
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,769
but not as fast as it could be.

878
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,023
Practice, practice, practice.

879
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,593
Thank you for all
you've taught us.

880
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,881
I wish it could be more.
It feels like nothing.

881
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:11,551
If we will help even one child,

882
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,885
it's everything.

883
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,906
Short limb syndrome?

884
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,853
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we're not sure.

885
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,188
At this point, we're just
admitting him for observation.

886
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,689
We'll know more in the morning.

887
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,779
Thank you.

888
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,949
Hey. So got your own TV,

889
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,363
they serve a chocolate
pudding that's not half bad,

890
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:31,987
and I'm gonna see if I can scare
up some comic books, okay?

891
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:34,908
Hey.

892
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,208
You okay?

893
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,327
You just told the
nurse I was sick.

894
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:40,563
Yeah, you're fake sick.

895
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,315
The nurse knows that. Even...

896
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,800
All the doctors know it.

897
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,847
We're just pretending so
you can stay here tonight.

898
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,071
There is nothing wrong with you.

899
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,608
Is it fake with my mom and dad?

900
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:55,762
No.

901
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,498
No, I wish it was.

902
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,951
My dad's still not awake?

903
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,836
No, he's not.

904
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,888
Is he ever gonna wake up?

905
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:13,396
I don't know.

906
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,170
So, you played soccer.

907
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,972
I did.

908
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,691
Hey. Owen's been acting crazy.

909
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,360
I think this is why.

910
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,879
The left defender is crucial.

911
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,747
Kids make you crazy.

912
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,384
Yeah.

913
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,020
Kind of cute, though.

914
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,454
Dr. Grey.

915
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,794
I'm not gonna get fired.

916
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,413
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

917
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,516
No, it's worse than that.

918
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,576
Dr. Bailey, Joyce is crashing.

919
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,228
What?

920
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:23,349
Dr. Kepner, you have given
us piles of supplies already.

921
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,618
This equipment is expensive.

922
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,955
Yeah. Yeah, but
this will really help.

923
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:32,391
Oh, and you should
definitely take this.

924
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,727
It's an infrascanner.

925
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:36,629
It can detect a brain bleed.

926
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,264
Oh. Oh.

927
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,768
Uh...

928
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,036
Are you sure this is all right?

929
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,405
Perhaps you need
to talk to Dr. Hunt.

930
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,541
Don't worry about it.

931
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,063
Honesty's not all
it's cracked up to be.

932
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,756
<i>They say the truth
will set you free.</i>

933
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:13,299
<i>What the hell do they know?</i>

934
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,965
<i>The truth is
horrible, frightening.</i>

935
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,837
<i>The truth is more
than you can bear.</i>

936
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,153
Bailey said the second patient
isn't responding to antibiotics.

937
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,077
So she's going to need surgery.

938
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,246
I just operated on the third.

939
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,249
He's hypotensive and
still pretty unstable.

940
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,963
Once Murphy's identified
all her patients for the day,

941
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,038
then we'll get them in here,
make sure no one else is infected.

942
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,885
We're gonna need to make
some kind of statement.

943
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,789
Before this gets
out there on its own.

944
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,944
Hey, uh,

945
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,280
the first patient, Joyce Basche,

946
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,282
she didn't make it.

947
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,479
I thought that the surgery
would get rid of the infection,

948
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,035
but...

949
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,738
You need to get cultures
on the other two right away.

950
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:27,985
And we need to make sure that
we're using the right antibiotics

951
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,336
so that this doesn't
get out of control.

952
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,526
Okay.

953
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,696
We just lost Joyce Basche.

954
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,064
Dr. Bailey...

955
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,543
No, she's her patient.
She should know.

956
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,995
Leah checked all the charts.

957
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,113
She was only on two of the
patients that got the infection.

958
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,866
She never touched the third one.

959
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,990
What, is that supposed to
reassure me? A woman just died.

960
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,610
It couldn't have been Leah.

961
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,680
The only doctor who
touched all three patients

962
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:51,864
was you.

963
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:58,637
We're gonna need
to get legal down here.

964
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,803
Wait. Anything could've
caused this kind of infection.

965
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,726
Yeah, no...

966
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,245
Well, we know that, but
until there's an investigation...

967
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,443
No, I gotta go, 'cause I
have two more people...

968
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,649
Owen?

969
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,862
Dr. Webber will deal with them.

970
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,029
Yeah, this is Dr. Avery.

971
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,330
Get me Joelle Geller from legal

972
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:15,194
down here, conference room two.

973
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:17,223
I will

974
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,824
go over my notes.

975
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,877
Sit down, Dr. Bailey.

976
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:24,897
No. My patients are in danger.

977
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,086
Dr. Webber will
take care of them.

978
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:29,680
I haven't even told

979
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,432
Joyce's husband
that she didn't make it.

980
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:37,342
I know the man!

981
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,512
I don't need Grey to tell
him that I killed his wife!

982
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,714
Dr. Bailey, please sit down.

983
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,017
<i>We're supposed to
be straight with you,</i>

984
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,709
<i>so be careful what you ask for
when you walk into a hospital.</i>

985
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,861
What are you saying?

986
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,231
I'm asking you to sit down.

987
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,782
<i>Because when you find
out what's really going on,</i>

988
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,584
<i>you may never recover.</i>
