1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,315
<i>They hit you out of nowhere.</i>

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,042
What happened?

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,479
We were arguing.

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,931
He kept saying that he
couldn't trust me anymore,

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,985
that I was a liar, that I...
that I lied about who I was.

6
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,353
He hit you?

7
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,006
God, it just got so bad.

8
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:27,075
<i>When bad things come,
they come suddenly,</i>

9
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,242
<i>without warning.</i>

10
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:30,279
I don't know what's
gonna happen now.

11
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:31,713
Nothing's gonna happen.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,149
You're safe.

13
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,665
All right? You're safe here.

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,033
You just need to get some sleep.

15
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,177
All right? Just try and sleep.

16
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,426
If you need anything...

17
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,595
I'll have my cell.

18
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,230
Where are you going?

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,210
<i>We rarely get to see
the catastrophe coming...</i>

20
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,818
Alex, what are you gonna do?

21
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,747
Make sure that's
covered, and make sure...

22
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,845
<i>No matter how well
we try to prepare for it.</i>

23
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,399
What is all this?

24
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,663
Weather report says a
massive storm is coming.

25
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,787
Hurricane force winds and heavy
rain. They say it's three days out.

26
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,216
So we have time
to prepare, then.

27
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,491
Exactly. So for the ER,

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,588
we're gonna need to overstock
supplies and blood products.

29
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,212
Let's get ready for
double capacity intakes.

30
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,915
That means extra beds
and gurneys in the hallways.

31
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,284
This storm will bring
in a lot of causalities.

32
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,797
We're gonna need to
make room for them,

33
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,683
so let's discharge all
patients that can be.

34
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,239
Post-op and long-term patients

35
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,586
are gonna be transferred
to Seattle Pres further inland.

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,312
We're gonna bring in supplementals,
water, food, meds, lighting.

37
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,181
We're gonna be checking and
refueling the backup generators.

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,616
As for you surgeons,

39
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,986
push, postpone, or cancel
all elective procedures

40
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,554
until after this storm...

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,084
So we're canceling
surgeries now?

42
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,408
Well, you can afford
to slow down a little bit.

43
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,922
I'm pregnant. I'm not sick.

44
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,078
You're very pregnant.

45
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,858
You're three weeks
away from your due date.

46
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,025
Shepherd. Yeah.

47
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,484
I need your help. Come with me.

48
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,396
There will be a list of
available surgeons...

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,632
So you've got your craniofacial
baby. Are you gonna postpone?

50
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,256
No, he said elective. The
kid's got his brain on his face.

51
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,504
Don't snap. I was just
wondering if maybe...

52
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,660
Well, we have three days.

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,729
Most importantly,

54
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,346
we're gonna need
to print hard copies

55
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:12,948
of all computerized
patient charts

56
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:14,316
in case of a power loss.

57
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,480
All of them? Do
we have time to...

58
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,170
I'll do that.

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,721
Bailey, it's good
to have you back.

60
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,256
I'll put you on the OR rotation.

61
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,592
I mean I'll do the charts.

62
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,430
Folks, they're saying that
this is going to be a bad one,

63
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,617
but we have three
days to prepare.

64
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,453
So let's do it and be
ready when the storm hits.

65
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,120
Thank you.

66
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,909
How's she doing?

67
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,106
She feels like she
can't go into an OR.

68
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,258
She thinks she'll kill
anyone she touches.

69
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,960
I tried to convince her to
come down to LA with me,

70
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:48,127
take some time off,

71
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,745
but then we heard
about the storm,

72
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,381
and she said she
had to stay and help.

73
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,487
Anything I can do?

74
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,990
I wish there was,
but honestly...

75
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:56,591
Anyone but me.

76
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:58,844
I know.

77
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,977
I brought him in a few
hours ago. He had a CT.

78
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,551
I wanted to wait for you.

79
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,936
You gotta help him.

80
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,758
It's Chest Peckwell.
I mean, Jason Myers.

81
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,932
So between removing
the encephalocele

82
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,313
and closing up
the facial cleft...

83
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,257
It is gonna take
most of the day.

84
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,188
You guys have any questions?

85
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,057
Uh, no.

86
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,459
I guess not. No.

87
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,423
I would tell you not to worry,

88
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,497
but that's a load of
crap. You'll worry.

89
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,065
But if it helps,

90
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,184
I'm not worried a bit.

91
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,796
It does help.

92
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,587
A lot. Thank you.

93
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:48,076
So you knew exactly what to
say to her. Is that a mom thing?

94
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,223
Oh! The internet told you
I was a mom, too, huh?

95
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,475
Oh, God. Okay, all right.
Apparently, I'm super creepy

96
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,032
'cause I know
everything about you.

97
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,501
Well, I'm creepy, too,
because the internet told me

98
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,080
that you studied
with Bud Clement,

99
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,532
and I did a year
under him at Hopkins.

100
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,489
Bud? I mean, he's a genius.

101
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,769
Yeah. But oh, my God...

102
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,137
His breath. His
breath is so bad.

103
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,304
Something died in him.

104
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,961
It did.

105
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,507
All right. Well, this
changes everything.

106
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,976
I mean, if you studied
under Clement,

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,133
then I'll have you
do the calvarial graft

108
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,646
and I'll just focus
on the bipartition.

109
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,469
Cool? Really? Yay.

110
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,905
Yeah, yay.

111
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,026
Do you want to go get
coffee before we start this?

112
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,261
Um... Yeah.

113
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,575
You know, I have to
get some stuff done.

114
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,760
So I will, I'll meet you...
I'll meet you up there.

115
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,450
Okay.

116
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,797
I mean, you're probably just gonna
go cyber stalk me some more, huh?

117
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,454
I might be.

118
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,123
Creepy.

119
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,159
I understand it.

120
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:41,062
If my dad doesn't wake
up, I go live with strangers.

121
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,965
Hey, hey, hey, not
strangers. A foster family.

122
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,869
People who want to take
care of you and are more...

123
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,938
More prepared to do that
than your grandma is right now.

124
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,007
Will they play soccer?

125
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,847
I hope so.

126
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,750
What if they don't?

127
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,352
What if they're like the
people from <i>Harry Potter?</i>

128
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,204
Like, gross, mean, and scary?

129
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,891
They... They
won't be, all right?

130
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,826
I promise.

131
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,047
But if my dad wakes up, I
could stay with him, right?

132
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,632
Yeah, if he wakes up.

133
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,685
Ethan, honey.

134
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,271
Oh, eat your yogurt.

135
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,527
Okay. Well, I'll see you,
all right? And don't worry.

136
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,412
Okay.

137
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,050
Page me if anything changes.

138
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,985
Owen.

139
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:40,789
Nancy and I had a conversation
about withdrawal of care.

140
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,540
I did not bring it up. She did.

141
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,038
She wanted to know what the
chances are after nine days...

142
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,495
It is way too soon to
talk about pulling the plug.

143
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:48,780
And I told her

144
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,794
since he's gone eight
days without improvement,

145
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,129
the neurological deficits
are more likely permanent.

146
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,502
Of course you did.

147
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,937
I wasn't gonna lie, Owen.

148
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:57,483
She doesn't want to put
her son through any more,

149
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,347
or her... It's too soon.

150
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,264
Get another head CT, a
CBC, and a chem panel.

151
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,593
We just drew blood this morning.

152
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,367
I know. Do it again.

153
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,438
Oh, hey. Hey. Hey.

154
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,412
Can I ask you something?

155
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,297
Yeah.

156
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,511
When you and Derek adopted Zola,

157
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,646
how did you know?

158
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,780
I mean, how did you really know

159
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,549
that that was something
you were gonna do?

160
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:30,617
Why? Are you thinking...

161
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah, forget it. Just forget it.

162
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,244
Clear the hallways for cots.
People will come looking for shelter.

163
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,512
How bad is this supposed to be?

164
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,846
Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst, right?

165
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,714
What do we got? 39-Year-old
construction worker.

166
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,933
Wind blew him off a building.

167
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,317
Fell four stories
to impale himself

168
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,691
on three bars of standing rebar.

169
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,688
Vitals are stable. Minimal
blood loss on the scene.

170
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,306
Maintaining airway.
Okay. Let's go.

171
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,530
Let his name be Bob.
Please let his name be Bob.

172
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,665
Why?

173
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,215
Shishka-bob.

174
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,383
My name's Leon.

175
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,369
The patient's awake
and responsive.

176
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,289
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

177
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,958
It's bad, huh? This is
really bad? Am I gonna die?

178
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,554
The fact that we're
talking right now, Leon,

179
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:09,822
means it's not as
bad as it could be.

180
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,945
I guess so.

181
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,797
If these bars hadn't caught me,

182
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,611
I'd be a stain on the
pavement right now.

183
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,201
That's the attitude, Leon.
Just keep that up, okay?

184
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,248
Let's get him to the OR.
And we'll take x-rays there.

185
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,806
Page Grey and Torres.

186
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,006
Kepner, Kepner.

187
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,252
What? I'll take this.

188
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,643
Why? Why? I caught it.

189
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,244
It's a big case,
and I need you on...

190
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,646
Yes, it is a big case.
It's my big case.

191
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,627
Hey, I am about to take
my oral boards again,

192
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,194
and this is exactly
the kind of case

193
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,730
that I want them to
see that I can handle

194
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,531
because I am going
to crush them this year.

195
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,855
I need you on storm prep.

196
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,200
And you once told
me that I should

197
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,159
stop being an administrator
and start being a surgeon.

198
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,289
And that's my human shish kebab.

199
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,879
Okay. All right. I hear you.

200
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,831
Go. Thank you.

201
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,078
Now I will check in on you. If
things get hairy, I'm tagging you out.

202
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,351
You won't have to!

203
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,586
<i>Nurse Cano to ER.</i>

204
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,289
<i>Nurse Sandy Cano to ER.</i>

205
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:56,958
What happened?

206
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,655
What does it look like?
Brooks, what do you see?

207
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,079
Like, someone
super messed him up.

208
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,462
Talk like a doctor.

209
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,499
Um, temporal bone fracture
with an epidural hemorrhage.

210
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,968
How soon does the bleed
need to be evacuated?

211
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,269
Like, yesterday.

212
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:11,189
Yeah, book an OR.
Let's get him up there.

213
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,270
Karev, what the hell
happened? Who did this?

214
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,626
Make sure he doesn't die.

215
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,713
You can't let him die, okay?

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,891
This one's sitting
right next to the carotid,

217
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,526
but it doesn't seem
to have damaged it.

218
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,334
This one's in the
right upper quadrant.

219
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,768
And according to the ultrasound,

220
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,136
it might have missed the liver.

221
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,432
The ultrasound
on this one showed

222
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,267
the femoral artery
is intact, for now.

223
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,602
These bars are rough metal.

224
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,504
When we take them out,
we risk shredding the vessels.

225
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,227
He could bleed out.

226
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,195
Doctors, he's starting
to lose his airway.

227
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,631
I need to intubate.

228
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,677
Okay, I want to cut
down the protruding bars

229
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,995
as close as possible to minimize

230
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,263
the damage when
we pull them out.

231
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,004
Bone cutter? Maybe.

232
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,006
Doubtful.

233
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,624
Nope.

234
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,925
1/2-inch rebar.

235
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,327
You're gonna want a
4-1/2-inch angle grinder

236
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,928
with a cutoff wheel.

237
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:10,348
Thank you, Leon. No worries.

238
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,584
Okay, run. Do not walk.

239
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,455
Chest Peckwell?
Jo's Chest Peckwell?

240
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,757
Karev brought
him in beat to hell.

241
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,936
He has a brain bleed.

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,992
Karev brought him in?

243
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,689
Yeah. I think that he's...

244
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,216
Hey! Hey!

245
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:32,070
Do you have a 4-1/2-inch
angle grinder with a cutoff wheel?

246
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,316
Dr. Bailey, I'm
thrilled that you're back

247
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,252
and honored that
you requested me.

248
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,854
I'm very excited
to be in your OR.

249
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,444
So what are we doing?

250
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,179
Press "print,"
go to the printer,

251
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,449
take the chart,
collate it, repeat.

252
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,417
We're doing this, then?

253
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,302
You need me to go over it again?

254
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,690
But Bailey tested
negative for staph.

255
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,059
And she knows that,
but she doesn't feel it.

256
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,955
- This way. This way.
- Murphy. Murphy.

257
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,623
Where are you going with that?

258
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,358
OR one. Kepner
needs to cut the excess

259
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,022
rebar off of shiska-bob... Leon.

260
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,618
All right. Come on.

261
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,564
Hey!

262
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,339
Where were we? Oh, yeah, Bailey.

263
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,092
Right. Yeah, I just
think that she needs to...

264
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,106
Um, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

265
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,579
Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,494
Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!

267
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,712
Shut it off! Shut it off!

268
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,514
You can't grind metal.
The room is full of oxygen.

269
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,766
The grinder's gonna give off
sparks. You'll blow up the room.

270
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,905
Oh, God. Okay.

271
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,085
Yeah, good call.

272
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,726
I've been through
something like this before.

273
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,010
And how'd that work out?

274
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,412
Not great.

275
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,384
Oh, you're early.

276
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:37,518
So are you.

277
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,115
Well, I kind of like
to oversee the prep.

278
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,488
Me, too.

279
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,768
Feel free to join me, 'cause
clearly, you're a control freak.

280
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,069
Well, nothing wrong with that,

281
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,453
since clearly,
you're a bigger one.

282
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,696
It's exhausting,
isn't it? God, yes.

283
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,943
I'm surprised you're letting
me do any of the reconstruction.

284
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,578
I figure, the more people
know how to do this,

285
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,847
the safer for kids everywhere.

286
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,783
It's kind of my way of
controlling the world.

287
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,767
And this way, you have
something to remember me by.

288
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,303
Well, every time I
tuck a baby's brain

289
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,454
back into his
skull, I will think...

290
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,088
You are gonna think of me.

291
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,841
That's the idea.

292
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:07,381
Here we go, right?

293
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,918
Here we go.

294
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,598
The metal's laying
on two major vessels.

295
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,700
They'll shred if we try and
pull the entire bar through.

296
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,736
You're right. But I'm damned
if I know how to do it, though.

297
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,692
Can we take out
the oxygen tanks?

298
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,740
Well, the tanks, yes, but
there are O2 outputs in the floor,

299
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,196
there and there.

300
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,710
I say we take him down to
a patient room, do it there.

301
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,268
He's already under anesthesia,
and he's too unstable to move.

302
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,647
All right, all right.
How about this?

303
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,249
Get all additional
oxygen tanks out.

304
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,924
I manually hyperventilate
him, get him on 100% O2,

305
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,842
and then I shut off
the vent. You cut.

306
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,861
When he runs
out of air, you stop,

307
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,095
I hyperventilate him again.

308
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,531
That'll take forever.

309
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,959
And it's still risky, but...

310
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,783
It's our best shot.

311
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,664
All right. Just give me the
grinder, and you can go.

312
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,198
All right, Knox, you
can go, too. I got this.

313
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,200
This is dangerous work,
people. So everybody out.

314
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:51,070
I'll stay. You'll need someone to
hold the bar steady while you cut.

315
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,038
And you'll need me
to irrigate the metal.

316
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,207
The grinder will heat up and
could burn through the vessels.

317
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,599
That's... Very good thinking.

318
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,066
There may be liver damage.

319
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,801
No, Grey, not you. You go.

320
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,454
Because I'm pregnant?

321
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,805
She has a kid.

322
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,102
She didn't bring hers
to the OR with her today.

323
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,326
He's got a point,
Grey. You should go.

324
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,778
Grey. Go. That's an order.

325
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,150
Okay, let's gown up and
wet down these drapes.

326
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:17,985
Hey, what's going on?

327
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,554
Why am I being
kicked out of my OR?

328
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,917
Owen Hunt just kicked me
out of my OR for being pregnant.

329
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,419
He what? MAN: Excuse us.

330
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,804
Well, there was a chance
that it could explode,

331
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,789
and it is incredibly dangerous.

332
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,646
Oh, well, I'm on
board with that, then.

333
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,282
Check with Karev. He brought
in a friend with a brain bleed.

334
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,867
Guy was beaten half to
death. Jason Myers from OB.

335
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,721
It's not his friend.

336
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,218
These are today's scans?

337
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,603
With smaller cuts,
like you asked.

338
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,704
Wait.

339
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,010
What is that?

340
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,279
We have a problem.

341
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,825
Mer, check out
this hyperdensity.

342
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,693
Is that something or
just noise on the film?

343
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,251
That looks real
to me. It's Alex.

344
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,117
Get a CT angio and find me.

345
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,034
I want to look at
those vessels. Okay.

346
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,736
All right. I'll
hyperventilate him.

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,894
When we get to 100%,
I'll say go, you cut.

348
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,575
We watch his sats drop to 90%.

349
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,243
Below 90%, there
could be tissue damage,

350
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,362
even brain damage, so at 90%,

351
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,519
I'll say stop and I'll
pump him up again.

352
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,449
You ready? APRIL
AND CALLIE: Ready.

353
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,906
And if anybody sees any sparks,

354
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:14,058
then run like hell, understood?

355
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,967
Yeah. Okay.

356
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:21,715
Go.

357
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:28,122
Oh, my God. Sparks!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

358
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,124
Everybody okay?
Everybody all right?

359
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,293
Torres?

360
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:35,062
Fine. Yep. Let's do this.

361
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,543
Okay, Kepner, if you're someone
who still prays, then maybe...

362
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,977
Dear Lord, please
be with us right now.

363
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,913
Help us save this
man, help us save Leon.

364
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:43,788
In your name, we
pray. Amen. And... Go.

365
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,597
Let's move to the abdomen.

366
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,625
Okay. All right.

367
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,519
All right. Go.

368
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,405
Oh, sparks!

369
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,474
Sparks!

370
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,708
Oh, my...

371
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,621
Ben, look! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

372
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,365
No, we're good. We're
good. We're good. Go. Go, go.

373
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,588
Oh, damn it. The CSF is leaking.

374
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,022
This is worse than I thought.

375
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,024
The crack has torn the dura.

376
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,342
It's pretty grody.

377
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,654
"Grody" is not a thing we say.

378
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,312
List the possible complications.

379
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,915
Um, death, that's pretty solid.

380
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,228
Strokes, re-clots,
being a potato,

381
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,403
goofiness, loopiness,
simpletonism.

382
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,537
Brooks.

383
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:38,125
Difficulty with speech,
memory, and vision.

384
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:39,672
Why are you making
me talk so much today?

385
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:41,629
Because you're
weird, and it bugs me.

386
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,647
But you also have a
natural talent for this.

387
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,351
And the weirdness is there
because you're covering up

388
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,819
a real lack of confidence
in your natural talent.

389
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,889
So now it is my job to
make you feel confident

390
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,991
and less weird. Okay?

391
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,437
Whatever twists your knickers.

392
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,230
I said fight the guy. I
didn't mean fight the guy.

393
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,631
Alex, this kind
of stuff was okay

394
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,999
when we first met you, but now?

395
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,846
Now you're supposed
to be less stupid.

396
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,948
I mean, you could go to
jail, your whole career...

397
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,205
Look, I'm not going to jail.

398
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,552
He was like that
when I found him.

399
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,587
That's your story? No
cop is gonna believe you.

400
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,427
Alex, it's us. Just tell us.

401
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,545
I didn't do anything.

402
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,646
He didn't do it.

403
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,947
He just found him.

404
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,667
I did it.

405
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,737
93.92.91.

406
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,184
Oh, God. This
is taking too long.

407
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,552
We've have to get
into the abdomen.

408
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:27,908
90. Hunt.

409
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,422
Almost there.

410
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,446
Almost there.

411
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,451
Go!

412
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:39,364
Stop! No! No!
No! Can't turn it on!

413
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:40,766
Don't turn it on! Cover
the body! Cover the body!

414
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,207
Fire! 88. He's getting hypoxic.

415
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,659
I got this.

416
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,679
Okay, okay. Okay, go.

417
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,064
God, good catch, Kepner.

418
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,433
Okay, all the bars are cut.
Let's see what we've got.

419
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,602
Torres, you go scrub.

420
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,070
Kepner, go back to the ER.

421
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,218
What?

422
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,823
I need you prepping
for the storm.

423
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,011
No, no, no, no. You
need another surgeon

424
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,871
for when we pull the
rod out of his abdomen.

425
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,746
Right, we're gonna be working
on his neck so we have some time.

426
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,665
Send in Grey or
whoever's available.

427
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,378
<i>Kepner.</i>

428
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,118
<i>I've got it. I'll find someone.</i>

429
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,703
Chief, he is my patient.

430
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,517
I have made every single
right call since he came in here.

431
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,936
And what, you want me to stock
shelves like some grocery clerk?

432
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,327
I need you there more
than I need you here.

433
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,230
Kepner, I'm not gonna
ask you again. Go now!

434
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,106
Nice.

435
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:35,543
I'm gonna mark where I'm
making my cuts, Arizona.

436
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:38,579
Then you will mark a
2x3-centimenter piece

437
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,565
of the parietal for the graft.

438
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,468
Dr. Avery, Dr. Robbins is
gonna do the calvarial graft,

439
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,236
and then I thought
I would walk you

440
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,788
through the reconstruction
of the nose and the lip.

441
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,190
Oh, I'm fine to watch
the master at work today.

442
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,637
Come on, Boswell. It sounds like

443
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,971
you're trying to get
us to do all the work.

444
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,296
Sounds to me like
Avery is chicken.

445
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,332
Not what I said. You
came out all this way.

446
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,952
Well, he can run a hospital,
but he's still a baby surgeon.

447
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,737
You're one of the
Grey-Sloan seven?

448
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,046
Is that a thing?

449
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,307
Yes, that's a thing.

450
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,658
You guys are legend.

451
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,610
You bought the
hospital, saved the staff.

452
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,374
Well, you know us control
freaks. We try to run everything.

453
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,733
It was brave. I
couldn't have done it.

454
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,235
And I'm so impressed.

455
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:21,822
And you, sir, are doing
this reconstruction, okay?

456
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,657
Okay. Okay.

457
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,143
Arizona, are you ready
to mark your graft?

458
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,512
Yeah. Yeah, let me in.

459
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,599
All right. Come right
over here next to me.

460
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:35,302
Here, go through these again
and just make sure they're in order.

461
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:37,616
Dr. Bailey, is there a reason
you chose me to do this?

462
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,956
Because you're an intern.

463
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,037
A surgical intern, at a
hospital, not a Kinko's.

464
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,915
Just... Since Dr. Shepherd
kicked me off his service,

465
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,961
I worry that everyone
thinks I'm a losing bet.

466
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,413
And if that's what
people think...

467
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,071
Do you want to be responsible
for killing a patient, Ross?

468
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,573
If the power goes out

469
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,275
and we lose access to
a patient's electronic files

470
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,862
and we reach for her chart
in this pile and it's not there,

471
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,196
what will happen?

472
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,776
Well, that's pretty
hypothetical...

473
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,368
The patient would die, Ross,
and it would be your fault.

474
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:08,980
And how would you feel? I...

475
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,737
How would you feel?

476
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,107
Bailey.

477
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,493
Hunt needs another hand in
the OR, asked for you to scrub in.

478
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,313
Tell him I can't. Storm's
coming. This needs to get done.

479
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,597
Bailey.

480
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,499
I'm in the middle of
the backup charts.

481
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,686
If I stop, I'll lose the order.
He needs to get someone else.

482
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,104
I'll go.

483
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,573
I'll do it myself.

484
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,662
Of course you will.

485
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,432
We were having a fight.
He grabbed my arm.

486
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,284
I fought him off.
It just, it got ugly.

487
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,753
He fell backwards and he
hit his head on the fireplace,

488
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,840
but he was still yelling when
I left. He was fine. I swear.

489
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,240
All right, you gotta go. Go.

490
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,154
No, she has to explain
to them what happened.

491
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,712
No, nobody does anything
until we see how Peckwell is.

492
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,897
Look, go home. Don't
let anyone see you.

493
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,561
You two don't say
a word to anybody

494
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,179
until we know exactly
what's going on.

495
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,552
Understand?

496
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,156
Hey.

497
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,625
Are you okay? She's okay.

498
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,660
You never saw her. What?

499
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,363
I have Paul Dawson's
CT angio results. Great.

500
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,216
Go.

501
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,521
Don't do anything stupid.

502
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,579
Oh, is that Chest
Peckwell? How is he?

503
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,610
Oh, a bad bleed. We won't
know more until he wakes.

504
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,745
What the hell happened?

505
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,602
I don't know. I need your help.

506
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,081
People keep saying
that to me today.

507
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,790
I found that on
Paul Dawson's scan.

508
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,491
Could that be a
clot that we missed?

509
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

510
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,423
It's blocking blood
flow to the basilar artery.

511
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,363
Brooks...

512
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,510
Why would we miss that?
Oh, I'm not asking her.

513
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,078
Yeah, she's... She's asking you.

514
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,385
And I'm asking you.

515
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,990
Because it's a thrombus...

516
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,491
Which is harder to see.

517
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,638
It's more common to
find a bleed or an infarct.

518
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,706
You were looking
for the wrong thing.

519
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,746
Nice job.

520
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,600
Could you take it out, like now?

521
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,736
Run a pipeline stent and restore
the blood flow to the basilar?

522
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,032
I mean, could that wake him up?

523
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,188
It could.

524
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,824
It could also kill him.

525
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,670
Does the family
want to take that risk?

526
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:14,094
But you said that yesterday,

527
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,664
you said it was our last chance.

528
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:19,316
This is... A long shot.

529
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,187
Well, what does Dr. Hunt say?

530
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,239
Dr. Hunt is in surgery,
and Paul is my patient.

531
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,508
And it's your decision.

532
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,963
Nancy, every second counts now.

533
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,449
Well, if there's
a chance that...

534
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,034
Okay. Okay.

535
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,769
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

536
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,988
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

537
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:44,959
Wocka, wocka, wocka, wocka,
wocka, wocka, wocka, wocka...

538
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:46,426
What are you doing?

539
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,662
Sorry. It's Pac-Man.

540
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,096
Because it looks like Pac-Man.

541
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,325
Now what do we
need to watch out for?

542
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,485
Dislodging the clot.

543
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,420
Jamming the stent, or...

544
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,083
Oh, damn it.

545
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:00,452
The basilar wall is
dissecting. It's just too weak.

546
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,520
If you don't place the
stent, it could rupture, right?

547
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:03,989
Yeah. If we place it too fast...

548
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,474
You risk ripping
the artery in half.

549
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,348
Either way, he's... He's dead.

550
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,811
Good. Yeah. Just be quiet.

551
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,519
<i>Dr. Kent to neonatal ICU.</i>

552
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,355
<i>Dr. Kent to neonatal ICU.</i>

553
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:16,773
Hey, Wilson.

554
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,353
I'm going, I swear. I just
had to grab some clothes.

555
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,721
Look...

556
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,505
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to hurt Jason.

557
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:25,683
I was just trying to get away
from him. And I lost it. I just lost it.

558
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,001
I like you.

559
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,837
But I love Alex.

560
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,638
I don't know if he's dumb enough

561
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,406
or loyal enough to
take the fall for you,

562
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,475
but he just might be.

563
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,963
I'd never let him
do that. I wouldn't.

564
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,398
Okay.

565
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,986
Hey.

566
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,599
Are they done
with that in the OR?

567
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,623
Yeah, they were
done a while ago.

568
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,436
Then why aren't I back up there?

569
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,127
I don't know.

570
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,890
Help. Help me.

571
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,877
Okay. Okay.

572
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:11,378
Okay.

573
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,936
Dissecting is stopped.
Stent is in place. Good.

574
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,204
Any leaks?

575
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,474
I'm not sure.

576
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,743
Yes or no, Brooks. Confidence.

577
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,362
No, sir. No leaks. Good.

578
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,626
Dr. Shepherd, you have a
message. Yeah, not now.

579
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,866
It's from Dr. Grey.

580
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,436
She took a fall on the
stairs. She says she's okay,

581
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,149
but she's going to
OB to get checked.

582
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,220
I can finish. You should go.

583
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:42,621
No, you can't. You're done.

584
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,612
Hard part's over. I'll
just retract the sheath,

585
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,214
hold pressure on the
femoral arteriotomy,

586
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,865
done.

587
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,300
I can do it. Go.

588
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,586
Okay. Here.

589
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,734
What?

590
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:57,257
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no.

591
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,575
No, Mousey.

592
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,921
Mousey, no.

593
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,065
No, don't touch her. Mousey, no!

594
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,224
Bailey just said no?

595
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,448
Mm-hmm.

596
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,566
Might be 'cause it
was me who asked her.

597
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,152
No, I'm telling you, she's
just a little shaken up.

598
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,721
She needs a break.

599
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,751
You know, Cristina went
through something similar,

600
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,257
so I get it.

601
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,704
How about you pull out the bar,

602
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,838
and I'll jump in and
catch the bleeders?

603
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,523
Got it. Torres, a hand here.

604
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:19,624
Hmm? Yep.

605
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,697
Okay.

606
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,327
You know it was the
same with Arizona.

607
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:23,818
You can't rush her back to work.

608
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:26,419
That might be true. For them.

609
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,306
Forgive me, Ben, but
with someone like Bailey...

610
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,092
Sometimes you just need
to rip off the Band-Aid.

611
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,379
Here we go.

612
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,814
Okay. Let's go. Yeah. Gotcha.

613
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,705
That is a handsome face.

614
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:47,241
Mm. Very handsome.

615
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:48,970
I couldn't have done
it any better myself.

616
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,627
Well, I wouldn't
have done it at all.

617
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,830
Thank you. This was incredible.

618
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,609
Oh, it was my pleasure.

619
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,517
Now my downfall as a surgeon

620
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:59,703
is a very tiny bladder,
so you guys have this.

621
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,053
I'll see you in just a second.

622
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:06,109
She is just one of
those people, isn't she?

623
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,906
What? What do you
mean? One of those people

624
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,041
that just make you feel like
you're capable of anything.

625
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,498
Sloan was like that.

626
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,127
He just sort of took for
granted that you were great...

627
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,712
So that you'd be great.

628
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,431
I wish she could stick
around a little longer.

629
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,056
I just, I have not felt
like this in a long time.

630
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,558
Yeah.

631
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,496
The baby's fine.

632
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,997
Define "fine."

633
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,477
And feel free to
talk like a doctor.

634
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,502
Fine means zero sign
of placental abruption

635
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,336
or any injury to the fetus.

636
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,238
No bleeding, no uterine rupture.

637
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,675
His heartbeat's
great. No distress.

638
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,593
Everything is
where it should be.

639
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,296
You are incredibly lucky.

640
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,508
Are you in any pain?

641
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,283
No. Just, just sore.

642
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,819
If you start to feel any pain
at all, you know where I am.

643
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,015
Thank you, Connie.

644
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,017
See, I told you, you
need to slow down.

645
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,074
You know how we
could have avoided this?

646
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:57,811
If I'd been safely in that exploding
OR, where I should have been.

647
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,463
Put your pants on.

648
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,901
Hey.

649
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,938
I just closed a midline
facial cleft. Primary surgeon.

650
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,339
What is wrong?

651
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,374
I don't know.

652
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,311
Hunt is actively keeping
me from surgeries.

653
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,741
I don't know if he thinks that
I'm gonna fail my boards again,

654
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,143
or maybe he's
just finally realized

655
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,778
that I'd make a better
secretary than a surgeon.

656
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:22,118
So I'll talk to him. No.

657
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,282
Don't. Don't. I don't, I don't
want you to fight for me.

658
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,356
Dr. Kepner, trauma's coming in.

659
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,652
Great.

660
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,604
Something else I
can get kicked off of.

661
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,561
Did they run a CBC
and a KB stain?

662
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,797
Yes, they ran all the
tests. The baby is fine.

663
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,543
Yeah, well, what about
you? I mean, why did you fall?

664
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,900
Are you dizzy?

665
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,969
I fell because I have
the same center of gravity

666
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,805
as a Jersey cow. I'm fine, guys.

667
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,558
Doctors, it's time.
It's happening.

668
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,804
Come on.

669
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:46,955
Come on. Hurry.
Before it starts.

670
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,295
What do we got?

671
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,592
A 48-year-old male complaining
of tightness in his chest.

672
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,377
He says he feels like
his heart is gonna burst.

673
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,841
All right, sir, we're gonna
take care of you, okay?

674
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,538
Is he seizing?

675
00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,406
Was there a head
injury involved?

676
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,925
Uh, what is that music?

677
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,594
Uh, sir, no.

678
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,147
You probably don't wanna
get off of that if you don't...

679
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,681
Nicole, what are you doing?

680
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,420
What is... What are you doing?

681
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:18,475
Nikki? What are you...

682
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,794
What are you doing?

683
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:22,596
Oh, hi.

684
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,315
Scott? Wait? What?

685
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,768
What is going on?

686
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,187
Melissa!

687
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,589
I'm...

688
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,161
Oh, Matthew!

689
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:41,381
Oh, my God!

690
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,653
They're everywhere.

691
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,005
Oh, God! It's so high!

692
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,596
Oh, sorry.

693
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:58,493
Who'd have thought Kepner
would've found somebody

694
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,967
as dorky as she is?

695
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,654
He is like the male
Kepner. What are the odds?

696
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,586
Whoo-hoo!

697
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:25,225
All right, April!

698
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:26,693
Oh, my God.

699
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:30,063
Uh, April, I know that
this seems crazy...

700
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:32,599
This is totally crazy. What?

701
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,869
And to some, sudden.

702
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:39,823
But when I know
something, I know it.

703
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,375
When I first saw you
standing in this doorway...

704
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,446
I felt a shock.

705
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,932
And I thought...

706
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,786
This is the most beautiful
person that I've ever seen.

707
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:56,156
And then I thought...

708
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,077
Yeah, well, no, I knew...

709
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,746
That I was gonna
fall in love with you.

710
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,430
Oh, God.

711
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:06,065
And I have never been so happy

712
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:07,667
knowing anything
in my entire life.

713
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:08,886
Oh, my...

714
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,756
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

715
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:18,828
April Kepner...

716
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,141
Wow.

717
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,465
I love you,

718
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,878
and I want to spend
the rest of my life

719
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,742
trying to make you as
happy as you make me...

720
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:25,897
Oh, my God.

721
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,987
If you'll let me.

722
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,625
Will you marry me?

723
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,461
Yes. Yes.

724
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,230
Whoo!

725
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,085
It was beautiful!

726
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,087
Way to go, Matthew!

727
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,289
Many happy years!

728
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,375
All right, Matthew!

729
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,396
How does Kepner get
that? How does that happen?

730
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:13,567
And I get crazy, I get cancer, and
now I got a psychopathic maniac.

731
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:15,802
Screw it. I give up.
I'm walking away.

732
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,117
Alex, what were you gonna do if
you got to Peckwell's house first?

733
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,785
Were you gonna have
coffee and talk it out?

734
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,554
I mean, tell me he wouldn't
have been worse off

735
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,922
had you gotten there first.

736
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,497
People change, but
they don't change.

737
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,283
Maybe Jo's crazy
fits your crazy.

738
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,463
Don't give up on her just yet.

739
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,104
We didn't give up on you.

740
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,375
Chest Peckwell is awake.

741
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,894
How is he?

742
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,629
He's fine.

743
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,614
But he's... He's
asking for the police.

744
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,323
I thought this storm
was coming in three days.

745
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,602
You know weather guys.

746
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,937
They're wrong most of the time,

747
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,961
and they still keep their jobs.

748
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,530
How do you feel, honestly?

749
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,833
Honestly?

750
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,061
I'd feel better if the
wall hadn't dissected.

751
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,215
I'm afraid it's done
more harm than good.

752
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,440
Derek.

753
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,642
How did I miss this clot?

754
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,562
You didn't, or it'd
still be in there.

755
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,790
You've done everything you can.

756
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:20,421
Then why isn't he awake?

757
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:33,525
He looks beautiful.

758
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:37,016
Yeah, and when he's 6 feet
tall and has a full head of hair,

759
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,763
all of this is gonna
recede to just

760
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:40,448
a tiny, little scar
on his forehead.

761
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,712
The girls are gonna love it.
It'll give him some mystery.

762
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,025
Thank you... So much.

763
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:50,363
Amazing.

764
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,065
This was an amazing day.

765
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:54,445
Well, you guys did most of the
work. I'm happy I just got to watch.

766
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,171
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can...

767
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,641
You can show me
to an on-call room.

768
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,408
Um... Why?

769
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:05,345
First night post-op, I like to stay
close by in case anything happens.

770
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,814
Oh, wow, you poor,
poor control freak.

771
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,366
Oh, you really get me.

772
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,250
Yeah. I really do.

773
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,870
This way.

774
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,546
Hey, Jason.

775
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,416
Cops here yet?

776
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,363
Let's talk for a second.

777
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,854
She attacked me, all
right? Jo's a lunatic.

778
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,534
She's disturbed,
and she's a liar.

779
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,492
Listen...

780
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,644
You got a good thing here.

781
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,812
Good job.

782
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,281
Nice place.

783
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,384
You have friends here?

784
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,019
Oh, you wanna be my friend now?

785
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:50,324
Me? Nah. I got enough friends.

786
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,759
Cristina Yang, she's my friend.

787
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,378
She owns the hospital.

788
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,947
Derek Shepherd.
Owns the hospital.

789
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,995
Meredith Grey, her
name's on the friggin' door.

790
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,270
And these are my friends.

791
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,173
And they don't like a
guy who hits his girlfriend.

792
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:07,557
Neither do I.

793
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,592
She attacked me.

794
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,161
What was I supposed to do?

795
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,097
You're supposed to
take it. A girl hits you,

796
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,100
you take it, or you walk away.

797
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,702
It's the story of my life.

798
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,272
Jason, you can tell this
story till you're blue in the face,

799
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,110
but all people are gonna
hear is that you hit her.

800
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:29,996
And that little bit,

801
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:32,377
it's gonna follow you
around the halls here.

802
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:33,916
And if you leave,

803
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,514
it'll get wherever you're
going before you do.

804
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,372
Oh, you'll make
sure of that, huh?

805
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:41,151
It sounds like you're
blackmailing me.

806
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,371
It sounds like you're
a guy who hits girls,

807
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,629
'cause you did.

808
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,858
So what do you wanna do next?

809
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,306
What'd he say?

810
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,552
What, you heard that?

811
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,759
I did.

812
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,673
You think it's okay to
blackmail people, Karev?

813
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,224
I wasn't. It was just a threat.

814
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,715
You're threatening him?
What are you thinking?

815
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,579
A bunch of people got hurt here.

816
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:08,946
I didn't see the
point in any more.

817
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,248
I mean, the guy's
not pressing charges.

818
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:11,838
Oh, so it all works out.

819
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,373
You feel good about that?

820
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:16,225
Because you shouldn't.

821
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,967
<i>Dr. Michael
Lamott to pediatrics.</i>

822
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:26,235
Bailey, when the
chief of surgery

823
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,437
orders you to scrub
in on a surgery,

824
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,434
you scrub in on that surgery.

825
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,359
The last I heard, you're not
chief of surgery or my boss.

826
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,707
But I am part owner
of this hospital,

827
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:37,975
which does, in fact,
make me your boss.

828
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,667
And you're not a file clerk.
We have enough file clerks.

829
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:42,002
But we need surgeons.

830
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,637
So either be a surgeon,
or get the hell out.

831
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,189
'Cause we don't need you.

832
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,942
The rebar.

833
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,903
Thank you very much.

834
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,607
He looks great. He is.

835
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,087
Broken leg, minor
internal injuries.

836
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:09,879
After all that, it turned out
to be kind of a nothing case.

837
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,527
You had absolutely no right
to kick me out of that OR today.

838
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,384
Grey, you weren't necessary...

839
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,886
You did it because I'm pregnant

840
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,666
and because you were
trying to protect me.

841
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,106
Yes. And?

842
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:22,415
I just want you to know it's
completely unacceptable.

843
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,378
And thank you.

844
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:27,264
Noted.

845
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,926
You asked me about Zola today.

846
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,519
We just knew. You know,
Derek knew first, of course,

847
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,921
because he's Derek, and
it took me a little longer

848
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,674
because I was scared.

849
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,092
One day, I just picked her up,

850
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,294
and I just knew.

851
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:45,297
I don't know how
else to explain it.

852
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:49,168
I looked at her, and
she was my daughter.

853
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,704
I just knew.

854
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:54,373
You know, this kid,
he needs someone,

855
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:56,293
and I like him,

856
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,328
and he likes me.

857
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,546
He's scared and alone and...

858
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,149
And I could help.

859
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,151
I know how to
help, and I want to.

860
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,656
And then I talk myself out
of it because he's not my kid.

861
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:12,993
He's 10. It's...

862
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:16,830
It's a huge commitment.
It's a lifetime of responsibility.

863
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,549
And it pretty much
uproots everything.

864
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,752
But then I spend one
minute with this kid,

865
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:26,423
and... I can't
imagine not doing it.

866
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,345
You're thinking I'm crazy.

867
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:33,646
No.

868
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,767
I'm thinking that's
exactly the way I felt.

869
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,720
Cristina won't get it.

870
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,607
Owen. It's Paul.

871
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,510
You should come.

872
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,548
He's awake. He's fine.

873
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,096
Neuro's good, he's talking.

874
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,020
He's fine.

875
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:06,295
Get him set for
transfer to Seattle Pres.

876
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,592
Well, isn't that a little...

877
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:09,448
I want them out of here ASAP.

878
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,296
The storm's here
sooner than predicted,

879
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,537
and I want them moved
inland before it gets worse.

880
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,081
I've rounded on
your entire service.

881
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,204
Brooks, thanks.

882
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,090
You've stepped up
when I needed it today.

883
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,175
I'm proud of you.

884
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,243
Thank you, sir.

885
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:38,962
Give it up.

886
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,397
Slamma-jamma.

887
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,931
Stay weird, Brooks.

888
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:44,265
<i>Engineering,
report to admitting.</i>

889
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:45,885
<i>Engineering to admitting.</i>

890
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,704
With me, Ross.

891
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,188
God, there's more?

892
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,561
You can stack 'em
against the walls.

893
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,295
Not too tall!

894
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:58,665
Hey. Never saw it coming, right?

895
00:36:58,733 --> 00:36:59,811
What's that, the storm?

896
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:01,117
No. April.

897
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,764
I was sure someone
would let it slip.

898
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:05,021
And have you seen Dr. Hunt?

899
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,810
No, no. What's
up? Nothing. I'd...

900
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,119
Would you tell him
thanks, though?

901
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,854
I had him keep April
out of surgeries all day.

902
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:11,644
This was kind of
my only shot at this.

903
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:12,946
Didn't wanna miss it.

904
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:14,647
No, no, you didn't.

905
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:16,661
Congratulations,
both of you guys.

906
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:17,833
Thanks.

907
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,931
Still awake? Yes, ma'am.

908
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,515
Owen's transferring Paul Dawson

909
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,617
and his kid over
to Seattle Pres.

910
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:43,309
How's Owen?

911
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,378
I don't know.

912
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,792
You know, I woke the guy up.
That's all he's been wanting to do,

913
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:50,750
but now he just seems
more disappointed with me,

914
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:54,537
and I know he's
got close to the kid.

915
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:58,341
You know, Owen was talking
about taking the kid himself.

916
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,876
Taking him?

917
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,512
What, like adopting him?

918
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,064
Or fostering.

919
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:08,034
He asked me about it.
He seemed ready to do it.

920
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,613
Okay, what am I
supposed to do with that?

921
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:10,781
Like, what am I supposed to do?

922
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:14,073
I don't think there's
anything you can do.

923
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,542
I don't think it's about you.

924
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,898
Thank you.

925
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:30,652
You guys have backup
generators, right?

926
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,125
Yeah, of course we do.

927
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,561
This really has
been a lot of fun.

928
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:44,437
Sort of sorry...

929
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:45,905
Me, too. I'm sorry it's over.

930
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:47,873
Yeah.

931
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:50,688
All right, well, then you'll just
have to have me back at some point.

932
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:52,611
That would be really great.

933
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,583
Um...

934
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,706
Well...

935
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,844
Okay.

936
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,646
It was... Okay.

937
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:20,873
Oh, God! I can't.

938
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,458
What? I can't.

939
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,076
<i>We do our very best.</i>

940
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,323
It was a pleasure meeting you.

941
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:26,587
Arizona.

942
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:35,321
You are allowed to
lose a little bit of control.

943
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,741
<i>But sometimes it's
just not good enough.</i>

944
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:53,172
<i>We buckle our seat
belts. We wear a helmet.</i>

945
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,140
<i>We stick to the lighted paths.</i>

946
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,742
What the hell happened?

947
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,155
The power went
out a half-hour...

948
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,263
No, you. What were you thinking?

949
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,365
Peckwell could have died.

950
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,317
Is he... No, he's fine,

951
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:05,997
and you're lucky he's
not pressing charges,

952
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,353
but you are an idiot.

953
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,672
You get that you could
have gone to jail, right?

954
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,674
You say that you
worked so hard to change,

955
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,577
to become this new
person, but then you do this?

956
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:15,956
If you don't wanna
be a lowlife anymore,

957
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,525
you gotta grow up
and stop acting like one.

958
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,565
No, you grow up!

959
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,846
Not everyone's like you, Alex.

960
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:26,456
People are horrible.

961
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,860
And the last time someone
grabbed me like Jason did, I...

962
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,949
I promised no one
would ever do that again.

963
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,486
So I am sorry, but...

964
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:44,723
Not everyone's like
you. Not everyone's good.

965
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,059
<i>We try to be safe.</i>

966
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:53,339
And now you think
I'm horrible, too.

967
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,323
No. No.

968
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,635
If you hadn't
gotten to him first,

969
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,659
I probably would
have killed the guy.

970
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:08,680
Why? Why would
you do that for me?

971
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,767
Shut up. Why wouldn't I?

972
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,570
<i>We try so hard to
protect ourselves,</i>

973
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,139
<i>but it doesn't make a
damn bit of difference.</i>

974
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,000
<i>'Cause when the bad things come,</i>

975
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,202
<i>they come out of nowhere.</i>

976
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,822
The storm is here.

977
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,457
It's totally here.

978
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:37,393
The daycare center said they're
gonna be open for 24 hours,

979
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,095
so I'm keeping Sofia in there.

980
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,742
We're not leaving.
Are you guys leaving?

981
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,165
I don't know.

982
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,267
Where the hell is Arizona?

983
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:47,598
We're gonna stay, right?

984
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,605
Yes, we're gonna stay.

985
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,351
'Cause if we get trapped at the
house, and you go into labor...

986
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,275
No, we're staying because
they need surgeons.

987
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,555
You need to take it easy.

988
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,713
I'm just gonna work until I...

989
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,166
<i>The bad things come
suddenly with no warning.</i>

990
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:02,313
What? Meredith, what
is it? <i>But we forget...</i>

991
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:03,814
You okay? Yeah.

992
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,037
<i>That sometimes...</i>

993
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,390
Yeah. My water just broke.

994
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,558
What? Okay.

995
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,627
Okay.

996
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,912
Okay.

997
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,847
<i>That's how the good
things come, too.</i>

998
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,068
Okay.
