1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,710
<i>Infections are like
sleeping monsters.</i>

2
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,013
<i>You can't see them.</i>

3
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,917
<i>You can't feel them.</i>

4
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,820
<i>But...</i>

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,392
<i>You must do everything
in your power...</i>

6
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,563
<i>To contain them.</i>

7
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,333
<i>Because when the
monsters wake up...</i>

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,870
<i>They're out of control.</i>

9
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,945
Hey. Bailey, you
shouldn't be here.

10
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,852
How is Seth Lepik? The
computer says access restricted.

11
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,155
They won't even let me
check on my own patients.

12
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,856
They swabbed my nose.

13
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,520
They're swabbing
everyone's noses.

14
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:35,727
Well, are they sitting
everybody down for interviews?

15
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,462
'Cause they think I
did something wrong.

16
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,113
Now I think it's the grafts.

17
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,926
I narrowed it down
to... Look, Bailey,

18
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,996
they've isolated the strain
of staph in your patients.

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,865
Now they need to
find out how it spread.

20
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:48,957
- Your job is to cooperate.
- I've got Seth.

21
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,307
Now go answer their questions.

22
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,899
Please.

23
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,294
We are throwing
Bailey under the bus.

24
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,795
Come on. That is
not what we're doing.

25
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,514
Yeah, it seems like that's
exactly what we're doing.

26
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,071
Two of our patients are dead
of the same post-op infection.

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,190
A third one's barely
hanging on. It was time.

28
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,970
We get the CDC In here
and figure this thing out.

29
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,305
By treating Bailey
like a criminal?

30
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,357
She hasn't done anything.
I hope that you're right.

31
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,974
The truth is, we
don't know that yet.

32
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,899
CDC is simply asking us to
temporarily freeze Bailey's files.

33
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,234
Oh, come on.

34
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,680
And that we not discuss
this investigation with her.

35
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,982
So today, just
keep your distance.

36
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,271
That is ridiculous.

37
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,152
Also I think now's the
time to put out a statement.

38
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,792
No, no.

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,589
No. About what? I
mean, we don't even know

40
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,579
if Bailey's the
source of this thing.

41
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,992
If one of ours is at fault and
we just sit on this information,

42
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,660
we look like we're trying
to cover something up.

43
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,978
The only way to
let the public know

44
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,302
that we can be objective
is by being transparent.

45
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,603
Vote?

46
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,083
I'm just saying, people
should learn the news from us.

47
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,284
There's no news. Okay, vote?

48
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,540
There's no news yet. Vote.

49
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,450
All in favor of
no press release.

50
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,263
Okay. No press release.
No statement. Clear?

51
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,349
Oh!

52
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,662
Watch it, members only.

53
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,219
Promise me you'll be nice.

54
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,165
These guys are trying
to take down Bailey.

55
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,401
They don't deserve nice.
No, not to the CDC. To Jason.

56
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,502
I'm nice to Jason.

57
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,259
Two minutes ago, you said,

58
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,072
"Hey, I have a surgery today
with your d-bag boyfriend."

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,891
Yeah, but I said
it with a smile.

60
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,826
Fine. I won't call
the guy a d-bag.

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,628
At least not to
his face, anyway.

62
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,235
I'm moving in with him.

63
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,089
So what do you think?

64
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,702
I think it's great. Really?

65
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,453
No. I think the guy
is a douche bag

66
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,955
who you've known
for about two minutes,

67
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,908
and that makes you an
idiot for moving in with him.

68
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,149
Alex... I'll be nice!

69
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,912
I'm gonna rock this corner kick.

70
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,037
Later, I promise. Right
now I have a surprise for you.

71
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,305
Look who's here.

72
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,607
Grandma!

73
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,791
Oh.

74
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,245
Oh, Ethan. Oh, Ethan. Ethan.

75
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,127
As you can see,

76
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,378
there aren't any residual
effects from the surgery.

77
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,369
So, I can go home?

78
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,583
Well, I'd like to keep an eye
on you for another few days.

79
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,185
Well, we can handle
a few more days.

80
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,441
Right, buddy?

81
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,489
Hey, Grandma, do you want
to see Dad? I can take you.

82
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,863
Oh, uh, is that...

83
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,464
Can he? Sure, sure.

84
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,453
He sees his dad every
day. He chats up a storm.

85
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,736
He told him all about
you coming to visit.

86
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,645
Dad's still unconscious. That's
because his brain is resting.

87
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,251
It's not uncommon after a trauma

88
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,104
for a person not to
wake up right away.

89
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,405
You shouldn't have to know
about these things, Ethan.

90
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,396
Well, he does,
and I think it's cool

91
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,583
that he's trying to help Paul
by learning all about his illness.

92
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,086
And speaking of Paul,
I'd like to see him, too.

93
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,155
If that's all right?

94
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,718
Ethan, do you feel up to pushing
your mom around in a wheelchair?

95
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,509
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,257
All right. Let me
get one for you.

97
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,181
Oh.

98
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,437
Murphy? I'm not supposed
to talk to you about this.

99
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,071
Dr. Bailey.

100
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,907
Come in.

101
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,810
Tell me there is someone
down here that I can help.

102
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,523
It's five against one
with the board today,

103
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,447
and I need a victory.

104
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,794
Bed three. Femur's broken.
I'm sending him up to angio.

105
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,551
Okay. Alert the press.

106
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,003
See what I mean?

107
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,624
You all right?

108
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,758
Matthew dumped me.

109
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,745
Oh.

110
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,664
Because I lied to him about
my virginity like you told me to.

111
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,833
That's not...

112
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,479
I lied because I had
something to lie about.

113
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,683
April, hold on a
second... You took my...

114
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,973
I shouldn't have let you,
but I did, and now he's gone.

115
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,736
I'm not board certified,
I'm not a virgin,

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,122
and everything I care about
has been ruined because of you.

117
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,586
So you know what?
Thank you. Thanks for that.

118
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,485
Six against one.

119
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,521
Help! Yeah, help! We
need some help over here!

120
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,167
Jane, honey, you okay? No!

121
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,491
What happened?

122
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,859
God, I'm gonna pass out.

123
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,729
We lost some
fingers. A lot of fingers.

124
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,947
We had a tug-of-war.

125
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,331
With what, razor wire?

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,083
Even better. Clothesline.

127
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,328
Does anybody have
the severed fingers?

128
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:37,768
Yeah, I got 'em. I got 'em.

129
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,589
Whoa! That's a lot of fingers.

130
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,958
Yeah, I counted six.

131
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,721
No, five. This
one's a turkey dog.

132
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:59,857
I would like you to take
me through each operation.

133
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,304
Well, I mean, if you're
looking for the source,

134
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,527
look at the grafts.

135
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,596
Okay? I used the same
ones on each patient.

136
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,192
This part of our investigation

137
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,261
concerns your interaction
with the infected patients

138
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,252
in the operating room, to
the best of your memory.

139
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:15,156
Well... I'd never used
this brand before.

140
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:18,059
I remember not
recognizing the company.

141
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,028
Dortmund or something.

142
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,030
Dr. Bailey,

143
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,250
we've looked at the
grafts. It's not the grafts.

144
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,435
Uh...

145
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:28,786
May I begin?

146
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,657
Oh, I was expecting a probing.

147
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,976
That's really more
of a gentle swabbing.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,618
Speaking of probing, I've
decided to have the baby naturally,

149
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,326
but I know the second
I start to scream,

150
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,355
Derek is gonna have
them pump me full of drugs,

151
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:50,458
so I'm going to need
you there in my corner.

152
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,160
Yeah. Uh, I'm not gonna do that.

153
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,130
When babies come out,
people poop on the table.

154
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,710
Cristina... Uh, no.

155
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,512
Karev. And can you make it fast?

156
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:02,069
Peckwell's HLHS mom
is gonna be admitted.

157
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,649
We gotta go walk her
through the procedure.

158
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,018
She wants me to
watch her give birth.

159
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,385
You're gonna poop on the table.

160
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:07,608
I am not.

161
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,321
You are. Almost everybody does.

162
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,430
Okay, so I poop on the table.
It's part of the miracle of life.

163
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,798
It's nasty.

164
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,712
Did I ask you to
watch me give birth?

165
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,235
No.

166
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,904
Cristina?

167
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,583
We have been
friends a long time.

168
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,190
You want to know how?

169
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,969
By not watching each other poop.

170
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:25,176
Holla.

171
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,616
Well, the good news is,
these wounds look salvageable.

172
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,201
I wasn't even gonna play,
but my brother Al insisted.

173
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,132
And then we were
losing, and Al was all...

174
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,549
"Wrap your hands
with the rope"...

175
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:40,074
Then I did.

176
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,526
What are you doing?

177
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,595
Uh, I just need to identify
whose fingers are whose.

178
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,309
That looks like a
pretty good match.

179
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,699
Except for the red nail polish.

180
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,628
Yes. That's my sister-in-law's.

181
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:53,187
Jane, good news.
Your manicure's intact.

182
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,741
Hi, Jane. I'm Dr. Avery.

183
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,153
You mind if I take a look here?

184
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,411
How's my daughter, Frances?

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,713
Tony, how's Frankie?

186
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,930
It's bad, honey.

187
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,749
The bone's still sticking out.

188
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,530
This is all Gigantor's fault. What's
he doing at our reunion anyway?

189
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,620
He's not even related.

190
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,216
He's Uncle Tony's weird friend.

191
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,734
I didn't mean to pull so hard.

192
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,302
Lay off Gunnar,
Cash. It's not his fault.

193
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,810
He didn't suggest to play
tug-of-war with a clothesline.

194
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,963
You want to blame
somebody, blame your uncle Al.

195
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:23,100
Okay, Kellers, I'm back and
I'm armed with French fries.

196
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,514
Huh? Any takers?

197
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,987
We can't eat, Al.

198
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,183
We're just about to get
our fingers reattached.

199
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,375
Okay, uh, anybody
cold? I can find blankets.

200
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,994
Stop, Al! Just stop!

201
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:36,180
Nobody's hungry or thirsty
or wants to run a relay race!

202
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,716
Reunion's over.

203
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,562
Okay, Frankie. I'm gonna
need to get some x-rays.

204
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,896
You gonna be okay being
away from your family

205
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,680
for a little while?

206
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,338
Yes, please.

207
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,774
Yeah. Okay.

208
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,255
Dr. Hunt says it's
good to talk to him, too.

209
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:55,883
Hey, babe.

210
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,121
Sorry I haven't been
by to see you, but...

211
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,524
Well, I've been kinda busy
with the brain surgery and all.

212
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,626
Rachel.

213
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,162
Don't. Don't do that.

214
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,548
Don't joke.

215
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,421
I gotta be honest with ya, babe.

216
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,917
You've looked better.

217
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,091
Me? Well...

218
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,228
I haven't looked this
good since that summer

219
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,664
that we went to the river
and I got that stomach bug

220
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,566
and I lost, like, 15 pounds.

221
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,984
You're missing it.

222
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,853
Stop it.

223
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,672
It's not funny.

224
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,609
None of this is funny.

225
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:39,627
My son is dying.

226
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,863
He's not dying.

227
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,983
We are a long way off from that.

228
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,585
I know that this may
look bad, but you...

229
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,765
It should be me.

230
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,321
Hey, Ethie.

231
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,374
Why don't we give Grandma a
little one-on-one time with Pop?

232
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:55,043
You want to take me for a spin?

233
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,659
I think that's a great idea.
Go on. Give her the nickel tour.

234
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,067
All right?

235
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,103
Can I hold him after he's born?

236
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,537
Just for a minute.

237
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,974
Uh, he's gonna need
to go right into surgery.

238
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,376
Your baby has hypoplastic
left heart syndrome

239
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,277
and an intact atrial septum

240
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,241
that is causing a
restriction to blood flow.

241
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,332
He's fine when he's in
utero, but once he's out...

242
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,699
The condition is fatal.

243
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,030
Which means he won't
be getting enough oxygen.

244
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,665
We'll let you hold
him when he's stable,

245
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,638
after his surgery. ALEX: Okay.

246
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,224
So we'll do the C-section,

247
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,660
and then we'll have 60
minutes to get him to the cath lab

248
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,628
and perform the operation
to open his septum.

249
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,742
And if you don't make
it in time, he could die?

250
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,994
No, we can do the
C-section in the cath lab.

251
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,434
It'll give us more time.

252
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,402
Deliver in one room
and operate in the other.

253
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,553
Can you do that?

254
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,889
I don't see why not.

255
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,835
There are about
1,000 reasons why not.

256
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,993
You know, people have
babies all over the place.

257
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,680
Taxi cabs, high
school bathrooms.

258
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,281
If we don't have to waste time

259
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,116
moving the kid from
one floor to another,

260
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,846
why should we? Because you
don't do C-sections in Cath labs.

261
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,104
Oh, Karev, back me
up. I'm with Peckwell.

262
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,400
Not my name, but okay.

263
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,019
This whole
situation is high risk.

264
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,526
If something goes wrong,

265
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,655
we don't have the tools
on hand to deal with it.

266
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,094
Are your tools
glued to the floor?

267
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,546
Bring them with you.

268
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:08,415
Okay, we have an opportunity
here to do something new

269
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,318
and badass.

270
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,169
I mean, don't you
want to be the badass

271
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,005
who delivers the
kid in a cath lab?

272
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,673
Who does that?

273
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,541
Nobody... But you.

274
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:20,795
Okay.

275
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,213
Okay, I'm in.

276
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,415
All right. Karev,
you with Peckwell?

277
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,677
Myers. Dr. Jason Myers.

278
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,418
Nobody cares. Karev?

279
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,355
All right. I'm good.

280
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,657
Sounds like one
nasty tug-of-war.

281
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:36,444
It was the height of idiocy,
which is saying a lot for my family.

282
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,879
I'm a journalist.

283
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,725
I cover the sophomore
beat for my school paper.

284
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,384
And they chose me to edit the
spring supplement this weekend,

285
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,298
but my parents told me I had
to go to this stupid reunion,

286
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:49,068
that it was more important to
pretend not to hate people I hate.

287
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,742
And now my hand is
ruined and my career is over.

288
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,843
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,779
Your hand is
going to be just fine.

290
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,963
I will see to that.

291
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,265
Okay? And...

292
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:00,468
You have lots of time to
worry about your career.

293
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,203
Okay? Okay.

294
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,622
All right. So do you have
any questions before we start?

295
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,652
Just one. Someone
took my cell phone.

296
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:07,808
Can I get that back?

297
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,126
Sure. Right after the scan.

298
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,830
And I have a follow-up.
What's the CDC doing here?

299
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,704
Okay, we're gonna lie down now.

300
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,656
Good. All right. Try to
stay still. Try to stay still.

301
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,805
Thank you.

302
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,371
<i>Okay, beginning with Joyce.</i>

303
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:28,562
Joyce Basche, I placed
an AV graft for hemodialysis.

304
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,115
Take me through that.

305
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,286
I made an incision over the
radial artery and basilic vein...

306
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,888
I'm sorry.

307
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,201
I'm going to ask you to
go back a little further.

308
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,558
Did you scrub?

309
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,659
Did I scrub?

310
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,088
For how long did
you scrub, roughly?

311
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,535
Four minutes, 36
seconds, exactly.

312
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,081
You're sure about that? I am.

313
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,405
I used <i>Think,</i> The
Aretha Franklin song.

314
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,425
I run it in my head. It's
two minutes, 18 seconds.

315
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,743
<i>Hospital protocol is
a four-minute scrub,</i>

316
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,729
<i>so I go through it twice.</i>

317
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,507
<i>And the scrub nurse who handed</i>

318
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,907
<i>you your instruments, that was?</i>

319
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,851
<i>Fran. She was
right across from me.</i>

320
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,012
<i>Well, now the graft is
in place, and you secure.</i>

321
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:39,133
<i>I did a standard vascular
anastomosis with running prolene.</i>

322
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:41,352
<i>I checked for leaks.
There were none.</i>

323
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,988
<i>And you closed or Dr. Murphy?</i>

324
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,359
Wait. The doppler.

325
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,896
<i>I confirmed good
flow with the doppler.</i>

326
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,382
<i>Then I closed.</i>

327
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,289
And it went perfectly.

328
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:03,169
All right. Anything
else you remember?

329
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:05,776
I remember saying,
"That went perfectly."

330
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,907
All right. Let's move
on to Seth Lepik.

331
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,671
I got this.

332
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,016
What the hell's going on?

333
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,318
These guys won't
tell us anything.

334
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,287
Sir... I want my son outta here.

335
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:24,445
I want him transferred to
another hospital right now.

336
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:25,691
I understand. I'll
have to tell you,

337
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,981
moving Seth now would put him

338
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,611
at greater risk for
more complications.

339
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,312
If we're hoping to
avoid another surgery...

340
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,736
You're damn right, we are.

341
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,838
You're not touching
my son again.

342
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,255
See what you can do
to arrange a transfer.

343
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,567
Hey, Myers set up for the
C-section in the cath lab.

344
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,336
We need to run through
the steps of the procedure.

345
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,093
Look at you. "Myers."

346
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,373
You say it like he isn't
nailing your girlfriend.

347
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,607
She's not my girlfriend.

348
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,058
Whatever. You love her.

349
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,582
She's my friend.

350
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,751
You sound stupid
when you say that.

351
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,164
She's moving in with the guy.

352
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:06,621
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,456
Beat him up.

354
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,770
No. I'm gonna try to be
nice to him and get along

355
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,226
so I don't lose my friend.

356
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:16,831
Or you could punch him
and take back your girl.

357
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,428
Ouch. I know,
right? And it's a kid.

358
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,963
Listen, I'm gonna
take her up for surgery,

359
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,886
and I was hoping that
you'd want to assist.

360
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,633
Oh, last time I checked, I was
a world-class peds surgeon,

361
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,001
and interns assisted attendings.

362
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,291
They do, it's just...

363
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,804
I want someone
in there I can trust.

364
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,668
You know, I want to
avoid a Bailey situation.

365
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,425
Plus, you're cute
when you irrigate.

366
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,881
Sold.

367
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,961
Oh, the kid's gonna ask
for her phone back. Stall her.

368
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,030
She's gonna tweet about the
investigation. She's a journalist.

369
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,532
For what, like, the Sunshine
Elementary newsletter?

370
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:41,750
She's, like, nine.

371
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,940
Hi, Frankie.

372
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,152
Hey, have you
found my phone yet?

373
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,210
Uh, not yet. So
this is Dr. Robbins.

374
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,262
She's gonna assist
me in surgery.

375
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,682
Now your hand was
pretty badly crushed

376
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,779
from the trampling, so it's
gonna mean an extensive surgery

377
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,432
to repair these
bones here and here

378
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,555
and fixate these.

379
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,767
Oh, my God.

380
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,658
It's gonna be
okay, though, right?

381
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,004
I mean, she's gonna be able
to, you know, use her hand?

382
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,161
Oh, that's the goal.

383
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:07,026
Sweetie, I'm gonna go tell
your mom you're gonna be okay.

384
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,050
Okay.

385
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:10,918
Okay.

386
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,867
It's worse than
we thought, honey.

387
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,559
All right, so do you have any
questions before we take you up?

388
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,228
No. Okay.

389
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,662
Actually, I do have one.

390
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,398
The CDC is
investigating Dr. Bailey

391
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,924
because several of
her patients died, right?

392
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,403
Um, who told you
about Dr. Bailey?

393
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,517
I asked an orderly. Oh, shoot.

394
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,236
I mean, I can't
reveal my sources.

395
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,921
But you just
confirmed it for me,

396
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,623
so you can be my second
source. Oh, no, I didn't.

397
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,687
That's Dr. Robbins? Hey!

398
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,255
What are you doing?

399
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,495
Checking Bailey's post-ops.

400
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,108
I thought Richard was
taking care of Bailey's patients.

401
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,212
Just Seth Lepik, the
infected guy. I took the rest.

402
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,145
Bailey's patients are
all turning up with staph.

403
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,580
You're pregnant.
Why take the risk?

404
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,948
Because I'm
looking out for Bailey.

405
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,292
And I'm trying to
look out for you.

406
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,493
This is why I need
Cristina in the room.

407
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,330
What room? The delivery room.

408
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,031
Wait. What?

409
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,568
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

410
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,482
On-call room, you and me?

411
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,106
Oh, I wish.

412
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,709
Uh, but I have an atrial
septostomy with Karev.

413
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,528
But after I save a baby's life,
I'm gonna need to celebrate.

414
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,396
Okay. Well, find me.

415
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,465
Oh, how is the grandma?

416
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,095
Uh, she's sweet, but useless.

417
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,479
Rachel's doing better, though,
so at least Ethan's got her.

418
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,122
Paul's gonna wake up.

419
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,325
I've been doing serial neuro
exams. I have a good feeling.

420
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,634
Spoken like a true scientist.

421
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,097
Thank you.

422
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,476
Thank you for
having a good feeling.

423
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,599
Anytime.

424
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,254
Oh, Mer asked me to be at her
birth and watch her poop on a table.

425
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,006
You have to do that.

426
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,876
Can't I just show up after when
everyone has control of their bowels?

427
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,091
Watching a baby be born
is like seeing God in person.

428
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,901
Spoken like a true scientist.

429
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,502
I used

430
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:12,723
scissors to shorten
the graft to fit.

431
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,109
<i>Took about a centimeter off.</i>

432
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,246
<i>I remember, Mr. Lepik
had deep vessels.</i>

433
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,465
<i>Uh, so I asked Fran
for more retraction.</i>

434
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,733
<i>I'm sorry. Fran?</i>

435
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,102
<i>You named Linda</i>

436
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,010
<i>as your scrub nurse
on Mr. Lepik's surgery.</i>

437
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,606
<i>Yes. Yes, right. Sorry. Um...</i>

438
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,409
Then I finished the
graft, and I closed.

439
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,907
Well, what about the leak?

440
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,425
<i>According to Mr. Lepik's chart,</i>

441
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,744
<i>there was a small
leak on the venous side.</i>

442
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,217
<i>Yes. Lepik.</i>

443
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,386
<i>Yes. Uh, he had a leak.</i>

444
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,805
<i>Um, and I put in
an interrupted stitch.</i>

445
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,808
You remember that?
Yes, I remember.

446
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,561
I irrigated with
antibiotic solution

447
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,597
to avoid infection,
then I closed.

448
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,277
You closed? That's important.

449
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,950
I did. I closed.

450
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,247
You're sure? Because your...

451
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,921
Did you put the cap
on the toothpaste?

452
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:01,155
Sorry?

453
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,457
I assumed you brushed
your teeth this morning.

454
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,966
So did you put the cap back
on the toothpaste or didn't you?

455
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:07,360
Or can you be sure?

456
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,496
Because when you do a
thing every single day...

457
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,066
Dr. Bailey, we're talking
about the lives of two people.

458
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:14,835
What, you don't
think I know that?

459
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,888
Don't insult me. These
are my patients who died.

460
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,991
You think I don't know
that far, far better than you?

461
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:27,246
So again, uh, are
you sure you closed?

462
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,384
Could I take a break, please?

463
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,492
There's only a
little more to, uh...

464
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,709
Do.

465
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,815
<i>Dr. Reynolds to ICU.</i>

466
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,717
<i>Dr. Reynolds to ICU.</i>

467
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,755
Hey. Is your interview over?

468
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,792
We're on a break. Wait. Wait.

469
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,472
Aren't you supposed to be
avoiding me like the plague?

470
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,945
Come on. What can I do to help?

471
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,163
Anything?

472
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,983
I just want to know
how Seth Lepik is.

473
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,149
I'd like to see his chart, but
they locked me out of the system.

474
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,575
Dr. Grey.

475
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,480
She wants to check
on her patients.

476
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,182
What do you think she's
gonna do, alter their charts?

477
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,089
That's what the CDC
is gonna think, yes.

478
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,636
Well, maybe you
called them too soon.

479
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,254
I am thinking of the
bigger picture here.

480
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,956
She's part of that picture.

481
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,258
We need to stand by our doctors.

482
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,328
Even if she's at fault? We
stand by her then? She's not.

483
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,580
But we should cross that
bridge when we get to it.

484
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,999
We're kind of at that bridge.

485
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,139
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Avery?

486
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,275
Yes. Sorry to bug you,

487
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,277
but I was just kind
of wondering, is there

488
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,296
any update on my family...

489
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,842
Or their fingers?

490
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,567
Mom? Mom! Somebody help my mom!

491
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,269
What's wrong? Mom?

492
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,904
She needs some help. Uh, ma'am?

493
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,700
Hey, what's your
mom's name? Rachel.

494
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,202
Dr. Bailey, step away
from the patient, now.

495
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,970
Okay, let's clear the
wheelchair and the tables.

496
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,494
I got it. Make room.

497
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,563
Okay, lay her down.
All right. All right.

498
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:10,112
Call a code. MAN: Right away.

499
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,096
Mom! Page Dr. Shepherd, stat.

500
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,871
Yes, doctor.

501
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,175
Okay, Amelie, here we go.

502
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,426
Scalpel.

503
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,879
It's gonna be okay, honey.

504
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,414
But what if it's not?

505
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,483
Shh.

506
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,938
No! Stop.

507
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,372
I can't do this.

508
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,857
Not right now.

509
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,693
His heart is okay now.

510
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,356
And you all know that
when he comes out,

511
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,862
it's going to stop working.

512
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,865
I'm not ready for him to die.

513
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:42,994
Amelie, honey... No.

514
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:45,319
Look at me. Look in my eyes.

515
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,371
You have to do this.

516
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,874
Your baby's life depends on
it, and you are wasting time.

517
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,343
We're all here.

518
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,851
We're all doing our best
to save your baby's life.

519
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,430
Breathe with me.

520
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,130
Okay. One more
time. One more time.

521
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,007
You can do this.

522
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,642
Right?

523
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,010
Right.

524
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,448
She's ready.

525
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,198
Just confirm what I have so far.

526
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,699
There's some
kind of an infection

527
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,567
going on in the hospital
linked to Dr. Bailey.

528
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,302
You don't even
have to say anything.

529
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,403
You can just nod if I'm close.

530
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,544
Let it go, Woodward.

531
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,657
Who's Woodward?

532
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,908
Uh, you should know that.

533
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,410
You should give
me back my phone.

534
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,951
You're denying my
second amendment right.

535
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,998
Wait. You want a gun now?

536
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,366
Duh. First. I meant first
amendment, obviously.

537
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,636
Look, there's this
girl named KK.

538
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,654
Who wrote an article
about some bird

539
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:43,822
that everyone
thought was extinct

540
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,562
living in her backyard.

541
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,443
It got picked up by the AP, and
now she's a stringer for the <i>Times.</i>

542
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,200
This is a real story.

543
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,664
I mean, I have an opportunity
here to be awesome.

544
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,349
Why don't you count
backwards from ten?

545
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,873
Mmm-hmm. Okay?

546
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,192
Ten...

547
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,860
Nine...

548
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,539
You're obstructing
the free press.

549
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,946
What's after nine?

550
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,165
Eight...

551
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:06,433
Seven...

552
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:08,413
What are we gonna
do when she wakes up,

553
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,677
roll her up in a rug and
stick her in the trunk of a car?

554
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,645
Is he okay? Is he alive?

555
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:19,874
He's beautiful.

556
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:22,750
Thank you.

557
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,471
I got him.

558
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,255
Please save my baby!

559
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:32,759
Let's move, people.

560
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,124
Coming through. Clear
the way! Shepherd?

561
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,792
Her pupil's blown.
She's re-hemorrhaged.

562
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,595
I need to get her to an OR.
What the hell happened?

563
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,229
I'll let you know when I know.

564
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,133
Okay, let's go. MAN:
Check her pressure.

565
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,421
I'll see you up there.

566
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,090
Hey. Hey.

567
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,357
She's gonna be okay.

568
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,937
We've got her and we're
gonna take care of you.

569
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,878
Hey, hey. Room 10-24.

570
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,441
She's gonna take
you to your grandma.

571
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,830
Wait for me there.

572
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,266
Come on. This way.

573
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,995
What is it?

574
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,180
He's dropped his pressure. I can't
hear breath sounds on the right.

575
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,733
Okay, run fluids wide open.
Get me a chest tube tray, fast.

576
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,157
Right away, Doctor.

577
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:05,476
In the vena cava.

578
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,777
What is the oxygen saturation?

579
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,113
Thirty-five.

580
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,466
Inside the right atrium.

581
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,895
Nobody move. Nobody breathe.

582
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,091
Oh, Seth.

583
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,926
Oh, dear God.

584
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,828
Chest tube, now.

585
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,330
Hold on.

586
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,117
Hold on.

587
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,724
Perforating the septum.

588
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,690
Why isn't the blood
going through?

589
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,165
Because I'm not through.
Just give me a minute.

590
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,706
Now I'm through.

591
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,741
Man, I'm good.

592
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:26,122
So my mom's dead?

593
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,959
Yes.

594
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,072
But Dr. Shepherd said she
was getting better this morning.

595
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:35,198
Yes, but there was something
going on in her brain that was...

596
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:40,304
Sudden and
couldn't be prevented.

597
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,932
There was no way of knowing
that this was going to happen.

598
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,410
Could it have been the ice
cream? Like a brain freeze?

599
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,663
No. No.

600
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:53,099
Ethan...

601
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:56,648
There was nothing anyone could
have done to have stopped this.

602
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,577
Well, I need to go
now to my grandma.

603
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,596
She needs someone
to hold her hand.

604
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:14,455
I'm so sorry.

605
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,548
All right, Deedee and Jane's
surgeries both went very well.

606
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,633
They'll be in recovery soon.

607
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:30,387
Cash is still in surgery, and
Dr. Torres is in with Frankie now.

608
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,456
Her fractures were complicated,

609
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:35,036
but hopefully, with therapy,
she'll regain full use of her hand.

610
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,227
Therapy?

611
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,378
How much therapy?

612
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,091
Well, that's hard
to say now, Tony.

613
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:43,275
But it could be anywhere
from six months to a year.

614
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,720
You hear that?

615
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:48,672
A year of physical therapy, Al.

616
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,041
And then she might
get full use back. Might.

617
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,270
Well...

618
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,924
Let's look at the
bright side now...

619
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,415
The bright side?
Everyone is mangled.

620
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,983
Well, not Frankie.

621
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,219
She got lucky.

622
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,299
She's still got all
her digits, Tone.

623
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,856
Her hand was crushed!

624
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:09,109
I know. It's horrible.
I know it. And...

625
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:12,679
And I'm sorry, but, hey, well...

626
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:17,451
We're all here for you. And
that's why we're a family, right...

627
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,915
For stuff like this?
Hey. Come on, huh?

628
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,121
Mr. Keller.

629
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,556
Let me get a look
here. You all right?

630
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,314
I think I broke my hand.

631
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,593
He's not stabilizing. He
needs surgery immediately.

632
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,968
No, not in this cesspool.

633
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:36,687
An ambulance is coming for him.

634
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,255
No, he's too
unstable to transfer.

635
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,589
I'm canceling all...

636
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,436
You guys have some
infection running rampant.

637
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,776
It's not safe.

638
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,085
It's not the hospital.
It's one doctor.

639
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,163
The infection came from one
doctor and one doctor alone.

640
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,599
She's been isolated and the
infection has been contained.

641
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:57,991
I've been tested. I'm clean. The
OR has been tested. It's clean.

642
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,354
If we don't go right now,
your son's gonna die.

643
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,304
Do what you have to.

644
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,473
Save my son.

645
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,010
You cleared to scrub in?

646
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,590
Yes, sir. They cleared
me this morning.

647
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,147
Okay, prep him.

648
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:22,782
So Bailey did do
something wrong.

649
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,685
Of course not. I only said
that to get their kid into surgery,

650
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,566
and if you repeat it,
I'll have your ass fired

651
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,310
before you finish
talking, you understand?

652
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,691
<i>Dr. Rizzo to the ER.
Dr. Rizzo to the ER.</i>

653
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,348
Baby's looking good.

654
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,027
Heart function's
hypokinetic but improving.

655
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,352
Yang says that's to be expected.

656
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,920
That Yang's a piece of work.

657
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,269
Yeah. Well, try living with her.

658
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,253
Listen, man, I appreciate
your work today.

659
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,945
I think this thing with Jo
got us off on a bad foot.

660
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,447
She cares a lot about you.

661
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:54,965
We're friends. That's all.

662
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,968
All right. All right.

663
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:02,039
I had a messed-up
childhood, too.

664
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,958
I was a foster kid
like her. It was crappy.

665
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:07,527
But I didn't have it
near as bad as Jo did.

666
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,464
I was never homeless,
never had to live in my car.

667
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,783
But she's really turned
it around for herself.

668
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,752
And I just...

669
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,603
I want the best for her, is all.

670
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,306
Yeah, okay.

671
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,676
Yeah. Thanks for today.

672
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,653
Every year, it keeps on getting

673
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:35,600
harder and harder
to plan these things

674
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,608
and to get everyone to come.

675
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:38,975
Why do it?

676
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,964
It doesn't seem like
they appreciate it much.

677
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:45,149
They're all that I have.

678
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:49,352
I almost got married a few
times, but I always messed it up.

679
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:54,174
My family is Tony and Jane
and Deedee and Cash and...

680
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,476
Everybody else out there.

681
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,578
And I'm just meant to be...

682
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,914
Annoying uncle Al.

683
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:06,436
Well, you'll think of
something for next year.

684
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,606
I mean, you just gotta...
Just gotta keep trying.

685
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,999
Do I have the staph strain?

686
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,671
I'd like to start again
with Seth Lepik, please.

687
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,077
I made a small
transverse incision,

688
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,528
minimal blood loss.

689
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,565
<i>I deepened the incision
into the subcutaneous tissue,</i>

690
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,300
<i>asked for retraction.</i>

691
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,163
<i>BP was good. All
vitals were good.</i>

692
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,637
BP's 90 over 60 and falling.

693
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,416
- More laps.
- There you go.

694
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,202
Suction. MIRANDA:
<i>You tested me for staph.</i>

695
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,243
Can I get those results, please?

696
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,989
There was a leak
on the venous side?

697
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,082
There was a leak on the
venous side, a little blood loss.

698
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,566
But very little.

699
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,952
Now just can you get
me my results, please?

700
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,066
Come on. More.
More. Pile 'em in.

701
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,941
Yes, doctor. Look, I gotta
try and find it. Hold on.

702
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,960
More suction.

703
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,540
<i>Just again, I'd like you
to take me through...</i>

704
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,298
Okay, I can take you
through my scrub technique

705
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,477
and how I hold my instruments.

706
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:10,941
But the only thing
you need to know

707
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,413
is do I have this
staph infection.

708
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,421
You should know that by now.

709
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,955
More lap pads. More.

710
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,045
Okay, more suction. Right there.

711
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,742
Come on.

712
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,344
<i>Other doctors have been cleared.</i>

713
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,785
<i>So why am I going through this?</i>

714
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,494
<i>Just go down there
and get my results.</i>

715
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,043
You have my results?

716
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,786
You have my results,

717
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,421
and I...

718
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:53,527
Have this strain of staph?

719
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,752
Did I do this?

720
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,992
I did...

721
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,693
Didn't I?

722
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,678
I'll be there in the room

723
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,714
when fetus arrives. You will?

724
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,505
Yeah. You're gonna
want me there.

725
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,805
Okay.

726
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,804
You're gonna poop
on the table, though.

727
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:27,505
And I'm gonna have to see it,

728
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,497
and then I can never unsee it.

729
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,867
You know what's worse than
you seeing me poop on the table?

730
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:36,881
What? Me knowing you've
seen me poop on the table.

731
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,750
So you'll suffer
more than me. Yes!

732
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,055
Oh, okay. That
makes me feel better.

733
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,938
Hey. Hey.

734
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,862
I'm sorry. I heard
about Paul's wife.

735
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,875
Yeah. I appreciate that.

736
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,701
Are you angry with me?

737
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,057
No. No. I just...

738
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,961
I'm angry at the situation.

739
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:02,629
Okay, well, you
know, after this,

740
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,475
let's just go home, and then
I can make some dinner...

741
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:05,676
No, I'm gonna stay.

742
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,451
I'm gonna stay just in case
Paul's condition changes

743
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,404
or if the kid needs...

744
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:15,475
You know, I just... I just
don't feel like I can leave,

745
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:17,210
you know?

746
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,645
I mean...

747
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,213
What would you do?

748
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,482
I would go home,

749
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,101
because I'm his
doctor, not his family.

750
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,822
Yeah.

751
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:32,492
I'm gonna stay.

752
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,312
Okay. I understand.

753
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,057
Come to see your
boyfriend's miracle baby?

754
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,241
Why did you tell him that? What?

755
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,217
That I'm a homeless dumpster
diver. I don't tell anyone.

756
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,936
You don't tell people about me.

757
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,300
You told me... Yeah,
it's called a secret, Alex.

758
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:03,434
It's what friends
tell each other.

759
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,086
Look, what's the
deal? What did he say?

760
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,543
Why'd I tell you? So stupid.

761
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,178
What is the point of a new start

762
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:09,774
if there's always some dumbass
dragging you back down?

763
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:10,908
Whoa, whoa. Listen.

764
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,131
No, you listen.

765
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,640
You don't tell people about me.

766
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,203
You don't talk about
me or to me, ever.

767
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,641
Our investigation has
determined the presence

768
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:25,579
of methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus usa600.

769
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:29,216
Bailey...

770
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,079
Oh, Dr. Bailey, you should
not be here right now.

771
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,036
This is about me.

772
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,554
I'd like to hear it.

773
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,174
That's your call.

774
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,788
We have a protocol for a reason.

775
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:41,144
Okay, we vote.

776
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,450
She stays.

777
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,524
Staph aureus usa600 is an
antibiotic-resistant infection

778
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,844
with a range of symptoms
from simple skin rashes

779
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,729
to fatal sepsis.

780
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,898
We have traced the source
of the infection to one doctor.

781
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,467
Dr. Miranda Bailey

782
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,370
is a carrier of mrsa usa600.

783
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:14,027
But the real culprit
here is the gloves.

784
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,012
Records show the
surgical gloves in use

785
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,148
at the time of
outbreak, March 15,

786
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:22,552
shipped from the manufacturer
Hemming Synthetics Incorporated.

787
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,823
We switched to Hemming's
gloves when Pegasus was here.

788
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,459
Our testing reveals
manufacturing defects.

789
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,912
Microscopic tears in the
gloves, which facilitated

790
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:35,698
the transmission of staph usa600

791
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,801
to Dr. Bailey's patients.

792
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,736
It is the CDC's determination,

793
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,371
were it not for the
defective gloves,

794
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:45,308
the patients in question
would not have been infected.

795
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,827
As for Dr. Bailey, we
recommend eradication measures

796
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,697
before she can go back
to any kind of patient care.

797
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,398
All right. Thank God.

798
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,517
Best possible outcome.

799
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,962
Here are copies of our report.

800
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:10,166
The CDC thanks you for
your time and cooperation.

801
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,629
And please...

802
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:14,587
Feel free to call my office
if you have any questions.

803
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,572
Thank you.

804
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,159
<i>You've harmonized
now. Drink it all.</i>

805
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,346
You seem more like
the French cinema type.

806
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,847
I'm just a teenager.

807
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,048
Mmm-hmm.

808
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:30,670
What's this?

809
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:32,071
It's a press release.

810
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,751
We're putting it
out in the morning,

811
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,353
which means you have 12
hours to scoop the <i>Times.</i>

812
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:37,393
Or the <i>AP.</i> Or whatever.

813
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,780
Hey.

814
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:42,114
Be awesome.

815
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,685
Wait. I have a question.

816
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:47,754
One.

817
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:48,955
And I have a follow-up.

818
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,777
Turns out Bailey wasn't
at fault. Defective gloves.

819
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,746
I heard. That's great.

820
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,082
Yeah.

821
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,454
You know what?

822
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,267
I spent my entire day getting
treated like the bad guy here.

823
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,519
I'm not gonna do
this with you anymore.

824
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:11,188
You want to feel guilty
about what we did? Go ahead.

825
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:12,612
Just leave me out of it.

826
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:16,615
I didn't force you
to do anything.

827
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,563
I'm sorry that
you're hurt. Okay?

828
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,355
I'm sorry that Matthew
broke up with you.

829
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,235
As far as us sleeping together,

830
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,459
I'm never gonna
be sorry about that.

831
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,763
April?

832
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:38,204
Anyway. Good night.

833
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,545
I'm sorry.

834
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:49,482
What? No.

835
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,551
No, no. I am sorry.

836
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,287
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

837
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:58,107
No, you made a mistake
and you asked for a do-over.

838
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,654
Well, I made a mistake, too.

839
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,077
I was hurt and I
acted like an idiot.

840
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,049
I was hoping...

841
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,953
You could forgive me,
that I could have a do-over.

842
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,976
Yes.

843
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,814
It could have happened
to any one of us, Bailey.

844
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,707
We'll get you treated,
get you cleared...

845
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,926
I killed two patients. No.

846
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,495
You didn't know.

847
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,626
You scrubbed
properly, you gloved...

848
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,067
How's Seth Lepik?

849
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,990
I lost him.

850
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,625
The infection formed
an abscess that...

851
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,089
Eroded into his innominate vein.

852
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,287
I'm so sorry.

853
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,058
Bailey, how can I...

854
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,394
No! Now you want to help me?

855
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,563
Where were you when
my patient was alive,

856
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,197
when I could've helped him?

857
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,401
You shut me out. You left me.

858
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,881
Bailey, I was trying to
protect you. That's all.

859
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,304
No, no, the hospital.

860
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,590
You were trying to
protect the hospital.

861
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,291
It's all that matters to you.

862
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,461
And I don't know
why I'm so surprised.

863
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,265
Adele complained about
that every time I saw her.

864
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:47,667
And I protected you.

865
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:51,054
I made excuses to her for you.

866
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,305
I stood by you. Bailey.

867
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:54,957
No, you were a drunk.

868
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,061
You were operating
on your patients drunk,

869
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,562
and I stood by you.

870
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,165
I expected the same from you.

871
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,732
I deserved it. I earned it.

872
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,168
But all you cared about...

873
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,203
No.

874
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,522
You...

875
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,477
Are not who I thought you were.

876
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:29,542
But I am going to be in there.

877
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,345
I know. You'll be
looking into my eyes

878
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,558
and holding my hand
and feeding me ice chips,

879
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,693
and that's just where
I want you, just there.

880
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,495
Cristina can run interference

881
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,830
and handle the bossy nurses,

882
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,798
and if I decide I want drugs...

883
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,689
Fine. Whatever you want.

884
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:48,578
Or if I poop on the table...

885
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,947
If you what?

886
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,627
<i>All that time you spent
convincing yourself</i>

887
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,002
<i>the sleeping
monster wasn't real...</i>

888
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:58,037
Yeah.

889
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,874
<i>It was gathering strength.</i>

890
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,210
Oh, crap. It's you.

891
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,179
<i>The infection was spreading.</i>

892
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:07,814
What's the matter?

893
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,383
You were right... About Jo.

894
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:12,885
Of course I was.

895
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,303
What did I say again?

896
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:15,521
Forget it.

897
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:16,722
Oh, Alex.

898
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:20,960
I'm such an idiot.

899
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:23,996
I love her.

900
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,820
What?

901
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:31,921
Just...

902
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:45,468
You're weird.

903
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,777
Give it a minute.

904
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,307
It's just...

905
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,510
She just...

906
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,563
But I always screw myself
out of everything good.

907
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:03,798
I think I'm losing Owen.

908
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,088
What?

909
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,423
Not today, but...

910
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,593
Soon.

911
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,495
<i>The monster's awake now.</i>

912
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,766
<i>And there's nothing
you can do about it.</i>
