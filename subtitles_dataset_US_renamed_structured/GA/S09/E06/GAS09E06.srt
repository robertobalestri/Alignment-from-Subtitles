1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,270
<i>Doctors have never
had all the answers.</i>

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,322
Derek, I don't know.

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,711
It isn't just a visit.
She's "back" back.

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:13,928
It's only been two nights.

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,999
As long as she needs.

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,802
I mean, she lost someone.
She's been through some stuff.

7
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,311
I think she just
needs her friends.

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,605
She doesn't want to be alone.

9
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,685
<i>There was a time
when you were sick,</i>

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,086
<i>we'd just drain your blood like</i>

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,227
<i>you were getting an oil change.</i>

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,230
Today is, uh, knee
replacement day, right?

13
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,697
Had to cancel them.

14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,544
We're meeting with our
lawyers today about the crash.

15
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,901
Oh, how's that going?

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,071
Uh, I'm not allowed to say.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,350
All right, that's fine.

18
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,441
How's Arizona?

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,750
Not allowed to say.

20
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,428
You.

21
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,358
Dr. Bailey. Here you
go. Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,477
She won't see anyone. She
won't even leave the house.

23
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,467
Yeah, and... She's walking.

24
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,597
She's even working
with her prosthesis,

25
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,082
but, you know, it has to be
perfect. And I try to be encouraging,

26
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,267
but then she tells
me I'm pushing her.

27
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,990
Tell her I say get
her ass in here.

28
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,725
Oh, sweet.

29
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,205
Then she can be cranky
and resentful to you.

30
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,706
<i>We're constantly
having to rethink</i>

31
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,330
<i>what we thought was true...</i>

32
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,399
Oh.

33
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>And redefine it.</i>

34
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,961
Wilson, you stink. Vomit.

35
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,497
It's vomit. I'm
covering the pit,

36
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,814
and Santa Claus came to town.

37
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,199
I don't need a play-by-play.
Go clean yourself up.

38
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,367
That's what I'm doing.

39
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:15,456
Go. You're disgusting.

40
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,962
What is this? What?

41
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,541
This list your real
estate agent sent to mine.

42
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:24,333
"Repair discolored/burned
portion, hardwood floors"?

43
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,213
Oh, that's just some stuff
you gotta take care of.

44
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,614
"Repair/refinish wood
molding in doorjambs"?

45
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:29,716
Yeah, they're all scratched up.

46
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,340
There's like five
things you gotta fix.

47
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,919
And what if I don't? Then
I'm not buying your house.

48
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:35,771
Well, that's crazy, because you
begged me to sell you that house.

49
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,057
We made a deal. We
shook on it. We drank on it.

50
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,998
These are reasonable
requests. Come on, Mer.

51
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,783
We're friends, but
this is business.

52
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,802
Let's be like grownups here.

53
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,281
Did you just tell me to grow up?

54
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,605
I hate Karev.

55
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,690
Seconded. Oh, motion carried.

56
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,842
We hate Karev. What
happened to you?

57
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,211
I'm covering the pit, and
Santa Claus came to town.

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,175
You know, I was starting to
think that he was an okay guy,

59
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,743
but he's just mean. Santa?

60
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,767
Karev.

61
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,334
Santa came in two weeks ago,

62
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,521
and he barfed all over
me, too. Barfed all day.

63
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,650
Did he say anything about me?

64
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,139
Santa? Karev.

65
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,487
Don't do that. Don't be the sad
girl with the hang-up. It's pathetic.

66
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,155
He slept with Heather.
She's not hung up.

67
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,424
Why did you start your year by
having sex with your boss anyway?

68
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,930
Because he's stupid hot.

69
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,451
I have social anxiety,

70
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,037
so, sometimes it's
easier than talking.

71
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,986
Oh. I'm a really good listener.

72
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,807
Just sayin'.

73
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,009
Jackasses, all of you.

74
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,246
Mmm.

75
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,232
Wow.

76
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,344
That was...

77
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:34,335
So...

78
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,588
So stupid.

79
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,335
Not where I was going with that.

80
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,125
Oh.

81
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,578
What is wrong with me?

82
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,791
How many times can I
say this is not happening,

83
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,715
and then, the next thing
I know, it's happened?

84
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,318
I am... I'm so weak.

85
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,904
You're not weak. You're just...

86
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:53,156
Disgusting.

87
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,974
I was a good person once.

88
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,442
A person with willpower.

89
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,745
I have fasted
before. This is worse.

90
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,281
This just feels
helpless and inevitable.

91
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,252
Like watching two cars
head toward one another

92
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:11,289
and there's nothing you can do.

93
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,657
There's gonna be a crash.

94
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,292
People are going to die.

95
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,872
And you're just
gonna be left there...

96
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,767
You are lucky I'm even
selling you this house.

97
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,879
You're lucky I'm buying it.

98
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,736
That list is the
tip of the iceberg.

99
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,071
I mean, there's dry rot...

100
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,379
There is no dry rot.

101
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,107
Aah! Ah!

102
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,721
Brian Danziger, 17, he passed
out in first period English.

103
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,823
Severe abdominal pain,
tremors, and he's hypertensive.

104
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,581
His parents are on the way.

105
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,126
Brian, were you drinking this
morning? Did you take anything?

106
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,900
No, I don't take drugs.

107
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,096
God! What happened?

108
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,653
He's distended,

109
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,316
and he's got tenderness
in the right upper quadrant.

110
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,867
Does he look
jaundiced to you? A little.

111
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,891
Brian, I'm gonna need you
to lie back down, please.

112
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,749
I... Oh.

113
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,162
Alex.

114
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:57,869
Uh, all right. Make sure you
get L.F.T.s, COAGs, a tox screen,

115
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,954
and an abdominal CT.

116
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,549
Edwards, what do
you think this is?

117
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,224
I think...

118
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,458
I'm sorry. I don't know.

119
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:05,722
That's all right.
We don't either.

120
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,586
For all we know, this
kid could have dry rot.

121
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,497
I'm sorry I messed
you up like that, hon.

122
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,188
I start puking like this,
it doesn't stop for days.

123
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,168
Well, I'm gonna
give you some fluids

124
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,326
to counteract the
alcohol in your system.

125
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,889
I don't have any
alcohol in my system.

126
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:25,330
Mmm-hmm. Last time
you threw up all over us,

127
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,050
your alcohol level was .21,

128
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,585
and the time before
that, it was even higher.

129
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,837
It does take the
pain down a notch.

130
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,518
But I swear to you, hon, I
ain't been drinking nothing.

131
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,110
I mean, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

132
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,627
My stomach hurts so bad

133
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,108
that I get so nauseous,
I just wish I would die.

134
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,399
Please. You got to help me.

135
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,001
Well, let's figure it out then.

136
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,963
Mmm.

137
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,587
Okay.

138
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,861
I told you to change your shirt.

139
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,249
What the hell is wrong with you?

140
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:03,151
This is what I can
offer you salary-wise.

141
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,788
That's fine. Thank you.

142
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,340
You don't need to thank
me. Thank Jeff Russell.

143
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,649
He really pushed
to get you here.

144
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,439
Who's Jeff Russell?
He's the new cardio chief.

145
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,775
He's a good guy. You'll
like him. Or you won't.

146
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,735
Oh, there's a meeting today about
the plane crash with the lawyers.

147
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,653
Will you be there? I will.

148
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,037
So do I have to come?

149
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:26,173
No, I will be there
to support my staff,

150
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,482
not as your proxy.

151
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,095
I'm not your proxy anymore.

152
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:33,798
All right.

153
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,050
So...

154
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,330
Now, here's your
orientation packet.

155
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,254
Welcome.

156
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,563
And I'll see you around.

157
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,425
Jamie's appy went perfectly,
her incision looks great,

158
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,639
but her throat is still giving
me cause for concern.

159
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,162
It's just a sore throat, right?

160
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,047
Probably just an infection,

161
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,060
but the swelling is abnormal.

162
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,528
So, I want to keep
her here another day

163
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:10,963
and run some
tests just to be sure.

164
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,405
Of course. Let's
be sure. Thank you.

165
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,606
Yeah.

166
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,126
<i>And of course my kids got to it</i>

167
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,270
<i>before my husband
could even try it.</i>

168
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,665
<i>All right, and the
judge is tasting it now</i>

169
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,357
<i>and we are gonna see
what you get, Susan.</i>

170
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,153
<i>That is three and a
half out of four apples!</i>

171
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,596
Hello.

172
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,742
Hey, Arizona. It's, uh,
Miranda Bailey. How are you?

173
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,744
Uh... Well, I'm, you know...

174
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,513
<i>I wish I had
time to talk, but...</i>

175
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,470
I'm calling for a favor.

176
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,440
I have a 13-year-old female,

177
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,341
<i>three days post-appendectomy</i>

178
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,228
<i>with a persistent sore
throat, and as of this morning,</i>

179
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,291
<i>severe swelling on
the left side of her neck.</i>

180
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,614
I'm kind of at a loss here.

181
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,683
<i>Well...</i>

182
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,300
Get a CT. <i>I am.</i>

183
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,671
I am. I just thought you might
know off the top of your head.

184
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,240
Have you ever seen
something like this?

185
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:08,059
Maybe. I mean, I'd have
to take a look at the chart.

186
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,931
You know, Bailey, I'm not really
back to work yet, and I'm busy.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,832
<i>I know, I know. I just...</i>

188
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,002
What if I have an intern

189
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,348
<i>bring you a copy of the
chart? You take a look,</i>

190
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,175
if it sparks anything,
you can call me back.

191
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,559
Can't you just email it?

192
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,893
Um, not scanned yet.

193
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,902
Fine. Fine. Just
send the chart over.

194
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,054
Oh, thanks so much.

195
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,036
Sir, we have a problem.

196
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:37,716
You don't have to call me "sir."

197
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,607
I do. It helps me.

198
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,109
Sir...

199
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,418
You need to get
your Averys straight.

200
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,380
Oh? In your address book.

201
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,293
Last night...

202
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,528
You sent an email, which I
believe was for my mother.

203
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,552
Oh.

204
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,520
It began, "I can't sleep...

205
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,866
"Thinking about you tonight..."

206
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,190
Uh, that's enough.

207
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,086
Well, it would've
been for me, too.

208
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,459
But it really goes on.

209
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,162
Sir, I do not like thinking
about you in that way,

210
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,597
or my mother in that way,

211
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,677
or you and my
mother in that way.

212
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,684
Message received,
son. Won't happen again.

213
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,720
Don't call me "son."

214
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,238
I meant it colloquially.

215
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,125
But, that won't
happen again either.

216
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,428
Well, I took the liberty of forwarding
your email on to my mother.

217
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,780
I thank you for that.

218
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,081
All right. Sir.

219
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,198
You were supposed
to tell me when

220
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,632
Brian Danziger's labs came back.

221
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,496
No, I thought I was
supposed to tell Dr. Karev.

222
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,293
I should've told you, too.

223
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,838
Uh, Brian Danziger's
labs are back.

224
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:33,906
Get away from me.

225
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,997
Oh, not fair. You
are the scariest one.

226
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,676
That was always
supposed to be me.

227
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,777
You shouldn't have left.

228
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,568
I'll establish dominance.

229
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:41,831
Maybe I'll use
one of the classics.

230
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,915
How was Owen?

231
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,539
You mean "Chief Hunt"?

232
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,741
The husband formerly known
as Owen is now just my employer.

233
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,145
He gave me the
orientation packet.

234
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:55,216
Brian Danziger's sedated.
His B.P.'s down a little.

235
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,064
Yeah, tox screen's negative, his
L.F.T.s and I.N.R. are elevated.

236
00:08:58,088 --> 00:08:59,565
Did you get a good
look at his liver?

237
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,390
Oh, the prodigal Yang returns.

238
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,575
We've missed you.

239
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,309
Yes, hi. Blah,
blah. Pleasantries.

240
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,979
Hey, what do you know about
the new cardio chief, Jeff Randall?

241
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,298
Russell. Nothing. Yeah.

242
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,478
No one named Jeff has ever
done anything substantial.

243
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:15,553
Hey, Karev, when you buy Mer's
house, can I get my old room back?

244
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,199
Nope. No roommates.
We're not in college.

245
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,506
We're real people now.

246
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:20,119
Wait, you're selling
him your house?

247
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,754
I might not, he wants
me to rip out the floors.

248
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,678
I'll take the floors as is.
- Jackson.

249
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:25,074
Why don't you shack
up with Kepner?

250
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,214
You guys are always
boinking anyway.

251
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,267
Where is he going?
Away from you, it seems.

252
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,652
Cristina, glad you're back.

253
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,871
You still doing it with Avery?

254
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,083
Does everybody know this now?

255
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,440
God and everybody.

256
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,142
For four whole seconds I
was glad you were back.

257
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,811
Mmm. I gotta go
meet this Jeff schmuck.

258
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,314
You were right.

259
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,716
About the floors?

260
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,917
About the liver.

261
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,804
Oh, crap.

262
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,417
<i>You think it's something I did?</i>

263
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,707
With Karev?

264
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,787
Because things were really
heating up, and suddenly,

265
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,328
he stops returning my texts.

266
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,307
He barely talks to me, and I
can't figure out what happened.

267
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,642
What happened is, he's a guy.

268
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,666
So you think we're done?

269
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:02,144
You should be.
Yeah, but is he...

270
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,301
Leah, stop.

271
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,069
Labs for Santa Claus.

272
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,378
Yeah, it's mine.

273
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,112
What about Shane?
He's nice. Yeah, he is.

274
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,478
I wish I liked nice.

275
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:14,824
Then you picked the right guy.

276
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,925
Karev's mean.

277
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,882
And thoughtless, and a douche.

278
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,845
And there's nothing
wrong with him at all.

279
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,869
Karev? Santa.

280
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,488
23-year-old female,

281
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,256
37-week gestation,

282
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,042
echocardiogram reveals
myxoma in the right ventricle...

283
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,655
Dr. Randall? Russell.

284
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,696
Sorry. I'm Dr. Yang.

285
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,866
Oh. Holy crap.

286
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,534
You're here.

287
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,586
Jeff Russell. Make it Jeff.

288
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,821
Jeff, it is.

289
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:44,024
So, this is great.

290
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,904
Well, I understand you
already know your way around,

291
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,146
probably better than I do, so...

292
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,547
Welcome.

293
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,549
And go. Have fun.

294
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,618
See patients.

295
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,287
I thought we might talk.

296
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,889
I wish I had the time.

297
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,501
Dr. Russell... Jeff.

298
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,287
I am happy to be back at
Seattle Grace-Mercy West,

299
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,711
but not if my
progress ends here.

300
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,608
I think my time would
be best spent... Dr. Yang.

301
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,499
I am in the weeds.

302
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,502
I have a huge myxoma
on a pregnant lady,

303
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,372
I am spearheading the first
U.S. Lotus Valve implantation,

304
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,258
I've got four papers that journals
are breathing down my neck for,

305
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,711
I've got an army of
interns who could use...

306
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,564
Who need some...

307
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,349
Who are stupid.

308
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,134
Go. Run my service,
make me look great.

309
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,253
Just don't kill my patients.

310
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,167
Who's gonna assign my surgeries?

311
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,024
Um, you are. Call me

312
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,459
if you do something really cool.

313
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,826
Sir, I'm a fellow.

314
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,123
No, that's not what I've heard.

315
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,812
I've heard you're
as good, as capable,

316
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,943
as excited about this
work as I am, if not more.

317
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,000
Go.

318
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,735
Be that way.

319
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,206
Myxoma in right ventricle.

320
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,425
Mass measures 3 centimeters...

321
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:52,760
At this point,

322
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,097
it's about assessing
these emotional damages.

323
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,901
So, we'll need to
hear everything.

324
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,715
You must be Dr. Yang. Glad
you could be here. Have a seat.

325
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:05,868
Dr. Hunt, I guess you won't
be necessary as proxy anymore.

326
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,426
Uh, I'm here more out
of support for my staff.

327
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,972
Yeah, I don't mind if he stays.

328
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,764
Today, we'd like to get
some statements about,

329
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,166
continued physical,
but also, mental

330
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,880
or emotional difficulties you
might have suffered since the crash.

331
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,170
What if we don't have any?

332
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,372
Well, um, why don't we talk?

333
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,773
We'll see what comes up.

334
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,770
Almost anything can be
helpful to monetize your injuries.

335
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:25,993
How do we do that?

336
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,229
We use a formula.

337
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:32,000
It's, uh, your medical bills,
plus pain and suffering,

338
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:34,001
equal to three times
your medical bills,

339
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,070
plus flat-rate
hard-tissue injuries,

340
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,956
plus loss of income,
plus lost earning capacity,

341
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,226
plus any other
foreseeable harms,

342
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,511
for each of you, so,

343
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,197
we're talking about
a sizeable award.

344
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,544
Far more substantial than
the settlement they offered you.

345
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,778
Where's all the money come from?

346
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,970
Well, we're looking
at the possibilities now.

347
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,973
Uh, the charter company,
aircraft manufacturer,

348
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,809
parts manufacturers,
the pilot, of course.

349
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,093
The ground crew at Sea-Tac...

350
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,513
Jerry? Did you say Jerry?

351
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,759
Who's Jerry? DEREK: The pilot.

352
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:03,860
He was up there with us.

353
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,444
He broke his back.
He's paralyzed now.

354
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,846
You're gonna go after him?

355
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,236
Well, if we find he was
negligent, shouldn't we?

356
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,133
You know, I'm
sorry. I can't help.

357
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,568
I've got no residual injuries,

358
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,170
and I've gotta go run
someone's service for them,

359
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,476
so, you know, good luck.

360
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,815
Folks, listen,

361
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,801
you have a special bond.

362
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,569
You've been through
something horrible

363
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,321
and survived it together.

364
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,457
But as far as the
pilot is concerned,

365
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,009
you need to stop thinking
of him as one of you

366
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,762
and start thinking of
him as one of them.

367
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,088
I am Dr. Yang, Dr. Russell's
cardiothoracic fellow.

368
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,801
Good to see you back, Dr. Yang.

369
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,825
Have we met?

370
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,593
Um, sort of.

371
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,462
You threw a vase full
of flowers at our heads.

372
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,190
Did I hurt you? No.

373
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,076
Well, there's still
time. I'm Dr. Ross.

374
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,167
Since many of you
will wash out or be fired,

375
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,631
I won't waste time learning
your names for at least a year.

376
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,454
I will call you by
your dwarf names.

377
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,640
You, "Happy."

378
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,525
You, "Mousey."

379
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,789
There wasn't a dwarf
named "Mousey."

380
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,230
They saved her for you.

381
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,632
Now get me up to speed.
Every patient, every chart.

382
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,412
I want to know this
floor better than you do.

383
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,547
Right. Wrong.

384
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,753
You're surgical interns.

385
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,599
No one should know
this floor better than you.

386
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,090
You're "Dopey" now.

387
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,204
She's worse than
Medusa. I hate her.

388
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,061
I heard that.

389
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,639
So, we're not sure
if it's cancerous,

390
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,475
but there is a
mass on his liver,

391
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,965
and it is hemorrhaging.

392
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,301
So, we'd like to do a
biopsy as soon as possible.

393
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,519
All right. Of course.

394
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,782
There's something
else. Brian's symptoms...

395
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,126
The jaundice, the hair
loss, the high blood pressure,

396
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,470
coupled with a hepatic
lesion, it's all consistent

397
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:41,245
with the use of
anabolic steroids.

398
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,913
What? What the hell?

399
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,395
Brian...

400
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,930
Are you taking steroids? No.

401
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,194
Have you noticed
changes in behavior?

402
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,923
Moodiness, depression...

403
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,769
Shut up! Just shut up,
I said I don't take them.

404
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,793
Brian.

405
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,511
Unprovoked aggression...

406
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,579
Don't listen to her.

407
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,208
He's not even an athlete.

408
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,015
He's in the Model U.N.

409
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,151
Brian, baby,

410
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,537
just tell me.

411
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,940
If you did it, honey,

412
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,608
just tell me.

413
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,230
I wanted...

414
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,053
Girls only like the guys

415
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,956
with these crazy bodies now.

416
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:33,146
I wanted a shot at
someone liking me.

417
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,256
Brian, how long have
you been taking them?

418
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,568
I swear, I've barely taken any.

419
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,955
For two years.

420
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,675
Since sophomore year.

421
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,624
That's when you
stopped being my boy.

422
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,963
I'm sorry.

423
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,766
I'm so sorry.

424
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,402
I didn't know.

425
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,472
I didn't know.

426
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,094
Wilson, what's the status
on our frequent flyer?

427
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,963
Santa? Mmm-hmm.

428
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,843
I don't know. He wasn't lying.

429
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,945
His labs came back
negative for drugs and alcohol.

430
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,897
He's dehydrated, but otherwise,

431
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:15,034
his chem panel's good, his
blood sugar's surprisingly good.

432
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,736
Treat him and
street him. I'm sorry?

433
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,625
Santa Claus has been
coming here for years.

434
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:20,611
Same symptoms, always
drunk, always nauseous.

435
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,514
We always run multiple tests,
and they're always negative.

436
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,217
He's looking for drugs.

437
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,454
Give him some antiemetics, give him
some food, and send him on his way.

438
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,701
I just feel like
there's more to this...

439
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,674
Wilson, I know
you wanted to help.

440
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,076
But you're a surgical intern,

441
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,843
and your skills are
needed elsewhere,

442
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,714
and we need that bed.

443
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,951
Discharge him, please.

444
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,114
Hey.

445
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,517
It looks like there's
nothing wrong with you.

446
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,520
You guys always say that.

447
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,237
There's nothing more we can do.

448
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,656
So I gotta get.

449
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,241
Yeah.

450
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,376
You got a blanket
I can take with me?

451
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,628
I'm freezing to death.

452
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,102
Hey.

453
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,725
Stop!

454
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,177
You don't get to
have sex with me

455
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,568
and then just walk out

456
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,870
without even so much as
a "Have a nice day," okay?

457
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,483
I deserve more
respect than that.

458
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,373
What about me? What about you?

459
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,586
I have to stick around
and listen to you

460
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,026
compare sex with me
to a fatal car crash?

461
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,628
Hear how repellant,
how disgusting...

462
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,630
No. No, no.

463
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,939
Oh, my God, no.

464
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,468
No, it is not you.

465
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,638
You are great.

466
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,038
You are not the problem.

467
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,475
Okay. So then...

468
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,996
Okay, so, um...

469
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:04,726
So, you know when the
dessert tray comes around,

470
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,161
and you know you should say no

471
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,803
because it's not
nutritious and it's fattening,

472
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,312
and you just, you know
you shouldn't, but...

473
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,417
But, it's right there,

474
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,693
and it's so beautifully made,

475
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,762
and it looks so good.

476
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,008
And you've had it before,

477
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,910
so you just, you know, how...

478
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,701
Right. Delicious it is.

479
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,104
And it's just... It's
right there, you know?

480
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:30,624
I do. Yeah, I know.

481
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,845
So... So you have it.
You have the dessert.

482
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,316
And it is delicious.

483
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,001
I mean, it is

484
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,187
an amazing dessert.

485
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,622
It is really good.

486
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,392
For

487
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,961
a moment,

488
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,031
and then you feel
tired, and bloated,

489
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,599
and gassy,

490
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,836
and so guilty,

491
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,939
like you just erased
all of the exercise

492
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,224
you have ever done,

493
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,569
and tomorrow,
you're gonna wake up

494
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,138
with zits all over your face,

495
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:10,664
and Jesus is so disappointed
in you again. And you just...

496
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,803
Are you kidding me?

497
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,949
Hey. ARIZONA: <i>Did
you send the chart?</i>

498
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,273
I did, an hour ago.

499
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,592
I told my intern to leave
the copies by the door.

500
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,405
Well, did you tell
them to ring the bell?

501
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,128
I would've thought
that that was a given,

502
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,964
but this year's interns

503
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,277
<i>seem more defective than most.</i>

504
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,345
Did you tell me to leave the...

505
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,769
Ah. Speak when you're spoken to.

506
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,403
Yeah. It's outside your door.

507
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,905
Fine.

508
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,512
<i>Would it be safe to
say that that surgery,</i>

509
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,698
<i>the one Dr. Torres
performed on your hand,</i>

510
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,901
was your last hope at
regaining your surgical career?

511
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,606
You could say that.

512
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,740
Dr. Torres, you'd agree

513
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,269
that with the failure
of that surgery,

514
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,353
Dr. Shepherd won't be able to...

515
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,456
Okay, I'm sorry.
Just to be clear,

516
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,879
the surgery didn't fail.

517
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,115
It worked. The
graft failed to take.

518
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:02,511
That was a risk
we were willing...

519
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,485
But Dr. Shepherd
can no longer operate.

520
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,514
No.

521
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,284
We'd hoped we'd
get 100% function...

522
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,951
And it's expected that he
will never operate again.

523
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,709
Um, I didn't say that.

524
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,560
But if it is true,

525
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,997
and you can help
establish that as a fact,

526
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,834
it would raise the award
tremendously, for everyone.

527
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,603
No, in my opinion,
Dr. Shepherd won't operate again.

528
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,595
Can we take a break
for a minute, please?

529
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,681
Okay.

530
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,471
Ah!

531
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,893
Ow. Ow! No! Ah.

532
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,969
I am so sorry. I don't
know what happened.

533
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,415
<i>The stupid intern's gonna
hear about it, though.</i>

534
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,173
No, it's just, it's a huge...

535
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,724
It's a huge waste of my time!

536
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,726
It is, and I'm sorry.

537
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,072
I will find out what
happened to that chart

538
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,296
and get it right over to you.

539
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm sorry, but, Dr. Bailey,

540
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,743
you never told me
to deliver any chart.

541
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:48,983
When you are spoken to.

542
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,392
Dr. Yang, listen, if you
could give me a few minutes.

543
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,072
I really don't have
the time or the need

544
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,429
to keep dragging this out.

545
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:04,142
I Respect that. That's fine.

546
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,649
But you were involved,

547
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,479
and your statement could
benefit your colleagues

548
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,613
and their families.

549
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,948
Anything you could
say might be helpful.

550
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,006
My shoulder hurts sometimes.

551
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,424
I might have had some P.T.S.D.

552
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,732
You did throw that vase at me.

553
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,463
That is hearsay,

554
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,942
or something. Fifteen minutes.

555
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,249
Dr. Yang, Dr. Russell's

556
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,496
post-op aortic ulcer
patient's coughing up blood.

557
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,786
Did you page Russell?

558
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:27,399
He's in surgery.
He said to page you.

559
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,663
Mousey, suction.
Set up for intubation.

560
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,576
Thank you.

561
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,372
Say something that'll
make him feel better.

562
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,774
You're gonna be just fine, sir.

563
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,543
Don't oversell it.
What do you think it is?

564
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,217
Could be a fistula.
Could be a dissection.

565
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,531
We won't know until we get
more studies and open him up.

566
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,555
Yes!

567
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:45,805
Sorry.

568
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,540
Mousey, get a repeat CT stat.

569
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,860
Dopey, prep an OR. You
guys are both scrubbing in.

570
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,311
I need all hands.

571
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,613
Now.

572
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,360
And someone tell Russell
that I'm probably opening up

573
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,117
his aortic ulcer.

574
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,831
She's awesome. I love her.

575
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,974
Get this to path. Get us an
answer as quick as you can.

576
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,043
Got it.

577
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,848
So I'm, uh, willing
to compromise.

578
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,483
I'm gonna let the
ceiling thing go.

579
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,329
Okay, and let the
other four things go,

580
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,497
and then we'll have a deal.

581
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,921
We already have a deal.

582
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,483
Why the sudden need
to be a homeowner, Alex?

583
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,902
Why the sudden need
to be a ball-buster?

584
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,286
Because it's my house.
Seriously, why now?

585
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,294
I've been sleeping
around a lot with interns.

586
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,457
And you need
more space for that?

587
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,131
I just, I...

588
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,876
I'm starting to wonder
if I'm gonna be that guy

589
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,501
who graduated from high school

590
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,237
who hangs out in his El Camino
looking to nail the freshmen.

591
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,365
I don't want to be that guy.

592
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,629
So don't be that guy.

593
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,207
I know. I gotta
grow up a little.

594
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,642
So I stopped calling interns,

595
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,210
I stopped saying "dude,"

596
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,113
and now I just want a place
of my own. You get that, right?

597
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,532
That may just be the
dumbest and the saddest thing

598
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,067
I've ever heard you say.

599
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:49,295
And I've known you a long time.

600
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,492
Sir.

601
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,927
My mother replied to your email.

602
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,312
Oh, dear.

603
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,343
Because I forwarded it
to her, she replied to me.

604
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:11,725
Oh, well. Um, that's
rather graphic, isn't it?

605
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,010
Yeah, she's a wordsmith.

606
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,429
I am asking you
both, begging, actually,

607
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:18,165
that you keep this from
ever happening again.

608
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,154
I'll speak to her.
See that you do.

609
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,386
Sir.

610
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:30,343
Wilson, why did you order an
abdominal CT on Santa Claus

611
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,846
when you discharged
him an hour ago?

612
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:34,995
Because I didn't discharge him.

613
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,768
Well, where is he?

614
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:40,187
He's right here.

615
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:41,415
Hey, there.

616
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,340
Hey.

617
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,010
Excuse us.

618
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,017
You gave him a CT and
an extreme makeover?

619
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,163
You're here to do surgery.

620
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,520
I cleaned him up a little.

621
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,356
Because poor people
don't get good medical care,

622
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,091
or dirty people,
or smelly people.

623
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,343
And if he'd come in, in a
good suit and some cologne,

624
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,111
we'd all be busting
our asses for him

625
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,214
instead of accusing
him of scamming drugs.

626
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,316
I thought, if his scans
show he needs a consult,

627
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:12,419
maybe like this, his next
doctor won't blow him off.

628
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,921
CT's been done.
Wait for the results,

629
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,562
if they're negative, you
send him on his way,

630
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,298
immediately, okay?

631
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:27,768
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

632
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,672
They're waiting for us.

633
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,842
You all right?

634
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,712
You ever wish we would've
just taken the settlement?

635
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,148
Then we wouldn't have
to relive this over and over.

636
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:44,451
Well... None of
us wanted to settle.

637
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,119
I did.

638
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,038
We all did. In fact, we voted.

639
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,388
Then why did you agree not to?

640
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,576
You know why.

641
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,947
That's not fair.

642
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,265
It's true, though.

643
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,544
It came down to
you, and you agreed.

644
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:00,701
Because you pushed us.

645
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,137
You came in late
with your big speech...

646
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,089
What are you... You did, Derek.

647
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,701
You decided and you
pushed... I did not push you.

648
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,102
And when you do that, no
one's gonna go against you.

649
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,071
How was I supposed to
stand up? I did not push you.

650
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,172
And you did the same
thing with your hand.

651
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,391
What are you talking about?

652
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:14,531
I told you, I did not
want to do that surgery.

653
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,777
You suggested that surgery.

654
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,345
Yeah, for someone
else, for Schachter.

655
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,913
I wasn't suggesting it
for me, and I told you that.

656
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,565
But you wouldn't let up
and you made me do it.

657
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,870
Because I thought
you could do it!

658
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:28,189
I believed that you could do it.

659
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,453
That's my fault.

660
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,549
Don't feel bad,
Callie, it's on me.

661
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,960
Bailey, it's Robbins.

662
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,773
I have thoughts on your
case, many thoughts and ideas,

663
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,065
but I can't tell if
they're worthwhile ideas

664
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,167
until I read the chart.

665
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,669
So can you send me
the friggin' chart? Please.

666
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:57,836
Someone suction for me.
- I'll do it.

667
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,938
- I can do it.
- Wait. Earn in.

668
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:01,722
Dopey, what are we
looking at on the scans?

669
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,042
It looks like a dissection
in the ascending aorta

670
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,760
with an aortobronchial fistula.

671
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,818
Good. You're Happy again.

672
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,637
Suction. Mousey,
why did Russell opt

673
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:12,556
for an endovascular
repair of this ulcer?

674
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,408
I, uh... Personal preference?

675
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:17,289
Uh, patient's age
and limited mobility.

676
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,062
Oh, Happy for the win.

677
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,197
Keep on suctioning.
It's a good choice.

678
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,477
But I've learned that sometimes,

679
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,379
it's better to do things
the old-fashioned way.

680
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,035
Mousey, hold this
back here, like this.

681
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,420
Good. What do we see here?

682
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,318
It looks like the stent tore
through the aorta and bronchus.

683
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,991
Ooh, Mousey coming
up from behind.

684
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,877
3-0 Prolene.

685
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,412
This is gonna be a mess.

686
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm sorry, but there are plenty
of other houses in Seattle

687
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,150
for you not to screw interns in.

688
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,658
This is stupid.
I'm calling it off.

689
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,565
You can't do that.
Escrow's practically closed.

690
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,821
Not my problem.

691
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,207
Neither is "repaint marks
on living room ceiling."

692
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:48,653
Oh, come on. It's a tiny list.

693
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,489
Good. Then it shouldn't hurt
when you stick it up your...

694
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,546
I've got the results
back from path.

695
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,214
It's cancer.

696
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,171
Your scans came
back completely clean.

697
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,351
I need you to be
honest with me, please.

698
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,775
Did you come in
here looking for drugs?

699
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,812
Yeah, I did.

700
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,925
Can you help me out with that?

701
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,849
Okay. Get up. Get dressed.

702
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,428
Can I just get an
Aspirin or something?

703
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,517
I mean, any...

704
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,053
Aspirin? You want an Aspirin?

705
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,371
Yeah, I get these headaches

706
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,599
like my head's been run
over by a truck or something.

707
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,593
And the whole world, it
gets louder and brighter.

708
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,395
And I just can't move.

709
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,524
Migraines.

710
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,625
You get migraines?

711
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:28,693
Why didn't you say so?

712
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:32,185
I tried to. I was
going to, but...

713
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,271
But what?

714
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,500
What is it?

715
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:44,648
So, it's cancer?

716
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,382
Yes.

717
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,186
But the good news
is, we got it all.

718
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,665
There is a chance
of reoccurrence

719
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,784
if he continues
to abuse steroids.

720
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,057
He won't.

721
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,764
He was perfect.

722
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:04,334
He was skinny, yes,
and awkward, but...

723
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,137
Funny, smart-alecky...

724
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,873
Thoughtful...

725
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,176
Perfect.

726
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,800
Then he forced himself to...

727
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,447
I thought he was
just being a teenager

728
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:24,587
when he changed so much.

729
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,616
If I had known, I'd have
stopped him, I swear.

730
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:30,977
I'd have done anything.

731
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,316
What's the matter with you?

732
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:37,951
Change your clothes, now.

733
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,286
Yes! That's it! I have
been walking around

734
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,350
in the same vomit-soaked
shirt since this morning.

735
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,237
It couldn't be that I've
been repeatedly puked on

736
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,804
by a patient who pukes all day,

737
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,240
despite the fact that I can't
find anything wrong with him

738
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,309
except extreme
nausea and migraines.

739
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:54,284
No, I must lack the
ability to wash myself

740
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,398
or have absolutely
no self-respect.

741
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,371
You know what?
Speaking of no self-respect.

742
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,091
Call Leah, please.
She is unbearable.

743
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,426
Let her know if you're
done, or bored, or whatever,

744
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,723
because trying to figure it
out is gonna drive her crazy.

745
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,864
Come with me now.

746
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:11,751
He's on the way to
C.C.U. All vitals are stable.

747
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,687
Dr. Yang for the win. Up top.

748
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,634
Uh-uh.

749
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:19,792
Dr. Yang, when did Dr. Russell's
noninvasive TEVAR turn into

750
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:23,279
a bilateral thoracotomy
with bypass?

751
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,560
When Russell's stent tore
through the guy's aorta.

752
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,467
And you couldn't
find the time to just

753
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,580
consult with Russell
first? Yeah, I tried.

754
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:30,915
Russell doesn't
even know you yet.

755
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,105
You don't have free reign

756
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:33,551
to just tear into
someone else's patient.

757
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:34,653
You'll be gone
on your first day.

758
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:35,717
He should thank me.

759
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:38,077
He's probably going to fire you.

760
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,514
Still, it was an amazing...

761
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,771
Shut up.

762
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,993
Hey, hey. You talk
to your wife tonight?

763
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:54,411
No. Why?

764
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,114
Oh, I may have pushed
a thing a little too far,

765
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,423
and now I'm not sure
what you're going home to.

766
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,219
What did you do?

767
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,554
Well...

768
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,343
Bailey? What did you do?

769
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,513
Oh, I may have
pushed it just far enough.

770
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,226
Okay, you gotta go. What?

771
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,317
She's like a, you
know, a little bird.

772
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,952
If we move too fast,
we'll scare her off.

773
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,733
You're too much pressure
now. You gotta go.

774
00:32:21,757 --> 00:32:22,867
Go, go, go!

775
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,708
Okay.

776
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,911
Oh. Yeah, okay.

777
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,860
All right. Come
here, little bird.

778
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,799
I never got the chart.

779
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,101
I am so sorry.

780
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,669
It's right here.

781
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:39,117
You know, you asked for my
help, and I'm happy to help you,

782
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,952
but I can't do that unless
I have the information.

783
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:44,027
Again, so sorry.

784
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:46,440
You know, when you say you're
gonna do something, you should...

785
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,165
Oh, ah. Uh-huh.
Right. Right here.

786
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,667
The pulmonary infiltrate.

787
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,530
I knew it. I think she
has Lemierre's disease.

788
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,681
People still get Lemierre's?

789
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,771
Well, I think she does.

790
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,117
You can confirm
with an I.J. ultrasound.

791
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,674
Now, what's that gonna show?

792
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,243
Ugh. Come on.

793
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,611
Lemierre's has markers.

794
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,846
The pneumonia, the
complaints of shoulder pain.

795
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,915
And she might have
an I.J. thrombosis,

796
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,728
but we'll see if we
caught that early enough.

797
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,980
But her throat cultures
have been negative so far.

798
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:13,507
Yeah, it's tricky, and we see it
so seldom now, we overlook it.

799
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,594
You spoke to my mother?

800
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,895
Mmm. I did.

801
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:22,465
So there won't be any
more miscommunications?

802
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,966
Shouldn't be.

803
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,403
Appreciate it if you could
just keep it to yourselves.

804
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,771
Well, we can certainly do that.

805
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,890
Thank you.

806
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,090
If you can.

807
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,992
Sorry?

808
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,806
Well, when I get an email
that's not meant for me,

809
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,897
I hit a quick
reply or delete it.

810
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,042
You've been running
back and forth,

811
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,699
making sure I hear
from Catherine,

812
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,978
making sure she hears from me,

813
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,502
making sure we connect.

814
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:46,907
I think maybe you aren't as
upset as you pretend you are.

815
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:48,536
Oh, I'm not? I think you're glad

816
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,511
your mother's found someone
who makes her happy.

817
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
You just don't
want to admit that.

818
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,537
Just keep it out of my inbox.

819
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:03,673
So, tell me the name again.

820
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,708
Cyclic vomiting syndrome.

821
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,672
It's been linked to
mitochondrial disease.

822
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:09,029
We see it a lot in kids.

823
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:12,264
Good labs, extreme
nausea, vomiting for days.

824
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,712
It's a bitch to diagnose,
so the parents go crazy.

825
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,748
I thought it was the booze I
was taking for the headaches.

826
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,188
No, it's the migraines.

827
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,724
That's what triggers
the vomiting episodes.

828
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,158
But there's no cure?

829
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,805
Not yet, but now that
we know what it is,

830
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,328
we can treat the migraines.

831
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,574
And I don't have to
live like this anymore?

832
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,081
No, you don't.

833
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,499
Oh, this works on migraines

834
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,612
and should lessen
your C.V.S. symptoms.

835
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,848
We're gonna set you up
with a primary care doctor.

836
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,516
But if this happens
again, you come back,

837
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,207
you, uh, look for us,

838
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,342
either Dr. Wilson or myself.

839
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,860
We'll take good care of you.

840
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,406
Thank you. Yeah.

841
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,275
Sure saved my biscuits
from the fire on this one, Doc.

842
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,715
Thanks. Oh, thank her.

843
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,518
Someone else might
have let your biscuits burn.

844
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,323
Darlin',

845
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:53,673
I could hug you.

846
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:55,441
Oh, that's fine.

847
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,594
Except you're a
little pukey there.

848
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,925
You know as well as I do, I
had no other choice but to...

849
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,149
Let's wait and see
what Russell says.

850
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,594
If you didn't want me here,

851
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:08,936
you shouldn't
have hired me back.

852
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:12,036
Dr. Hunt, Dr. Yang,
what happened?

853
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,871
I had to go in on
your aortic ulcer.

854
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,815
He had hemoptysis...

855
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:22,435
The patient is stable now.

856
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:24,270
We can talk about
Dr. Yang's decision...

857
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,872
Dr. Yang...

858
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:27,657
Thank you.

859
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,525
Good save.

860
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,112
And thank you, Hunt.
You're absolutely right.

861
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,900
Now I know why you
pushed so hard for her.

862
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,234
Great work.

863
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,845
Uh, could you take
out your tape recorder?

864
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,604
I need to retract
my earlier statement,

865
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,038
testimony or whatever.

866
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,401
Well, I'm not sure
anything you said was...

867
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:01,991
I lied before.

868
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,327
I do believe Dr. Shepherd
can operate again.

869
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,364
Well, that's
speculation, not fact.

870
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,548
It's a fact that
nerve regeneration

871
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:10,984
is very slow.

872
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,685
His nerve may need more time.

873
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,465
And there are also new
nerve connectors we could try

874
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:16,367
for closer approximation
of the severed ends.

875
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:17,891
That's a fact.

876
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,188
And we could still try
an end-to-end transfer.

877
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:23,396
We haven't even tried to
take a branch of the M.A.B.C.

878
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:25,243
You've given this some thought.

879
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,250
Yeah.

880
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:29,464
Every single night since
you dropped that instrument.

881
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,320
Why didn't you mention
any of this before?

882
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,803
Because I was scared.

883
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,645
Because I felt
like I failed you.

884
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,291
But you weren't wrong
to believe in me, Derek.

885
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,425
And you weren't wrong to push.

886
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,550
In fact, you should've
pushed me harder.

887
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,886
We haven't tried everything.

888
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,155
You shouldn't
give up until we do.

889
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:57,925
All right, listen...

890
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,132
I am sorry, okay?

891
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,712
I'm sure that you would
prefer your booty calls

892
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,769
to be uncomplicated
and void of feeling,

893
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,049
so I think you should probably just
seek them somewhere else, okay?

894
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,689
'Cause I know this
is just sex to you.

895
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,825
It's not just sex.

896
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,855
I mean, I wish it was.
I pretend that it is,

897
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,640
'cause you have a good thing
going with Jesus, but it's not.

898
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,130
It's not?

899
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,639
No, and stop calling me
a car crash, or dessert,

900
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,152
or acting like I'm
bumming out Jesus.

901
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:21,837
I'm sorry. You made
it seem like it was...

902
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,584
And stop acting like I don't
have any feelings, okay?

903
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,735
I have feelings. I
have a lot of 'em.

904
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,759
About what?

905
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,747
You. About you, April. For you.

906
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:37,070
I'm so sorry that I hurt them,

907
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,955
your feelings...

908
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,023
It's okay. Just...

909
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,825
I thought it was just sex.

910
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:43,960
Mmm.

911
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,429
Yeah, so did I.

912
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:49,993
Okay. Have a good night.

913
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,150
Talk to you tomorrow.

914
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,727
I didn't stay to
nail the freshmen.

915
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,809
I know. You stayed for Robbins.

916
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,666
Yeah, and you know
what she told me?

917
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,685
That I'm a nobody.
That I have no one.

918
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,874
She told me that I have
nothing to show for my life.

919
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:13,889
I want your house,
Mer, 'cause...

920
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,877
I don't know why, I just do.

921
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:21,497
The chips on the ceiling are from the
first Christmas tree we got, intern year.

922
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,194
You wouldn't know that,
because we didn't like you then.

923
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,930
And the burn marks
on the hardwoods

924
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:29,183
are from flame shots from
that stupid party Izzie threw.

925
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,285
And the scratch marks on
the doorjamb in the study

926
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,671
are Zola's height marks,
since she could stand.

927
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:36,640
And the ones on the other side
are from me when I was little.

928
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,393
I grew up there, Alex. It's
hard for me to change things.

929
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,561
And you grew up there, too,

930
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,818
so before you go

931
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,497
trying to change
everything about yourself,

932
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,321
you got yourself this far,

933
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,700
and you're fine the way
you are, and so is the house.

934
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,968
So, I'm not changing anything.

935
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,152
You can if you
want, but I won't.

936
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,013
Okay.

937
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,698
We got a deal?

938
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,702
We got a deal.

939
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:02,866
What about the dry rot, though?

940
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,557
Would you get away
from me with the dry rot?

941
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,278
Thank you all for
your cooperation today.

942
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,708
Next step is for us to file a
complaint against the parties.

943
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,732
Can we leave the
pilot out of this?

944
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,100
The man is a paraplegic now.

945
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,564
Yeah, I agree. We
should take him off the list.

946
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,921
Wait. No. What if he
was drunk, or asleep...

947
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,256
No, we talked to him.

948
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,792
Dr. Hunt, I'm gonna have
to ask you to step out now.

949
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,477
This is only appropriate
for the victims of the crash.

950
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:26,578
Oh.

951
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,942
Okay.

952
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,137
Folks, we're not
going after the pilot.

953
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,285
We need to investigate
him to make our case,

954
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:39,720
but the damages we'll be
seeking will be far greater

955
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,645
than what that pilot
could be accountable for.

956
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,047
Or the charter
company, for that matter.

957
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,084
We'll be going
after bigger fish.

958
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,620
More and more, it's
looking like the best strategy

959
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,690
will be to look for fault
with the hospital itself.

960
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:55,676
Boise?

961
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:56,976
No, this hospital.

962
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,913
The people who
put you on that plane.

963
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,335
All right. Well...

964
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:09,022
Looks fine.

965
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,667
<i>It can be scary to find out</i>

966
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,731
<i>you've been wrong
about something.</i>

967
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,615
<i>But we can't be afraid
to change our minds...</i>

968
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,294
You're right. You
are absolutely right...

969
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,485
<i>To accept that
things are different...</i>

970
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,469
<i>That they'll never
be the same...</i>

971
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,570
Promise me you'll take this.

972
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,260
I will. Thank you.

973
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,964
<i>For better...</i>

974
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,307
<i>Or for worse.</i>

975
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,506
<i>We have to be willing to give
up what we used to believe.</i>

976
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:20,210
God! You scared me.

977
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,622
What the hell are
you doing here?

978
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,646
Mer gave me the keys.

979
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,163
Mer just sold me this place.

980
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,864
I know.

981
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:26,950
I want to rent from you.

982
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,451
No, no. I said no roommates.

983
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,720
Oh, come on. It's
fine. It's a big house.

984
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:34,324
We work weird hours.
We'll barely see each other.

985
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,507
You won't know I'm here.

986
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,796
<i>The more we're willing
to accept what is...</i>

987
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,966
<i>And not what we thought...</i>

988
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,134
What?

989
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,404
You asking me for help.

990
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,906
Well, when you put it like
that, I want to kill myself.

991
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,296
The master's mine.

992
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:57,980
Rent's due on the first.

993
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,449
You buy the toilet paper.

994
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,352
<i>We'll find ourselves
exactly where we belong.</i>
