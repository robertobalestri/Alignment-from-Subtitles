1
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,719
<i>Surgeons don't compromise.</i>

2
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:07,222
Derek Shepherd.

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,525
Multiple hand fractures
with a median nerve injury.

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,495
Arizona Robbins,
open femur fracture

5
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:16,431
with resultant
above-knee amputation.

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,268
Lexie Grey, deceased.

7
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:22,938
Mark Sloan, deceased.

8
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:24,217
This doesn't include extreme...

9
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,593
<i>We defy death. We
exceed perfection.</i>

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,923
<i>We operate for 17 hours
straight if we have to.</i>

11
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,425
Wish for me to extend
their deepest condolences.

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,593
How is... How is the
investigation going?

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,311
Have they found
what caused the crash?

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,931
The investigation could take
years. That's why we want to help you

15
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,354
put this tragedy behind you.

16
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:42,702
I think you mean, your clients
would like to put it behind them.

17
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,826
So I am authorized at this time

18
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,212
to propose a
one-time settlement.

19
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,948
Bayview Aeronautics
takes your loss seriously.

20
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:56,237
Now the settlement
agreement must be unanimous,

21
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,139
and it releases
Bayview Aeronautics

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:02,110
from any and all other claims,
known or unknown, but...

23
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,746
Most important,
it will allow you

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,349
to put this painful
time behind you

25
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,801
and move on with your lives.

26
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,629
<i>We aren't built to settle.</i>

27
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>But that doesn't mean we won't.</i>

28
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,787
Wow. OWEN: <i>Yeah.</i>

29
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,889
That's a lot of money. <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,114
And they need an
answer in three days.

31
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,649
Oh. Uh...

32
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,768
Okay.

33
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,596
How you been? <i>Okay.</i>

34
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,705
You?

35
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:32,874
I'm fine.

36
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,927
Good.

37
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,244
<i>So...</i>

38
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,393
You'll call me when you decide?

39
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:39,749
Yeah.

40
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,017
Yeah.

41
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,284
<i>Should we settle?</i>

42
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,988
Should we not settle?

43
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,556
I don't know.

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,859
We should go to sleep.

45
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,562
Do you want to keep
the lights on or off tonight?

46
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,664
On, please.

47
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,877
Do you know what this
money could mean for us,

48
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,578
for Sofia?

49
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,514
I mean, she won't have to
take out loans for med school.

50
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,437
We'd be taken care of.

51
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,106
You and me and Sofia.

52
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,929
I think that's what
Mark would want.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,345
You know what I want?

54
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,513
More than anything?

55
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,915
I want to know
what you're thinking,

56
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,033
what you want.

57
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:33,435
Just...

58
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,925
Okay, well, the home health
care nurse will be here soon.

59
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,248
Try to be nice.

60
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,350
Don't throw things
at this one, okay?

61
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,935
Just...

62
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,202
Let her help you.

63
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,092
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

64
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,563
Hey, Alex.

65
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,499
Why did an intern just
give me a compliment

66
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,284
on the crown moldings
in my empty house?

67
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,752
Are you still sleeping there?

68
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,837
Chicks like it better
than the on-call room.

69
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,755
Okay, that's disgusting.

70
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,157
Now I have to have the place
tented. Give me back my key.

71
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,492
You don't even
live there anymore.

72
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,482
What do you care? Key. Please.

73
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,884
Hey, you guys.

74
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,904
Can you believe we're
in the attendings' lounge?

75
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,456
April, what are you doing here?

76
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:30,175
Oh, uh, Hunt came and
got me on the farm in Moline.

77
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,889
I was giving the pigs their
breakfast, and I turn around,

78
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,891
and there's Dr. Hunt,
offering me my job back.

79
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,799
He didn't tell you guys?

80
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,068
Did anyone else see
Dr. Hunt in the barnyard?

81
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,153
When he appeared unto
you, was he glowing at all?

82
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,619
April?

83
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,821
Hunt hired her back.

84
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,255
We think. It might
have been Jesus.

85
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,657
I thought you went to Tulane.

86
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,715
Yeah. No, I changed my mind.

87
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,252
Hey, you people are attendings.

88
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,337
You do not change
clothes in front of everyone

89
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,038
like animals or interns,

90
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,174
because nobody
wants to see all that.

91
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,392
Apparently Kepner does.

92
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,626
What?

93
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,430
No, I don't. I wasn't...

94
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,198
Gotta go. Me too. Welcome back.

95
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,009
Glad you're back.

96
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,443
I am back...

97
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,678
Too.

98
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,513
I'm also glad

99
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,749
to be back.

100
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,001
Okay.

101
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,494
Morning, Dr. Bailey.

102
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:44,132
I cannot get used to having
them in the attendings' lounge.

103
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,302
Well, I'm still getting
used to having you in here.

104
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:53,891
Dr. Yang. Famous and infamous.

105
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,893
Come on in and take a load off.

106
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,846
You took a break.

107
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,015
I did.

108
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,799
Some R&R. Yes.

109
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,462
Feels good,
doesn't it? Fantastic.

110
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,947
What'd you see? I went
to the Mall of America.

111
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,221
I rode the roller coaster.

112
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,023
I purchased jeggings. I'm
ready to get back to work.

113
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,393
You went on the Internet and
searched "Mall of America."

114
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,743
I am gonna be a team player. I
mean it. I heard what you said, sir.

115
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,183
Then put on some
scrubs, young lady.

116
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,819
Thank you.

117
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,954
I saw you have a
laser revascularization...

118
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,423
You'll be working with
Dr. Thomas for now.

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,027
I'll believe team player
when I see it, Dr. Yang.

120
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,475
I got your text. What do we got?

121
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,010
16-year-old kid, fished her out
of the sound, sailing accident.

122
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,617
You mind? Sorry.

123
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,217
Why are you following me?

124
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,908
I'm your intern for the day.

125
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,854
Well, hello, intern.
You have a name?

126
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,878
Jo Wilson.

127
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,146
Nice. I like chicks
with boys' names.

128
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,165
Karev.

129
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,784
What? I do. It's hot.

130
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,797
Stop sleeping with your
coworkers. It ruins them.

131
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,937
I slept with you.

132
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,034
And now I no longer
sleep with men.

133
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,126
Roxie Meyers, 30,

134
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,063
here for excess skin removal
after a 100-pound weight loss

135
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,431
two years ago.

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,740
117 pounds.

137
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,050
Frank.

138
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,763
I can't help it if
I'm proud of you.

139
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,881
And we've set up a consult

140
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,454
from general for
the hernia repair?

141
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,633
I did, yeah.

142
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:15,756
Hey, I'm it.

143
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,892
I am... I'm your consult.

144
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,728
Okay. Hi.

145
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,598
Dr. Kepner is going
to repair your hernia.

146
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,916
Hi.

147
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,502
So I'll just need to go
over some incision points.

148
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,154
Honey, could you...

149
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,001
They want me to
take off my robe.

150
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,785
Roxie, this is a big operation.

151
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,321
I want to know everything
that's gonna happen to you.

152
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,912
Frank, please.

153
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,298
This is my fiancee,
love of my life.

154
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,095
You guys do a good job, okay?

155
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,119
Of course.

156
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:47,466
I'll be right outside, babe.

157
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,990
Okay.

158
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,962
All right.

159
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:55,730
Okay.

160
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:59,651
Now I'm gonna start
with some incisions here.

161
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
And here. The man's a saint.

162
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,422
We've been together two
years and we still haven't...

163
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,408
You know, had sex.

164
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,838
I mean, when we cuddle,
when he squeezes me here,

165
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,862
it makes me cringe.

166
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,214
I just want to feel pretty.

167
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,493
You're already pretty.

168
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,783
You sound like Frank.

169
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,947
Do you have any questions
for me before the surgery?

170
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,904
Just one. When? I'm sorry?

171
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,584
I think she wants to know
when she and Frank...

172
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,752
When can I jump his bones?

173
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,127
Your incisions will be
healed in about two weeks.

174
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,232
So after that, you and Frank
can be as physical as you like.

175
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,901
Two weeks? Okay.
Wow. I just got butterflies.

176
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,602
Okay, Emery, we're gonna

177
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,869
need to take a look at your leg.

178
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,371
You and you, start
cutting off the splint

179
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,873
so we can see what we've got.
- I can't feel my foot.

180
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,830
Can you tell us what happened?

181
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,777
Yeah, this massive wave came
up and the mast crushed my leg,

182
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,111
and then... And then
<i>Pickle</i> just rolled over.

183
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,196
<i>Pickle?</i> My boat.

184
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,648
God, I can't believe I lost her.

185
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,337
Why can't I feel my foot?

186
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,067
Okay, who else was
on the boat with you?

187
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,270
No one. I'm doing a solo
sail from Mexico to Alaska.

188
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,060
Oh, my God. Doppler. Doppler.

189
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,562
Is that...

190
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,992
Her tibia and fibula, I think.

191
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,661
What's wrong? Everything's fine.

192
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,329
Just try to stay calm, okay? Do
you know where your parents are?

193
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,964
I sailed here from
Mexico by myself.

194
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,549
I don't need you to
wait for my parents.

195
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,733
Tell me what's happening.

196
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,135
I'm not getting a pulse.

197
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,469
Okay, Emery, I am so sorry,

198
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,843
but we might not be able
to save your foot, okay?

199
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,879
No! Your injury's very severe.

200
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,548
It's mangled and
there's no blood flow.

201
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,348
Give her five of morphine!

202
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,434
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Oh, my God.

203
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,887
She moved her toes
with a nearly severed foot,

204
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,322
so the tibial nerve's
probably still intact, right?

205
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,859
So, Dr. Torres, you think
you can actually save the foot?

206
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,672
Well, when we get in there
and do some nerve testing,

207
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,207
we'll be able to assess
the damage better.

208
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,442
I spoke to her parents.
Their flight gets in late tonight.

209
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,643
Great. Do you want to scrub in?

210
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,778
Hell, yeah.

211
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,068
All right.

212
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,884
This might take a while.
I need you to stay back

213
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,384
and monitor my pre-
and post-ops. But...

214
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,786
I had hoped since I was the
one that saw the toes move,

215
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,409
I'd hoped that I...

216
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,179
But you need me to monitor
your pre- and post-ops.

217
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,965
Got it. Great.

218
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,911
You could've let her scrub in

219
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,375
or stand in the
back and observe.

220
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,363
Why? Because she has joy.

221
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,806
I like joy, excitement,
happiness,

222
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,352
people looking at
me like I know things.

223
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,404
She practically squealed
when I mentioned nerve testing.

224
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,805
There needs to
be more squealing.

225
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,207
I can squeal if you want me to.

226
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,842
That sounds dirty
and inappropriate.

227
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,506
Which I hear is your
specialty these days.

228
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,105
I brought a Tater Tot hot dish.

229
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,440
You didn't!

230
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,009
Rina also brought
Tater Tot hot dish.

231
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,318
It's Pop Pop's favorite.

232
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,796
I know it is, love.
That's why I brought it.

233
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,115
Okay, you know Pop
Pop has an enlarged heart.

234
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,635
So he can't be having
a Tater Tot hot dish.

235
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,054
Not even a bite?

236
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,332
It's his last meal.

237
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,196
No, you get a last
meal before they kill you.

238
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,687
We're not planning
on doing that.

239
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,628
Dr. Yang.

240
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,096
Hi, Dr. Thomas.

241
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,533
Never show up in Mr. Patel's
room during visiting hours.

242
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,201
Now you tell me.

243
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,116
Are you still planning on doing

244
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,684
the ventricular
reduction surgery?

245
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,658
Yes, I spoke to him
about it this morning.

246
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,189
Wouldn't an LVAD be in order?

247
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,580
An LVAD is a Band-Aid.

248
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,217
Ventricular
reduction is a repair.

249
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,247
You'll be hacking off
working heart muscle.

250
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,204
So that what's left can
work more efficiently.

251
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,185
This is an extremely high-risk
procedure when there's a simple fix.

252
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,776
People die from this surgery.

253
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,278
Not when I do it, they don't.

254
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:41,556
How does such a tiny
human make such a big mess?

255
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:45,076
Should we settle?
It's a lot of money.

256
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,989
We could stop work,
travel for a while,

257
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,157
show Zola the world.

258
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,848
Zola wants to see the park

259
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,150
and the pond and the
turtle that lives in the pond.

260
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,395
Okay, so we don't settle.

261
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,970
Not settling means
what, years of litigation

262
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,323
and thousands of dollars
looking for answers?

263
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,592
And it's not gonna
bring Mark or Lexie back.

264
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,128
Traveling the
world sounds better.

265
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,762
Yeah, it does.

266
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,498
Hey. What?

267
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,501
So you realize,
Zola's sleeping...

268
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,864
And all we're doing is talking?

269
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,621
You're right.

270
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,167
I can do that... Something
about that right now.

271
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,535
Let me get that
little... What is this?

272
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,159
Ow! Ow!

273
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:19,693
There's a block
under my... Okay.

274
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,906
Shh! Don't wake
her up. Be quiet.

275
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,962
Okay. Shh.

276
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,619
Hey.

277
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,927
Hey.

278
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,855
Uh, we...

279
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,768
We should agree
on the positioning

280
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,604
for the incisions
for our surgery,

281
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:38,108
so that I can have good
visibility for the hernia.

282
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,865
Yeah. Um...

283
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,284
I'm gonna go in
here and then here.

284
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,087
Great. Good. Okay.

285
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,456
That looks good. Good.

286
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,992
So you staying here or a
hotel? What's going on?

287
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,761
Uh, yes.

288
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,831
Here until I find a place.

289
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,133
Yeah.

290
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,936
I didn't call you, April,
because I didn't...

291
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,373
I'm revirginizing.

292
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,671
It's... It's a thing,
revirginizing.

293
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,456
It involves a lot of prayer,
which I had time to do in Moline,

294
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,665
staring at the 'N SYNC
posters on my wall,

295
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,078
which kind of makes me think
of Jesus as Justin Timberlake,

296
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,713
but my pastor says
that's totally fine,

297
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,248
you know, as long as
I'm still talking to him,

298
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,533
keeping the lines of
communication open.

299
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,656
Okay, April, you...

300
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:24,125
It's my second chance, Jackson.

301
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,238
And I didn't think I'd get one,

302
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:30,281
but then Dr. Hunt showed up in
Moline and offered me my job back,

303
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,949
and that was my sign

304
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,386
that I get to recommit
myself to God.

305
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:40,241
I can accept his forgiveness
and... And have a second chance.

306
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,077
A do-over, you know,
without all the mistakes,

307
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:45,380
just slate wiped clean.

308
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,505
I am... Revirginizing.

309
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,867
Yes.

310
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,468
Which is really
your way of saying

311
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,221
that you want to pretend
that you and I never happened.

312
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,891
No, that is not...

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
It's... It's... It's
not that simple.

314
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,876
Okay. That'll do it.

315
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Thank you, Doctor.

316
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,968
Dr. Yang.

317
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,805
How is the great surgeon
from Seattle on this fine day?

318
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,140
Great.

319
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,825
You can't fool me.

320
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,527
I am a reader of faces,
and your face tells me...

321
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,196
This is one of the finest
cardiothoracic centers in the country.

322
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,201
I came here to do innovative,
cutting-edge surgeries with you,

323
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,871
not ventricular reductions with
Thomas is what my face tells you.

324
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,985
Look, everybody
has to take a shift.

325
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,591
Babysit the old man.

326
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,072
Put your time in, and I'll see
to it that you join me in the OR

327
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,176
very soon.

328
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,632
On something good?

329
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:58,386
Well, I'm consulting on
a guy with mitral regurg.

330
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,388
Are you doing a
mitral annuloplasty?

331
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,390
Probably.

332
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,670
And I'll relocate the tip of
the posterior papillary muscle.

333
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:05,877
Are you serious?

334
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,106
As a heart attack.

335
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,132
Cardio humor. Oh, yes, sir.

336
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,918
I am laughing,
just not externally.

337
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,114
Let me see a smile then.

338
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,117
No, let me see
the great Dr. Yang

339
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,107
turn her frown upside down.

340
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,767
Better.

341
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:33,999
I hope you won't be
offended if I tell you

342
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,007
that you have a very nice smile.

343
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,099
<i>Look at this!</i>

344
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,527
Kepner is doing
an umbilical hernia

345
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,762
her first week back.

346
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,248
Uh-huh.

347
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,368
She failed her boards.

348
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:49,320
She was fired, twice.

349
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,689
The closest that girl has
been to an OR in months

350
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,542
is what, the Moline
large animal vet?

351
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,663
Her head is not in the game.
She has other things on her mind,

352
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,667
things I don't even
want to think about.

353
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,636
So... What, you're gonna
pull her off the surgery,

354
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,632
do it yourself?
Don't be ridiculous.

355
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,057
I'm getting her a babysitter.

356
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,529
<i>Hey, Cristina. April's back.</i>

357
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,697
Yeah, I heard.

358
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,164
<i>Owen went to a pig farm?</i>

359
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,016
So you're talking to Owen?

360
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,818
<i>Yeah, about the settlement.</i>

361
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,137
Hey, what's up, Yang?

362
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,291
<i>I'm about to be
accomplice to a murder.</i>

363
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,479
I always knew you'd
find your specialty.

364
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,278
What are you...

365
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,484
Actually, I know,

366
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,670
let's pretend this
never happened.

367
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,623
What...

368
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,229
What?

369
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,418
Show me. Show me.

370
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,370
Dr. Bailey, all respect,

371
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,688
but I can handle a
hernia repair on my own.

372
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,136
<i>Well, you've been
working with pigs.</i>

373
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,954
<i>Maybe she's worried you'll
slaughter someone out of habit.</i>

374
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:04,306
So have you thought
about the settlement?

375
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,763
What do you want to do?

376
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,664
<i>I don't know.</i>

377
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,428
<i>Whatever everybody
else wants to do.</i>

378
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:11,085
I'm a team player, Mer.

379
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,586
Apparently, so am I.

380
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,453
We were able to restore blood
flow to your daughter's foot.

381
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,255
So it looks like we're
gonna be able to save it.

382
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,529
It'll be a long, hard
process, but she's tough.

383
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,565
She sure is. You have no idea.

384
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:25,874
Mom, look.

385
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,530
That's a beautiful boat, but...

386
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,854
Yeah, they want to donate it

387
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,567
'cause they heard
about the accident.

388
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,102
I think we need to wait and
hear what Dr. Torres has to say.

389
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,770
No, if I get back out there
within the next two weeks,

390
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,078
I can still make it before
the weather gets really bad.

391
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,507
Or I could just
amputate your foot,

392
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,127
and you could be up
and out of here in a week.

393
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,667
Or I could get you
close to full function back,

394
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:48,172
but it means a series of pretty
big operations over a few months,

395
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,561
and you have to stay
off the foot completely.

396
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,361
Fine. Let's do it.

397
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,341
Actually, you guys
have to give consent.

398
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,665
Well, is...

399
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,050
Just say you consent.

400
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,638
Yeah.

401
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,107
I bought you a coffee.

402
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,310
Wow. Thanks.

403
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,982
You have a nice smile.

404
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,149
Thanks.

405
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,785
And, uh...

406
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,131
Just beautiful...

407
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,232
Eyes.

408
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:22,985
You know, if you want to drab...

409
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,609
Grab a drink later or...

410
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,988
Okay. I know this
Mexican place...

411
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,895
Okay, okay, okay,
you're flirting with me,

412
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,965
which is really sweet
or would be really sweet

413
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,450
if you were into ladies,

414
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,263
but I'm guessing that
you're not a lady lover,

415
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,288
'cause you also look
terrified that I might say yes.

416
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,141
You're poking a bear,

417
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,543
a very horny bear.

418
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,196
And what would you
do if the bear said yes?

419
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,249
And there you'd be,
trading sexual favors for...

420
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,985
I don't know what it is
you want from me, so...

421
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,387
You're gonna have to tell me.

422
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:54,700
I was wondering if
it would be possible

423
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:57,044
to scrub in on
your next surgery.

424
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,526
Okay, A, never trade sex

425
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,139
for scrubbing in because
that's just skanky.

426
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,774
Save it for actually
getting to cut.

427
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,165
And, B, you're giving
coffee to the wrong person.

428
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,068
Alex, your intern
brought you coffee.

429
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,704
Cool.

430
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,326
I was wondering if
it would be possible

431
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,377
to scrub in on
your next surgery.

432
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:18,873
That's not gonna happen.

433
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,737
But, hey, grab me another
coffee. That was great.

434
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,320
Go.

435
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,782
Shoot. This defect's too big.

436
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,201
I'm gonna need
some mesh. Suction.

437
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:30,953
Here's an idea.
Let's just pretend

438
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,437
that the patient never
even had a hernia,

439
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,873
then you wouldn't
have to do anything.

440
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:35,780
Would you stop? This
is not a joke to me.

441
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,242
No, you said you're
pretending that...

442
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,794
What are we talking about?
If you would just listen.

443
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,062
I'm not pretending
it never happened.

444
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,530
What never
happened? It happened.

445
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,915
I know it happened. Could
someone just please...

446
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,689
But now I am wiping
the slate clean.

447
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,651
By acting like it
never happened. No!

448
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,035
- What never happened?
- Nothing!

449
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,249
I...

450
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,414
Oh...

451
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,638
My...

452
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,706
God.

453
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,353
Hey. Derek.

454
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,910
You... You doing a consult?

455
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,289
No, actually, I have
a question for you.

456
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:26,414
Do you remember
the Donna Drake case?

457
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,582
About six years ago,
mother of twin girls.

458
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,347
Remember it? I can't ever
forget it. I won't ever forget it.

459
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,549
How much did the hospital
end up settling with the family?

460
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,939
Ooh. Wow. It was a lot.

461
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,586
I can check the exact amount,

462
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,720
but it was definitely
the largest settlement

463
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,788
that I can remember.

464
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,762
Because it was our
fault that she died.

465
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,096
It's pretty standard.

466
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,965
The bigger the mistake,
the bigger the payout.

467
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,230
They offering you a
pretty big settlement?

468
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,520
Yeah.

469
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,589
Yeah, they are.

470
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,427
<i>So you'll meet with
everyone else tomorrow,</i>

471
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,314
<i>see what they want to
do, and that's that, I guess.</i>

472
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,382
I mean...

473
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,270
I guess I want to go with
what everyone else decides.

474
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,989
Okay.

475
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:15,112
<i>Oh, there is this woman
with, like, the most</i>

476
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,381
nasal voice you've
ever heard of.

477
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,951
She does the code calls
here. They're unintelligible.

478
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,013
I mean, everyone
understands 'em, but to me,

479
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:24,015
<i>it's like a foreign
language.</i> That's funny.

480
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,216
Yeah. You got...
You gotta hear it.

481
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,606
<i>Sure.</i>

482
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,837
You know what? Just
wait. It'll happen any second.

483
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,993
<i>Okay.</i>

484
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,350
She was a virgin.

485
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,424
I know that.

486
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,670
You defiled a virgin.

487
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,774
Stop hitting my head. I...

488
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,045
I will go full crazy
on you. All right?

489
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,642
I am a grown ass man.
She's a grown woman.

490
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,860
Yeah, but she's...

491
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,383
She's what, April Kepner?

492
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,352
Believe me, she is grown.

493
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:13,471
I didn't manipulate her.

494
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:17,308
I didn't defile her or trick
her. I didn't take her virginity.

495
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,677
She... She gave it to me.

496
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,012
All right? This isn't about
something I did to her.

497
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,283
This is something we did
together, and she can't handle that.

498
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,885
So she is praying...

499
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,621
To Justin Timberlake,
apparently.

500
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,123
And I'm pissed.
And... It's a mess.

501
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,692
So just stop hitting my head.

502
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,181
So Alex is a diseased
man-whore again,

503
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,884
and April Kepner
is no longer a virgin.

504
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:46,587
Wow! I missed a lot
with that plane crash.

505
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,789
Yeah, you missed a whole lot.

506
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,292
The chief banged my mom.

507
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,794
What? The...

508
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:56,112
Owen banged...

509
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,101
Webber. Webber.
Dr. Webber banged my mom.

510
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,683
Oh.

511
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,168
Oh!

512
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,171
Oh, my God. Yeah, I know.

513
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,841
Well... If it makes you feel any
better, he banged my mom, too.

514
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,328
That makes me feel worse.

515
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,252
Just let her come down
here for a little while.

516
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,387
Did you check the
I's and O's on 31-50?

517
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:21,516
<i>I did this morning.</i>

518
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,218
She doesn't stop
crapping and peeing

519
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,520
just because you
want to watch a surgery.

520
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,704
Go and check them again.

521
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,205
What is your problem?
My problem is,

522
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,657
I have 40 patients
on my service.

523
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,942
The new PEDs
attending is an idiot,

524
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,332
and I need help.

525
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,594
So until your wife comes
back to the hospital,

526
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,697
I need my interns
to actually work.

527
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,158
My wife is disabled.

528
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,859
My daughter's father is dead.

529
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,456
There's nothing we
can do about that,

530
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,790
but this money will
pay for Arizona's rehab.

531
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,015
It would take care
of our little girl,

532
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,166
Mark's little girl.

533
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,563
This is a huge amount of money.

534
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,898
It's a life-changing
amount of money.

535
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,516
All right, so you're
saying we take it.

536
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,805
I'm just saying,

537
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,070
you don't walk away from
a number like this, right?

538
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,227
Well, I'm still
talking to Cristina,

539
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,679
but I think she'd
want to take it, yeah.

540
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,883
Mer?

541
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,534
Yeah. I mean, I guess, yeah.

542
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,020
Derek, what do you think?

543
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,289
It has to be unanimous.
What do you say?

544
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,580
I say, we have until tomorrow.

545
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,401
<i>I googled you.</i>

546
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,521
I know how to do it
even though I'm old.

547
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,607
I know what googling is.

548
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,510
I googled you, and it said
that you were in a plane crash.

549
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,199
Am I talking to myself?

550
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,518
I would rather talk
about the medicine.

551
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:47,024
Okay. Notice how I close
without using felt pledgets.

552
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,645
You impressed? I know you are.

553
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:54,181
You're just too
prideful to admit it,

554
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,502
but that's okay. It comes
together impeccably.

555
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,411
I didn't think that
was possible.

556
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,489
I mean, I've tried to
suture myocardium before

557
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,669
without synthetic patches
and couldn't get it to hold.

558
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,659
Yes, well, the trick is

559
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:10,531
to use a double layer of
zero vicryl. It's my signature.

560
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,094
I'm the only one in the
country who can do it

561
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:16,086
because I've devoted
my life to doing it.

562
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:20,073
I don't go home to
family and chitchat.

563
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:25,112
I go to bed thinking
about this technique.

564
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:28,499
So... What is your
signature move?

565
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:31,401
Oh, I don't...

566
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,137
Life is short, you know?

567
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,974
You've seen that yourself.
So you better get at it.

568
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,627
There it is.

569
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:43,430
Now if you had put
in your beloved LVAD,

570
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,411
he would've died waiting
for a heart transplant,

571
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:47,734
which would never happen.

572
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,854
This way, Bo Bo
has a chance at life.

573
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,189
Pop Pop.

574
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,724
What? Speak up.

575
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,793
Uh... Nothing, sir.

576
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:08,516
The settlement meeting
is at 8:00 tomorrow night.

577
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,440
Are you gonna go?

578
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,409
Mmm.

579
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,912
You're going,
so I don't have to.

580
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,348
See how that works?

581
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:21,185
I'm going to speak for Mark,
who can't speak for himself.

582
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,471
See how that works?

583
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,618
You should be at that meeting.

584
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,519
You should speak for
yourself. I wasn't there.

585
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:31,812
I... It's not a decision I
should be making for you.

586
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,328
You weren't shy about
making other decisions for me.

587
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,152
What's different now?

588
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,516
I mean, I think
you're on a roll.

589
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,839
I can't do this.

590
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,374
Say it, 'cause it was perfect.

591
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,722
"It's not a decision that I
should be making for you."

592
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:47,946
Say it. Stop.

593
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,379
Say it again.

594
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,076
"It's not a decision that I
should be making for you!

595
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,678
"As opposed to
hacking off a limb.

596
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,313
"That's the kind of decision
I should make for you."

597
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,237
Fine. Don't go. I will
make all the decisions.

598
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,922
Just so you know,

599
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,702
I'm gonna vote to take
the settlement for Sofia,

600
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,604
because Mark would
want her to have the money.

601
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,978
I think Mark would want you

602
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,008
to pick up your daughter
when she's crying.

603
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,475
I guess he's gonna have
to deal with disappointment,

604
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,660
just like the rest of us.

605
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,080
<i>Mer, we chopped up this
heart, and it was amazing.</i>

606
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:31,082
<i>I mean, you should see how
this guy handles myocardium.</i>

607
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,455
Are you sleeping with him?

608
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,891
What? No. He's like 100.

609
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,304
You know who did sleep
together? April and Jackson.

610
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,827
No way. Kepner did it?

611
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,741
<i>She did it.</i> Finally.

612
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,076
<i>Except she's not doing it again.</i>

613
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,299
What do you mean?

614
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,929
Clean slate.
She's revirginizing.

615
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:45,113
<i>Oh, please.</i>

616
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,537
No, she's there, he's there.

617
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,250
All she has to do
is hear his voice,

618
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,019
and she's not gonna
be able to think straight.

619
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,254
<i>All right, now keep in mind,</i>

620
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,038
there's still a lot of
swelling and bruising.

621
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:58,431
It's okay, Roxie.

622
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,460
It's more than okay. It's...

623
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,005
There's nothing to squeeze.

624
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,144
Hey, Rox, the cafeteria
was out of lemonade,

625
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,246
so I got you... Oh!

626
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:15,199
Oh! Sorry.

627
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,602
Hi.

628
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,770
Hey.

629
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:28,761
Hi.

630
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,684
Hey.

631
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:42,075
I'm sorry. I gotta
go. Excuse me.

632
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,808
Dr. Karev, I've rounded
on your pre-ops,

633
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,409
your post-ops,
I've run your labs,

634
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,702
and I'm updating
your charts right now.

635
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:55,022
What about my consult on the
JRA kid? You schedule that yet?

636
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,957
No, I haven't had a chance to...

637
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,859
You kidding me? Stop
with the charting. Do it now.

638
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,382
Or don't.

639
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,362
No, I'm... I'm
sorry. I'll schedule it.

640
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,865
God, I can't believe I'm
crying in front of my boss.

641
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,933
I told myself that
I wouldn't do this.

642
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,203
Look, I'm not supposed
to be this person.

643
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,467
I don't fail.

644
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,573
I was valedictorian
of my high school,

645
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,075
graduated cum
laude from Princeton,

646
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,543
I was first in my
class at Harvard.

647
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,800
How am I not getting this?

648
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,253
I've somehow
become the loser intern.

649
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:29,840
I blew the appy with Dr. Grey,
you've been piling on the scut,

650
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,636
so clearly I pissed
you off somehow.

651
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,527
You get scut because
you're an intern.

652
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,062
That's what interns do.
It's the best way to learn.

653
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,864
And...

654
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,182
You haven't pissed me off.

655
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,450
I haven't?

656
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,519
No, I'm just...

657
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,173
Dr. Torres may
have told me not to...

658
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,341
Flirt with you

659
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,877
because it may be possible

660
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:53,630
that I dated a couple
of other interns.

661
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,527
You mean Heather. Yeah, her.

662
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:57,483
And Leah. Yeah...

663
00:28:57,552 --> 00:29:00,370
And Susan, Stacey, Tina, Irene.

664
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,016
Don't worry about the flirting.

665
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,618
I have absolutely
no interest in you

666
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,176
since you've already screwed
every one of my friends.

667
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,313
I should go.

668
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,450
8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I'm doing a Nissen.

669
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,951
Don't be late.

670
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:23,888
Mrs. James, I just checked
on Emery. She's doing great.

671
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,896
And she promised to take
it easy before her follow-up.

672
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,248
She's lying.

673
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,734
A sailing company donated
a new boat, and she took it.

674
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,864
She's going back out there as
soon as you let her out of here.

675
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,282
What? She's
always been like this,

676
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,589
headstrong, independent...

677
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:38,069
Okay, if she goes out there
before this is healed properly,

678
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,333
she'll lose that foot.

679
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,228
Maybe you could keep her here.

680
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,998
Say that she has to stay
here while she recuperates.

681
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,944
I can't keep her here
without medical necessity.

682
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:50,153
If we stop her from
sailing, she will hate us.

683
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,155
So let her.

684
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,935
Stop being scared
of your own daughter.

685
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,604
She's 16. She
named a boat <i>Pickle.</i>

686
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,994
She's a little girl.

687
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,396
Be her parent.

688
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,746
She needs you to be the bad guy.

689
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,784
I could get in a lot
of trouble for this.

690
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:43,173
The plane's aft broke
away from the main cabin.

691
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,443
The tail was
recovered in zone one.

692
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,915
That's a keel beam.

693
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,884
It was recovered in zone
two, about half a mile away.

694
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,699
And that's the R-3 cabin door.

695
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,794
What happens to all this?

696
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:22,479
What happens if we settle?

697
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,596
I'm sorry I ran off
like that. I just...

698
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,666
So I am not gonna
pretend it didn't happen.

699
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,101
I can't do that.

700
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,683
I know. I... Me either.

701
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,886
I can't stop thinking about it.

702
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,955
The more I think
about it, the more...

703
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,940
The more I try not to think
about it, I'm thinking about it, so...

704
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,631
Yeah, I know.

705
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,899
I know.

706
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,670
Do you want to get married?

707
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,289
Uh, what?

708
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,619
Because if you're serious about
this whole revirginizing thing,

709
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,044
that means that the next
guy that you sleep with

710
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,628
is probably gonna
be your husband.

711
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:16,949
Right? That's what you want.

712
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,887
And I am not ready to
be anybody's husband.

713
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:24,023
And I really don't think you're
ready to be anybody's wife.

714
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,760
So let's remember
that it happened.

715
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,279
Make sure it doesn't
happen again.

716
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,916
Unless we want it to.

717
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:35,986
Unless we are...

718
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:38,856
Ready.

719
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,726
I'm... I can't...

720
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,940
I can't be near
you or I might...

721
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,964
Me too.

722
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,184
Okay, so we...

723
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,453
We stay away from each other...

724
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,589
For... For a while.

725
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,009
Okay.

726
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,194
Um, so I'm just gonna...

727
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,729
Walk away now.

728
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,651
Bye.

729
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,189
Oh, God.

730
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,997
It is a horror movie
inside this microwave.

731
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,743
A horror movie. They are...

732
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:27,754
Entitled, ungrateful children,
and they should know better.

733
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,585
Not that I care. I don't
care. I'm done caring.

734
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,376
Okay, so what's really going on?

735
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,864
Tuck let go of my hand.

736
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,350
What?

737
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,121
Tuck. He let go of my hand.

738
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,168
I took him to his first
day of kindergarten,

739
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,104
and I was, you know,
ready for the tears

740
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,461
and the good-bye, and
how hard it was gonna be,

741
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,592
and he just let go of my hand.

742
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,867
He didn't even look back. He
walked in, saw a toy he liked,

743
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,202
and didn't look back.

744
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,171
I called his dad.

745
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,573
He was busy.

746
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,751
He's getting married again.

747
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,380
And she's very nice.

748
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,484
I... I like her.
Whatever. He was busy.

749
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,764
So I called Ben,

750
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,289
and he was studying up

751
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,326
to observe his first
laparoscopic surgery.

752
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,727
He was so excited...

753
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,929
Everybody's moving on.

754
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,465
And I'm here, doing
appys and choles,

755
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,195
'cause that's what a general
surgery attending does,

756
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,518
appys and choles.

757
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:36,522
While everybody else is
off conquering new things,

758
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,658
I'm stuck.

759
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:41,744
And I didn't care. You know,
I mean, this was my choice.

760
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,975
I'm not even sure I noticed...

761
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,598
Until Tuck let go of your hand.

762
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,434
Till Tuck let go of my hand.

763
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:56,660
You know what happens when
someone lets go of your hand?

764
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,760
What?

765
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,912
You get it back.

766
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,598
It's a good thing.

767
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,769
You know, interns
let go, and Tuck let go,

768
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,437
and even Ben let go.

769
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,675
And they're all still there.

770
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:15,361
They all still love you.

771
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,565
But it means you
get your hand back.

772
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:21,167
It means you have time...

773
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:23,570
Not to wash the dishes.

774
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,072
To do something
with, to get out there,

775
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:28,441
to find diseases to cure,

776
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,910
to take it to the next level.

777
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:33,146
Hell, it means invent
the Bailey Method.

778
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,134
But you gotta get out
there, do something.

779
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,521
And don't look back.

780
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,321
<i>Yeah, we're meeting in an
hour about the settlement.</i>

781
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,385
<i>Have you decided?</i>

782
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,696
No, I don't care.

783
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,751
So... Do you want to think
about it some more or...

784
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,756
No, no, I just... Settle or
don't settle. It doesn't matter.

785
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,260
You know, whatever the group
wants to do is fine with me.

786
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,711
<i>Okay.</i>

787
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,358
I'll call you and
I'll let you know.

788
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,160
<i>No, no, don't. I mean,
just send me a check.</i>

789
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:12,118
Or, you know, I'll... I'll
get the lawyers to call.

790
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,288
Okay.

791
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:19,893
We can't keep doing this.

792
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,796
I know.

793
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,132
<i>I'm here now.</i>

794
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,568
I know.

795
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,825
So...

796
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:37,977
Bye.

797
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,078
Bye.

798
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,123
Arizona, I've come to get you.

799
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,558
You're going to this meeting.
It starts in 20 minutes.

800
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,679
Arizona?

801
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,033
Where are you?

802
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:04,504
Oh, my... Are you
okay? Where's the nurse?

803
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,790
I didn't like her.
So I fired her.

804
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,543
Great. Great. That's just great.

805
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,062
Why are you...

806
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,833
I thought...

807
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,741
That I could
get to the toilet...

808
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,321
On time by myself.

809
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,990
Apparently, I was wrong.

810
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,787
Did you fall? Are you okay?

811
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,978
Do I look okay?

812
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,531
I am sitting in a
pool of my own urine.

813
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,344
I'm putting you in the
shower. No, just get out!

814
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:36,236
Hey! Do not talk to me that way.

815
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:38,082
Please! Please
get out! Arizona...

816
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,338
Did you hear me?

817
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,573
You did this!

818
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,758
I can't even pee by myself!

819
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,004
Yeah, and it's a problem

820
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,190
because you now stink!
This bathroom stinks!

821
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:48,164
Get off of me!

822
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,545
I am not sharing my home with
anybody who smells like this!

823
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,801
Get off of me! Get off of me!

824
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,135
Get off of me!

825
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,420
I have nowhere else to go!

826
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,723
This is my life now, too!

827
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,225
You know, I was, too.

828
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,529
In a plane crash.

829
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,931
In Vietnam.

830
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,668
Everyone on board the plane died

831
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,237
but me.

832
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,292
I never...

833
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,879
I never have told anybody about
that around here. You know, it's...

834
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,667
Would you like a smoke?

835
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:16,981
Oh, I don't smoke.

836
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,021
Oh.

837
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,090
Me neither.

838
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,425
Not anymore.

839
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,044
I mean, these things
could kill you, you know?

840
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,546
What?

841
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,848
Well, you know...

842
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,649
It seems like...

843
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,587
Everything kills you these days.

844
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,027
Yeah.

845
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,261
Yeah.

846
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,105
Sorry.

847
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:57,060
So we've all agreed and we...

848
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,228
No. Wait.

849
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,405
We can't do this.

850
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,068
I saw the plane. I
went to the hangar

851
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,638
and I saw the
pieces of our plane

852
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:11,187
laid out on the floor
like a jigsaw puzzle.

853
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,677
If we agree to settle,

854
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,296
they do the investigation,

855
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,510
and we can't do
anything with the results.

856
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:22,352
Bayview Aeronautics will take
the results and act accordingly.

857
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,764
Oh, I'm sure you'll
be very thorough.

858
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,105
Big companies are always
very good about self-policing.

859
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,258
Mistakes happen,
Derek. Accidents happen.

860
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,126
We make mistakes
that can cost lives, too.

861
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,727
Yes, we do.

862
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,670
But when we do,

863
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,499
we have M&Ms,

864
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,033
we pore over the files,

865
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,383
we make sure it
never happens again.

866
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:42,888
And we try to make sure

867
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:46,042
future patients never have
to go through that grief.

868
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,755
They don't have to sleep
with the lights on every night

869
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,939
because the
darkness is too much.

870
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,477
We just can't stand
by and let this happen

871
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:57,269
to other people's
Lexies and Marks.

872
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,063
We have to do
something about it.

873
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,326
We have to make this right.

874
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,555
If I could interject
for a moment...

875
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:05,645
Be quiet.

876
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,763
Your decision does
have to be unanimous.

877
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,193
She said, be quiet.

878
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,305
Callie, what are you thinking?

879
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,557
My advice at this time...

880
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,808
Shut up.

881
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,404
You're not one of us.

882
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,466
You don't know. You have
no idea what we've been...

883
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,962
Derek's right. We
shouldn't take the money.

884
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,442
We can't take it.

885
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,561
<i>When we follow our hearts,</i>

886
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,496
<i>when we choose not to settle,</i>

887
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,550
<i>it's funny, isn't it?</i>

888
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:05,171
<i>A weight lifts.</i>

889
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,607
<i>The sun shines
a little brighter.</i>

890
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,178
<i>And, for a brief
moment at least,</i>

891
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:16,048
<i>we find a little peace.</i>
