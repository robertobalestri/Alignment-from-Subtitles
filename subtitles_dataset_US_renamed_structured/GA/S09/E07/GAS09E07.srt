1
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,558
<i>Can two people
really be meant to be...</i>

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:11,793
For her patient.

3
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:13,239
And I had to rearrange
some of your surgeries.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,730
<i>MFEO?</i>

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,442
Check the OR Board
for any changes.

6
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:17,516
<i>Soul mates?</i>

7
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:18,867
I have one last thing to say.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,387
Some of you may run
into Arizona Robbins today.

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,083
It's her first day back.

10
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,640
So if you see her, just
make her feel welcome.

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,793
Or maybe... Maybe just
don't make a big deal at all.

12
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,045
It might be better.
Noted. Thank you.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,477
Hold on. I just want to
address one more thing.

14
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,801
Most of you are aware
that a group of our doctors

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,403
have filed a lawsuit
against our hospital.

16
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,689
Some of you may be
wondering what this all means

17
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,369
and how it's gonna
affect our staff.

18
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,510
I'd like to be clear.

19
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,528
It doesn't... At all.

20
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,407
Let's just let the
lawyers worry about that.

21
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,764
That's their job.

22
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,534
Our job is to continue
to work together

23
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:53,885
and support each other

24
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,631
in giving the great
standard of care

25
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,906
that we have always given.

26
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,037
Let's not let something like
this get in the way of that.

27
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,593
Thank you.

28
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,702
<i>It would be nice if it's true...</i>

29
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,499
<i>That we all have someone
out there waiting for us...</i>

30
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,701
<i>Us waiting for them.</i>

31
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:11,703
That was good.

32
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:17,273
Anything else?

33
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:20,462
Yeah.

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,375
The fire house. I'm not
staying there anymore,

35
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,483
so I was wondering
what we should do.

36
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,185
I mean, if we
should sell it or...

37
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,154
I wondered what
you wanted to do.

38
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:33,492
You should do what
you like. It's your house.

39
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,727
<i>I'm just not sure I believe it.</i>

40
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:39,965
Okay.

41
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,383
Red eagle has landed.

42
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,085
What? Arizona just got here.

43
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,464
I had an intern
wait at the entrance

44
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,149
and then text me
when they saw her.

45
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,919
I also put the weirdo over
there on wheelchair duty.

46
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,393
Now listen, she'll
be tired and in pain

47
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,689
but she won't ask for it
unless she sees it's close by.

48
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,425
Just don't shove it

49
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,759
in her face. She hates that.

50
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,001
You know what I hate?
That you won't stop talking.

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,414
Well, then you two will
get along just fine today.

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,037
Oh. Red eagle.

53
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,241
Red eagle. Don't... Don't...
Don't look up. Don't look up.

54
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,527
Keep reading, yeah.

55
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,464
Hi. Robbins.

56
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,782
Oh, hey. Good. You're here.

57
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,117
Well, I gotta run.

58
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,896
Derek's all, "Fix my hand."

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,419
"No rest till I'm healed."

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,639
We got a big schedule.

61
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,919
There was a 9-year-old
that came in last night

62
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,125
with abdominal pain,

63
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,879
a 6-year-old with
a Wilms' tumor,

64
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,049
there's a 10-year-old that
needs a kidney transplant.

65
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,261
You know, he's
a really cool kid.

66
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,697
You're gonna like him.

67
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,207
Well, call them back and
get the deposit back then.

68
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,120
Well, I'm glad your
sister likes the view,

69
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,912
but I'm the one who has
to put on the poufy dress.

70
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,115
You know what? This
conversation is over.

71
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,584
Well, I love you, too.

72
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,200
Red panties and a lace bra.

73
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,829
He wants to have a
Christmas wedding...

74
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,831
In a rustic mountain lodge

75
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,168
with red ribbons and
mistletoe and a tree

76
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,985
with ornaments
made of our photos.

77
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,181
That sounds beautiful.

78
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,304
No, it's stupid.

79
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,707
What kind of self-respecting man

80
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,819
cares this much about a wedding?

81
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,926
I did.

82
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,795
Yeah, but I did the
wedding thing before.

83
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,197
I'm gonna make all those people

84
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,766
who showed up the first time
sit through another ceremony

85
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,420
because, maybe I'll mean it this
time? You were there with Adele.

86
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,689
You got me a set of ramekins.

87
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,316
And I'd be happy to
get you another set.

88
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,971
I want to get married in a field
with wildflowers everywhere

89
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:35,013
and butterflies that are
released when I say "I do."

90
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,927
And I want to have these
little mints that say "mint to be."

91
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,586
You get it? 'Cause
they're mints...

92
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,987
There will be no mints.
We're going to the courthouse,

93
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,505
have a little
cocktail party after.

94
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,424
Yeah, we'll see about that.

95
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,594
A man who puts down a deposit
is a man who means business.

96
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,829
Well, he has till the 12th
to get his money back.

97
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,298
That's two days.

98
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,001
He'd need two years to
get me to agree to a wedding

99
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,452
with Santa Claus running around.

100
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,840
Wait. Today's the 10th?

101
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,126
Yep.

102
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,830
It was good that Owen
said that about the lawsuit.

103
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:12,534
What, his "one big,
happy family" crap?

104
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:13,913
It's very sweet
unless you're me.

105
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,453
It needed to be said.

106
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,922
Yeah, unless you're the
deformed wife chained in the attic.

107
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,302
Well, what do you
want to be to him?

108
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,254
You left him. Do you
want to be something else?

109
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,856
Well, I don't want to
be chained in the attic.

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,907
Hey, guys, have you seen
Jackson? He's not answering my texts.

111
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,026
Why, you looking for
some Jackson action?

112
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,117
Oh, my God. What did I tell you?

113
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,404
Thirty years as a nun,
she cannot get enough.

114
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,139
So you haven't seen him?

115
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,723
No, but we will tell him

116
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,872
that you really, really,
really need to see him if...

117
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,228
Bye, April.

118
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,857
Okay, so if we
go to the axilla...

119
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,943
And then down the
forearm to grab the MABC,

120
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,111
there are two branches.

121
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,629
Okay, now this is the
really cool part, okay?

122
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,031
It's so freakin'
state-of-the-art,

123
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,265
I can't even believe it exists.

124
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,889
That's a lot of build-up.
Better be good.

125
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,891
We take just the anterior branch

126
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,272
and we use that part
for the cable graft.

127
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,946
What else you got?

128
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,325
Did you hear what I just said?

129
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,482
Yeah. What else you got?

130
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,515
Okay. Yeah.

131
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,766
We could

132
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,234
do an end-to-side transfer.

133
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,392
The statistics are
really, really good.

134
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,693
What else?

135
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,573
Derek, I went to the
trouble of making a slide.

136
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,742
Could you please look at it?

137
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:16,881
You know as well as I do

138
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,083
that those stats come
from studies on rats.

139
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,255
And as far as the end-to-side
transfer, yeah, it's state-of-the-art,

140
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,006
but once you take
away my good nerve,

141
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,875
I will have less function
than I did before.

142
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,595
You don't have it. Keep trying.

143
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,141
I practiced with
Arizona last night.

144
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,446
She made a much
more enthusiastic Derek.

145
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,055
What's wrong?

146
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,407
Dr. Bailey,

147
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,609
did you know the ten
coldest counties in the country

148
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,394
are all located in Minnesota?

149
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,109
You're glad to be back.
I'm glad you're glad.

150
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,432
Now did you double-check

151
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,862
the history of the
heart valve like I asked?

152
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,886
Grumpy.

153
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,270
Yes, and based on the history,

154
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,150
we've chosen a
pericardial bioprosthesis.

155
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,040
I made sure the OR has it ready.

156
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,554
Okay, and Dr. Ross, you
took care of our room situation?

157
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,106
East-facing window like
he likes. It's also private.

158
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,810
Good. Okay.

159
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,286
Hey. MAN: We've arrived!

160
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,715
Hi. Dr. Bailey!

161
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,184
How does the liver
look? Is it a good one?

162
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,624
The best.

163
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,804
Dr. Ross spent the last 24
hours on the phone with UNOS

164
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:20,629
to make sure it didn't
go anywhere else.

165
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,041
They were threatening
to send it to Portland,

166
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,743
but I went all "Dr.
Bailey" on 'em.

167
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,433
That's my man.

168
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:26,879
A little thank-you
for all your hard work.

169
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,302
Thank you.

170
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,872
For you. White birch rosemary.

171
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,017
And... Look at you.

172
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,419
What's new on the wedding front?

173
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,787
Have you gotten a wedding dress?

174
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,396
You know it's all
about the dress.

175
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,958
He got knocked down by
some woman at the mall

176
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,626
and fell pretty hard
into a perfume stand.

177
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,728
He's got some abdominal
pain and a deep lac on his hand.

178
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,197
All right. Why aren't
you suturing him?

179
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,265
I paged Plastics.

180
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,933
The patient's
a little difficult.

181
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,169
Okay, well, you're a doctor.
It's your job to deal with difficult.

182
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:50,458
I know, but...

183
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,276
Mr. Freeman, I'm Dr. Grey.

184
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,372
Do you mind if I examine you?

185
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,428
All yours.

186
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,513
Great. Okay.

187
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,779
Please let me know
if you feel any pain...

188
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,536
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:04,522
Dad! I am so sorry. Ignore him.

190
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,274
Dad, I swear to God.

191
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,087
This is why Danny and Tim
don't talk to you anymore.

192
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,577
I never grabbed Tim's ass.

193
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,942
No, you grabbed Tim's
wife's ass, and Danny's wife.

194
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,299
It's okay. It's okay.

195
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,679
I need you to lean
forward for me.

196
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,183
And take a deep
breath for me, please.

197
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,941
Another one.

198
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,225
And we're done here.

199
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:26,144
What is wrong with you?

200
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,295
It's a compliment.

201
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,440
It's horrifying.

202
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,610
I tried to warn you.
You did a lousy job.

203
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:32,879
There's some
abdominal tenderness,

204
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,713
so let's get a CT, and get
me the results right away.

205
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,948
Grey, I just got out of surgery.

206
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,149
You got a patient
with a hand lac?

207
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,751
Yeah, he's over there.
And watch your ass.

208
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,525
What do...

209
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,710
Jackson, we need to talk.

210
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,012
I...

211
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,322
Right now.

212
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,748
All right.

213
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:53,221
What's up?

214
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,057
I'm late.

215
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,709
For what?

216
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,872
Four days. I have never
been four days late in my life.

217
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,396
Four days late for...

218
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,597
Oh.

219
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:04,983
Oh.

220
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,786
Oh... Oh...

221
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,368
Of course.

222
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,682
Just when I start thinking
that maybe this could work...

223
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,139
Something that feels so
good can't be bad, right?

224
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,275
I don't know. Maybe Jesus
is okay with premarital sex.

225
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,456
He made that rule when
people got married at 16.

226
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,108
He never expected people
to wait till they were 30.

227
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,126
But now I have a
baby in my uterus,

228
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,061
and it is clear that
he is not okay with it.

229
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,802
Okay, Jesus. I get it.

230
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,138
Relax, okay?
You're not pregnant.

231
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,251
I am a clock. I am never late.

232
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,619
We use condoms. Condoms break.

233
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,042
They don't break.

234
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,744
Sometimes they break. Just...

235
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,897
We're gonna have
you pee on a stick,

236
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,092
and we'll know in five minutes.

237
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,260
No. No. Those things
can give off false positives.

238
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,618
It has to be a blood test.

239
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,185
Fine. You're right.

240
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,632
We'll go draw your
blood right now.

241
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,176
Okay? Uh-huh.

242
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,142
Jackson...

243
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,514
Hey, we are not gonna
worry until we know for sure.

244
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,149
Okay? Okay.

245
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,655
Dr. Kepner, we need you.

246
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,619
14-year-old in a
horseback riding accident.

247
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,621
Hypotensive and bleeding
through his bandages.

248
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,629
I'm around all day,
so just text me later.

249
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,392
Wexler, Lewis, Trauma one now.

250
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,611
Hey, Avery, you're
helping me research a plan

251
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,884
for Shepherd's hand today.

252
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,370
Uh, can it wait?
I'm a little busy.

253
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,907
Oh. Well, every second, the
nerve is dying a little bit more.

254
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,687
As we stand here and
argue, his nerve is dying.

255
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,043
Yes, but...

256
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,392
His nerve died just a little
bit more. Let's go. Snap, snap.

257
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,550
Hunt. Nice speech this morning.

258
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,899
Very, "Once more unto
the breach, dear friends."

259
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,761
Shakespeare. <i>Henry V.</i>

260
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,055
Yeah.

261
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,502
I mean, the point is that
you're handling all this well.

262
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,927
Thanks. You need something?

263
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,774
Just checking in. You
all right with this meeting?

264
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,232
Yeah, I'm just telling
them what happened. Why?

265
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,470
No reason. It's just, you
know, a lawsuit like this,

266
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,989
reminds a hospital
that it's a business.

267
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,524
The angles change
pretty quickly.

268
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:11,153
So don't let 'em
back you in a corner.

269
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,643
I should be fine.

270
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,212
Of course. Of course. Look,
you know what you're doing.

271
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,914
Just ignore me.

272
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,916
Dr. Hunt, I'm sure you're
aware, members of your staff

273
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,451
have now lodged
an official complaint

274
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,919
with intent to sue Seattle
Grace-Mercy West hospital.

275
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,143
I am.

276
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,811
So today is just a
preliminary interview

277
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,531
to prepare the hospital's case.

278
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,316
This is a confidentiality
agreement.

279
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,105
You can look it over.
It just says that...

280
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,965
You should make note
that it specifically mentions

281
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,934
your wife Dr. Cristina Yang as
one of the plaintiffs in the case.

282
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,407
Yeah, I saw that.

283
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,871
So we understand, this is
an unusual situation for you

284
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,157
and a clear conflict of
interest for the hospital.

285
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,665
Don't worry. Whatever
we say here will stay here.

286
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,751
Great. No awkward conversations
around the dinner table.

287
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,289
Okay, so let's start

288
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,058
with why your team flew to
Boise Memorial on that day.

289
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,711
Boise asked us to help with
a conjoined twin separation.

290
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,782
We'd had success with a very
complicated procedure months earlier.

291
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,433
Graham Cunningham, 65,

292
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,752
presented with cirrhosis
approximately seven years ago.

293
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,338
He's now in
end-stage liver disease

294
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,534
and has subsequently also
developed valvular heart disease.

295
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:16,924
Well done, Dr. Ross.

296
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,309
I've been practicing.

297
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,688
Why didn't we treat
this valve disease...

298
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,158
Right away? Because the
valve replacement surgery

299
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,126
would've caused
his liver to fail.

300
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,477
But the liver transplant
would've caused his heart to fail.

301
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,179
That's why we'll do
both surgeries today.

302
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,282
First the valve replacement,
then the liver transplant.

303
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,605
Good.

304
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,434
You almost make me
want to learn your name.

305
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Dr. B, You're confident
this liver's the one?

306
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,373
We're not gonna
get halfway to the OR

307
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,875
and have to turn
around like last time?

308
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,465
All signs point to
this being the one.

309
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,579
We just had to date a
bunch of others to find it.

310
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,680
Kind of like you,

311
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,632
kissing all those frogs
before you met me.

312
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,545
A dirty old man touched
my butt today, twice.

313
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,713
Really?

314
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,026
How was your day?
How was Callie?

315
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,490
Well, she didn't touch my butt.

316
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,652
Derek. What?

317
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,983
I'm all for burying things with
sex, but this is your career.

318
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,047
You want to talk about it? Yes.

319
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,310
Why do the surgery at all?

320
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,546
I've always wanted to
spend more time fishing.

321
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,048
I just got Zola her first
fishing pole. It's pink.

322
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,270
Derek.

323
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,640
There is no good
solution. There's half fixes.

324
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,476
Maybe there's more
function. Maybe there's not.

325
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,246
And if they can't
fix it, then that's it.

326
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,464
It's done. It's over.

327
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,811
It's not over. You find a fix.

328
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,146
You used to be so dark and
twisty. Now you're optimistic.

329
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,279
We're not talking about me.

330
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,539
Let's just not talk at all.

331
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,877
That's it. Good.

332
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:45,891
Avoid twisting the
cables too tightly

333
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,660
or they'll cut
through the sternum.

334
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,717
What is this I hear about
you letting your intern

335
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:50,986
do a procedure on my patient?

336
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,620
You tattled on me?

337
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,966
I didn't spend the last
three months on liver watch

338
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,201
so you could kill this guy.

339
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,286
Hey, no one's killing anyone.

340
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,591
She's good. Better than you.

341
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,979
No gloating.

342
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,163
Yang.

343
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,520
Do you know how long
this man's waited for a liver?

344
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,238
So long, he was
married to a woman

345
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,367
the first time he came in here.

346
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,975
Now he's come out.

347
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,888
He's met the man he's meant
to spend the rest of his life with.

348
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:18,762
This is not the man we
let an intern practice on.

349
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,966
Okay, relax. She won't do it.

350
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,318
Since when did you
become such a romantic?

351
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,675
Boo-hoo.

352
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,463
You're lucky you even
get to work with me.

353
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,665
Does that hurt at all, Sean?

354
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,850
Good. Good.

355
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,714
All right. You
having any fun here?

356
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,249
I heard there was a
pro basketball player

357
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,766
making his way
around the halls here.

358
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,085
Did you get to
meet him? Tall guy.

359
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:48,509
He probably hit his head
on the door on the way in.

360
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,826
All right. Well, we will
check back with you later.

361
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,082
Bye.

362
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,558
Good job.

363
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,822
You said $20 if I didn't
ask about the fake leg.

364
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,062
I only got $10 on me.

365
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,114
Then next time she comes in,

366
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,503
I'm gonna tell her how you told
me that I couldn't say anything.

367
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,538
Keep your trap shut.

368
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,854
Hey, is he always that quiet?

369
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,561
Yeah. Strange kid.

370
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,424
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Kepner
needs some extra hands

371
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,493
on a horse
trampling, 14-year-old.

372
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,077
All right, tell 'em we're
on our way. Yeah.

373
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,164
I'll catch up with
you. No, I can wait.

374
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,628
No, a kid got trampled
by a horse, Alex. Go.

375
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,783
Can I help you?

376
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,970
No. I just got lost

377
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,874
on my way to Radiology.

378
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:00,626
Can you take over
the ultrasound?

379
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,827
He's got abdominal tenderness,

380
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,312
and I need to get
control of this bleeding.

381
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,569
I think he may have
lacerated his femoral vein.

382
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,065
My sneakers. What's that?

383
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,991
Don't lose my sneakers.
They're 200 bucks.

384
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,987
That's why his leg
slipped through the stirrup.

385
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,789
You have to wear a shoe with
a heel when you ride a horse.

386
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,212
Kid spends 200
bucks on sneakers,

387
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,282
he's obviously not the
king of awesome choices.

388
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,327
All right, there's possible
blood on the upper left quadrant.

389
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,763
Great. Let's get him up to CT.

390
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,019
Hold on. Wait for Robbins.

391
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,799
Are you kidding me?
She's on her way.

392
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,735
He just got dragged
20 yards by a horse.

393
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,519
He's totally stable. Look,
it's her first day back.

394
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,621
He did a stupid thing. I'm
not gonna let it ruin his life.

395
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,089
Let's move this
gurney right now!

396
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,180
Right away, doctor.

397
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,098
Okay, somebody
step out and call.

398
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,177
It looks like...

399
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,346
There's some calcification
of the aortic annulus here?

400
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,182
Is that a statement
or a question?

401
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,868
I will check again.

402
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,370
Oh, no.

403
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,906
Look at that. He comes
bearing bad news.

404
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,841
It's gonna be fine.

405
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,538
The plane taking the transplant
team got delayed by rain.

406
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,289
We'll know more in an
hour. We've heard that before.

407
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:07,281
You don't know. Maybe
this is a good thing.

408
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,650
Like maybe the
plane has to be late

409
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,721
so the transport ambulance
doesn't crash into an 18-wheeler.

410
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,472
Things happen for a reason.

411
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,774
Here we go.

412
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,309
Well, they do.

413
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,794
I always say, I would
never have met Hank

414
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,758
if my ex Carol hadn't
forced us to move to Seattle

415
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,199
to be closer to her family.

416
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,578
You wasted 30
years in that marriage.

417
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,470
No, it wasn't a waste. It
got me here. I met you.

418
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,517
Thirty years too late.
Better late than never.

419
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,141
Things don't always
happen for a reason, Graham.

420
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,077
I was alone all that time
and you were scared.

421
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:40,264
And I don't believe that that's the
way things were supposed to be.

422
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:42,183
We were supposed to be together,

423
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,218
have our entire lives together.

424
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,054
So I can't just sit back
and be okay with you losing

425
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,773
the one thing that can get
me my 30 years with you.

426
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,459
I'm sorry.

427
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,546
He's just a little scared.

428
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,314
You're damn right I am.

429
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,801
You don't screw this up.

430
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,236
We won't.

431
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,839
Dr. Ross, you'll make
sure that the liver gets here?

432
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,258
If I have to drive to Oregon
and pick it up myself.

433
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,473
See? Maybe that's why I had to
say things happen for a reason,

434
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,996
so you'd yell at them.

435
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,995
Good news. Your
scans came back clean.

436
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,318
So you're free to go home.

437
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,871
Thank God. You
got lucky this time.

438
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,857
The next lady in the
mall might have a gun.

439
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,170
And so Dr. Wilson can assist you

440
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,771
with any other questions
that you may have,

441
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,315
and I will write you the
prescription for the painkillers. Ah!

442
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:29,463
Nice.

443
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,814
That's enough!

444
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,150
I am all you've got
left, Dad. And I'm done.

445
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,780
You sit around and mope
about how Mom left you,

446
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,981
but of course she did.

447
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,156
You'd be crazy to
stay married to you.

448
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,718
How long has this been
going on, the touching?

449
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,075
I don't know.

450
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,676
My Mom left him,
like, two years ago,

451
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,345
but it was at least
a year before that.

452
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,546
And before that?

453
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:46,913
He was normal.

454
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,718
He was my dad.
Dr. Grey, what's going on?

455
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,436
Excuse me for a second.

456
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,486
Did you see the way he
was grabbing my pen?

457
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,910
That's a grasping reflex.
It's a frontal release sign.

458
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,579
I thought that went
away after infancy.

459
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,876
Well, it does unless you have
a tumor in your frontal lobe,

460
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,577
in which case,
primitive reflexes

461
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,446
come back along
with disinhibition.

462
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,715
Patients start becoming impulsive,
saying things they shouldn't.

463
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:10,988
Grabbing ass. You're so smart.

464
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,372
Stop sucking up.

465
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,925
Go get a CT. And page Neuro.

466
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,875
Hey. I'm about to head
back into my meeting.

467
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,677
Bailey and I are doing the
heart-liver surgery today.

468
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,969
I'm lead cardio on it, and
Russell wanted you to sign off on it.

469
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,277
Okay. That all?

470
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,788
No. Why am I here?

471
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,435
What? You pushed
to have me back.

472
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,638
I am curious why, because
you don't seem to want me here.

473
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:35,307
You're gonna do great things,
Cristina, and I'm running a hospital.

474
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,842
I'd rather have you do
that under our banner.

475
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:37,948
You're good business.

476
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,257
That's the only reason?

477
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,650
You moved away. You
asked me to stop calling you.

478
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,919
Now you're back.
What do you want?

479
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,587
I don't... I don't
know. That's...

480
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,379
Well, let me tell you what we do
know. We want different things.

481
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:53,976
Every time we try to ignore that,
we end up hurting each other.

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,632
We don't work.

483
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,952
That's what we know.

484
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,520
And that hasn't changed.

485
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,949
Nothing's changed at all. I
have to go back to my meeting.

486
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,477
The brochure has a picture of the
place decorated with icicle lights.

487
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,346
And those reindeer
made out of twigs.

488
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,500
That's gross.

489
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,086
What about a cupcake
tower instead of a cake?

490
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,196
You could do red
and green frosting.

491
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,058
Come on.

492
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,955
You guys are in love.
Why not celebrate that?

493
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,446
'Cause sometimes love
makes you do stupid things.

494
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,925
Suddenly you're screwed
the rest of your life.

495
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,032
What he said.

496
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,340
Why are you even talking?

497
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,079
I need that answer about
the radial nerve transfer.

498
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,286
Yeah. Slow reader here.

499
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,332
Hey. Hey.

500
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:35,806
Arizona!

501
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,086
Hey, Dr. Robbins. You're
working with horse kid, right?

502
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,688
Yeah, I am. Karev's
got him in pre-op.

503
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,279
And Dr. Kepner, was she also
in pre-op or is she probably...

504
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,026
Excuse me. Why would she
know where your girlfriend is?

505
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,716
Read the article.

506
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,945
Hey, I'm gonna do an
exploratory lap on this kid tonight,

507
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,569
so I might be
home a little late.

508
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:50,482
You're doing exploratory
surgery your first day back?

509
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:53,340
- That's a lot of standing.
- You think that...

510
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:57,044
You might get bored? 'Cause
I get bored just standing.

511
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,012
And sitting... I also
get bored sitting.

512
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,577
Hey. Bailey and Ben are
having a Christmas wedding.

513
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,841
They're gonna have carolers.

514
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,334
I love Christmas carolers.

515
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,603
There will no carolers.

516
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,152
Torres, I'm gonna be right back.

517
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,296
No, no, no. I need you here.

518
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,513
Jackson.

519
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,049
Sorry. I thought you were...

520
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,483
You two having a sex date?

521
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,035
We are not having a sex date.
Not everything is about sex.

522
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,188
You okay?

523
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,372
Yes.

524
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,574
No.

525
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,778
Oh, God.

526
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,696
April? I had a plan.

527
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:37,001
I was gonna be married
and have a husband.

528
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,303
Our wedding would
have the mints.

529
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,956
We'd be "mint to be," committed.

530
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,945
I was gonna tell my
husband that I was pregnant

531
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,729
by giving him a t-shirt that
said "world's greatest dad."

532
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:49,964
Now look at me.

533
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,152
You're pregnant?

534
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,667
I think so.

535
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,671
Well, I don't know.

536
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,752
Plans never work out the
way you think they're going to,

537
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:02,275
especially with babies.

538
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,006
You try and try to get
pregnant, and you can't.

539
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,640
And then a baby comes
when you least expect it,

540
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,993
probably because
you didn't plan it.

541
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,600
Plans don't mean anything.

542
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,201
Hey.

543
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,652
I was just leaving.

544
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,837
Tell us about your decision

545
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,122
in using Skytrip Express
as the charter company.

546
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,229
It wasn't my decision.

547
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,681
The hospital has a
deal with that company.

548
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,295
Has the hospital always
used that company?

549
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,468
I have no idea.

550
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,664
Were you aware that Skytrip had

551
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,608
a history of mechanical issues?

552
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,222
What?

553
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,354
FAA reports four
incidents since July 2010.

554
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,507
No, I didn't. Of
course I didn't.

555
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,576
You don't remember
switching to Skytrip

556
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,050
from another charter
company last December?

557
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,719
I'm not... I'm... I
wasn't aware of that.

558
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,538
I run a surgical
staff. I'm not a...

559
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,324
In a round of budget cuts
heading into fiscal 2012,

560
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:54,695
transportation policy shifted from
your previous company to Skytrip,

561
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:58,198
who it appears subcontracts
to several smaller companies...

562
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,367
Who had mechanical
issues. That's right.

563
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,155
This is how we save money, by
jeopardizing our people's lives?

564
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,407
Who are vetting these guys?

565
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,258
Who approved
switching to a company

566
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,544
without checking their
damn safety records?

567
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,533
Is this your
signature, Dr. Hunt?

568
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,480
I don't remember
this specifically, but...

569
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,251
Yes. Yes, I approved this. I...

570
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,154
I did it.

571
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,841
So what happens now, I resign?

572
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,571
This interview is
just to ascertain...

573
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,812
That is the last
thing that we want.

574
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:48,098
I'm sorry. Can I interject
something here, off the record?

575
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,652
Dr. Hunt, I am Roberta
Thompson. I am new to the board.

576
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,837
Yeah, we've met. Right.

577
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,489
I just want to be clear here.

578
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,125
You said it yourself.

579
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:01,545
You run a surgical staff,
and you do a hell of a job at it.

580
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,163
You wouldn't do it so well

581
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,791
if we expected you to chase
down every zero on a budget report.

582
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,753
Owen, a mistake was made...

583
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,007
An oversight, and
it cost us, all of us.

584
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,709
God knows it cost our doctors.

585
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,546
And you, your own wife has
paid a terrible price for this,

586
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,714
but the board wants you to know

587
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,850
that you have our
full support in this.

588
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,773
You okay?

589
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,007
Yeah.

590
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,611
You? Yeah.

591
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,628
I don't know. I know.

592
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:41,363
I guess I should've
been on the pill.

593
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,186
Yeah I guess, we
were both pretty stupid.

594
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:49,860
Jackson, I can do
this myself, you know?

595
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,161
What?

596
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,474
Just, if this isn't
what you want.

597
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,898
Why...

598
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:54,882
What the hell, Kepner?
Our surgery's about to start.

599
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,391
I'm anemic. STD screen.

600
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,763
Great timing, though,
'cause I just finished.

601
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:01,066
And can you get that?
Perf. Thank you. Yeah.

602
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,089
All righty. And see ya.

603
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,567
Dr. Bailey.

604
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,051
Hey. We're almost ready for you.

605
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,955
After this bile duct,
we'll be just about done.

606
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,934
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Warren's
calling the front desk.

607
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,503
He was wondering what time
your surgery would be done.

608
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,877
Yeah, I bet he is.

609
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,496
He probably found
another inspiration picture

610
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,965
in a bride magazine
he wants to discuss.

611
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:32,169
Do we do silver bells or
snowflakes on our invitation?

612
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,938
Garland or poinsettias
on the centerpiece?

613
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,106
Suction.

614
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,295
It's just a wedding.

615
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,661
Come on.

616
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,074
Out of all people, I thought I
could count on you to have my back.

617
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,776
Do you think I wanted that
wedding at Meredith's house?

618
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,083
That was for Owen.

619
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,746
Put on the dress.
There are bigger battles.

620
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,670
Right, 'cause that
philosophy worked out

621
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,605
so well for you
and Owen. T-tube.

622
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,390
Here you go.

623
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,110
Ugh!

624
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:58,023
Dr. Kepner? Sorry, this PDS

625
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:00,698
suture isn't holding, and
I can't get hemostasis.

626
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,794
Horseback riding is
supposed to be fun,

627
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:04,912
but even if you wear the right
shoes and a helmet and everything,

628
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:05,964
protection doesn't always work.

629
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:07,215
You know what? What's the point?

630
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,650
You might as well
just ride bareback.

631
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,700
Karev, can you take
this over for a second?

632
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:10,941
Yeah, sure.

633
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,906
You, whatever your name is, can
you stop stalking me with chairs?

634
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:29,387
I'm stretching, which is normal.

635
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:30,905
We all need to
stretch sometimes.

636
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,049
So can you just get
that thing away from me?

637
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,957
Pickups. WOMAN: Here you go.

638
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,041
You were right.
It's a tumor. Move.

639
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,282
But this Neuro guy says
it's too far along to operate,

640
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,034
so they're just gonna
send him home.

641
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:57,337
She spent all these years
thinking he was just a dirty old man,

642
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,339
and now she knows it's a tumor

643
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:02,075
and that's not who he
is, it's too late, and...

644
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:05,578
I'm talking to myself.

645
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,183
Dr. Yang, I'm
almost finished here.

646
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:11,185
You can get ready
to close the sternum.

647
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:15,055
Boki, I think Dr. Yang prefers
sternal cables, not monofilament wire.

648
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:17,635
Dr. Edwards, how would you like

649
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,337
the honor of closing
for me today?

650
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:22,980
No. You heard me. No
interns closing up this patient.

651
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,382
Dr. Bailey, I might not give
the best wedding advice,

652
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,696
but this is my intern
under my service,

653
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,631
and she's been practicing
this procedure for days.

654
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,717
I am more than
confident she's prepared.

655
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:34,224
Fine. Let her close.

656
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,060
Prepare the sternal
cable, please, Boki.

657
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,741
Dr. Bailey, should there
be this much bleeding?

658
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,898
He's not clotting.

659
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,300
Let's get some FFP
and Factor VII up here.

660
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,701
Get in there with some lap pads.

661
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,090
We need to apply pressure quick.

662
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,084
All right, guys.
Okay, let's make sure

663
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,486
that we check pulses
every two hours.

664
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,959
I'm gonna go
talk to the parents.

665
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,910
Everybody out.

666
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,072
I said get out.

667
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,255
You okay?

668
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,242
Robbins, are you hurt?
Did you hit your head?

669
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,167
I was... I was so
proud of myself.

670
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,788
For getting through
today and the surgery,

671
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,357
like nothing was different,

672
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,791
and I'm such a big shot

673
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,661
that I went and put all
my weight on my left foot,

674
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,899
I don't have a left foot.

675
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,336
And now I'm on my ass.

676
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,773
And you should... You should
see the look on your face.

677
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,577
Are you gonna... Are
you gonna help me up?

678
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:44,995
Yeah. Come on.

679
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,635
Come on.

680
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,673
How's the bleeding?
Still won't stop.

681
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,853
Can we try more RBCs?
That'll just overload him.

682
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,226
What's his lactate level?

683
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,457
It's gone from nine to
17 in the last 30 minutes.

684
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,331
No.

685
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,950
Come on. No. No.

686
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,437
Damn it.

687
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:11,666
What is it? Why'd you stop?

688
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,057
See how the liver's patchy?

689
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,892
He's rejecting it?

690
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,876
Does this mean I
don't get to close?

691
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,633
Okay, so if we
did a pedicle flap...

692
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,302
We could do a tendon transfer
to get back motor function.

693
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,434
Where are you? What?

694
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,601
You've been staring
at your phone all day,

695
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,659
like some 16-year-old girl

696
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,606
waiting for a creepy
college guy to text her back.

697
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,829
I need you to focus.

698
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,447
I'm sorry, okay?

699
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,961
But we both know Shepherd is
just gonna shoot this thing down.

700
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,363
He doesn't want
to do the surgery.

701
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,347
He doesn't know what
he wants. He's just scared.

702
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,422
He wishes this never
happened, but it happened,

703
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,219
and now it's up to us
to come up with a plan

704
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:49,809
that makes him feel
just a little less scared,

705
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,528
makes him believe
it'll all be okay.

706
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:55,165
And we can do that. So come
on. Are you with me here?

707
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:57,958
I gotta go do something.

708
00:28:58,387 --> 00:28:59,769
What?

709
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,523
Hey. What's up?

710
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:04,924
Look at this.

711
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:09,396
A mesio-orbital
frontal lobe tumor.

712
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:10,705
He's the grabby guy.

713
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:12,165
He's a father.

714
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:14,274
His whole family's
horrified to be around him.

715
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,714
I thought we could help him,
but Clemens says it's inoperable.

716
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:17,771
No, it's not.

717
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,406
I thought so.

718
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,008
All right, I'll page Clemens,
let him know that he's an idiot,

719
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,577
and walk him
through how to do it.

720
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:24,886
Derek. Yeah.

721
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,658
He's not gonna do
as good a job as you.

722
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,081
No, he's not.

723
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,150
Which is why you have
to get your hand fixed.

724
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:37,735
I don't... I don't
have the results yet.

725
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,942
I told you I would text you.

726
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,560
I'm in. All the way.

727
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,260
What? Come on.

728
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,767
I know it might not be what you
planned or how you planned it,

729
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,691
but we can do this.

730
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,638
We'll get married, have an
awesome kid, be amazing parents.

731
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,812
I'm in.

732
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,410
Don't say that if you
don't mean it. I mean it.

733
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,633
We can do this.

734
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,470
You really think that...

735
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,954
You said it yourself.

736
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:11,663
Something that feels
this good cannot be bad.

737
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,261
So you... You really want this?

738
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,445
I want this.

739
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:17,563
We get married.

740
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:19,872
We have a house.
We get a big yard.

741
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,067
And we have a wedding?

742
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:22,513
We have a huge freaking wedding.

743
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,871
In a... In a field
with butterflies.

744
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,101
Butterflies, a field...
Whatever you want.

745
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,803
Okay? Your family's
gonna be there.

746
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,672
My family... I mean, my
crazy mom's gonna be there.

747
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,123
She'll probably bring Webber.

748
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:33,897
Whatever. That's fine.

749
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,799
Oh, my gosh.

750
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:43,256
Are we really...

751
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,160
You sure we can do this?

752
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,250
We can do this.

753
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,348
How did you know?

754
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:03,376
Eleven years in your job.

755
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,312
You want it back? No.

756
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,847
You know, they're usually
looking for a scapegoat,

757
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,483
someone they can lay all the
blame on and then set 'em adrift.

758
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:11,968
That's what happened?

759
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,921
No, the board, they
have my back completely.

760
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,056
Well, that's great.

761
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,290
Yeah.

762
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,179
Why wouldn't they just fire me?

763
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,098
I don't know.

764
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,067
What?

765
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,881
You're married to
someone on the other side.

766
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:31,805
They seem unhappy about that?

767
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:35,058
Richard, thanks.

768
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,631
You said it was a perfect match.

769
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,832
It was.

770
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,853
Just sometimes for reasons
we don't always understand,

771
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:50,324
the body doesn't want
to accept the new organ.

772
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,992
So what now? You...

773
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,856
You put him back
on the transplant list?

774
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,081
Yeah. We made calls.

775
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,150
But given Graham's condition...

776
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,718
He needs this.

777
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,386
Look at him.

778
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,333
You can't tell me there
are sicker people out there.

779
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,608
That's the point, bug. I'm sick.

780
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:12,061
Better they give it to someone
who could make it last.

781
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,066
How long do I have?

782
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,336
A week, maybe.

783
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:23,306
That's good.

784
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,545
It's not 30 years.

785
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,947
But it's better than nothing.

786
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,416
I'm sorry.

787
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:37,404
Hey, you don't get to
leave. Come back here.

788
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:47,013
I'm old. And I've
had a good life.

789
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:50,817
I found people to love
who loved me back.

790
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,988
You save your tears for
someone who needs them.

791
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:59,409
I mean it. You did good.

792
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,513
We've got this week...

793
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,159
And we're gonna make it count.

794
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,100
Good night.

795
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,763
All right. Then I'll
see you tomorrow.

796
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,662
Here we go.

797
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,358
"Not pregnant."

798
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,295
Oh, God.

799
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,030
Thank you, Jesus.

800
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,467
Now we don't have to
get married. We're free.

801
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,885
We just... We just
dodged a bullet.

802
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,132
Like, the biggest bullet ever.

803
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,251
Thank you. Thank you,
God. Thank you. Thank you.

804
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,636
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

805
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:18,671
No. No, Jackson,
no, I didn't mean...

806
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,135
Just, you know, now
things don't have to change.

807
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,045
We could stay dating, just
not while also raising a child.

808
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:28,359
Everything can stay the same.
You know, I'll just go on the pill

809
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,761
so I don't have to freak
out every time that I am late.

810
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:34,304
It's cool. Seriously,
don't bother.

811
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,107
What? Jackson...

812
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,009
Maybe this was a sign, you know?

813
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,711
That we needed to stop.

814
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,495
Honestly, I think
it's for the best.

815
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,431
Okay. I mean, if that's what...

816
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,738
It is.

817
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,446
I gotta go check in on
Torres. I will see you later.

818
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,248
Okay.

819
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,722
Hey, weepy.

820
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,728
No big deal, but
don't do that again.

821
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:15,929
It's gross.

822
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,164
Sorry.

823
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,056
What? You cared about him.

824
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:25,788
No, I didn't.

825
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,891
You did, just like you cared
about that other intern so much,

826
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,843
you fought me to teach her.

827
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,279
Just like you cared
about my wedding

828
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,727
enough to give
me personal advice.

829
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:39,218
Good advice that I'm
actually planning to take.

830
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,098
So I don't know
what happened to you

831
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,901
in that frozen hell of a tundra,

832
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:44,991
but you've changed.

833
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,325
I did not.

834
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,915
No. No, no, no, no, no!
You're supposed to...

835
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,551
You're supposed to wait. I'm
coming up with another plan.

836
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,853
It's not like the others.

837
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,132
Okay, great.
Well, let's hear it.

838
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,655
No.

839
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,958
No, you're just... You're
gonna crap all over it.

840
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,693
I've been busting
my ass for you on this

841
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,462
and making PowerPoints
and losing sleep

842
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,658
to talk to surgeons
in Switzerland

843
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:08,943
when I should be talking to you.

844
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,201
You want to fix your hand?
Then help me, damn it.

845
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,549
That came out a little
stronger than I intended.

846
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,250
You're right. Okay? So
here's what we're gonna do.

847
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,052
We're gonna throw
out everything we have.

848
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,342
We're gonna get new studies.

849
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,456
We're gonna come at
it from a different angle.

850
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,360
We're gonna clear our heads,
and then we are gonna figure it out.

851
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,365
So do we start right now?

852
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,515
Tomorrow.

853
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:31,137
You need to take the
night off. Thank you.

854
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,373
Oh, thank God.

855
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,242
Have I changed?

856
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,282
How?

857
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:43,917
How would he know that?

858
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:46,085
Who?

859
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,565
He says nothing has changed, but
what if I'm the thing that's changed,

860
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,749
but he won't
friggin' talk to me?

861
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:52,725
I'm all caught up now.
Do you think I've changed?

862
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,093
Well, you want Owen back.

863
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,394
I don't.

864
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,553
Yeah, I want Owen back.

865
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,939
We've changed. It's good.

866
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,145
I'd like to see that.

867
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,375
Dr. Hunt. Is there
something else?

868
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,415
Yeah, a question.

869
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,246
My conflict of interest here doesn't
seem to concern you too much.

870
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,580
Well, like we said,
it's unusual for...

871
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,398
What about my wife's
conflict of interest?

872
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:22,550
She's married to me, too.

873
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,651
Well, that...

874
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,375
I booked the plane,

875
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,422
and my wife could benefit
financially from my negligence.

876
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,979
You're hoping that because
I'm married to Cristina,

877
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,392
the judge will throw
this whole case out.

878
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,850
Whoa, Dr. Hunt. Let's
not over think this.

879
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,785
The board supports you 100...

880
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,223
Let me just remind you that

881
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,191
the confidentiality
agreement that you signed

882
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,577
is punishable by termination
and financial penalties.

883
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,767
I understand.

884
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,035
Have a good night.

885
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:02,328
You will be getting an
invitation in the mail soon.

886
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:04,864
There will probably
be elves on it.

887
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:08,635
You, however, will
not be getting me a gift.

888
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,882
Are you telling me that if
I get you a waffle maker,

889
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:12,338
you'll send it back?

890
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,907
I do like a waffle.

891
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:16,793
Well, it's gonna be fine.

892
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,311
You promise?

893
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,748
No. But I'll have
your back either way.

894
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,450
I wouldn't be able to
show up to work again.

895
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,606
It wasn't that bad.

896
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,869
It sounds pretty bad.

897
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,910
I cry during sex
sometimes. It's not that bad.

898
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,454
All right.

899
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:48,908
You look like crap.

900
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,694
Yeah. That's about right.

901
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,213
Beer. MAN: Sure.

902
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,315
So, Kepner's knocked up?

903
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:58,946
I mean, she was acting
a little weirder than usual,

904
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,147
you were taking her blood.

905
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,439
Here you go.

906
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,508
Well, not that it's
any of your business,

907
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,094
but no, she is not knocked up.

908
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:09,406
That sounds like
something to drink to.

909
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,830
Can we get another
round? Coming up.

910
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,361
No more calling her "weird."

911
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,318
She is. Yeah, I know. Just...

912
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,120
You're not allowed to say it.

913
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,686
Can you dance? Can
you show me your moves?

914
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:35,016
Hello. Can you dance with me?

915
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,922
Hi.

916
00:39:38,493 --> 00:39:39,826
What's going on here?

917
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,238
We're having a
little dance party.

918
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:44,330
So... I guess you
had a good day?

919
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,549
Yeah, yeah. I fell down.

920
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,284
What? What happened?

921
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:51,854
I got back up.

922
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,318
Hey, I started dinner, but then
little miss wanted my attention,

923
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:56,675
so do you mind
finishing the salad?

924
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,494
Sure. Hi, baby. Hi.

925
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,184
Hi, Mama. Hi, Mama.

926
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:07,131
Do you want to dance?

927
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,840
Hi.

928
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,227
You see my necklace?

929
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,506
<i>Maybe I do believe it...</i>

930
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,002
<i>All this "meant to be" stuff.</i>

931
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,089
Hey.

932
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,358
Hey.

933
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,394
So, I talked to Clemens.

934
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:35,014
He referred the tumor patient to
somebody over at Seattle Pres.

935
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,535
Great. Take a look at
the shirt that I bought Zola.

936
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,648
It's in the bag on the counter.

937
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,623
Meredith, guys don't get all
goo-goo over baby clothes.

938
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:45,958
Just look.

939
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,177
What is this?

940
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,847
<i>Why not believe it, really?</i>

941
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,555
<i>Who doesn't want more
romance in their life?</i>

942
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,869
It's only three weeks so I
shouldn't even be telling you.

943
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,210
I mean, I still have
a hostile uterus,

944
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,524
and terrible things are
constantly happening to us,

945
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,192
which is why I haven't told
anyone. I haven't even told Cristina.

946
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,584
So if you tell anyone,

947
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:14,887
I swear, I will kick you out
of this house that you built.

948
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:18,391
Don't worry. And good
things happen to us.

949
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:21,193
We're gonna have another baby.

950
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,215
We are gonna have another baby.

951
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,684
<i>Maybe it's just up to
us to make it happen...</i>

952
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:36,209
<i>To show up and be
meant for each other.</i>

953
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,766
Thank you for coming. Yeah.

954
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:45,801
We should talk.

955
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,553
We should.

956
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,989
<i>At least that way,
you'll find out for sure...</i>

957
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:51,240
I think...

958
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:52,925
We should get a divorce.

959
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,364
That's what you want?

960
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,000
<i>If you're meant to be...</i>

961
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:05,604
Yeah.

962
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,109
<i>Or not.</i>
