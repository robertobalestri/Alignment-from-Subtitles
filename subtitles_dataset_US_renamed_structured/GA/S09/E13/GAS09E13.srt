1
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,206
<i>They've installed cameras.</i>

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,715
They're all over the CCU.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,195
Next they'll be in the
ORs, the hallways,

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,430
the on-call rooms.

5
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:17,733
We're being spied on, Mer.

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,268
Who knows what evil lurks

7
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,303
behind that electronic eye?

8
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:22,671
<i>Morning, Dr. Yang.</i>

9
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:26,054
<i>Big Brother knows my name.</i>

10
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,790
<i>Big Brother can
see your name tag.</i>

11
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,013
<i>Excuse me.</i>

12
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,593
<i>The cameras are not
here to spy on you.</i>

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,311
<i>They are here to supplement you.</i>

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,848
On the other side of the
camera is a remote physician,

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,889
an extra set of eyes to
help reduce mistakes,

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,825
improve patient care, and
maximize physician hours...

17
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:46,027
<i>We've all heard
the buzz words...</i>

18
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:51,149
<i>"Streamline, optimize,
integrate, adapt."</i>

19
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,802
<i>Every day someone comes
up with a new strategy or tool</i>

20
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:58,573
<i>or technology to
increase our efficiency.</i>

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,209
<i>The idea is to make
our lives easier.</i>

22
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:03,023
<i>But the question is, does it?</i>

23
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,964
And of course, ultimately
reduce costly litigation.

24
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,816
So does that answer
your questions?

25
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,902
With disturbing clarity.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,620
All right. Let's move on then.

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,539
As you can see, this OR

28
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,942
has been arranged
with maximum efficiency,

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,394
specifically for OR turnover.

30
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:22,247
Now, what are the main
causes for bottleneck?

31
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,251
The layout of OR supplies,
equipment, and instruments.

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,479
So what we have done here...

33
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:28,648
What did we miss?

34
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,872
ORs are sloppy.

35
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,123
There are doctors
in the ceilings.

36
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,770
What? What do... What
does that even mean?

37
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,344
We'd know if you'd just
put her stupid tights on her.

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,658
I was talking her into it, okay?
She was getting on board.

39
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,727
She's two. At a certain point,
she doesn't have to get on board.

40
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,795
She has to be in day
care. So you pick her up

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,079
and you yank her tights on her.

42
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,380
That's what you do.
And then she cries.

43
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,765
Yeah, because you wasted
all that time cajoling her,

44
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,250
so now I have to be the bad cop.

45
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,351
If you just made it
clear in the first place

46
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,591
that she has no choice.

47
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,042
Because when
every second counts,

48
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,456
you need the most
efficient approach.

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,145
Mm. What she said.

50
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,501
It's about new hospital
procedures, and we weren't invited.

51
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,810
Thank God. It looks boring.

52
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,437
Don't you guys get
what's going on?

53
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,533
Yeah, they're closing the
ER. And streamlining the place.

54
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,553
It sucks, but...
They're gonna fire us.

55
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:08,376
Why bother teaching
us the new protocols

56
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,356
if we're gonna be gone
anyway? You're crazy.

57
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,620
It's not that bad.

58
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,749
Is it? Look at this.

59
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,887
Nurses are stockpiling.
The end is coming.

60
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,026
Your average time between
surgeries is 37 minutes.

61
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:28,597
With these new OR procedures,
I'd like to see that cut in half.

62
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,799
Thank you, everyone.

63
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,153
Closing the ER should
cut down on time.

64
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,332
We won't have any patients.

65
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,623
How's Hunt feel about that?

66
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,002
He says he's not gonna
do anything about it

67
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,291
until it actually happens.

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,660
It's happening.

69
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,795
And he can't be a trauma
surgeon without an ER.

70
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,309
Is he gonna leave town? 'Cause
if you go with him, I'm screwed.

71
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,627
I'm kind of depending
on your rent check.

72
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,029
Way to make this all about you.

73
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,386
The ER is not going to
close. Derek has a plan.

74
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:52,487
Where is Derek?

75
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,784
He spent the night with Kepner.

76
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,102
It's gonna work, right?

77
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,336
Of course. See, 'cause
if derm cuts a fellow,

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,610
and then cardio skips
the TED conference,

79
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,663
plastic/ortho
shares lab facilities,

80
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,359
we'll get a little bit
here, a little bit there,

81
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,195
and we'll have enough
saved to keep the ER alive.

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,519
They're gonna be mad
about the TED conference.

83
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,099
They're gonna be
pissed about everything,

84
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,700
but that's okay. It's gonna
work. Do we have a reply yet?

85
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,408
Uh, no, not yet.

86
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:14,876
That was the subject line?

87
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,589
What, is that bad?

88
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,842
Well, would you open an e-mail
that said "proposed budget cuts"?

89
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,493
Oh, no. Did I just
kill our proposal?

90
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,477
No. We're just gonna
have to pitch it in person.

91
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,620
Go door to door,
which is better anyway.

92
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:25,882
It's hard to say no
to someone's face.

93
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,438
Oh!

94
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,052
No offense, sir. You have an
unusually appealing face, but...

95
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,220
I have to brush
my teeth. Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,921
I know. You do, too. Oh.

97
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,379
Standardizing an
OR is one thing,

98
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,814
but that's not going to
make much difference

99
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,151
if we don't standardize
what happens in the OR.

100
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,320
To that end, I have brought
in Dr. Darrell Nesbaum

101
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:43,905
to show us how it can be done.

102
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,825
Everything will be scanned...

103
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,344
When did you become
such a kiss-ass?

104
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,980
The last five hospitals
whose efficiency she improved

105
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,782
ended up cutting
their staff by 30%.

106
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,932
I'll learn to rope cattle if
it means keeping my job.

107
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,241
Well, I'm safe because they
can't fire the pregnant lady.

108
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,407
Can they?

109
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,559
Uh, Dr. Nesbaum, you
can take it from here.

110
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:06,444
Of course.

111
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,296
Good morning, everybody.

112
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:11,817
Now, I have just one
question before we begin.

113
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,985
Are you ready to
rock some hernias?

114
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,220
Whoo!

115
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,205
That's what I'm talkin' about.

116
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,374
Has she moved yet?

117
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,981
What do you think?

118
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,961
Is her mom here? 'Cause
she's nicer when her mom's here.

119
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,263
No, she had to leave for work.

120
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,531
You sure the kid didn't eat her?

121
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,154
You guys, stop.

122
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:35,640
She's angry. She's 13 and she
had a double hip replacement.

123
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,841
You'd be angry, too.

124
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,571
She's mean. Like a badger.

125
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,179
She's three days
post-op now. Okay?

126
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,192
If she doesn't move her
hips, we're looking at clots,

127
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,683
contractures, poor recovery.

128
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,268
We just have to make
her do it for her own good.

129
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,138
Oh. Look who I'm talking to.

130
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,569
Can't even put a
toddler in tights. Huh?

131
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,041
Oh. Oh.

132
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,390
Well, then you just... You
show me how a bad cop does it.

133
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,349
Karev, get in there.

134
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,751
Why me?

135
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,819
We're attendings. You're
a fellow. It's an order.

136
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,686
That's how a bad cop does it.

137
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,310
Dr. Hunt, I sent contractors
to measure the ER space.

138
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,890
Yeah, and I told
them to get lost.

139
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,480
I know. That's
why we're talking.

140
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,883
The ER is open for one more day.

141
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,217
Uh, Dr. Hunt,

142
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,286
the ER is closing.

143
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,299
I know you don't want it to, but
you're gonna need to let that go.

144
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,023
While we are treating patients,

145
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,392
I don't want your
workmen in the way.

146
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,673
We are on a tight schedule
with the renovation.

147
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,408
I was hoping that
you would cooperate.

148
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,176
Yeah, well, you're
gonna need to let that go.

149
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,633
Well...

150
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,947
I'd just like to hear
you name one thing

151
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,149
that you can put in there
that's more useful than an ER.

152
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,806
It's still under review, but...

153
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,737
In the army, the guys at
the front get the most saves.

154
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,939
Why? Because the closer
you are to the moment of injury,

155
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,524
the better chance
you have to help.

156
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,591
That is what an ER is.

157
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,615
Where are we going?

158
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,483
Roof. Medevac's coming.

159
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,586
I shouldn't. I
should hop off now...

160
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,332
Emergency medicine
is the front line.

161
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,356
We're the first
responder. We're closest.

162
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,486
It's the most important
thing that a hospital does.

163
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,561
It's arguably... So
name me one thing

164
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,724
that you would replace
it with that matters more.

165
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,064
You've made your point.

166
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,078
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a big day, and I...

167
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,819
40-year-old male
logger versus chain saw.

168
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,667
Deep neck laceration affecting
most of the major blood vessels

169
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,002
and extending into the chest.

170
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,804
He's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

171
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,389
And his nose is
pretty much sliced off.

172
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,653
How's his airway?

173
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,025
Intact. It was never stridorous.

174
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,609
Did not appear to
involve the trachea.

175
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,518
Oh! Oh!

176
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,951
I got it. I got it.

177
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,204
It's the carotid.
I have it. I got it.

178
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:32,640
I was closest.

179
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,802
Okay, everything appears stable.

180
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,471
Let's redress the
nose. Page plastics.

181
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,039
- Right away.
- Gown me.

182
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,541
Work around Dr. Cahill and
see who else is available.

183
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,093
I'll check. Keep
holding pressure.

184
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,528
As soon as I find
another surgeon,

185
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,929
I'll take over and I'll
get you out of there.

186
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,119
No, I got it.

187
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,598
Having one person
control the carotid

188
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,742
limits his chance
of stroking out.

189
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,209
All right. Gown her, too.

190
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,728
Right away.

191
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,096
Start with Russell. You
want to do the opener or me?

192
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,409
Well, the numbers
are so compelling.

193
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,627
I think I'd start with how much

194
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,012
his department's cuts
will save the hospital.

195
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,963
And then I would...
I'll do the opener.

196
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,899
Sorry. I get a little
excited about statistics.

197
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,567
Not everybody shares
that passion. Not everybody.

198
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,219
Okay, so you do the talking,

199
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,720
and I'll hold up the chart
when you give me the signal?

200
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,178
Perfect. Damn it. Hunt
needs me in the OR.

201
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,357
You're gonna have
to start without me.

202
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,459
No. People don't like me.

203
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,582
Talk from your heart,

204
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,027
not about the charts
or the numbers.

205
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,368
You can do this.

206
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,869
Uh...

207
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,208
And there you have it.

208
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,109
A technique I have
developed through years

209
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,829
of highly focused research.

210
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,481
I eat, sleep, and
breathe hernias, folks.

211
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,516
After today, something
tells me you will, too.

212
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:51,035
Gross. Dr. Nesbaum.

213
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,766
Over the years, I've
developed my own technique

214
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,556
for a hernia repair.

215
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,821
So if it's all the same
to you, I'll stick to that.

216
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,194
I'm sure it's lovely,
but the point here

217
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,429
is to standardize the way

218
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,631
Seattle Grace-Mercy
West approaches the hernia

219
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,566
so every OR can be
prepped the same way.

220
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,536
It's quick, clean, efficient.

221
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,855
I suppose.

222
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,423
Listen to old man Webber.

223
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,242
"My ways are the best ways.

224
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,877
"Ooh, it's drafty in here.

225
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,696
"Somebody bring me a blanket."

226
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,465
Now what do you say to a
little friendly competition? Hmm?

227
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,785
The first surgeon who can
perform 20 hernia repairs

228
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,771
using my exact
tension-free mesh technique

229
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,642
will win bragging rights,
the respect of their peers,

230
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,126
and... Aha!

231
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,914
This sweet baby.

232
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,365
Oh.

233
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,279
I've seen those in the gift
shop. They're not cheap.

234
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,664
I knew it. They're
making us fight to survive.

235
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,354
First prize is a fleece.

236
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,503
Second prize is a
one-way ticket to the curb.

237
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,041
Shall we begin?

238
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:52,613
Tributes. May the odds
be ever in your favor.

239
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,919
Take 'em off.

240
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,141
What?

241
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,122
Well, we gotta get you up
and moving. Today's the day.

242
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,678
Maybe tomorrow's the day.

243
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,242
Look, if you don't get up, your
hips aren't gonna heal right.

244
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,499
I don't care.

245
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,235
I know it's hard.
But you're only 13.

246
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,598
You talk like your
whole life is over.

247
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,455
Like you even know
what my life was.

248
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,309
I know that you
were into gymnastics.

249
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:25,112
I wasn't "into gymnastics,"
stupid. It was my career.

250
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,847
Ever since I was four years old,

251
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,566
it's all I've ever wanted to do.

252
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,002
My mom worked double
shifts so I could be in the gym

253
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,403
five hours a day.

254
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,555
More on the weekends.

255
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,807
And I knew that if I
worked really hard,

256
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,027
someday she wouldn't
have to anymore.

257
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,663
I ranked number one at the
Future Stars Nationals last year.

258
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:46,101
I was going to the Rio
Olympics. I was next.

259
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,136
When my hips started to hurt,

260
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,938
I thought that I pulled a
muscle, so I trained through it.

261
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:55,943
I'm not next anymore. I'm
nothing. I'm number zero.

262
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,396
Hey. No, you're not.

263
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,209
Maybe this part might be over,

264
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,434
but you got time to
do all sorts of things.

265
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,270
They said that if the
surgery was successful,

266
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,306
I might be able to ride a bike,

267
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,652
'cause that's as good as having

268
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,093
your face on a
slurpee cup, right?

269
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,413
You might understand if

270
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,583
you've ever been
great at something.

271
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,084
Been best at something.

272
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,024
So, yeah, my life is over at 13.

273
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,661
I get to ride a bike
and go to school

274
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,112
and wait to die.

275
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:41,150
<i>Cardio tech to the ER.</i>

276
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,440
<i>Cardio tech to the ER.</i>

277
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,044
Dr. Yang, about the IV heparin
you ordered for room three.

278
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,549
Is there a problem?

279
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,553
No. It's just Dr. Richardson
insists I give sub-q enoxaparin.

280
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,206
Who the hell is Dr. Richardson?

281
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,330
Yeah. Ignore it.

282
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,898
I tried.

283
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,286
He keeps insisting, and it's
really upsetting the patient.

284
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,907
<i>Open the pod bay doors, HAL.</i>

285
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,915
<i>It's Bob Richardson.
Dr. Richardson.</i>

286
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,862
<i>I have a little problem, Bob.</i>

287
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,385
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

288
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,632
<i>You're supposed to be
our eyes in the sky, correct?</i>

289
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,733
<i>Yes.</i>

290
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,535
<i>Then how about you just do that?</i>

291
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,602
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

292
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,505
<i>Don't question my
medical decisions.</i>

293
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,290
<i>If I order my intern
to give IV heparin,</i>

294
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:38,679
I want IV heparin.

295
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,560
<i>I guess you haven't
read the results</i>

296
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,566
<i>from the SYNERGY trial,</i>

297
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,430
<i>which showed enoxaparin
reduced the need for monitoring.</i>

298
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,487
Oh!

299
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,689
Got a lot of time to read, Bob,

300
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,202
<i>hanging out in your underwear,</i>

301
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,071
<i>watching your wall of monitors?</i>

302
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,206
<i>'Cause that same trial found
that there was more bleeding...</i>

303
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,026
Dr. Yang. The pit's calling with a
possible cardiac trauma in the field.

304
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,883
Five minutes away.

305
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,664
Don't try and be a doctor, Bob.

306
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,982
Just make sure my idiot interns

307
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,438
<i>don't screw up.</i>

308
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,174
<i>Give the IV
heparin. Don't butt in.</i>

309
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,776
<i>Let's go.</i>

310
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,284
Dr. Russell. Dr. Kepner, trauma.

311
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:20,138
Trauma, of sainted memory.

312
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,456
Actually, we're trying
to save the department,

313
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,503
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about some ideas.

314
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,127
Got your e-mail.
"Proposed budget cuts."

315
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,274
Nice try.

316
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,598
Well, I think you'll
see that a 2%...

317
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,766
Okay, numbers
don't really matter. I...

318
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,313
Ever been to a TED conference?

319
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,087
I haven't. Inspiring.

320
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,734
Finest minds of our
generation under one roof,

321
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,841
sharing stories of
mind-bending innovation.

322
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,243
That sounds great but...

323
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:45,179
Innovation is what's
gonna save this hospital...

324
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,659
Okay. Not this penny saved,

325
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,826
penny earned crap.

326
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,150
Okay, but...

327
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,996
Good to meet you, Dr. Kepler.

328
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,236
Kepner.

329
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,738
This is a mess. I don't
think we can fix this primarily.

330
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,079
Can you check for back bleeding?

331
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,714
Cahill? Me?

332
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,395
Yeah, you're holding the
clamp. If you can't do it, then...

333
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,768
Okay.

334
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,368
He doesn't have any. Okay.

335
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,452
Which means he has
poor collateral flow.

336
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,021
We're gonna need a shunt.

337
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,445
I can put it in if someone will
get me a Rummel tourniquet.

338
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,731
Thank you.

339
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,578
Sorry. I used to do that.

340
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,091
Hmm. It's like
riding a bike, huh?

341
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,115
Yeah, if the bike's
going 200 miles an hour.

342
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,484
That's what makes it fun.

343
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,818
Yeah, damn right, it does.

344
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,367
So why did you
stop in the first place?

345
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah, Hunt, I got your page.

346
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,025
You're worried
about a brain bleed?

347
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,354
Yeah, we didn't get a
chance to do the scan.

348
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,610
His carotid blew.

349
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,056
Is that Kepner? Cahill.

350
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,897
Dr. Shepherd, hi.

351
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,343
So instead of telling
us how to do our jobs,

352
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,428
now you're just doing them?

353
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,084
That would be more efficient.

354
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,048
No, she was in the right
place at the right time.

355
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,282
She probably saved his life.

356
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,739
I got lucky.

357
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,958
Lucky for this guy his
chain saw slipped today.

358
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,764
Tomorrow he'd be dead already.

359
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,143
What do you got?
Skateboarder versus car.

360
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,700
Late teens. Didn't have ID.

361
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,447
The kid was slaloming
hills with a buddy.

362
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,082
Was nonresponsive in the field.

363
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,621
His last systolic was 70.

364
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,251
Heart rate tacking
along in the 130s.

365
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,109
EKG shows some changes,
so I suspect cardiac trauma.

366
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,439
Okay, I need a portable
X-ray up here, stat.

367
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,148
I need a 12-lead, and
let's get a TEE bedside.

368
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,576
Right away. Ready on
three. One, two, three.

369
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,159
Murphy, set up the TEE. Got it.

370
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,554
Type and cross for six units.

371
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,823
Hang two units of O-neg
as soon as possible.

372
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,303
Hey, what's your buddy's name?

373
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,660
Rich. Rich Campion.

374
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,055
Does he have any
allergies that you know of?

375
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,123
Is he on any medications?

376
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,763
I don't know.

377
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,026
Look, is he going to be okay?

378
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,201
We're doing everything we can.

379
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,332
No breath sounds on the right.
Someone set up a chest tube.

380
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,605
On it.

381
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,940
It looks like a
mediastinal hematoma.

382
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,525
Could be an aortic transection.

383
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,855
We need to move fast, people.

384
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,312
BP's still dropping. Scissors.

385
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,061
Yeah, he's crashing.
Where is that blood?

386
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,698
Right here, doctor.

387
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,051
He has a medical ID.
It must have broken off.

388
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,464
Okay. What's it say?
What's he allergic to?

389
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,553
Oh, God.

390
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:07,982
What is he allergic to?

391
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,409
Okay, stop.

392
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,644
He's a Jehovah's Witness.
We can't give him blood.

393
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,964
They're prepping the
OR for a bloodless surgery

394
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,565
so we'll need to
recirculate his blood.

395
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,984
So we'll put him on
a cell saver machine,

396
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,819
and then continue
the hypertonic saline,

397
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,771
colloids, and factor VII to pump
up his intravascular volume.

398
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,730
We're seriously repairing an
aortic transection without blood?

399
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,909
Yeah, we have no choice.

400
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,299
We could use blood.

401
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,112
We could also be arrested
for assault and battery.

402
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,647
Very funny. I'm not joking.

403
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,816
There are protocols in
place for people who won't

404
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,651
or can't accept
supplemental blood.

405
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,286
We do bloodless
surgeries here all the time.

406
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,244
Have you ever done this, a
bloodless aortic transection?

407
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,795
No.

408
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,477
<i>Dr. Radnor to
labor and delivery...</i>

409
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,678
I hear you. I did.

410
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,201
And...

411
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,403
Alex.

412
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,971
You don't have her walking yet?

413
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,567
There's no talking to that girl.

414
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,602
It's dark in there. Really dark.

415
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,987
Karev... I'm serious.

416
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:04,451
That girl turned me
into a suicide risk.

417
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm gonna move her myself then.

418
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,348
Excessive force,
bad cop's go-to move.

419
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,117
Oh!

420
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,652
You know what
makes a bad cop bad?

421
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,104
When the good cop's namby-pamby
approach gets us nowhere.

422
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,539
Then bad cop has to set a limit

423
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,086
and ends up looking
like a big meanie.

424
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,411
A good cop's approach
takes time and patience.

425
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,995
Bad cop is a notorious hothead.

426
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,064
If she's going to insist
on wearing dresses,

427
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,216
she has to wear tights.

428
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,525
I'm gonna go lie down.

429
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,117
His vitals are worse.
How's the cell saver coming?

430
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,202
Almost ready.

431
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,720
Do we have surgical glue? Yes.

432
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,227
Avitene? Yes.

433
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,457
Okay, I want two bovies set up.
- I'm on it.

434
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,548
Joy, get my headlamp
ready. Here it is.

435
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,182
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

436
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,318
Where is my gel
foam and thrombin?

437
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,648
We're trying to keep
blood loss to a minimum.

438
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,604
We need a whole bunch more.

439
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,975
Okay, hypertonic saline?
Factor VII? Check. Check.

440
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,388
Cell saver ready? Check.

441
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,728
Okay, let's go
before he bleeds out.

442
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,286
I can't cut. He'll
lose too much blood.

443
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,821
What do we do?

444
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,323
We'll go in percutaneously.

445
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,592
Get the OR ready for
an endovascular repair.

446
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,010
Let's move.

447
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,052
Excellent, Dr. Grey.

448
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,454
19 more to go.

449
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,131
You're gonna choke, Grey.

450
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,410
You'll choke and die,
and I will dance and sing.

451
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,978
Damn it. Damn it!

452
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,482
The mesh is bunching
up at the pubic tubercle.

453
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,513
You know, I still
feel that you do not...

454
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,331
I understand this
can be tricky at first,

455
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,949
but once you get the hang of it,

456
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,768
you'll see why a dozen
hospitals around the country

457
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,303
have already
adopted this approach,

458
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,905
and I've already had
inquiries from a dozen more.

459
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,495
Check! Excuse me.

460
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,696
Okay. All right.
That's the right idea.

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,453
But... But... But what?

462
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:53,883
Well... Check.

463
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,150
Check! WOMAN: Check!

464
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,107
Hey, don't beat around the bush.

465
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,219
Tell me what you don't like,

466
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,320
'cause it looks perfect to me.

467
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,810
Okay.

468
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,757
Take a look at what
Dr. Grey is doing over here.

469
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,264
You see how she doesn't
rush, cut the mesh just right?

470
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,585
See, now when done properly,
the mesh will fit perfectly

471
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,754
and not require extra
sutures to hold it,

472
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,856
thereby reducing the risk
of future complications.

473
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,338
So do this over, pay
attention to the details,

474
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,846
and take your time.

475
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,835
I would be happy to give
you some pointers if you'd like.

476
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:24,952
That bun in the oven may give
you job security, Meredith Grey,

477
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,381
but it does not make you
immune from a smack in the mouth.

478
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,031
Rich is still in surgery.

479
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,033
Dr. Yang sent me
down to talk to his family.

480
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,434
Well, how... How's he doing?

481
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,919
It's touch and go.

482
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,954
They're gonna take
him back up to the CCU.

483
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,573
Is his family here?

484
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,241
Dude, like...

485
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,309
Dozens of them. Lord...

486
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,924
You know, I swear, we
hung out practically every day.

487
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:55,065
We have the same
shift at the skate shop.

488
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,879
And he never once
mentioned to me

489
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,263
that he was a Jehovah's Witness.

490
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,720
He never talked about it.

491
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,851
Father of all mercy...

492
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,875
I kind of don't think he is.

493
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,623
Well, maybe it was
just a personal thing.

494
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,078
Maybe, but I mean, if you...

495
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,249
If you believed in something
so hard that you would die for it...

496
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,538
Would you keep it a secret?
Wouldn't you at least tell your friends?

497
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,806
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

498
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,886
I should... Look, I gotta...
I gotta get out of here.

499
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,023
Will you... Will you
call me when he's out?

500
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,480
Sure. No problem.

501
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:30,000
With which we ourselves
are being comforted by now.

502
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,371
Blessed be the God and
father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

503
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,685
We can't repair the
carotid under tension.

504
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,842
It'll pull apart.

505
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,210
Or clot. It's tricky.

506
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,323
We can't use one of
these vessels to patch it.

507
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,914
The chain saw chewed
everything up pretty good.

508
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,417
I could take a piece of
saphenous vein from the leg...

509
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,903
Yes. Good. Good.

510
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,416
Go ahead. Prep
the leg. All right.

511
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,822
Scissors and betadine, please.

512
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,191
Right away, Doctor.

513
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,075
So I hear somebody's
nose came off?

514
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,387
Can I have a headlamp, please?

515
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,645
Almost. Take a look.

516
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,207
Well, I would if
we could find out

517
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,983
where we're keeping the
headlamps these days.

518
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,979
And what should've
shaved off half a second

519
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,169
has now added five.

520
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,071
Thank you.

521
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,288
Gauze, please.

522
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,709
Oh, sorry. Meant
to just say "gauze."

523
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,677
That "please" just cost
me a tenth of second.

524
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,789
All right, Avery. That's enough.

525
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,413
Chief, you know
this is all about

526
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,082
turning over the tables for her.

527
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,595
I mean, I feel like I'm
working the dinner shift

528
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,619
at a Jumbo Burger
in here. Dr. Avery...

529
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,532
She should just replace us
with surgical robots, really.

530
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,501
I mean, that's essentially
what she's asking us to be.

531
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,601
Shh. Bless you.

532
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,786
You don't tell us
how to run an OR

533
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,920
if you don't
actually work in one.

534
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,243
That's all I'm saying.

535
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,141
You can tell Dr. Pantsuit
hasn't been in one in years.

536
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,748
Until today.

537
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,240
Well, I can repair this post-op.

538
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,109
So, just give me a
shout when you're done.

539
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,112
Thank you, Doctors.

540
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,483
Best of luck.

541
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:52,566
Mm-hmm.

542
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,235
I thought I was gonna be fired.

543
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:58,773
Sorry about that.

544
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,961
It's fine.

545
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,509
It's easier if
there's a bad guy.

546
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:05,746
My people just care
about this place.

547
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:08,082
I know. I know you're all upset,

548
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,484
especially you, losing your ER.

549
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,464
But I also know that without me,

550
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,366
you'd lose this entire hospital.

551
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,791
So if you need to blame
me instead of thank me,

552
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,659
I'm fine with that,

553
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,128
because I will
know who saved it.

554
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,798
I've saved a dozen
before just like this one,

555
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,187
and no one thanked
me for those either.

556
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,394
Let's add a CPK to his next blood
draw. What was his last hemoglobin?

557
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,363
Four.

558
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,648
The guy's on fumes.

559
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,718
Try and stimulate blood
production by giving EPO.

560
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:48,155
Or we could give him blood
and cut out the middle man.

561
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,590
<i>We can also give
IV iron-dextran.</i>

562
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:51,992
Thanks, Bob.

563
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,728
We can give him iron?
How is that logical?

564
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:56,808
We can give him the components
of blood, just not blood?

565
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,259
We have to respect his wishes.

566
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,417
What wishes? He
can't tell us anything.

567
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,647
His friend didn't even know
that he was a Jehovah's Witness.

568
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:03,782
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing

569
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,200
you talk about
at the skate park.

570
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,257
I'm just saying, he's 19.

571
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,042
How can he even
know what he believes?

572
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:10,477
When I was 19,

573
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,613
I was a completely different
person than I am now.

574
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,164
I wanted to be a radiologist.

575
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,350
Wow. I feel like I'm
seeing a whole new you.

576
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,765
Start his EPO and keep
a close eye on his crit.

577
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,554
Right away, Doctor.

578
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:23,424
So you're fine with this?

579
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,253
Even though he could
die, you're fine with just...

580
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,805
It doesn't matter what I think.

581
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:29,062
He had an alert. It was
very clear, no blood.

582
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,771
I don't get to have an opinion
about it, and neither do you.

583
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,051
So there's nothing we can do?

584
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,591
Yeah, there is.

585
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,975
We can talk to the family.

586
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,227
<i>Good luck.</i>

587
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:49,822
Simmi, I need you to take my
hand. I'm gonna help you sit up.

588
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,046
You're gonna swing
your legs to the side

589
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,288
and you're gonna stand up.

590
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,439
Now.

591
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,691
I don't give you
permission to touch me.

592
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,244
Like, bodily. I'll scream.

593
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,843
Simmi, if you don't move,
I'm gonna have to say

594
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,378
that you're acting
against medical advice.

595
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,247
We will discharge
you, you will go home,

596
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:10,237
and you will rot, okay?

597
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,984
The muscles around
your new hips will atrophy,

598
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:14,153
and you will probably
never walk again.

599
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:16,277
Why do you care?

600
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,478
Because I'm your doctor

601
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,627
and I worked very
hard to help you.

602
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,156
Wouldn't it suck if
you didn't help me?

603
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,284
If you went through all of that
training to become a big doctor,

604
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,242
you came up with a plan,

605
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,945
you did my operation, you
did it just right, just perfect,

606
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,981
you made me so
I could walk again,

607
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,098
but I didn't,

608
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:41,301
wouldn't you feel helpless,

609
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,238
like nothing matters?

610
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:47,741
No matter how much
you care, how hard you try,

611
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,311
how badly you want something,

612
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,298
you will never have it

613
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,602
because everything is
totally out of your control.

614
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,159
Feel that?

615
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,930
Couldn't have done
it better myself. Yes!

616
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,386
Yes, indeed.

617
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,689
Okay, all right,
people often ask me

618
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,759
how I can focus so
much time on hernias

619
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,672
and maintain this
level of excitement.

620
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:27,414
Well, now you see.
Perfection is exciting.

621
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:28,598
Yeah.

622
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,096
Hear that, Grey? I'm perfect.

623
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,583
Look at Miss
Slow-and-Steady over there.

624
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,040
Can't even bother
to participate.

625
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,278
No, seriously, Grey, you okay?

626
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,664
Yeah, yeah. I just need to...

627
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,154
Darn it.

628
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,576
Something's wrong.

629
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,212
Something's wrong.

630
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,058
You're right. I got
comfortable and flip,

631
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,844
and the universe is
smacking me down for it.

632
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,511
I'm not immune. I'm not safe.

633
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,086
Wait, wait. Grey,
stop. What is going on?

634
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,595
There... There's a flutter.
It's... It can't be right.

635
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,963
Sweetie. This is
not a bad thing.

636
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,271
What? It's not?

637
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,967
No, it's good.

638
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,301
It's so good.

639
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,256
Your baby's kicking.

640
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,313
Oh.

641
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,747
He's lost a lot of blood. I'd
say more than half his volume.

642
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:37,017
He'll make new blood.

643
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,786
It takes about four days
to make new blood cells.

644
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,872
He may not have that much time.

645
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,174
What would really help
is a blood transfusion.

646
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,209
No. No blood.

647
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,395
If you're worried about
disease transmission,

648
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,648
I can assure you that all of our
blood is meticulously screened.

649
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,368
It's not that we don't
trust your blood. We just...

650
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,765
We believe that
life is a gift from God

651
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,149
and we don't try to
sustain it by taking in blood.

652
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,696
Let me be perfectly clear,
your son's condition is critical.

653
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,749
Without blood, his organs
will start shutting down.

654
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,035
And once he starts that spiral,
there is nothing we can do.

655
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,344
Oh, dear God.

656
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,006
We are juggling all kinds
of substitute measures,

657
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,709
but nothing is as good as blood.

658
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,710
As his surgeon, I urge you

659
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,996
to let us give him the
best chance we can.

660
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,565
Let us give him blood.

661
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,155
We have seen amazing
miracles through prayer.

662
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,590
If it's God's will...

663
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,377
So you won't allow blood,
even if it's gonna save his life?

664
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,095
'Cause prayer... Murphy.

665
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,715
We appreciate all
you're doing for our boy.

666
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:45,318
But your blood wouldn't save
his life. It would condemn him.

667
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:51,323
Living with it would be so much
worse for him than dying without it.

668
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:54,827
We understand.

669
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:58,015
We will do everything in our
power to keep your son alive.

670
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,549
Thank you.

671
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,839
Colvin said I was insulting
him and everyone in his field.

672
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,176
Beck said she doesn't
talk to fund-raisers.

673
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,444
And... And Springfield

674
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,124
basically had me
agreeing to give him money.

675
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,842
And then Russell... You
talked about the numbers?

676
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,265
No.

677
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,833
April.

678
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:19,786
I didn't. I mean, just
a... Like barely at all.

679
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,666
We don't have a lot of time,
but I'll see what I can do.

680
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,023
There's Redmond.

681
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:24,258
Hey, hey, Tim.

682
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:25,976
I saw your little Howie today

683
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,306
when I was dropping Zola
off at day care. Man, he's cute.

684
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,524
Thanks. Yeah, he's a kick.

685
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,826
Yeah, Zola's at
that age where she's

686
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,194
just putting everything
in her mouth.

687
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,744
Yeah, we're not quite
there yet. Just you wait.

688
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:35,614
It's like, Legos,
magnets. Really?

689
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:37,632
Anything that is a
choking hazard, they find it.

690
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,300
Jeez. Yeah, well, lucky for us,

691
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,208
the ER is right downstairs
from the day care.

692
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:44,127
Yeah, that's for sure.
Wait, isn't that closing?

693
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,623
Yeah, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

694
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,431
Dermatology has two fellows.

695
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:49,716
Now if we could
just cut one of them,

696
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:51,985
maybe we could possibly...

697
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,613
I hate her.

698
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,696
Who?

699
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,610
My intern. Why?

700
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,785
Look at her, all mopey-faced
just 'cause she didn't get her way.

701
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,321
We were never mopey-faced.
We just sucked it up.

702
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,441
Why aren't you
in your skills lab?

703
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,788
Because the baby kicked.
Wouldn't stop kicking, actually.

704
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,507
Jerk. No, it's good. It's great.

705
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,197
Kicking is a good thing.

706
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,082
Maybe I should kick my intern.

707
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,230
Maybe my baby's kicking
because it wants a granola bar.

708
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,354
That's possible.

709
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,569
<i>You want to stop right there.</i>

710
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,753
You tried to give
blood instead of fluids?

711
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,421
He's not stupid, you
know, the eyeball.

712
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,490
<i>He has eyes.</i>

713
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,723
<i>And a zoom lens.</i>

714
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,070
Rich is circling the drain,
and he doesn't have to be.

715
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,710
We are giving him
everything we have,

716
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:25,058
just like the family requested.

717
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,347
Yeah, I know. And
they're praying. Awesome.

718
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,183
You never administer anything
to a patient without my orders.

719
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,080
You think that because
you've been here all of,

720
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,738
what, six months, you know
everything? You know nothing.

721
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,789
On the timeline of
doctoring, you are an amoeba.

722
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,736
I thought that he
deserved a chance.

723
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,212
You have passion. I get it.
You still have to do what I say.

724
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,098
I am your boss and I am
trying to save this patient's life.

725
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,267
Now get out of here.
You're off my service.

726
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:48,969
I just... Now.

727
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm sorry.

728
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,980
<i>What are you gonna
do, get her fired?</i>

729
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,417
<i>She didn't do anything.</i>

730
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:06,185
<i>There's nothing to tell.</i>

731
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:08,921
She's right, you know?
He's circling the drain.

732
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,957
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

733
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,744
Okay.

734
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:17,847
Ready?

735
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,333
Fingers crossed.

736
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,635
Yes.

737
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:22,944
The sutures will hold.

738
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,122
There will be no bloodbath.

739
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,774
Okay, let's go, Doctor.

740
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,342
Remove your clamps.

741
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,577
Dr. Cahill?

742
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,026
Okay.

743
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,693
Okay, good.

744
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,573
I totally wasn't sure
that was gonna work.

745
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,697
I get it. I get it.
But you did great.

746
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,401
I'd never have thought you'd
spent a day outside of an OR.

747
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,071
Oh! Thank you very much.

748
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,658
Good God. I have to go.
I've... I've lost a whole day.

749
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,359
You're all right if I...

750
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,544
No, no, we're not done.

751
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,991
But it's pretty
straightforward...

752
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,447
No, we need to finish debriding.

753
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,265
We need to put in drains, close,

754
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,136
then you get to tell the
family that you saved him,

755
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,138
he's alive because of you.

756
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,807
And then they get to thank you.

757
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,111
And that's the best part.

758
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,016
10 blade, please.

759
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,632
I'm saying, they always cut

760
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,607
the lowest on the
totem pole first.

761
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:34,874
And we're below that.

762
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,742
I've been emptying
urine bags all morning.

763
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,495
You gotta stop.

764
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,797
All these cuts,
the reconfiguring,

765
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,244
this is designed to
make the hospital

766
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,708
run more efficiently
in the future.

767
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,196
So? That means Cahill

768
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,137
is planning for the
hospital to have a future.

769
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,232
If you're gonna have a hospital,

770
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,317
there's one thing you can't cut.

771
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,019
Doctors.

772
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,426
Crap. My patient's coding.

773
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,829
See that? We save lives, people.

774
00:31:55,915 --> 00:32:00,016
We are smart,
young, vital doctors.

775
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,245
You're right.

776
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,331
If she's planning
for the future...

777
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,288
We are that future.

778
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,546
You hope.

779
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:16,866
'Cause you can talk all you
want and work hard, hustle,

780
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,414
you can empty more urine
bags than the next guy.

781
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,054
The future, kids,

782
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:23,002
is completely out
of your control.

783
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,125
Jeff. How's the research coming?

784
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,439
Save it. Your sidekick
already made the pitch.

785
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,107
Not gonna happen. Come on.

786
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,776
Your team can watch
the TED talks online.

787
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,920
It's not about the talks.
It's about the networking.

788
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,462
The real... This isn't about me.

789
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:52,997
This is what's good
for the hospital.

790
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,539
Everyone can benefit from
the ER, the patients especially.

791
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,056
Mm.

792
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,725
You know what might open
my heart to your cause?

793
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,511
Your parking space.

794
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,849
My space is right next to
yours. It's not even an advantage.

795
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,396
In fact, you're five feet
further from the door.

796
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,064
I don't want to swap.
I want 'em both.

797
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,866
I don't want you
dinging my doors.

798
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,390
What?

799
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,898
I want both spots so I
can park in the middle.

800
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,634
How's your sister, Jeff?

801
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,337
Really?

802
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,584
Really? You're
really gonna go there?

803
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,608
Well, I'll never forget
how grateful you were

804
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,942
when I clipped her aneurysm.

805
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,327
And you said,

806
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,379
"If there's anything I
can ever do for you..."

807
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:38,827
This is just plain bullying.

808
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,099
Say good-bye to TED, Jeff.

809
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,977
I still want your parking space.

810
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,966
May as well swallow your
poison berries now, Webber,

811
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,268
because I am the
girl who's on fire.

812
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,336
Check.

813
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,938
Very good, Dr. Webber.

814
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,857
Let's just...

815
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,304
I'm... I'm confused.
Where the mesh?

816
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:07,593
I didn't use any.

817
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,657
I wanted to give you a
look at the Webber method

818
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,365
so you can see just
what you're missing.

819
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,467
It's lovely, but...

820
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:14,735
Isn't it?

821
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,931
See, when I use
the relaxing incision

822
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,133
to oppose the tissue
without tension,

823
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,291
I achieve the same result
without the use of mesh.

824
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,629
But this method will no longer
be performed at Seattle Grace.

825
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,566
The method we learned
today is the accepted method

826
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,352
for open primary
repairs hospital-wide.

827
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,987
Because we're cogs
in an assembly line,

828
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,157
churning out product
over and over,

829
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,919
standardized across the country.

830
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,972
Don't you think every patient
deserves the same standard of care?

831
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,540
And how good can that care be

832
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:43,991
when we see 50
patients in a day?

833
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,843
What are their names?
Who are their families?

834
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,778
With that kind of volume,
who in the hell knows?

835
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,780
As long as you can slap a
sign on the door that says,

836
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,599
"Over ten million served,"
who the hell cares?

837
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,551
You're missing the point.
The patients don't matter.

838
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:56,793
What matters is... I didn't...

839
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,262
Obviously, I didn't
mean that. Okay?

840
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,983
We are only concerned about
hernias, right now, I mean.

841
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:05,830
See, that... That
is really quite good.

842
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,167
In the months to come, I think
everyone should follow your lead, okay?

843
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,990
Okay. Keep it up.

844
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,381
Still in v-fib.

845
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,128
How long has it
been? 26 minutes.

846
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,585
Push another epi and
charge again to 200.

847
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,770
Charging.

848
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,990
Clear.

849
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,821
Still nothing. Damn it.

850
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:31,111
Uh...

851
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,411
Charge to 200 again.

852
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,947
Clear.

853
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,392
Okay, I'm calling it.

854
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,527
Time of death, 6:42.

855
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,455
He didn't have to die.

856
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,285
All they had to do was
let us give him blood.

857
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,976
And he still could've died.

858
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:24,548
The CCU is full of people we
pump full of blood, and they still die.

859
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,898
People die.

860
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,500
You know, what you did was wrong

861
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:29,068
in about a hundred
different ways.

862
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:32,071
And I plan on telling you
all of them, just not right now.

863
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:37,760
'Cause right now, I have
to go talk to the family.

864
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,130
<i>Hey, show's over, Bob.
You can change the channel.</i>

865
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,571
Hey.

866
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,174
How'd it go?

867
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,777
Oh, for God sakes.

868
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,480
I mean... Okay, see,
Officer Hard-Ass?

869
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,229
Your approach doesn't
always work either.

870
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,105
Hey.

871
00:37:06,842 --> 00:37:08,858
You need to get up now.

872
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,322
You need to take a few steps
and remember how it feels.

873
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,479
And I know... I know
how hard this is.

874
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:14,997
But you want this. You do.

875
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,232
You don't know what I want.

876
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,585
No? Okay.

877
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,131
I lost my leg.

878
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,999
Less than a year ago.

879
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:36,486
And I was scared and in pain

880
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,674
and I thought that I
would never be able to do

881
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,690
the things that I
like to do anymore.

882
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,259
But I did.

883
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,645
I operated on you.

884
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,015
Wow.

885
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,517
They send the cripple in to
teach me how to live my life.

886
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,839
Okay. Okay.

887
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,289
You know what?

888
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,686
You can be scared
and you can be pissed

889
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,788
and you can lie here
like a garden slug

890
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,328
till you die for all I care.

891
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:04,997
But you will not, not,
become a monster

892
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,861
that takes everyone
else down with them.

893
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,635
You will treat people
with kindness and respect.

894
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,288
And you will
start with yourself.

895
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,657
And you will start
by standing up.

896
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,854
And you will do so by
the time I count to three,

897
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,028
or I will drag your
ass out of this bed.

898
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,613
So, one...

899
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:22,348
Two...

900
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:24,917
Three.

901
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,081
Okay. You got it.
You got it. You got it.

902
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,215
Okay. Okay, I
got you. I got you.

903
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,239
All right. Good. Good. Good.

904
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,225
Wow.

905
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,443
Take a step.

906
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,563
Great. Look at that. You got it.

907
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,551
Good. Good job.

908
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,853
All right. Look at you.

909
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,891
Oh, my... He's gonna live?

910
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,058
Mm-hmm.

911
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,226
Thank you.

912
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,779
This is who you really
should be thanking.

913
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,731
If it wasn't for
her... Thank you.

914
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,668
Thank you so much!
God bless you. Thank you.

915
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,394
Hold the elevator, please!

916
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,800
Oh.

917
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:15,601
Off to celebrate, are we?

918
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,773
I get it.

919
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:22,870
Well, change can be rough.

920
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,560
But once you get used to it,

921
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:28,798
you'll never believe you did
a hernia repair any other way.

922
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,151
And if I may say, that sweatshirt
is quite becoming on you.

923
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,117
It's itchy.

924
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,344
I did forget what a rush it is.

925
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,657
Yeah. What, saving someone's
life? Yeah, it's not bad.

926
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,727
You know, we could do that
again tomorrow if we had an ER.

927
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,402
We figured it out.
We can save the ER.

928
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,982
We got each department
to make some cuts,

929
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,416
and I'm gonna have
to park in Tacoma,

930
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,990
but it is going to work.

931
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,293
I'm sorry. You misunderstood.

932
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,696
No amount of budget
cutting or shuffling

933
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,996
is gonna save your ER.

934
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,415
Or your hospital,
for that matter.

935
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,799
You're getting us ready to sell.

936
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:08,955
What?

937
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,759
A buyer is going to
save your hospital.

938
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,812
I just need to
make it presentable.

939
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:18,330
I'm sorry. What? It's...

940
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,350
You're staging it, like a house.

941
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,684
Exactly.

942
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,687
And the ER is like
the shag carpet.

943
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,805
It's gotta go.

944
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,325
Sorry.

945
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,829
I had a wonderful time today.

946
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,877
<i>To really be efficient,</i>

947
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,948
<i>you have to eliminate
what doesn't work.</i>

948
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,478
<i>You have to figure
out what's important...</i>

949
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,546
What are you gonna do?

950
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,816
You mean right now or...

951
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,419
Or both. Whichever.

952
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:36,942
Right now I am
going to drink a lot.

953
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,245
That's all I know.

954
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,917
Can I buy the first one?

955
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:46,219
Yeah.

956
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,816
<i>And hold on tight...</i>

957
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:54,594
<i>To the things that matter most.</i>

958
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:07,307
Wow.

959
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,442
I felt that.

960
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,496
Wait.

961
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,232
Oh!

962
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,569
<i>You got a soccer
player, I think, right there.</i>
