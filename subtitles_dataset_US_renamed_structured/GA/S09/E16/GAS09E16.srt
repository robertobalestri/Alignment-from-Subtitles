1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,747
<i>There is a procedure
to treat epilepsy</i>

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,172
<i>that involves surgically
severing the connection</i>

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,441
<i>between the left
and right brain.</i>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,527
<i>The goal is to block
signals that cause seizures.</i>

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,664
A packet?

6
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,110
We're gonna
convince these people

7
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:19,567
to give us $175
million with a packet?

8
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,837
It's a nice packet.

9
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,505
Mer, Owen stopped calling.

10
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,202
If this doesn't work, he'll
never speak to me again.

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,676
Once we buy the hospital,
the sneaking around stops.

12
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,495
And once Owen
finds out what we did,

13
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,030
he's gonna be
the happiest of all.

14
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,148
Derek is completely...

15
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,167
<i>The problem is,</i>

16
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,337
<i>this also cuts off the brain's
ability to communicate with itself.</i>

17
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,600
Hey. Hi.

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,090
Good morning.

19
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:45,594
<i>The left side has no idea
what the right side is up to.</i>

20
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:48,662
<i>The patient may experience
problems with coordination...</i>

21
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,067
<i>Memory, speech.</i>

22
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,279
Okay, really?

23
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,620
It's been a week.

24
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,449
What the hell is going on?

25
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,806
You walk out, no warning,

26
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,619
and now the
hospital's falling apart.

27
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,271
Yesterday a bunch
of nurses walked.

28
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,372
We lost lab techs,
support staff.

29
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,045
What?

30
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,959
I mean, if you wanted to screw
the Pegasus deal, success,

31
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,316
high five.

32
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,129
But now people are
saying that without a buyer,

33
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,753
the whole place could
go belly-up in a month.

34
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,949
What are you trying to do?

35
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,773
We... Cristina.

36
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,228
Fine. Whatever.

37
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:22,509
<i>It's a drastic solution
that's only considered</i>

38
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>when all other
options have failed,</i>

39
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,837
<i>because once a
surgeon makes that cut,</i>

40
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,405
<i>there's no going back.</i>

41
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,554
Shane, have you seen the
Chief? Yeah, he's right over...

42
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,143
I'm too young to be this tired.

43
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,800
At least we still have jobs.

44
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,920
Stop saying that.
Hospitals don't just close.

45
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,229
Right?

46
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,677
Chief, the ORs are overbooked.

47
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,523
Seven more nurses didn't
show up for their shift today.

48
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,742
Too many surgeries,
not enough staff.

49
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,859
Um, do me a favor.

50
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,923
Go back up there and
see what can be pushed.

51
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,802
Dr. Bailey, you
look nice. New suit?

52
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,371
Old suit.

53
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,284
Been in the back of my closet
since my last job interview,

54
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,958
somewhere around Y2K.

55
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,109
You're going on interviews?

56
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,473
This place is a sinking ship.

57
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,758
This place is not sinking.

58
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,482
We're having some trouble,
but we're gonna fix this.

59
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,351
Cahill's convinced Pegasus
to come back to the table.

60
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,298
She's having that
meeting right now,

61
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,984
and she's going
to make this sale.

62
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,585
Everything's gonna be fine.

63
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,089
Whatever you say, Cap'n.

64
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,027
Bailey, please.

65
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,408
They're reevaluating their offer

66
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,144
based on all of these walkouts.

67
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,213
We can't afford to lose
another surgeon, most of all you.

68
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,753
Me?

69
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,834
You're the heart of
this hospital, the spirit.

70
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,991
You set the tone that
others can aspire to.

71
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,504
This place can't
function without you.

72
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,411
Right, Brooks?

73
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,496
What?

74
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,930
Yes. Right.

75
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,134
Fine.

76
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,401
You better be right.

77
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,185
'Cause if this boat goes under

78
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,550
and I don't have a life jacket,
I'm coming looking for you,

79
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,907
fists swinging.

80
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,158
And I'm short, so
my punches land low.

81
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,910
<i>Neuro Resident,
extension 2-2-1-9.</i>

82
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,301
<i>Neuro resident,
extension 2-2-1-9.</i>

83
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,069
I think Dr. Webber's
having a stroke.

84
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,898
You need to go.

85
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,073
Where?

86
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,101
Don't care. Just go. Go now.

87
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,056
She's pretty. Mom.

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,212
How was breakfast?

89
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,663
Ah, informative.

90
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,043
If what Richard
tells me is true,

91
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,507
it's time for you
to come to Boston.

92
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,333
What have you done?
Okay, now just wait a second.

93
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:30,387
I've seen the kind of garbage
that goes on in a Pegasus hospital.

94
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,305
If your options are
either working for them

95
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,173
or this hospital shutting
down altogether...

96
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:35,664
Catherine,

97
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,517
okay, this hospital
is not shutting down.

98
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,745
In uncertain times,

99
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,370
men like Jackson and
myself have to stand tall.

100
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,357
We can't pack up and flee
at the first sign of trouble.

101
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,409
A man who does not
bend to the winds of change

102
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,145
is a man that you
can be proud of.

103
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,547
That's poetic.

104
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,100
I'm just sayin', let's slow down

105
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,335
and see how this all shakes out.

106
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,481
I don't think...

107
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,682
Mom, I agree with Dr. Webber,

108
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,439
with Richard.

109
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:08,830
I can't say that
I like this at all.

110
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,618
You can push it a day.

111
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,820
It's a tumor surgery
on a little kid.

112
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,700
Right, but is he
"dying today" sick

113
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,024
or "can't play soccer
but still hanging on" sick?

114
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,294
I'll see myself out.

115
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:28,283
<i>Dr. Glass, call the
operating room.</i>

116
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,497
You take Bobby Brinn in
for his pre-op scans yet?

117
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,786
Oh, no, not yet.

118
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:32,965
What about Julie Chang's labs?

119
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,005
Just about to do that.

120
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,021
Are you pissed at me? What?

121
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,023
I blew you off last night,
and you're pissed at me.

122
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,593
I'm pissed because I have
85 million things to worry about

123
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,857
since Robbins walked out.

124
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,113
You hanging out with your
boyfriend isn't one of 'em.

125
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:49,588
I shoulda gone to Hopkins
when I had the chance.

126
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,941
I'll get those labs.

127
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,721
Okay, so this time, I'll do
the peds and trauma stuff first.

128
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,122
And then I will
go into the neuro.

129
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,573
Okay, can somebody
else do the closing?

130
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,741
I was awful last
time we practiced.

131
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,964
No, you were fine.

132
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,133
We really want to
end on my flop sweats?

133
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,379
Derek, you do the closing.

134
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,398
I'm sorry. It should be
just a few more minutes.

135
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,233
Can I get you any
water or coffee?

136
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:08,368
No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

137
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,457
Coffee.

138
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,058
And a bagel or something.

139
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,107
I'm starving.

140
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,242
This meeting was supposed
to start half an hour ago.

141
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,665
Okay, he's a billionaire.

142
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,617
One of his minutes
is worth 40 of ours.

143
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,864
I can't believe we got this
meeting in the first place.

144
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,033
Yeah, nice job, Stan.

145
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,089
I really believe Julian
Crest is our guy.

146
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,509
He made all his money in
late-stage Internet mobile.

147
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,795
Medical tech is the one area
he doesn't have a foothold.

148
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,665
Your focus on applied
research, it's right up his alley.

149
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,118
Yeah, well, someone
should buy him a watch.

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,487
Who are you calling?
Heather Brooks.

151
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,807
Mousy.

152
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,074
Wait. What are you doing?

153
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,537
What happened to
not talking to anyone?

154
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,223
I left patients behind. She's
keeping an eye on them.

155
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,792
I haven't said anything to her.

156
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:49,981
I'm giving her advice.

157
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,482
Oh.

158
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,429
We're all set if
you'll follow me.

159
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,734
Oh. ARIZONA: Oh, okay.

160
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,573
Leave it.

161
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,644
Mmm!

162
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,072
I am not the heart
of the hospital.

163
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm a chump who didn't quit
when she had the chance.

164
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,294
Now I'm stuck
cleaning up the mess.

165
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,728
Brooks, you gonna
answer that phone?

166
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:10,919
Sorry.

167
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,088
Oh, it's my mom.

168
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,257
She's going through
a rough patch.

169
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,624
Less about your mom.

170
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,538
Right. Okay. Uh, Melissa
Keyser, 28 years old.

171
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,361
She's a former
patient of Dr. Grey's.

172
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,997
She's been on dialysis but
has exhausted all viable veins

173
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,098
and is now septic.

174
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,478
Which means she's done. Ha!

175
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:28,347
Dr. Grey left me a hopeless
patient. Of course she did.

176
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,605
May as well have left me
a pillow to smother her with.

177
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,326
Are you the doctor?

178
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,062
My mom won't wake up.

179
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,008
<i>Dr. Granville to recovery.</i>

180
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,157
<i>Dr. Granville to recovery.</i>

181
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,894
You're lurking. You blame me?

182
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,338
I did it. They're in.

183
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,518
The deal closes at
8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

184
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,637
Seattle Grace-Mercy
West will officially

185
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,578
be a Pegasus Horizons hospital.

186
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,814
I can't... That's... Really?

187
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,594
I told you I was good at this.

188
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,331
There are just a
few things to iron out,

189
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,532
so I'll find you
when we're done.

190
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,488
Okay, well, I have...
I have a surgery,

191
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,789
but I could come in right...

192
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,587
No, go, go. Be a
doctor. I'll find you.

193
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,210
Okay. Hey, Alana?

194
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,013
Thank you.

195
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,386
<i>You are investing
in an institution,</i>

196
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,672
<i>a reputation, a legacy.</i>

197
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,509
But Seattle Grace-Mercy West
Hospital is worth more than its past.

198
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,712
Our plan is to build
on that reputation,

199
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,315
to make Seattle Grace a
place where medical innovation

200
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,817
is developed and delivered

201
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,019
to the patients who need it.

202
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,022
That is our plan.

203
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:57,158
That is the future
of Seattle Grace.

204
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,527
And we invite you
to be a part of it.

205
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,455
Neat.

206
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:17,094
We'll, uh... We'll let you know.

207
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,147
I thought you were
taking us to Julian Crest,

208
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:20,731
not his day care center.

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,445
You don't just walk in and
talk to a guy like Julian Crest.

210
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,447
There are hoops to jump through.

211
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,104
Those junior execs like us,

212
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,869
they pass us up to his
business development guys.

213
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:32,272
We impress them, then
we see the man himself.

214
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,429
Oh. Will they do this
before or after their naptime?

215
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,925
You were golden in there.

216
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,861
There's no way you don't
make it to the next level.

217
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,362
I'm telling you, any second now

218
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,052
this phone is gonna ring.

219
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,090
Really, any second now.

220
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,424
Yes, I understand.

221
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,742
What are they saying?

222
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

223
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,094
Understand? What
do you understand?

224
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,278
Thank you. Thank you
very much for your time.

225
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,899
You guys, you were kind of rude.

226
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,151
Well, what did
they freaking say?

227
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,391
I'm sorry. You got the meeting.

228
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,177
Oh! Yes.

229
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,230
Brooks.

230
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,415
Brooks, what's the story?

231
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,696
I'm sorry, but I'm on
Bailey's service today,

232
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,198
and she is not your biggest fan.

233
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,571
Okay.

234
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,984
<i>Melissa Keyser's
in septic shock.</i>

235
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,920
Her last systolic
was in the 70s,

236
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,854
but Bailey's not ready
to throw in the towel yet.

237
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,506
<i>Which is why I've
been trying to reach you.</i>

238
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,948
So I found this article on
surgeons crafting artificial arteries

239
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,433
<i>for patients with
exhausted vessels.</i>

240
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,697
Brooks, what are you doing
in here with the lights off?

241
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,815
Gotta go, Mom.

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,479
<i>Bye.</i> Uh...

243
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,843
Dr. Bailey, here is the work-up.

244
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,331
Ooh.

245
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Maybe we really do need to
look into that smothering pillow.

246
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,381
You know...

247
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,684
I actually think
I read an article

248
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,444
about artificial arteries for
patients with exhausted vessels.

249
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,996
Really? Tell me more.

250
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,643
I don't remember more.

251
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,300
Well, then find me that article.

252
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,215
Angry Avery returns.

253
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,634
What? Your face.

254
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,382
You get all mad and your
eyebrows do that thing. It's cute.

255
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,473
It's my mom.

256
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,542
She's been on me for
years to come back to Boston

257
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,545
and take a leadership role in
the Harper Avery Foundation.

258
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,514
And now she is
ringing that bell again,

259
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,482
that loud, very loud bell.

260
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,135
You're leaving?

261
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,205
No. I work here.

262
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,357
Did you prep Mrs.
Preston for the rhinoplasty?

263
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,725
That's been pushed.

264
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,689
Leah says Dr. Hunt's canceling
all non-emergent surgeries.

265
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:05,558
I actually thought that's
what Angry Avery...

266
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,222
That's the fifth time this week.

267
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,603
I never thought I'd say this,

268
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,705
but maybe my mom has a point.

269
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,212
Okay, Bobby. So here's the plan.

270
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,360
What I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make a small incision

271
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,584
right about here.

272
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,265
Then I'm gonna take Phil and
I'm gonna stuff him in a bag.

273
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,856
And I'm gonna chop him
into a tiny million little pieces.

274
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,045
And then I'm gonna
yank him right outta there.

275
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,493
And <i>adios,</i> Phil.

276
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,728
Hear that, Phil?

277
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,146
You're going down.

278
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,184
Phil's his tumor. Mmm.

279
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,386
He was six when we
found out about the mass.

280
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,009
Bobby heard "man,"

281
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,158
which, you know, kind of
made it easier to talk about.

282
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,949
There's this evil little
man inside of him.

283
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,245
Dr. Karev,

284
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,835
can I keep Phil's head?

285
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,848
When I'm done grinding up Phil,

286
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,567
there's not gonna
be a head left to keep.

287
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,207
That's so gross.

288
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,380
Just admit it, Dr. Hunt.

289
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,494
My gut's a mess
because you screwed up.

290
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:17,363
Adhesions are unfortunately
a normal complication of this...

291
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,021
How can four surgeries
in two years be normal?

292
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,785
You're supposed to be in
there clearing out my scar tissue.

293
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,821
Instead you keep making more.

294
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,545
Sorry I'm late.
I had to do lots.

295
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,776
And now you're gonna let Tardy
Marty dig around in me, too?

296
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,067
Why do I keep coming
back to this chop shop?

297
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,069
Because today we're
trying something new,

298
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:37,539
something we only do
with high-risk patients.

299
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:38,956
Which you certainly seem to be.

300
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,620
Pick up on that, did you?

301
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,743
Andy, this is going to work.

302
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,390
What happens if I get up
and walk outta here right now?

303
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,333
The blockages caused by
your scar tissue will stay blocked,

304
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,034
and then you die.

305
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:52,694
Well...

306
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,940
You could've led with that.

307
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,761
Something I can
do for you, Avery?

308
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,634
I don't know. Is there?

309
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,287
What?

310
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,655
I think you know something.

311
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,741
I know many things.

312
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,410
The kind of things to get a man
talking about winds of change

313
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,228
and standing firm,

314
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,864
even though it
feels like the ground

315
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,493
is about to crumble
out from under me?

316
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,274
A week ago, I came
across Torres, Yang,

317
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,876
Robbins, Shepherd, and Grey

318
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,211
all having some kind of powwow.

319
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,791
When I asked them
what they were up to,

320
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,292
they slammed the door in my face

321
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,651
like I was Diane Keaton at
the end of <i>The Godfather.</i>

322
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,065
Hour later, they resigned.

323
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,370
That sound at all
suspicious to you?

324
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,678
Sir, something tells
me you used to watch

325
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,246
a lot of <i>Unsolved Mysteries.</i>

326
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,143
I solved three of 'em.

327
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,939
This would restore
Seattle Grace-Mercy West

328
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,543
as the region's leader in adult
and pediatric trauma medicine.

329
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,511
Dr. Shepherd?

330
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,258
Yeah, we'll lead the
way in neuroscience,

331
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,625
a dedicated research institute

332
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,361
for the advances
of brain mapping,

333
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,613
with applications to the
treatment of Alzheimer's

334
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,853
and Parkinson's disease...

335
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,783
May I stop you for a second?

336
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,319
We would love to see a
little bit more on the financials.

337
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:23,372
Income statements, profit
projections, cash flow.

338
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,696
Your allocation of revenue,

339
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,317
perspective payment for
MS-DRGs versus capitation income?

340
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:33,871
Um...

341
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,623
We've got all that.

342
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,135
Yep. Right here.

343
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,253
Got it.

344
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,778
Marketing, customer
retention plans...

345
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,980
Is there a trend study here?

346
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,767
Yep.

347
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,169
One second.

348
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,976
I'm just running
it by Mr. Crest.

349
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,177
Oh.

350
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,946
Mr. Crest apologizes,

351
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,666
but he's leaving this
evening for Dubai.

352
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,034
Oh. Okay.

353
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,470
Dubai.

354
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,539
Wow.

355
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,044
But he can make 15
minutes for you this afternoon.

356
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,373
Great. Thank you.

357
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:49,797
All right. Great.

358
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,470
Alana.

359
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,539
I didn't expect it to
happen this quickly,

360
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,874
but I also didn't expect
it to happen this way.

361
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,893
I know.

362
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,458
The board just needs to review
their counteroffer and accept.

363
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,314
I called an emergency
meeting in an hour.

364
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,550
I would like you to be
there when I tell them.

365
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,418
Have you told Dr. Hunt yet?

366
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,321
That Pegasus is buying
his hospital for parts,

367
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,225
liquidating its assets,
laying off its staff?

368
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,373
I just haven't figured out how.

369
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,413
It isn't pretty, but
we needed a deal.

370
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,148
And it's a deal.

371
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,433
<i>Brooks? What's going on?</i>

372
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,705
<i>Is it Bailey?</i>

373
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,772
It's my fault. It's my fault.

374
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,006
Everybody's
gonna lose their jobs

375
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,141
'cause I had a stupid
idea. Oh, no, no, don't.

376
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,809
Nobody is gonna lose their jobs.

377
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,844
Everybody is. Brooks
heard it straight from Cahill.

378
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,279
The hospital is liquidating.

379
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,431
The deal is closing
tomorrow morning.

380
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:46,503
Does Owen know?

381
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,005
She didn't say.

382
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,986
All right, so Crest is our last
meeting, and it's our only chance.

383
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,225
In two hours.

384
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:52,509
Oh, no pressure or anything.

385
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,927
Ugh.

386
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:54,996
Okay.

387
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,848
Well, if we only get 15 minutes,

388
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,818
then we need to make
the most of them, so...

389
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,586
Right.

390
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,899
Right, right. We can't
just sit on our thumbs

391
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,568
and let 'em read
Stan's boring crap.

392
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,757
No offense.

393
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,537
None taken. It's
interesting to me.

394
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,888
We need to know all
of this boring crap, too.

395
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,156
All right, so we need
to be able to answer

396
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,842
every single
question he could ask.

397
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,176
Okay, well, let's divide it up.

398
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,360
Stan, give us all the
boring crap you have.

399
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,388
That doesn't make any sense.

400
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,823
It's true. Cahill said...

401
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:23,925
Brooks.

402
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,765
Okay. You... You
just can't say anything

403
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,132
to anyone else.

404
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,801
Something like this, it's...

405
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,604
People panic. It's too...

406
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,422
It's too big.

407
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,908
I don't understand.

408
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,444
This morning, you called
this place a sinking ship.

409
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,578
No, that's different.

410
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,930
I never thought it
would actually sink.

411
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,804
You keep your mouth
shut, you hear me?

412
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,772
They are stripping us for parts

413
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,274
like a busted ass truck.

414
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,636
What, and we're just
supposed to believe that

415
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,987
because you got a
kicky little haircut?

416
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,578
And also because it's true.

417
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,313
Ugh. I'm gonna be sick.

418
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,181
And I have a surgery.

419
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,417
I'm gonna be sick
in my final surgery.

420
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,135
This is not how I
wanted to go out.

421
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,099
Jackson might be
going to Boston.

422
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,784
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I... Stop right there.

423
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:14,342
I know this is really
bad, but don't be that girl.

424
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,959
What girl?

425
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,246
That girl who follows her
boyfriend across country

426
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,463
like a puppy dog.

427
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,198
I am not that girl.

428
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,503
They were just awarded
millions of dollars.

429
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,671
I'd quit my job, too.

430
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,216
No, you wouldn't,
and neither would they.

431
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
They're not that kind of people.

432
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,453
Oh, that's bull. They're
exactly that kind of people.

433
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,655
They're only out for themselves.

434
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,989
They're probably pooling
their money together

435
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,090
for some private
practice or something.

436
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,680
I don't buy it.

437
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,059
You want to start a restaurant,
you don't use your own money.

438
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,561
And they have no reason
to keep that a secret.

439
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,829
I shoulda gone to
freakin' Hopkins.

440
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,420
Yeah, that was a bad move.

441
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,467
What do you think's
going on over there?

442
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,741
You guys, we
cannot say anything.

443
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,654
News like this will
just make people panic.

444
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,405
Yeah, no kidding. I'm panicking.

445
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,224
Exactly, so don't say anything.

446
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,047
Don't say anything about what?

447
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,769
<i>Marcia Lowe,
return to admitting.</i>

448
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,505
<i>Patient Marcia Lowe,
return to admitting.</i>

449
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,925
You heard.

450
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,839
Your intern.

451
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,963
Damn that girl. I...

452
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,100
Could just grab
her by the hair...

453
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,262
What's that?

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,332
Oh, I'm...

455
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,135
Giving a patient
an artificial artery

456
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,837
so that she can
stay on dialysis.

457
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,806
Keep her alive long enough

458
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,175
to get the kidney
she's been waiting on.

459
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,363
Sounds like fun.

460
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,531
Want to scrub in?

461
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,017
Might be our last chance.

462
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,335
One more for the road.

463
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,713
I thought I'd be chief
of surgery someday.

464
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,073
You shouldn't spread
that kind of rumor.

465
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,140
It's not a rumor.

466
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,475
I heard it from Brooks.
She heard it from...

467
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,549
That is a textbook rumor.

468
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,617
And it's not true. Just
ask Hunt. He'll tell you.

469
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,970
He'd never confirm
something like that to an intern.

470
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,288
You ask him.

471
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,523
It's not my rumor.

472
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,308
Hey. We ready to roll?

473
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,580
As an academic medical center,

474
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,599
we are currently at 411 beds.

475
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,746
But once we're restored
to a level I trauma center,

476
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,064
that number will raise to 500.

477
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,632
Right, increasing
revenue streams

478
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,373
for both acute
and long-term care.

479
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,590
Pause.

480
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is in Chinese.

481
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,679
Literally in Chinese.

482
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,876
Tell Simon I need these in
English before I go back in there.

483
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,677
And have Alyse cancel
my tee time at Canterwood.

484
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,762
Right away. Sorry. Go.

485
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,101
Yeah, we're all very...

486
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,949
Did Sandy take my
luggage already?

487
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,273
I need my charger thingy.

488
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,026
So we're passionate about patient
care and medical advancement.

489
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,647
We want to be the premier
hospital in the US for both.

490
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,250
Your bags are at Sea-Tac
already. Should we bring them back?

491
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:10,995
No, that's silly.
Mr. Crest, here it is.

492
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,481
Not you. You're
great. Keep going.

493
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,382
All right, we would comprise
the managing board,

494
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,669
and with you being the
primary shareholder, you could...

495
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait. Stop. Go back.

496
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,989
I thought you were
looking for an outright buyer.

497
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,263
You want to run this?

498
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,248
We do.

499
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,544
But we all trained
and worked there.

500
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:27,212
Yeah, we know the
place better than anyone.

501
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,585
We've invested ourselves...

502
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,532
Yes. Invested
yourselves. I love that.

503
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,772
Sir.

504
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,042
You have totally done that.

505
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,162
The Shepherd method of
viral glioblastoma treatment...

506
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,892
Dr. Grey, your name
was on that, too, right?

507
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,399
It was.

508
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,285
You wrote the book on
scaffold-free cartilage fabrication.

509
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,367
First in your class at Smith,
Berkeley, and Stanford.

510
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,408
And Tim Kenner at Hopkins
won't shut up about you.

511
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,677
Oh.

512
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,790
Oh, well, um, clearly,
you've done your homework.

513
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,230
Yeah, I did.

514
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,276
What I found is, there's
not a manager in the bunch.

515
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,162
No administrative
leadership experience.

516
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,448
You gotta have someone
who can keep the lights on.

517
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,166
Dr. Shepherd was
the chief of surgery.

518
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,589
Yeah, for about ten minutes.

519
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,536
Then you stepped down,
own volition, no reason given.

520
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,060
What my gut tells
me is, you didn't like it.

521
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,596
Surgeons like surgery.

522
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,848
I know when I find
something I don't like doing,

523
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,266
I don't do it well.

524
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,851
They're ready for you.

525
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,598
Sorry. I have three meetings
before I get on a plane.

526
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:21,567
Thank you all so much
for coming to me with this.

527
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,273
I respect your passion.

528
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,675
I share it.

529
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,677
But I'm not feeling this.

530
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,956
Get someone on your team

531
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,514
with some real
administrative experience,

532
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,742
and we can talk.

533
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:37,304
Hmm.

534
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,773
This is what I've been saying.

535
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,175
We have the experience.

536
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,476
Well, he doesn't
think so. So we're...

537
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,910
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't do that, okay?

538
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,945
There's still something we
can do. What can we do?

539
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,897
He wants experience.
Let's get Richard.

540
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,761
What about the
guy who's chief now?

541
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:56,501
Well, we can't tell Owen.

542
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,103
What the hell difference
does it make now?

543
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,993
We need him.

544
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:01,606
All right, so if we get
Richard and Owen, then what?

545
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,729
Do we get another meeting?

546
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,158
Crest is leaving
for Dubai tonight.

547
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:06,678
Well, then we do
it before he leaves.

548
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,680
Uh, okay. Well, we can't
all march into the hospital.

549
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:10,699
Well, I'll go. I'll
go get Richard.

550
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,072
Okay.

551
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,578
Brooks, if that's your mother
on the line, so help me...

552
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,153
Dr. Webber, Dr. Grey is
in the waiting area for you.

553
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,254
It's urgent.

554
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,838
Meredith Grey?

555
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,803
Um, Brooks, come over here
and assist Dr. Bailey, please.

556
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:31,970
Wait. You're not actually going.

557
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,593
I'm sorry, Bailey. Hurry.

558
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,724
What else?

559
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,683
What else can Meredith Grey
possibly take from me today?

560
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,086
She gave us this fix.

561
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,349
What's that?

562
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,624
She gave us this fix.

563
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,959
She doesn't even
work here anymore,

564
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,972
and she's still out there
trying to help her patients.

565
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,596
Uh, what the hell are you
doing sharing patient details

566
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,512
with someone who
doesn't even work here?

567
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,085
She cares.

568
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,403
Oh, she cares?

569
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:01,966
Now don't you tell
me about caring.

570
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,350
I'm the heart of
this damn hospital!

571
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,061
All right, these adhesion
barriers we're placing

572
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,748
should keep the tissue
separate while it heals.

573
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,215
You said "should,"

574
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,618
but you told Andy that
they would for sure.

575
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,766
Right, with a guy like Andy, you
tell him the best version of the story.

576
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,900
So what happens
if it doesn't work?

577
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,374
Ross.

578
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:22,487
Well, if it doesn't work, then
we come back in six months

579
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,543
and we try again.

580
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,932
But we won't be
here in six months.

581
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,436
Ross heard a stupid rumor

582
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,038
that the hospital
is shutting down,

583
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,273
and now he's apparently
having a breakdown.

584
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,991
All right, everyone, I
shouldn't be telling you this.

585
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,148
It is still in the works,

586
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,718
but Pegasus is
buying this hospital.

587
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,331
And nobody is going anywhere.

588
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,366
You're lying. APRIL:
He wouldn't lie...

589
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,568
Yes, he would. He just
told us that he would.

590
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,520
Only this isn't telling the
best version of the story.

591
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:56,638
It's a flat-out lie.

592
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,895
What are you talking about?

593
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,875
Don't pretend like
you don't know.

594
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,294
Pegasus is buying the
hospital so they can liquidate it.

595
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:03,834
We're all losing our jobs.

596
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,496
Would you just
tell him it's not true?

597
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,254
It is not. Who said that?

598
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,562
Cahill.

599
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,464
It's okay. Uh, I got this.

600
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:28,092
He lied then he walked away.

601
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,926
He didn't lie, Ross.

602
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,064
He didn't know.

603
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,653
Have fun in the bag, jerk face.

604
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:40,933
Morcellator, please.

605
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,773
That's gnarly.

606
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,207
Yeah, Bobby would love this.

607
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,126
We could record the live feed.

608
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,206
He could rewatch the carnage.
Share it with his friends.

609
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,931
Nah. He'd be expecting
arms and eyeballs and crap.

610
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,412
Finding out the truth would
break his freaky little heart...

611
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,252
About Santa Claus

612
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,838
and how people get
sick and let you down,

613
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,473
and everything just falls apart.

614
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,343
Till then he can believe
whatever the hell he wants.

615
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:06,213
Yeah, you're right.

616
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:07,392
I mean, I'm a grown-up

617
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,827
and I was still a
little disappointed

618
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,212
we didn't find arms
and eyes in there.

619
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,635
All right, here we go.

620
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,022
Oh, sick.

621
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:19,821
Well, that's a very
interesting offer, sir.

622
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,928
But I wouldn't be
comfortable with...

623
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,464
Really?

624
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,052
That's a... Really?

625
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,852
I was able to do
some rearranging

626
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,554
and get Avery's rhinoplasty
back on the board.

627
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,075
He's on the phone with the
Boston chief of plastic surgery.

628
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,829
Jo was right. You're that girl.

629
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,864
I know.

630
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,277
We're all about
to lose our jobs,

631
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,612
and all I can think
about is the fact

632
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,380
that I'm gonna have to
stop sleeping with him.

633
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,444
I'm so gross.

634
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:47,968
Come on. The sex
can't be that good.

635
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,940
Look at him.

636
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,753
Really? I'm gonna
go talk to him.

637
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,243
Every step you take

638
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,679
is a giant leap
backward for womankind.

639
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,349
There goes the right to vote.

640
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,495
Roe V. Wade.

641
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,218
Cut it out.

642
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,737
Besides, you're just as bad.

643
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,472
You were hung up
on Karev for weeks.

644
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,980
Yeah, but you don't want
to be like me. You hate me.

645
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,460
Thanks.

646
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,612
And I don't hate you.

647
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:13,813
Yeah, you do.

648
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,618
<i>Dr. Chan to the isolation unit.</i>

649
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,886
<i>Dr. Chan to the isolation unit.</i>

650
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,356
What are you doing
here? I have to talk to you.

651
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,713
Oh, now you want to talk?

652
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,043
You're about a week
late. I need to find Cahill.

653
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,566
You have to listen.

654
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:35,068
Owen, is it true, they're
selling the hospital for scrap?

655
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,180
This is the deal you made?

656
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,332
This is the deal you made,

657
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,600
you, Shepherd, and all of you,

658
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,864
when you walked out on
me, when you lied to me!

659
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,687
We're trying to
buy the hospital.

660
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,125
So we've been looking
for an outside investor,

661
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:49,427
trying to get the money
together, but we've hit a wall.

662
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,898
I'm good for $3 million.
No, Richard. We don't want...

663
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,599
No, I just have to move
some things around.

664
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:56,263
It'll be everything
I have, but I am in.

665
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,220
No, we don't need your money.
We need your experience.

666
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,243
We need you.

667
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,891
I mean, we'll take your money,
too, if it comes down to it, but...

668
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,047
How much do you need?

669
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,498
$175 million.

670
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,411
That's pretty good.

671
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,024
It's not really funny, is it?

672
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,128
No.

673
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:24,801
So we only walked out to
stall the sale to Pegasus.

674
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,169
And it's not over.

675
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,437
We have an investor.

676
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,840
We just need you and
Webber to get him on board,

677
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,742
now, before the
Pegasus deal closes.

678
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,887
You couldn't tell me this?

679
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,389
Why couldn't you
just tell me this?

680
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,758
I could've fought for you.
I could've fought with you.

681
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,082
I'm sorry.

682
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,033
I wanted to tell
you. I wanted to.

683
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,552
But they said you
signed nondisclosures,

684
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:45,155
and if anyone found out you
were involved in a competing bid,

685
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,589
they could sue you,

686
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,298
or if they were pissed
enough, jail you.

687
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,044
Please trust me. I...

688
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:52,929
I was trying to protect you.

689
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,097
You don't need to protect me.

690
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:00,932
Wait, wait, wait. Where
are you going? The board.

691
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,568
If they think we can save this
place, it could buy you some time.

692
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:04,757
You can't take that chance.

693
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,143
Cristina, you need
to trust me, too.

694
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,893
Boston then?

695
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:28,515
No. Not Boston.

696
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,419
My mom wouldn't want
to win that way anyway.

697
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:36,239
But it's probably time to start
thinking about someplace else.

698
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:41,261
What about you?
Where are you headed?

699
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,847
I don't know yet.

700
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,348
Well, you never know.

701
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,550
We could end up
somewhere near each other.

702
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,855
That wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world.

703
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,891
Yeah. Sure.

704
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,823
Suction, please.

705
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,706
Hey, buddy.

706
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,374
They got him.

707
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,443
They kicked Phil's
butt straight to the curb.

708
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,490
I wish you coulda
seen the look on his face

709
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,193
when I pulled his eyeballs
right out of his stupid head.

710
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,961
Oh, dude. It was so nasty.

711
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,869
There were brains
and hair everywhere.

712
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,270
Don't forget the intestines.

713
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:25,722
How could I?

714
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,420
They got all tangled up
in my tools like spaghetti.

715
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:31,604
We had to take a break
just to get rid of all the goo.

716
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,730
What else?

717
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,001
Excuse me.

718
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:55,535
Hey.

719
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,870
You okay?

720
00:30:58,707 --> 00:30:59,787
You faking?

721
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,392
Joke's on you.

722
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,105
There aren't gonna be
that many more surgeries

723
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,257
for you to con out of me.

724
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,082
You're gonna be fine.
There are other programs.

725
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:12,502
Not like this one.

726
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,756
Not with a teacher like you...

727
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,141
Who shows me

728
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,710
cool tumor-in-a-bag surgeries

729
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,714
and thinks it's fun to talk to
little kids about guts and stuff.

730
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,346
You know, I, uh...

731
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,470
I barely saw you this week,

732
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,773
and it sucked.

733
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:37,511
I'll find another job. Whatever.

734
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,730
I... But I don't want to
never see you again.

735
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,086
Hey.

736
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,938
- I'm fine. I'm okay.
- I'm good.

737
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,843
Thank god Stephanie
wasn't here to see this.

738
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,099
Section 15,

739
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,018
allocation of equipment,
basically states that

740
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,150
all of Seattle Grace-Mercy
West medical devices,

741
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,214
radiology equipment, etcetera,

742
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:10,577
will be distributed between
Pegasus' existing facilities

743
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,440
at their discretion... Dr. Hunt.

744
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,181
You can't take this deal.

745
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,093
Dr. Hunt, can we step outside?

746
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:17,551
Dr. Hunt, I'm sorry.

747
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:18,985
It isn't what you want.

748
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,738
It isn't what any of us want,
but it is the deal we have.

749
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,225
No, it isn't. I have
another buyer.

750
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,694
I'm sorry. I told you.
He's not available.

751
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,174
Rita, I'm right here.

752
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,597
Hey, guys.

753
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,949
This is the leadership you
asked for, Richard Webber.

754
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,545
Pleasure. Pleasure.

755
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,203
Richard was Seattle Grace's
chief of surgery for 12 years.

756
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:38,800
Um, can we have a
moment to talk to you?

757
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,269
I have to be on a plane in
20. Can you guys ride with me?

758
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,510
That's fine, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

759
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,618
I only have room for two of you.

760
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:58,824
Not fair.

761
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,337
So what do we do now?

762
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,712
We go pick them up.

763
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,145
It is a solid capital investor

764
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:09,919
with a team of surgeon
consultants led by Richard Webber,

765
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,954
Derek Shepherd,
Dr. Torres, Robbins...

766
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,301
A group of
disgruntled employees.

767
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,469
Grey, Yang, and myself.

768
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,776
Well, where are they, then?

769
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,027
They can formally present
their offer to you tomorrow

770
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,230
if you hold off on
this sale to Pegasus.

771
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,509
No, you can't do that.

772
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,677
You can't make Pegasus wait...

773
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,167
You all have a choice here.

774
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,453
You can either be
responsible for consigning

775
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,621
this world-class hospital
to the scrap heap...

776
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,934
There's no choice. Or...

777
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,102
It's not a deal.

778
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:32,670
Or you can partner
with the doctors

779
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:34,222
who made this place what it was

780
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,828
and see what it can be.

781
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:37,542
The Pegasus deal went away once.

782
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:40,233
If it goes away again,
you have nothing,

783
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:42,218
no severance packages,

784
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,920
no paying off creditors.

785
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:45,733
You can't make
payroll next week.

786
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,940
Nothing.

787
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,958
All we need is one day.

788
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,260
One day.

789
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,819
Do you see them?

790
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,305
There.

791
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,548
Do they look happy?

792
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,742
I can't tell.

793
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,938
Sad?

794
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:09,677
I can't tell.

795
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,375
I got them to wait.

796
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,947
The board is gonna
wait for one more day.

797
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,098
You can make your pitch.

798
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:35,322
I did it.

799
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,389
We didn't.

800
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,608
Crest met with
Richard, liked him,

801
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,260
liked all of us,

802
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,545
then he said no.

803
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,430
Said he just wasn't feeling it.

804
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,254
So it's over.

805
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,141
It's over.

806
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,952
Dr. Kepner?

807
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,537
Andy's awake.

808
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,584
He's got some questions, and
I couldn't track down Dr. Hunt.

809
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,808
Okay. I will be right there.

810
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,427
I just needed some air.

811
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:18,998
Can I ask you something?

812
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,562
You want to know how
something like this could happen?

813
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,085
I don't know.

814
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,793
I guess I have to believe

815
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,295
that everything
happens for a reason.

816
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,164
It's all part of some plan,

817
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,617
and you're supposed
to learn something.

818
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:44,591
You lose a patient because
you forget to check their airway,

819
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,254
you don't make
that mistake again.

820
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,510
You fail your boards

821
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,891
'cause you're too busy
sleeping with your best friend,

822
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,480
maybe you stop doing that.

823
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,433
The hospital you
call home shuts down

824
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,280
just when you're
finally starting to feel

825
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:58,704
like you've got
your life together...

826
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,726
Actually, I was gonna ask
for a letter of recommendation.

827
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,831
Oh.

828
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,069
But I could probably
ask someone else.

829
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,505
That might be best.

830
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,693
Go on home, Brooks.
I'll take it from here.

831
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,877
If it's all the same,
Dr. Bailey, I'd prefer to stay.

832
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,420
Suit yourself.

833
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,323
What's wrong with your face?

834
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:40,747
You're right.

835
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:43,083
You are the heart
of the hospital.

836
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,786
I was, Brooks.

837
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:49,906
Was.

838
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,531
We're not buying a house. Hmm.

839
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,899
Well, we're not
buying a hospital.

840
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,105
We could buy a house.

841
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:09,241
Or build one.

842
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,439
We don't even know where
we're gonna be in six months.

843
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:15,531
So we build it in
Chicago or Miami

844
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,583
or New York.

845
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,018
We have each other,

846
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,704
and we have a
beautiful baby so...

847
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,873
We can go wherever we want.

848
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,896
Probably want to sell
Mark's place, right?

849
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,200
Probably.

850
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,974
We don't have to
move yet, do we?

851
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,993
No.

852
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,528
Not yet.

853
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,403
Vermouth?

854
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:56,106
That'll have to do.

855
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,858
Oh, and now you're
stealing my freakin' booze.

856
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:00,204
It's just vermouth. Shut up.

857
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:02,173
You don't get to
make stupid little jokes.

858
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,975
We had a good
thing going, all of us.

859
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,693
And now people
are losing their jobs,

860
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,983
and it's your fault.

861
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:09,097
We were trying to
buy the stupid hospital.

862
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,536
We were trying to help,

863
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,089
and we screwed up.

864
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,191
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,248
Oh, well...

866
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,739
40-year-old Scotch.
A patient gave it to me.

867
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,240
Now you're gonna sit down

868
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,225
and you're gonna
freakin' talk to me.

869
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,796
Oh, Derek, it's over.
Enough. You have to stop.

870
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,688
Yeah, I know. Ross asked me to
write a letter of recommendation.

871
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,324
And I'm gonna do them
for each of the interns.

872
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:53,646
Did you do one
for Heather Brooks?

873
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,193
Who? Mousy.

874
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:56,849
Oh, no. Not yet.

875
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,984
I will.

876
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,859
They were trying to buy
the hospital themselves.

877
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,368
They... They just
needed more money.

878
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:13,266
They couldn't get it in time.

879
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:15,501
Well, what are you gonna do now?

880
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:19,572
Well, I heard
Boston's awfully nice.

881
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:22,525
That thought has crossed
my mind a time or two.

882
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,127
I just didn't want to be pushy.

883
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,997
That hardly sounds like you.

884
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,038
I poured so much of my
life into Seattle Grace.

885
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,020
Always seemed like
a foregone conclusion

886
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,444
that I'd end my career
there, and I just...

887
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,335
I'm not ready to retire yet.

888
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,557
I never thought it would
be gone before I was.

889
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,694
How much money did they need?

890
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,023
What are you guys... Oh.

891
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,663
Folks!

892
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:18,814
You're right on time.

893
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,837
Come on.

894
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,862
Mom, come on. What is happening?

895
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,575
Have a seat. I'm
about to tell you.

896
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,801
<i>There's a reason surgeons
are willing to roll the dice</i>

897
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,920
<i>on a risky, go-for-broke,</i>

898
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,155
<i>point-of-no-return surgery</i>

899
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:46,042
<i>with potentially
devastating consequences.</i>

900
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,493
Ladies and gentlemen,

901
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:50,062
Dr. Webber's brought
to my attention the fact

902
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,466
that all of you have been
looking for an investor

903
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,434
to partner with
you in purchasing

904
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,104
Seattle Grace-Mercy
West Hospital.

905
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:01,891
It is my pleasure to tell you

906
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,261
that the Harper Avery
Foundation would like very much

907
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,979
to take you up on that offer.

908
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,692
What?

909
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,151
We have only one
condition. Only one.

910
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,332
Since the foundation will be
putting up the majority of the funds,

911
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:19,258
we would like a
representative of our choosing

912
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,844
to sit on your
board of directors.

913
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,891
Well, yeah...

914
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:27,249
My dears, we only have a
couple of hours to make this bid.

915
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,829
Do you want to
do this thing or not?

916
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,414
Yes. Of course. Okay, yes.

917
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:31,570
<i>Sometimes...</i>

918
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,749
Yeah. Yes.

919
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:33,839
<i>It works.</i>

920
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,511
Wow.

921
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,835
Wait, you woke up
me at the crack of dawn

922
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:48,182
to tell me you're coming to Seattle
to be my boss? That doesn't...

923
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,290
Oh, no, no, sweetheart.
You misunderstood.

924
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,626
The foundation is electing
you as our representative.

925
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:54,972
We're the majority shareholder.

926
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:57,980
That means you are in charge.

927
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,660
Wait. What?

928
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,834
Now give your
mama a kiss, Jackson.

929
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,969
She just bought you a hospital.

930
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:06,307
Hmm.
