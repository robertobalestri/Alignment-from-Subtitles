1
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:08,101
Now Mr. Linzer hates the food,

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,003
so he will tell
you he feels fine.

3
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,271
He does not feel fine.
And if you release him

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,596
before his I.N.R. stabilizes,
he will bleed to death.

5
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,598
Murphy's gonna
keep an eye on him.

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,951
I am gonna keep an eye on him.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,432
Mrs. Gellman's still intubated,

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,134
but I want the tube
out by Monday.

9
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,242
Have the nurses page you as
soon as she starts breathing on her...

10
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:28,355
I will ask them myself.

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,706
Oh, it's not too much for you?

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,074
Not at all. And
yet, you're trying to

13
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,582
fob it off to Petunia here,
with her years and years

14
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:35,178
of experience in critical care.

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,646
I want you to relax
on your honeymoon.

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,981
I thought that
you'd be reassured

17
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,732
by having two sets of
eyes on your patients.

18
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:43,391
The notion of an intern handling
my patients is the best way

19
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,172
I can think of to ruin a
perfectly good Mai Tai.

20
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,513
Oh, are you going
someplace warm?

21
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,609
We don't have to talk about it.

22
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,166
Oh, no. I want to talk

23
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,986
to you about my honeymoon...
The hotel, the sights...

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,498
I'm gonna handle
Mrs. Gellman myself.

25
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,534
What I'm wearing on the plane,
what I'm wearing on the beach.

26
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,219
Leah, leave. And the wedding...

27
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:01,321
Should I get my nails done
today or tomorrow on my way

28
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,089
to the ceremony?
Okay, she's gone.

29
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,513
I got this.

30
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,609
<i>The adrenal system
reacts to stress</i>

31
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,302
<i>by releasing hormones that
make us alert and reactive.</i>

32
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,051
<i>The problem is, the
adrenal system can't tell</i>

33
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,035
<i>what's a regular case of nerves</i>

34
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>and what's a real
impending disaster.</i>

35
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:18,760
Yo, Lefkowitz.

36
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,678
Did you bring it?

37
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,330
That's the whole thing? Yep.

38
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,450
Lefkowitz has gastroparesis
so he can't digest his food.

39
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,013
He was an epic
puker for a long time,

40
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,748
and now he can't
really eat at all.

41
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:32,173
So we're gonna give you
a gastric neurostimulator.

42
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,205
This thing, it's gonna
zap your stomach

43
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,324
so it remembers to push
the food down your system.

44
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,376
Get you back on
burgers and fries.

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,961
That's amazing.
Yeah, well, the guys

46
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,163
at the airport X-ray
are gonna go nuts.

47
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,537
That's sick.

48
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,207
Oh, uh, this is Dr. Wilson.
She's gonna be operating with me.

49
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,243
You've got a crack
team, iron man.

50
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,048
Hey.

51
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,353
Don't.

52
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,618
All right, all right. All
right. I'll stop. I'll stop.

53
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,642
Jeez.

54
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,926
When you and Arizona

55
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,806
get to the wedding
tomorrow... Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,013
Don't sit down.

57
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,324
What do you mean,
don't sit down?

58
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,451
Just find a place
and stand there.

59
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,863
You want us to
stand in the back?

60
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,182
Then we won't be
able to hear anything.

61
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,156
Stand in the damn front.

62
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,786
And block everybody's view?

63
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,287
I mean, if we're... I don't...

64
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,312
Just pick a spot. You know,
it's not complicated. Ugh!

65
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,548
You know, people allow you
to open them up with a knife.

66
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,278
If they knew you couldn't
follow a simple instruction,

67
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,569
they would run like
the wind from this place.

68
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,533
Are you... Are
you trying to say,

69
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,476
"Would you do me the honor
of being my bridesmaids?"

70
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,478
Does the whole thing
have to be about you?

71
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:45,947
Just put on a dress
and don't sit down.

72
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,749
Aww. We're bridesmaids.

73
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,818
Oh, don't even...

74
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,551
See? Ugh.

75
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,914
This is what I
was trying to avoid.

76
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,671
Ohh.

77
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,751
Now once I remove the
sural nerve from your leg,

78
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,044
Dr. Torres will graft it on to
Dr. Shepherd's median nerve.

79
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,280
You'll likely experience some
discomfort in your leg for a few weeks...

80
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,861
Months. Months. And
when he says "discomfort,"

81
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,146
it's gonna hurt like hell.

82
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,614
Well, you're a bag of
sunshine, aren't you?

83
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,332
I don't want to hear
six months from now

84
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,352
that you can't move and that
the ibuprofen hurts your stomach.

85
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,086
He makes me sound
like I'm a 90-year-old man.

86
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,789
Have you noticed that?
Because I've heard for decades

87
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,557
how I ruined your
life... Because you did.

88
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:19,409
And that Mom doesn't love
you. Because she doesn't.

89
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,044
I don't want to hear about
this. I think what you're trying

90
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,317
to say is "Thank you, Lizzie,

91
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,947
"for cutting off a leg
and giving it to me."

92
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,165
Ah. Here it is. This is how
it's gonna go down in history.

93
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,267
It is a nerve. It is
not the entire leg.

94
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,941
Okay. Let's focus. Jackson.

95
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:32,160
Um, I think
Dr. Shepherd's right.

96
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,440
If you're unsure,
we... Oh, come on.

97
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,914
I'm just winding him
up because it is so easy.

98
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,177
Just give me the form. Okay.

99
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,573
Now can I go hang out
with Zola in day care?

100
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,854
Oh, I'm sorry. They don't
let the adults come and go

101
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,598
because it's harder on the kids.

102
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,756
I will bring her to you later.

103
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,824
Grey.

104
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,126
Uh, when you get to
the wedding tomorrow,

105
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,211
don't sit down.

106
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,365
Call for a portable echo.

107
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,112
The lawyer put
together the papers.

108
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,930
They're gonna send
them over tomorrow.

109
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,532
Oh, I signed a bunch of
stuff with them last week.

110
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,505
Uh, not the plane
crash. The divorce.

111
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,207
Oh.

112
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,233
That was fast.

113
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,645
I said we wanted
to move quickly.

114
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:25,547
Apparently. It's all done.

115
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:26,631
You just have to sign.

116
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,129
Is that a problem? Nope.

117
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,953
Tomorrow, with a pen.

118
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,344
<i>Okay.</i>

119
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,312
Everything off
from the waist down.

120
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,597
Nice paper tablecloth
for you. I'll be right back.

121
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,569
You know, um... I
was thinking about

122
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,938
telling Lizzie if
you're okay with that.

123
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,752
Um, I think it's
still kind of early.

124
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,237
Yeah, but she's
doing this thing for me.

125
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,905
She'll tell your
whole entire family.

126
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,929
Well, you told Cristina.

127
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,714
I haven't.

128
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,377
Still? There's no point.

129
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,179
I'm probably gonna
miscarry anyway.

130
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,247
Meredith... I am
just stating the facts.

131
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,199
I have a very unstable uterus.

132
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,701
This baby has an uphill climb.

133
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,019
I am just being realistic.

134
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,844
Ready to take a look? Yeah.

135
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,619
Okay, scoot down.

136
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,966
Now there's still
a lot we can do

137
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,308
to support the pregnancy,
right, even with our history?

138
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,271
Of course. You've
got some risk factors.

139
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,922
But we're gonna
watch you like a hawk.

140
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,112
Okay.

141
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,176
There we go. Hi, baby.

142
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,403
Good news. Arizona and
I both have red dresses.

143
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,183
Now they're not the
same, but they are similar.

144
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,807
So it's not like matchy-matchy,
but it'll be super cute.

145
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,844
Now which part of my
face says I want super cute?

146
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,246
Ohh. Get over it
already. It's a wedding.

147
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,159
No one cares that it's
your second other than you.

148
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,333
Just hold your nose. It'll
be over in a few hours.

149
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,481
Sure. And then we'll be
married. And, oh, him in L.A.,

150
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:30,972
me here with my son
and a job that's known to

151
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,357
take up a great deal of time.

152
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,858
Oh, and he's an intern,

153
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,144
because one specialty
wasn't enough for him.

154
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,679
Let's get to that part.

155
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,131
You know, everyone's acting
like I'm some jittery bride.

156
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,067
Maybe I have
something to jitter about.

157
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,402
Well...

158
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,249
If it's the marriage you're
really worried about...

159
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,607
You can run.

160
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,876
Excuse me? Leave
him at the altar.

161
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,488
It's a clean break.
He's so pissed that you

162
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,989
stood him up in
front of all his people,

163
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,074
the whole thing is just over.

164
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,709
And then you're not wrestling

165
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,594
with a relationship
that's doomed

166
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,596
or tied to someone
for the rest of your life.

167
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,964
I mean, sure, you
love each other now.

168
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,515
But the next thing you know,

169
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,074
you are cleaning
his pee off the ground

170
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,054
and going to bed
with a foot-wide

171
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,806
demilitarized zone down
the middle of the bed.

172
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,465
Kidding.

173
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,411
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

174
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,247
No, it'll be fine.

175
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,698
It'll be fine.
Yeah, Ben's the...

176
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,372
The best. He's... He...

177
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,688
We have to do an open
procedure 'cause he's got adhesions

178
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,490
from a surgery a
couple years ago.

179
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,926
Once he's open, you can
take down the adhesions.

180
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,650
Really?

181
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:32,778
Yeah. I've never done

182
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:33,880
anything like that before.

183
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,247
Yeah, well, if it was me,

184
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,631
I'd spend the next few
hours in the skills lab.

185
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,704
Dr. Karev. Is this
because I told you about

186
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,211
when I was a kid?

187
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,257
Oh, yeah. I feel so bad you
were a dumpster-diving orphan,

188
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,981
I'm letting you hack
up a 10-year-old.

189
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,160
Sorry. Stupid.

190
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,635
Ya think?

191
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,072
Flowers, music... It's
a recipe for disaster.

192
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,309
April, you're going to be
fine. Don't worry about it.

193
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,789
Oh, come on. Don't tell
her she's gonna be fine.

194
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,157
You're gonna be
looking all pretty,

195
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,476
little bit of lip gloss on
your prude-y little mouth.

196
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,545
Jackson will spot
her across the room.

197
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,930
Try to look away, but he can't.

198
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,547
You're irresistible
in your dress.

199
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,283
One drink, and you're
doing the hippity-dippity

200
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,450
in the coat room.

201
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:13,491
The dress? Oh, God.

202
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,138
See? Cruel.

203
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,200
What?

204
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,585
Nothing.

205
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,990
So he's into you now?

206
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,475
Karev? No.

207
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,860
Uh-huh. Then why's he letting
you take down adhesions?

208
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,874
Have you ever removed adhesions?

209
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,247
No. None of us have.

210
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,793
Hey, Wilson.

211
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,857
Uh, where are Sujin
Kim's post-op notes?

212
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,020
I didn't finish it. I
wanted to practice for this

213
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,689
gastric neurostimulator
surgery I'm doing with Dr. Karev.

214
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,319
She's taking down the adhesions.

215
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,659
Really? Oh. Good for you.

216
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,772
He must really trust you.

217
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,612
Mmm.

218
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,726
Hmm. Um... I hope
you're not using

219
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,544
blunt dissection,
'cause that'll tear it.

220
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,688
You want nice, precise
moves with the instruments.

221
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,468
Okay. You sure
you're ready for this?

222
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,208
Yeah. You want me
to get you that chart?

223
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,211
No. It can wait.
You should practice.

224
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,964
See? She shouldn't even
be doing a move like this.

225
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,209
He's into her.

226
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,145
The last thing you want at your
wedding is to wonder if Mr. Linzer

227
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,964
is circling the drain
just because nobody

228
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,527
was monitoring his I.N.R.

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,084
So I'll just stick
around here tomorrow

230
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,585
and keep an eye on him.

231
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,587
Kepner, you broke up with Avery.

232
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,023
I... Yes.

233
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,291
Yes. I don't know
what that has to...

234
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,288
You're afraid that the sight

235
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,846
of me in cream colored raw silk

236
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,035
will bring tears to your eyes.

237
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,768
I am sure that you
will be beautiful...

238
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,138
I look at my father, he
kisses me on the cheek,

239
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,957
I turn away from him,

240
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,169
- take a breath.
- Dr. Webber.

241
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,538
I step towards
Ben... Is that for me?

242
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,206
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

243
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,309
And you and Jackson lock
eyes from across the room.

244
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,368
You melt into him
like snow in the rain.

245
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,957
I knew you would understand.

246
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,438
Suck it up, Kepner. If I
have to go, you have to go.

247
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,615
Okay.

248
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,667
"If I have to go,
you have to go"?

249
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,063
Oh, drop it. Oh, no.

250
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,527
That's the most beautiful
sentiment I've ever heard.

251
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:29,755
Lizzie's calves
are a little shorter

252
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,246
than we anticipated.

253
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:32,442
Tall girl, short calves.

254
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,898
So is that gonna be a problem?

255
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,368
No, not if we just get a little
more nerve from the other leg.

256
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,681
Are you saying to... - No.

257
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,483
Derek. Absolutely not.

258
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,684
No, I never liked this
idea in the first place.

259
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,018
We find another
donor or we don't do it.

260
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,553
Well, we couldn't
find another donor.

261
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,138
That's why we... Well,
then we're out of luck.

262
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,991
Can't we just... No,
we can't. We're not

263
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,592
gonna talk about this. We're
not gonna float this past Lizzie.

264
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,560
We're not cutting both
her legs to remove pieces.

265
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,634
Cancel the procedure.

266
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,739
I think you should bring a
date to Dr. Bailey's wedding.

267
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,507
That way we will
focus on our dates

268
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,065
and not on each other.

269
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,212
Or we could just be
focused on the happy couple.

270
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,412
Thank you.

271
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,198
I am wearing a strapless dress.

272
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:14,756
From here up, I'm
completely naked.

273
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,242
Just... Wear a different dress.

274
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,346
I don't have a different
dress. I work long hours.

275
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,264
I don't shop. I have
one dressy dress.

276
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,778
How am I supposed to find
a date with one day's notice?

277
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,614
Stephanie.

278
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,083
Hey. Um, would you like to
go to Dr. Bailey's wedding?

279
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,390
Oh, what?

280
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,953
Dr. Avery would love
for you to go with him.

281
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,037
That's not true.

282
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,088
He thinks that you'd
be embarrassed,

283
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,306
but you're not
embarrassed, are you?

284
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,607
Of course she's
embarrassed. She'll get over it.

285
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,515
Look, don't get
other... Strapless...

286
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,083
And tight.

287
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:48,200
I will pick you up
at 1:00 tomorrow

288
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,401
in the locker room.

289
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,194
What just happened?

290
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,462
What about you?

291
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,675
You got to pick mine, so
I get to pick yours, right?

292
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:57,699
Jackson.

293
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,568
Oh. What about Shane?

294
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,837
He's a good-looking
piece of man, huh?

295
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,219
- They're that short?
- No, they're

296
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:07,686
perfectly respectable calves.

297
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,657
It's just that we're not
gonna get quite enough nerve

298
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:13,831
from just the one. Okay.

299
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,110
I know it's a lot to ask.

300
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,635
No, it's, uh, fine. Do
what you need to do.

301
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,398
Derek thinks it's
too much to ask,

302
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,967
but he really needs this, so
if he comes to you and tries

303
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,076
to talk you out of
it, you have to push.

304
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,390
But don't tell him that I'm
the one that came to you,

305
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,654
because he won't like that.

306
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,784
You've got some
balls, don't you?

307
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,814
You know, if it's too much,
we can call the whole thing off.

308
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,206
You know we're family, right?

309
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,224
There was no wedding, Meredith.

310
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,127
You adopted a baby
and you never invited us

311
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,979
to come meet her.
You never accepted

312
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,914
our invitation to come see us.

313
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:50,051
All we got was a couple
of pictures via e-mail.

314
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,763
You know, my kids were
so excited that for months,

315
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,132
they walked around telling every
African-American person they saw

316
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,796
that we have a brown
baby in the family?

317
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,070
A year later, they kind of think

318
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,421
I made the whole
thing up. I'm sorry.

319
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,090
It's just, you know,
with everything

320
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,841
that's been going on...
No, I get that we're all busy,

321
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,900
but you're not shy about asking
me for a couple of body parts,

322
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,080
and now you want me to
cover your tracks with Derek?

323
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,499
If you feel like it's
inappropriate, we...

324
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,239
No, it's what sisters
ask sisters to do.

325
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,641
We cover each other's
asses. Look, if you want to be

326
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,826
a sister, I am delighted,

327
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,095
but then act like one.

328
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,550
My version of family
isn't like your version.

329
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:25,364
You guys give each other
crap and then you laugh about it.

330
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,232
You'd walk through
fire for each other.

331
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,724
Greys are not like that.

332
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,859
Derek said you had a
sister who worked here.

333
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,791
Half. She was on the plane?

334
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,392
You know, I really don't

335
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,895
want to talk about my sister.
My husband really needs this,

336
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,830
so you don't have
to like me, just him.

337
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:44,472
You have a child.
She's part of my family.

338
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,907
You of all people
should realize,

339
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,243
you need spares in
a family. You need

340
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,312
as many as you can get.

341
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,820
It was very nice to
talk to you, Lizzie.

342
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,147
Hey.

343
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,183
I stashed a little Johnnie
in case the ceremony's got

344
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,073
some cousin reading a poem.

345
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,870
Right. Uh, I meant to find you.

346
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,772
I'm kind of bringing a date.

347
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,207
Yeah, me. Two guys picking up

348
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,848
bridesmaids from out of town.

349
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,327
April's convinced that if
we don't both bring dates,

350
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,561
then we're both gonna end up...

351
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,896
Why you gotta talk to her?

352
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,336
She ruins everything.

353
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,704
How about I find
someone for you to go with?

354
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,293
You know, maybe
Stephanie has a friend.

355
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,270
Stephanie? That's
who you're taking?

356
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,321
You want a date or not?

357
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,025
No. All right.

358
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,230
Okay. Whatever. Just
don't get me an ugly one.

359
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,276
We're not doing the procedure.

360
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,289
Of course we're doing it.

361
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,124
You know what happened
when I said I'd do this?

362
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,510
Mom called me
three times in one day.

363
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,062
It just brings tears to my eyes.

364
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,313
She's a mess. Come on.

365
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,153
You're the golden child.

366
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,166
The rest of us are just
scrapping for second position,

367
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,168
and I just put a lock on it for
life. You think I'm giving that up

368
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,520
just 'cause you have to cut
into two legs instead of one?

369
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,322
Lizzie... No, we're
not discussing it.

370
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:57,823
I've decided. Get back
on the horse, Derek.

371
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,391
Oh, okay. So you think
I'm using this as an excuse,

372
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,993
that I'm too scared to
try and operate again?

373
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,298
No, of course not.
Nothing scares you.

374
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,070
Mmm.

375
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,239
What if it doesn't work?

376
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,969
Hmm? What if we
go through all of this

377
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,653
and nothing comes
of it? Well, then

378
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,078
at least we tried.

379
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,347
We're doing it.
Just... Say thank you.

380
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,221
You ready? Yep.

381
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,972
Bovie, please.

382
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,640
Thank you.

383
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,075
Okay, here? Yep.

384
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,344
Take your time. Okay.

385
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:32,747
Watch out for the blood vessels.

386
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,309
Wow. Look at you, all grown-up.

387
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,345
Up in the skills
lab, I was doing...

388
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,514
You put a hole in his stomach.

389
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,638
I haven't even...
Move, now. Move.

390
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,767
- All right. Clamp.
- Here you go.

391
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,968
2.0 Vicryl. WOMAN: I'll get it.

392
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,375
Suction.

393
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,791
Hey, Steph. You okay there?

394
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,975
Fine. Terrific.

395
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,176
I wanted to ask you...

396
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,360
I was gonna go to
the wedding with,

397
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:55,714
you know, a friend...
A guy, like, stag.

398
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,771
Yeah? And now he feels like

399
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,623
I'm bailing on him.

400
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,836
You don't have to go with me.

401
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,877
No, no. You don't want to go?

402
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,440
You have a date with a guy.

403
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,342
I ditched him, and I want
you to find somebody for him.

404
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,510
Is that weird?

405
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,712
Nothing about this is weird.

406
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,796
Terrific. Mm-hmm.

407
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,419
Mmm.

408
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,283
There's still some spillage.

409
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,534
Give me some lap pads...

410
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,469
And some 2.0 silk.

411
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:18,671
Get over here and
grab the retractor

412
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,406
so we can put
the device back in.

413
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,124
Wilson. I can't get
my hands to stay still.

414
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,059
Well, shake it off
and get over here.

415
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,745
The kid's gonna be fine,
just grab the damn retractor.

416
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,575
Get out.

417
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,138
Go!

418
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,600
You think Bailey will
notice if I'm not there?

419
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,625
She just made you a bridesmaid.

420
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,304
Oh, she doesn't
care about all of that.

421
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,706
She just wants a bunch
of people standing up there

422
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,995
so it won't look weird

423
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,225
when Ben has all his
guys standing up there.

424
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,609
And I have a
packed day tomorrow.

425
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,061
Yeah, 'cause you're
going to a wedding.

426
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,063
You're supposed to wear heels...

427
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,198
To a fancy occasion.

428
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,270
Oh, come on.

429
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,873
No, they make you
feel tall and confident

430
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,669
and feminine and...
And my plastic foot isn't

431
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,262
the right shape for... Heels.

432
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,275
I didn't get that
kind. Well, I mean...

433
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,199
It's not nothing.

434
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,978
I mean, why do you think women
all over the world wear them?

435
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,986
Because women all
over the world are stupid.

436
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,383
Oh, okay. So you're
gonna wear flats?

437
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,239
Oh, I'd be happy to wear flats.

438
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,535
Oh, no, you wouldn't because
then you would feel dumpy.

439
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,761
Oh-ho. Did you
just call me dumpy?

440
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,274
Can you just for one second
admit that you know what it is

441
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,538
I'm talking about?

442
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,301
Okay, I know it's hard.

443
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,104
It's hard all the time, and
this is just one more reminder.

444
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,743
But you are so, so beautiful.

445
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,690
Yeah, people stand next
to you and immediately

446
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,947
feel bad about themselves.
It's a public service

447
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,200
that you're a couple
of inches shorter.

448
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,402
It is a kindness to
every other woman

449
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,004
at that wedding
that you are just

450
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,873
one tiny bit less beautiful.

451
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,708
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

452
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,807
Are you still mad at me
because I called Lizzie?

453
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,292
Do you still love me?

454
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,561
Medium.

455
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,541
I just want your
hand to be better

456
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,805
so that we can put this stupid
plane crash stuff behind us.

457
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,153
Well, the lawyer called
to schedule a deposition.

458
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,754
He thinks we have a strong case,

459
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,458
especially now that Cristina
and Owen are getting divorced.

460
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,039
What does that have
to do with anything?

461
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,897
Well, it'd be a big
conflict of interest

462
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,083
if Owen was married
to one of the plaintiffs.

463
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:58,752
That's why they got divorced,
right? She didn't tell you?

464
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,722
No. Why would
she not tell me that?

465
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,740
You didn't tell her
you were pregnant.

466
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,777
Maybe things are different now.

467
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,400
On the morning of your wedding?

468
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,458
Oh, my house is
filled with my family

469
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,161
talking about makeup and hair.

470
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,990
- Just check into a hotel.
- Dr. Bailey.

471
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:28,616
Take a nice long
bath, get a manicure.

472
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,645
Oh, now I got you talking
about makeup and hair?

473
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,414
Dr. Bailey, what
are you doing here?

474
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,832
Checking up on my patients.

475
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,317
Making sure you
haven't bungled anything.

476
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,719
Don't mention her hair.
Why? Did something

477
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,969
happen to your hair?

478
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:38,993
Oh.

479
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:47,668
He probably knew it was risky,
so he wanted it on me and not him.

480
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,548
You have to stop. You're
making yourself crazy.

481
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,206
I'm gonna get
fired. No, you're not.

482
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,685
Just keep your head
down and do your work.

483
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,526
You're right.

484
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,743
You're right.

485
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,197
Now I have to ask you something,

486
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,177
and in light of the fact that
you think your job is on the line,

487
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,701
it's gonna sound really stupid.

488
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,847
Whatever. It's okay.

489
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,689
Dr. Avery asked me
to Dr. Bailey's wedding.

490
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,792
And I can't put two words
together into a sentence

491
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:14,089
when I'm within two feet of
him, and he's bringing a friend,

492
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,497
and he asked me
to bring a friend,

493
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:20,484
and it'll be like a bunch of
us, and we'll all go together.

494
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,593
You're right. It
sounds really stupid.

495
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,840
But will you do it?

496
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,991
Please, Jo.

497
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,170
Somebody page cardio? Yeah,

498
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,238
G.S.W. to the chest.

499
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,208
He put up two-and-a-half
liters of blood

500
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,010
when we put in the chest tube.

501
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,496
We should move him upstairs.

502
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,898
There is a bullet
in the abdomen.

503
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,001
I can do it, or we can
call for somebody else.

504
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,802
You can do it. Amicable, right?

505
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,076
Mm-hmm. Let's move.

506
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,329
You're still rechecking
Kepner's work?

507
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,331
What I was born to do.

508
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:54,668
I have a chole in
about ten minutes.

509
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,337
In and out, the whole
thing should take an hour.

510
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:00,558
You want to scrub in?

511
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,810
Take the edge off before
you go home and get dressed?

512
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:10,000
You... Are a good man.

513
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,063
Dr. Webber. Oh,
the man of the hour.

514
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,316
Oh, tell me you're not here
to take me back to that house.

515
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,673
No, I'm not.

516
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,493
Okay, well, he, um, just asked
me to do a chole with him...

517
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:21,540
And it's the only thing
that's calmed me down

518
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,215
on a day full of people trying
and failing to calm me down.

519
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,643
Why do you think he asked you?

520
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,770
You called him?

521
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,338
Oh.

522
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,622
Thank you.

523
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,053
Both of you.

524
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,555
So can I have a car
pick you up at the house?

525
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,490
How many times do I
have to say no to that?

526
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,258
A person shouldn't drive
themselves to their own wedding.

527
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:41,943
Well, I like to drive.
In a wedding gown?

528
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,319
It's my last ten minutes
as a single woman.

529
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,454
You know, you both
were on a roll there.

530
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:48,767
Why are you trying
to screw it up now?

531
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,924
I'll see you in the O.R.

532
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,294
And I will see you at the altar.

533
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,096
Dr. Robbins.

534
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,259
Yeah. Hi.

535
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,572
Dr. Karev had me take down

536
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,941
the adhesions. Yeah.
Yeah, how'd that go?

537
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,932
Some of the adhesions
were stuck to the stomach.

538
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,836
The stomach was injured.
He could be septic by now.

539
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,473
I don't think he
had any business

540
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,786
having an intern
do that kind of move.

541
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,489
You were pretty shocked
to hear that I was doing it.

542
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,058
He threw me in the deep
end, probably because...

543
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,216
Okay, hang on.

544
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,285
What exactly are you
saying about your attending?

545
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:41,008
G.S.W.

546
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,744
Sweet. Scrubbing in with Owen,

547
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:46,780
who wants to sign our
divorce papers today.

548
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,466
I guess we're being
mature and moving on.

549
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,169
Speaking of which,
why didn't you tell me

550
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,718
that the divorce was because
of the plane crash lawsuit?

551
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,653
What? Derek told me,

552
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,922
so that the case is stronger.
Which is great, I'm glad,

553
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,257
especially if it means the two
of you are getting back together.

554
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,592
It's good news, and I don't
know why you wouldn't want

555
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,016
to share that with me?

556
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,684
Because I didn't know.

557
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,488
You ready?

558
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:13,857
What?

559
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,883
Dr. Shepherd's prepped? Yep.

560
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,085
Uh, Dr. Torres is
going over the studies.

561
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,549
Okay. Yeah.

562
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,045
Hold it together.

563
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,648
Well, a nerve extraction's
a pretty simple procedure.

564
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:40,383
Not that. He asked me on a date,

565
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,236
to Dr. Bailey's wedding.

566
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,571
Dr. Kepner asked me.

567
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,800
It's a date? It's not,
like, a mentoring thing?

568
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,376
How is drinking champagne
and dancing to Barry White

569
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:50,795
a mentoring thing?

570
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,797
I thought it was,
like, spending time

571
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,194
getting to know the interns in a
casual, stress-free environment.

572
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,345
That was the free-doughnuts
thing in the lounge.

573
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,713
This is a wedding.

574
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,305
I can't go on a
date with my boss.

575
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,484
I need to focus on my work,

576
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,258
not get all wrapped
up in the ladies.

577
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:05,971
Did you really just
say "the ladies"?

578
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,672
You're the one who just said you
couldn't concentrate in the O.R.

579
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,975
'cause Dr. Avery might look at
you with his limpid green eyes.

580
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,460
The eyes are really intense.

581
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,211
You've noticed
it yourself, right?

582
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,075
Get a grip. You get a grip.

583
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,487
Karev, did you tell Wilson
that she'd be fired for

584
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,117
screwing up a gastric implant?

585
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,803
What? Is the patient
gonna make it?

586
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,027
The patient's fine. What
the hell did she tell you?

587
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,990
She thinks that you
set her up to take the fall

588
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:27,225
on a risky O.R. procedure,
and it kind of sounds like you did.

589
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,166
It would've been risky
no matter who did it.

590
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,378
And I was standing right there.

591
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,813
The second it got
hairy, I took over.

592
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,387
She was in over her head.

593
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,433
And where do you think I got
the idea to do something like that?

594
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,169
What are you talking about? You.

595
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,009
I'm trying to be like
you were with me.

596
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,244
You let me try crap so I
got confidence in myself.

597
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,590
That's what I
was trying to do...

598
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,626
Not treat the stupid morons
like the stupid morons

599
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,650
that I think they are.

600
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,551
I gave you opportunities.

601
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:50,670
I also gave you a boatload of
encouragement and support.

602
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,500
I didn't drop-kick you into
the deep end of the pool...

603
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,658
And yell, "Swim, idiot."

604
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,126
You're a teacher now.

605
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,612
Your students
fail, you've failed.

606
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,590
Oh!

607
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,636
Glad you're driving
yourself to the wedding.

608
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,972
Remind me to stay off the roads.

609
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:16,663
Were you like this?

610
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:23,370
On my wedding day, I
remember staring at my socks

611
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,718
for a long time. I had no
idea what to do with 'em.

612
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,929
You know, ten years from
now, if the marriage is strong,

613
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:35,599
I'll look back at
today and say...

614
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,102
"It was just a little
bit of cold feet."

615
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,006
If we're in a nasty
divorce, I'll say,

616
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,208
"I knew it was a mistake
the day we got married."

617
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,358
You think it's a mistake?

618
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,382
I just feel...

619
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,502
Worried. I never felt
that way with Tucker.

620
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,008
You were a child when
you married Tucker.

621
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,910
You're an adult now.

622
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,063
You know the world's
an ambiguous place.

623
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,966
You know that love
doesn't conquer all.

624
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,535
It conquers some stuff.
The other stuff kicks

625
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,720
the living crap out of love.

626
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:15,823
And this is the pep talk?

627
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,995
Overwhelming doubt is a problem.

628
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:25,932
A little bit of doubt is just a
sign of an intelligent adult.

629
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,971
Is Grey gonna be in the gallery?

630
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,201
No. She didn't want
to make you nervous.

631
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,171
I told her you
don't get nervous.

632
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,044
You're right. I don't.

633
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,531
Close your eyes. Enjoy your nap.

634
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,240
You've got nothing
to worry about. Mmm.

635
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,422
Torres. Hmm?

636
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,682
You've got nothing
to worry about.

637
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,740
We good to go?

638
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:07,969
Yes, we are.

639
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,375
Yes. We're... Yes.

640
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:10,788
<i>Jackson, I just
want to let you know,</i>

641
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:12,140
<i>I'll be here watching
the whole time.</i>

642
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,357
Couldn't be happier.

643
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,941
<i>No mistakes.</i> That's the plan.

644
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,449
Okay.

645
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,070
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

646
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,072
Get that woman
out of my gallery.

647
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:23,734
That's not a good
idea. Get her out.

648
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,159
<i>I heard that, Avery. Edwards,
don't even think about it.</i>

649
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,846
Now.

650
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,732
<i>Edwards, you wouldn't dare.</i>

651
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:35,068
<i>You have years with me. I
can be very difficult to deal with.</i>

652
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:36,770
15-blade, please.

653
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,266
<i>You narced on me to my boss?</i>

654
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,057
I worked hard to get here.
I'm not gonna let myself

655
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,126
get fired because...

656
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,304
Nobody's firing you.

657
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,639
I was trying to help you.

658
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,680
I clearly wasn't ready for it.

659
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,660
Why, because I had to take over?

660
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,562
Look, you can't go
crying to my damn boss

661
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,963
every time you get scared.

662
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,498
You can't cry at all
when you get scared

663
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:54,933
because it's scary
in there all the time.

664
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:57,741
I just thought, maybe
after I blew the appy,

665
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,043
I'd be a good target if you
needed to pin something

666
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,961
on someone. It's
paranoid. I get that.

667
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,230
I don't always trust people
who are trying to help me.

668
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,644
Yeah, yeah, you're a beaten dog

669
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,245
and you bite people
who try to feed you.

670
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,530
I don't give a crap
about your sad story.

671
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,434
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to get the hell over it.

672
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,369
You burned a bridge with
me. How about you grow up

673
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,171
before you burn a bridge
with every other attending

674
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,355
who tries to teach
you something?

675
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,417
50 centimeters of prime nerve.

676
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:25,652
Great.

677
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,156
All right.

678
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,007
Forceps, please. Thank you.

679
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,860
Okay.

680
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:35,195
Is no one making small talk

681
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:36,874
because this is Derek
Shepherd on the table?

682
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,233
This is intricate work. Small
talk is what keeps us awake.

683
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,002
Well, uh...

684
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,571
A couple of days ago,
I helped Dr. Kepner

685
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,985
extract a malignant
mass from the gluteal area

686
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,209
of a female patient.

687
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,113
It was an impressively
sized mass.

688
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,467
Who's gonna tell Dr. Shepherd
that he'll never operate again

689
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,837
because Ross' idea of
gossip is, he saw April Kepner

690
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,539
take a lump off an ass?

691
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,162
Brooks, suction.

692
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,399
All of, not half of it.

693
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,388
Sorry.

694
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:20,173
He's got a bunch of tattoos.

695
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:21,770
Wonder if it's some
sort of a gang thing.

696
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,471
I had... The chatter
isn't helping me,

697
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,290
and your experience
with gangland youth

698
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:28,354
has little bearing on
how we treat this patient.

699
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,255
What the hell was
that? I thought this was

700
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,474
supposed to be amicable.

701
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:44,865
We're getting divorced
because of the lawsuit?

702
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,513
It will significantly
increase your chances...

703
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,414
You didn't want to mention
it? I want you to get the money.

704
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:52,483
I want all of you
to get the money,

705
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:53,918
and I knew there
was a very real chance

706
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,154
that you would reject the idea
simply because I suggested it.

707
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,306
Oh, right. Because I'm so
simple-minded and petulant.

708
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,908
You've been known
to... Where do you get off

709
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,699
making some kind of unilateral
decision about our marriage?

710
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,646
How about the fact that
you moved across the country

711
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,047
and didn't have the
courage to do what I did

712
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,699
and simply ask for a divorce?

713
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,756
Oh, God. So this is ballsy,

714
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,574
you hiding behind the lawsuit?

715
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,687
You couldn't just admit to me,

716
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,689
or God sake, yourself,
that you wanted out.

717
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,292
You have to let this stupid plane
crash make the decision for you.

718
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,949
I chose the airline!

719
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:22,298
You like it better when I
decide? I chose the airline!

720
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:35,716
We had to make a
budget cut of 4%...

721
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,184
And we had a line item of
emergency transportation.

722
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,854
We never used
it, and we had a...

723
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:46,259
Fancy charter company,
and I chose a... Cheaper one.

724
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,060
You want to know
why it was cheaper?

725
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,350
You didn't build the plane.

726
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,867
People are dead.

727
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,570
Or fly it.

728
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,672
I thought you were dead.

729
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,230
You're not responsible.

730
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,201
Someone has to be.

731
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,939
I mean, it takes a
lot of small mistakes

732
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,485
to destroy something,
and it's really easy

733
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,942
for everybody involved

734
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,544
just to say, "I just did
this one small thing."

735
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:29,902
A bunch of people
made it possible...

736
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,672
For a bad plane

737
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,809
to take off with you, Meredith,
and Derek, and Arizona, and...

738
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,390
And I am one of those people.

739
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,530
Oh.

740
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,342
I think I'm having a
dream a really hot doctor

741
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,816
came to take care of me.

742
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,269
This really hot doctor is
leaving you to go to a party.

743
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,120
Mmm.

744
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,934
Callie said it could
not have gone better.

745
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,402
Mmm. Do you have any pain?

746
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,876
No.

747
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,210
How's Lizzie?

748
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,412
Uh, she's doing well.

749
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,991
She was still sleeping
last time I checked.

750
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,398
I'll swing by on my way out.

751
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:23,916
Mwah. Hey.

752
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,829
It may have worked.

753
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,437
And we're back on the shoes.

754
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,588
Please don't even
say it out loud.

755
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,462
It makes me feel
even more stupid.

756
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,031
Just... Tell her that
I wasn't feeling well.

757
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,678
You've gotta be kidding me.

758
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,802
Do not belittle me, okay?
You have no idea what it's like...

759
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,605
Oh, trust me, trust me,
I am intimately familiar

760
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,569
with what's going
on, and I'm over it.

761
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,704
You are exactly the same
person you were before,

762
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,160
just minus a leg.

763
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,274
You think it's nothing? No.

764
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,065
Oh, no, no, no, no. I
think it's everything.

765
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,530
And you know what? It
has been... For months.

766
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,787
And I have been
supportive for months.

767
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,934
But there comes a point
where you have to suck it up

768
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,375
and stop whining
and start living.

769
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:24,255
Okay, so you have
one leg. It's a wedding.

770
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,723
It's a wedding. And
weddings are sweet

771
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:27,625
and beautiful and
no one's gonna notice

772
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,126
the stupid leg because
everybody's gonna

773
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,396
be looking at Bailey,
and maybe for one night,

774
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,865
our lives can be about something
other than that damn leg.

775
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,766
My whole life is about that leg.

776
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,202
I haven't had sex in five
months because of the leg.

777
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:39,893
Enough about the leg!

778
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,550
Everything went smoothly.
Your vitals look great.

779
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,220
And Derek is awake,
and he's in good shape.

780
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:11,507
Meredith, I'm pushy. I get that.

781
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,578
Some people find it endearing,
and some people really don't,

782
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,280
but, um...

783
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,982
You don't have to want

784
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,401
Derek's truckload
of sisters in your life.

785
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:26,283
Yeah. You are a pain in the ass.

786
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:27,418
And I barely know you.

787
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,045
Okay, so...

788
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,104
I'm not very good at
this. But I'm gonna try.

789
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,721
I'm gonna show you something,
but you have to promise not to

790
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,723
blab it to the whole family.

791
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,846
Okay.

792
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:50,958
Promise? Yeah.

793
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,982
Okay.

794
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,862
You?

795
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:06,813
Really?

796
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:11,050
We're having a baby.

797
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,163
Yeah.

798
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:13,553
Yay!

799
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,591
Let her drive you, Miranda.

800
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,460
No, Mom.

801
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:23,240
I just need five minutes
with none of you touching me.

802
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,368
So did she bring
her friend or what?

803
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,512
Oh, come on.

804
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:16,900
He's the guy?

805
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:22,123
Mmm.

806
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,374
All right.

807
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:41,857
Was the lawsuit the only
reason you asked for a divorce?

808
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,381
There are many reasons.

809
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,757
You were...

810
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,086
Done a long time ago.

811
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,955
I'm asking about you.

812
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,366
Okay, let me put it another way.

813
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,158
I wanted to try again.

814
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,999
I was gonna ask you
if we could try again,

815
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,167
and you said, "I
want a divorce."

816
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:40,981
Come here.

817
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:57,967
Mmm.

818
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,787
Oh. Sorry.

819
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,756
I should throw this
thing out the window.

820
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,521
Hello. MAN: <i>Sir, this
is Barrett in the E.R.</i>

821
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,345
<i>Your wife is on her way here.
Paramedics say she's vomiting blood.</i>

822
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,591
What? Adele?

823
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:11,898
<i>She's hypotensive.</i>

824
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,777
Um, hey, uh, turn the
car around. We need to go

825
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,479
to the emergency room...
Did you check her vitals?

826
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:16,903
At Seattle Grace
Hospital right now.

827
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:51,236
Wasn't this stupid thing
supposed to start already?

828
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,975
I'm here, sweetheart.

829
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,588
Why is this happening?

830
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,640
We're gonna find out. How
much blood has she lost?

831
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,109
At least a liter,
a liter and a half.

832
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,343
It started about 45 minutes ago.

833
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,933
Oh, God! It hurts.

834
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,079
Hang more L.R.

835
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,297
No, not if she's lost
that much blood.

836
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,948
She needs a transfusion
and an N.G. tube.

837
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,106
I've got this, okay?
Sir, she's your wife.

838
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,786
Step back. Get me
an N.G. tube, son.

839
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,877
I can do this. Get
me an N.G. tube

840
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,745
right now. Okay, I
got it. You hear me?

841
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,934
Oh.

842
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,153
Okay. Get out of the way.

843
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,219
Okay. Central line kit, please.
- Yes, Doctor.

844
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:30,971
Yeah, yeah, Leah. Get
me out of this dress now.

845
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,261
Adele, hi.

846
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,097
Can you look at me?
Hey, we're gonna take

847
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,814
good care of you, okay?

848
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:38,229
She's having
ventricular couplets.

849
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:39,752
All right, watch for V-tach.

850
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,087
Prep the I.J.

851
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:43,050
Okay, you're gonna be
fine, baby. We got you.

852
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,535
All right. Get the
guide wire ready.

853
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:48,205
She's losing consciousness.
Bailey! Damn it. All right.

854
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:50,896
Uh, Barrett, take this.
Do a femoral line instead.

855
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,382
Uh, Leah, intubation tray.

856
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,020
Oh, God, Adele.

857
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,355
Oh, God.

858
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:05,811
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

859
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,391
Oh, straight to voice mail.

860
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,099
Um, it's possible

861
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,368
that I may have, by mistake,
said that if she had any doubts,

862
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,436
she should flee. What?

863
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,658
Why?

864
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,961
Well, I kind of said
that marriage is like

865
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,957
a dance of death and
that leaving him at the altar

866
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,531
would be a painful
but efficient out.

867
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,833
Oh, that's nice. I was joking...

868
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,353
And she was nervous, okay?

869
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,099
And she wasn't sure
if it was the wedding

870
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,400
or the whole thing.
The marriage?

871
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,469
She was nervous.

872
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,892
How nervous?

873
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,746
How nervous was she, Callie?

874
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,126
<i>The body doesn't
know the difference</i>

875
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,385
<i>between nerves and
excitement, panic and doubt,</i>

876
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:50,006
<i>the beginning, and the end.</i>

877
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:52,976
<i>The body just tells
you to get the hell out.</i>

878
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,645
<i>Sometimes you ignore it.</i>

879
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,816
<i>That's the
reasonable thing to do.</i>

880
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,087
<i>But sometimes you listen.</i>

881
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,524
<i>You're supposed to
trust your gut, right?</i>

882
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,727
<i>When your body says run...</i>

883
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,700
<i>Run.</i>
