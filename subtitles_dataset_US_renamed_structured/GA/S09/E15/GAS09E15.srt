1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,902
<i>I am telling you, once we
got these doctors talking,</i>

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,192
<i>it was a horror show.</i>

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,462
Shh. I just got Sofia back down.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,049
Oh, and Portland
Gen has quotas now.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,117
Yeah. It's unspoken,
but it's understood

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,231
that you have to churn out a
certain number of procedures.

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,488
And no research?

8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,938
Nope. Pegasus is only interested

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,569
in high-volume,
high-price-tag procedures.

10
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,925
Barely any patient interaction.

11
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,844
So no research, no innovation,

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,980
no opportunity to do what it
is we got into medicine to do.

13
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:33,659
Well, we won't let
that happen to us here.

14
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,817
Oh, yeah? That's
what they said at first.

15
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:37,914
And then the people that
fought management got fired,

16
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,088
and the rest wore
down or they left.

17
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:44,126
<i>They say there's one sure
sign of a successful negotiation.</i>

18
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,228
Now, I don't want to
leave. None of us do.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,096
You guys, come on.
We have to do this.

20
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,348
We have to buy the hospital.

21
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,482
Hold on.

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,100
Maybe she's right. Just wait.

23
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:54,369
<i>It's that when the
parties leave the table...</i>

24
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,021
What if we don't want to?

25
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,967
<i>They both feel like
they've been screwed.</i>

26
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,608
Yes. Oh, yes.

27
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:00,836
Is it, is it this?

28
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,895
Or... Or that?

29
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,663
Oh, that. Oh, exactly that.

30
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,382
<i>The goal is a compromise...</i>

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,652
Okay.

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,923
Your turn.

33
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,832
<i>A situation where
everybody wins.</i>

34
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,039
I'm sorry. It's never been
my dream to run a hospital.

35
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,608
Okay, well, you might
not have to run it.

36
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:23,626
Cristina should be here.
I have been texting her.

37
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,894
I just got back to work.

38
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,129
And, Derek, you just
got your hand back.

39
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,296
Don't you want to just work?

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,414
Work where?

41
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:29,766
I don't want somebody telling me

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,450
which patients I
can and can't treat.

43
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,186
Or putting a stopwatch on how
much time you can spend with them.

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,993
Yeah, if we ran the place,

45
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,456
we could make policy
decisions based on experience.

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,925
No offense, but that is
a naive way of putting it.

47
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,326
The job is much
harder than you think.

48
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,094
I wanted it once,
and I hated it.

49
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,701
We should stay the course.

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,149
I made a deal with Pegasus
that apparently will help the sale.

51
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,085
What deal? Nothing, it's stupid.

52
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,270
But maybe that's how we
make it work, from the inside.

53
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:52,405
What about Hunt?

54
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,740
I mean, he's pushing
for the Pegasus sale.

55
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:55,864
He thinks it's a good deal.
So what's he gonna say?

56
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,952
Oh, it's Cahill.

57
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,287
You know, she just
wants to strategize.

58
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,605
At 3:00 a.m.?

59
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,674
I bet she does.

60
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,203
You know the nurses
are threatening a walkout,

61
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,561
and I have to talk them down?

62
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,290
You know what? No.
Let's just not talk about this.

63
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,283
I just want to be here
for a few hours with you

64
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,461
where there are no problems.

65
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,885
Okay.

66
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,631
You know, the sale to
Pegasus closes in three days.

67
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:20,750
And Cahill says the
buyers are getting twitchy,

68
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,468
and if there's a mass
exodus of the staff,

69
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:23,820
even if there's a tiny exodus,

70
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,044
I mean, basically
if anybody leaves,

71
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,824
then the buyers
are gonna back out,

72
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,314
and we lose the sale, and...

73
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,384
The hospital closes.

74
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,504
That's not gonna happen.

75
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,739
You sure?

76
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,020
You can be a little more...

77
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,076
Maybe?

78
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,678
Convincing. Okay.

79
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,381
That's not going to happen.

80
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,394
What are we talking about,
like $100 million, $200 million?

81
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,363
You know what
we're talking about.

82
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:53,233
We have more than we're ever
gonna be able to spend anyway.

83
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,467
We have more
than we'll ever be...

84
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,269
- No, that's not true.
- But I don't know.

85
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,793
This is a massive undertaking.

86
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,939
Nobody knows
what it's gonna cost.

87
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,329
So what are you saying?

88
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,109
Are you saying that
they take everything?

89
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,527
I mean, everything from
the lawsuit, from all of us?

90
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,762
I have no idea what it's gonna
cost to buy Seattle Grace,

91
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,964
but I can guarantee you

92
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,749
it's more than the four
of us have combined. I...

93
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,539
That's only $60 million.

94
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,954
I had some money before
all this. I've got about...

95
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,488
700 grand I can
get to right away.

96
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,640
It's true. We have money in
the IRA. And we have about...

97
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,825
No, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

98
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,559
Well, just the lawsuit
damages then.

99
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,711
And we've got Mark's share, too.

100
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,151
Mark's share?

101
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,731
Yeah, and Lexie's
maybe? Is that rude of me...

102
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,866
I mean, I would have to
ask her... Our, our father...

103
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,501
Don't worry. Excuse me.
Yes, this is rude of you.

104
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,402
Okay, I'm sorry, but we can't
waste time on politeness here.

105
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,438
And Mark's share is not
our money. It's Sofia's.

106
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,940
You should've talked
about this with me...

107
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,229
That's what we're doing.

108
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,648
I mean privately with your wife.

109
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,146
Where is Cristina?

110
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,481
I don't know. I
keep texting her.

111
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,438
She would say yes to this.

112
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,251
- How do you know that?
- She knows.

113
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,813
Leave us alone.

114
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,215
Get some sleep.

115
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,284
This isn't all on
your shoulders.

116
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,919
It shouldn't be.

117
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,899
It is right now. If I can't...

118
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,857
You know, if I can't talk
the nurses into staying...

119
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,192
You will.

120
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,763
I just don't know
what's gonna happen,

121
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,231
with or without Pegasus.

122
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,460
I keep running through the
worst-case scenarios and...

123
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:18,106
All I know is...

124
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,009
That I'm happy here with you.

125
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,044
Whatever's falling
apart, I just...

126
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,279
You and I, we're...

127
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,348
We're safe.

128
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,417
Right. Right?

129
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,186
Exactly right.

130
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,253
I don't think that it's right
to spend all of our money.

131
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,609
It is an investment.

132
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,512
Of all of our money, Callie.

133
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,742
If your parents had ever
made you have a summer job...

134
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,394
Oh, come on. That is so
unfair. You might understand.

135
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,484
No, you are ready
to bankrupt us.

136
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,214
You're ready to let Pegasus
Horizons turn us into a bunch of robots.

137
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,556
You are ready to sink $50
million into maintaining a good vibe.

138
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,875
So what's the
alternative? We leave?

139
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,661
No, I don't want to leave.

140
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,280
This hospital is not
something that we lucked into.

141
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,759
This is something that we made.

142
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:02,016
And Webber hired
us, and he set a tone.

143
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,384
Hunt sets a tone,

144
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:04,964
and it's something I
am proud to be a part of,

145
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,287
and it's worth fighting for.

146
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,620
Shoot. Sorry. Is
that mine or yours?

147
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,511
It's mine, but she's
gonna wake yours.

148
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,756
I think Callie's right.

149
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,474
This isn't about a
financial investment.

150
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,226
It's a much bigger
opportunity... Right.

151
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,112
To stay and make the place
we dreamed of work again.

152
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,186
Yes. Oh, God.
Will you two stop it?

153
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,099
We are not spending this money.

154
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,001
If I have learned
anything in the past year,

155
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,937
it's that we don't get to know
what's coming around the corner.

156
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,128
Anything can happen,
to you, to me. Anything.

157
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,077
And our daughter deserves as
much protection as we can give her.

158
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,145
And we have the chance
to not have to worry

159
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,409
no matter what happens,

160
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,255
a chance to be prepared
should the worst happen...

161
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:42,758
I don't want to
live like that...

162
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,909
Getting ready for disasters
that may never happen.

163
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,123
Well, we have an opportunity
right now to do something about it.

164
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,424
And maybe we have a
responsibility to do that...

165
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,326
Oh, don't try and
make me feel selfish.

166
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,078
Don't try and make me feel
guilty just because you do.

167
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,301
Who said I felt guilty?

168
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:54,447
I think, I think
you feel guilty.

169
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:55,598
But that's not, it's not...

170
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,750
No, no, no, no,
no. Let's go ahead.

171
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,840
Tell me.

172
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,345
Some of us died.

173
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,824
And some of us are
gonna live with challenges

174
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,314
for the rest of their life.

175
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:09,283
And you, you got the money.

176
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,263
And then you got your hand
back and you got your career back,

177
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,005
and I think that
you feel guilty.

178
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,353
I think you feel guilty
about your decision to sue

179
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,555
and I think that you feel guilty
about having all this money.

180
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,573
And now I think that
you want to be the one

181
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:21,941
that comes in and saves everyone,
and you have to be the hero.

182
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,493
And it's selfish and
it's egomaniacal,

183
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,994
and now it's
affecting my family.

184
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,162
So just stop. Okay?

185
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,664
Everything that you've
done to make it better

186
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,887
has actually made it
worse. So please stop.

187
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,610
I think we should go.

188
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:39,413
You should.

189
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,747
Hey, Derek, I owe
you an apology.

190
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,749
Oh, no. There's no
need. No, no, I do.

191
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,351
It was late, and I was
tired and stressed out.

192
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,469
Well, we were all stressed out.

193
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,837
We're just trying
to do our best.

194
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,338
No, I know, but I had no
right to call you egotistical.

195
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,629
It was "egomaniacal," I think.

196
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,978
Yeah. I was out of line.

197
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,502
On the other hand...

198
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,073
You're Pegasus'
"Face of the Hospital"?

199
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,876
Cahill said it would
be some brochures,

200
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,345
some schmoozing,
not... All of this.

201
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:30,214
Not a whole lot of
practicing medicine either.

202
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,266
I hope you know
what you're in for.

203
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:35,136
No offense, Derek. I
mean, it's a great face, but...

204
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,906
This is a lot of it.

205
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,226
I mean, this is kind of gross.

206
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,695
This is unacceptable.

207
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,229
Dr. Shepherd, hold up!

208
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,910
Yeah? Love the picture.

209
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,567
Love it. Your head is gigantic.

210
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,102
I'm prepping for our AVM.

211
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,520
Do you prefer OR two or four?

212
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,622
He's doing an AVM
under hypothermic arrest

213
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,619
where he drops the brain's
temperature to avoid stroke risk.

214
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,892
I know what it is.

215
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,622
He's the only one in
the region who does it.

216
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,973
I've always wanted to see
it up close. Can we go now?

217
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,025
I'm not doing it. Cahill
wants me to meet the buyers.

218
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,217
He's the new face of the hospital
now. And the hair. Lucky us.

219
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,165
Great. Just make it go away.

220
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,407
Oh. Oh, my God.

221
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,559
Can we talk about the
giant pictures of myself?

222
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,455
Do you love them? I
want 'em down, all of them.

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,879
I agreed to a brochure.

224
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:22,350
"And other marketing materials
and collateral." This is that.

225
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,002
What are you ashamed of?

226
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,414
Telling people
that your hospital

227
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,650
is more than just
a set of clinically

228
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,919
sterilized walls and equipment?

229
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,627
That it is full of people
who are intelligent

230
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:35,163
and passionate
about caring for them?

231
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,059
'Cause that is what
your face tells people.

232
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,416
Says who?

233
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,995
Well, three focus
groups can't be wrong.

234
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,703
So just give it a few days.

235
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,821
You'll get used to you.

236
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,668
You ready for the nurses? Mmm.

237
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,725
<i>Marcia Lowe to CTU...</i>

238
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,244
It means a lot to me, Derek.

239
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,844
I know this is not you. I
know this is a sacrifice,

240
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,746
but this sale is our last shot,

241
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,265
and I feel like I've been
fighting this battle alone.

242
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,689
And to have you in
the fight with me...

243
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:03,585
That means a lot.

244
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,168
I don't, uh...

245
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,548
I don't want to do this anymore.

246
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,306
Oh. Oh, um...

247
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,486
No, no, no, no.
No, no, not, not this.

248
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,021
I want to do this. Lots of this.

249
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,346
I just don't want
to do it... Here.

250
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,126
I want to take
you out on a date.

251
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,828
Someplace that doesn't have...

252
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:29,951
Wheels...

253
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,103
Yes, okay. That would be nice.

254
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,766
And where fewer people
have bled to death.

255
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,240
Oh, well, now I'm totally sold.

256
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,625
Tonight?

257
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:38,814
Tonight?

258
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,141
Okay. Great.

259
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,565
I can't wait to see you
out of those clothes.

260
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,419
I meant scrubs.

261
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,671
Uh, in regular clothes.

262
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,735
Not that you don't
look great in scrubs,

263
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,943
'cause you would
look great in anything.

264
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,546
Like coveralls or a parka.

265
00:09:58,615 --> 00:09:59,698
7:30?

266
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,526
7:30.

267
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,452
Oh, and if I'm late,

268
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,898
it's because I'm still
banging my head

269
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,562
into a wall over
how this just went.

270
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:08,723
It went great.

271
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,507
Could be a volvulus.

272
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,498
Let's intubate and
put in an NG tube.

273
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,965
Draw .8 of etomidate.

274
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,567
When was the baby delivered?

275
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,230
Twenty-five minutes ago.
Vomiting, distended abdomen.

276
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,482
I need those films back, stat.

277
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,776
Give me the etomidate.

278
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,823
Sedatives in a newborn
need a light touch,

279
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,214
so I like to do it myself.

280
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,595
Shh. Shh, shh. It's okay,
buddy. You go to sleep.

281
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,659
I promise you won't
remember any of this crap.

282
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,568
What are you smiling
about? Nothing.

283
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,403
Cut it out. We need
to tell his parents

284
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,667
their brand-new
baby needs surgery.

285
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,742
His bowels have twisted
around the blood supply,

286
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,232
causing an obstruction.

287
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,268
So...

288
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,832
We need to do an emergency
surgery to correct that immediately.

289
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,460
So... We are going to...

290
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,863
Do that.

291
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,889
Mr. Finch, uh, can I speak
with you outside for a sec?

292
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,994
I know this is a lot to take.

293
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,246
Are you and your wife okay?

294
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,032
Who, Langer?

295
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,185
I don't know. I don't
know her that well.

296
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,232
That's my kid, but she...
But she's not my wife.

297
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,400
We work together.
We hooked up one time.

298
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,668
We tore one off
at an office party...

299
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,941
And his condom breaks

300
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,710
because he's too cheap
and stupid to buy decent ones.

301
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,713
I'm almost 40, I want
a baby, so I told him,

302
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,926
"You're off the hook,
but I'm keeping it."

303
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,095
And he says that he
wants to do the right thing.

304
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,103
I'm gonna raise that baby.

305
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,816
I mean, financially, yeah,
but I'm gonna be there.

306
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,823
I want to, you know...
Be a father to that kid.

307
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,154
He's a complete asshat,
but he makes a good living.

308
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,811
She's a bitch on wheels,

309
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,808
but she's smart and she's
tough. A kid could do worse.

310
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,982
And right now all I
care about is my baby.

311
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,629
Is my baby gonna be okay?

312
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,453
Tell me my kid's gonna
be okay. Can you do that?

313
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,569
Whoa.

314
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,181
So the chemo didn't work?

315
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,948
Just like the radiation.

316
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,963
A.J.'s cancer has
continued to spread.

317
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,936
So what, surgery now?

318
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,139
I mean, you said that
surgery could kill him.

319
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,824
You said he was too weak.

320
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,870
Well, Dr. Bailey here is
suggesting another approach.

321
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,411
Yeah, it's called
genome mapping.

322
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,398
If we can identify the
specific DNA sequence

323
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,633
of A.J.'s tumor,

324
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,435
it could open up a
variety of treatment options

325
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,120
and targeted drug therapies.

326
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,038
And no surgery?

327
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:39,357
You can do that here?

328
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,658
Uh, no, not yet.

329
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,844
We would have to contract
out to another facility.

330
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,863
I'm just waiting for approval
from the hospital advisory board,

331
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,777
and I think we'll
have that today.

332
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,121
We would just need to
have your consent to try...

333
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,962
Um... We will
take this as a "yes."

334
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,381
Okay.

335
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,062
Okay, I have salary
and bonus breakdowns,

336
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,952
benefits packages,
pension stuff...

337
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,081
Don't be nervous.

338
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,938
I'm not. I can
talk to my people.

339
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,868
Well, I hope so, 'cause
if not, we're in trouble.

340
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,119
You trying to make me nervous?

341
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,243
Hey, Dr. Hunt?

342
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,411
Uh, Bailey, I have to...

343
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,612
No, I just wondered

344
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,563
what you heard back
from the advisory board.

345
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,882
Uh, about?

346
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,284
About my genome mapping.

347
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,797
The request I
submitted to sequence...

348
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,889
Right, right. Sorry.
Um, they turned it down.

349
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:29,635
Well, no, no, no. It's,
it's just one sequence...

350
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,220
It's a "No." For...

351
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,510
Sorry.

352
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,277
<i>Okay, so what is
the big secret plan?</i>

353
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,701
We want to pool our
winnings from the lawsuit

354
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,303
and buy the hospital.

355
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,238
I was hoping you'd be on board.

356
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,097
Maybe I misspoke.

357
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,583
So that is the plan?

358
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:56,751
Yes.

359
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,135
That is so stupid!

360
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,216
You don't know the first
thing about owning a hospital

361
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,357
or running one,
and neither do I.

362
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,359
Well, Pegasus Horizons
knows how not to run a hospital.

363
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,239
I mean, you should
hear Callie's stories.

364
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,557
It's this or go somewhere else.

365
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,248
No. No one leaves.

366
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,850
Owen says if
people start leaving,

367
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,429
the sale won't go through,
and we're screwed.

368
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,913
That's why we want to buy it,

369
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,239
because we're doctors,
and we know how it runs.

370
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,941
Did you know you'll have to
file a declaration for land use

371
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,770
for approval by the
state attorney general?

372
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,590
Will we? I don't know.
I just made that up.

373
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,564
But see? We don't
know anything about this.

374
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,767
I'm surprised. I thought
you'd be on board.

375
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,946
Or you'd leave again.

376
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,620
Hey, no one leaves.

377
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,722
Owen is killing himself trying
to keep the hospital open.

378
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,276
Can we please stop talking
nonsense and have his back?

379
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,523
Hey. Our, uh, panniculectomy
was discharged. Said to say thanks.

380
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,737
Liposuction day?

381
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,539
High-volume, high-price-tag,

382
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,043
'cause when Pegasus
trims the fat, so do I.

383
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,635
What's the matter?

384
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:06,615
Nope. Can't talk about it.

385
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,355
Why, 'cause of her?

386
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,174
Mrs. Berkus.

387
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,543
Mrs. Berkus.

388
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,523
Mrs. Berkus!

389
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,581
She's blotto. What's up?

390
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,649
No, I can't talk
about it to you.

391
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,295
I could when we
were friends, but now...

392
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,219
We seriously can't
be friends now?

393
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,871
Yes, we can. Just...

394
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,353
This is too much.
How about this?

395
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:32,079
I will tell you a thing I would
tell you when we were friends.

396
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,648
My mom, she is driving me nuts

397
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,802
about taking a bigger role in
the Harper Avery Foundation.

398
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,054
"Grow up, child.
Get your legacy on."

399
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,622
It's not bad advice.

400
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,068
I know that, but I'm
working my ass off here,

401
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,436
and I'm not even
an attending yet.

402
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,521
You know what?
You're a crappy friend.

403
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,185
You're supposed to side with me.

404
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,963
See? Now you go.

405
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,631
Um...

406
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,281
So I've been seeing
this paramedic.

407
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,970
I'm aware.

408
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,855
Too much? No.

409
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,124
I told you I was seeing
Stephanie the intern.

410
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,442
Was that too much?

411
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,938
No. I mean, it's not a thing.

412
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,129
It's just, you know, fun and...

413
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,880
We're not serious.

414
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,589
We both know how that
can turn out. That is true.

415
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,051
Okay, your turn.

416
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,021
Okay. So...

417
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,490
He asked me out... On a date,

418
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,059
like our first real date.

419
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,073
And it's really,
like, our fifth date.

420
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,763
And, and this real date

421
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,027
is probably gonna wind
up at someone's apartment.

422
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,891
And it's... Going in a
direction, you know?

423
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,364
And it's one thing to tell a guy

424
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,033
that you're a virgin and
hope he understands,

425
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,334
but to tell him
that I was a virgin

426
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,736
and then wasn't
and now am again...

427
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,704
I just feel like there's no way
he's gonna understand that.

428
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,396
I mean, who understands that?
But I really like him and I just...

429
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,066
It's all gonna end tonight.

430
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,156
Oh, God. Too much.

431
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,274
Nope.

432
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,276
Oh, way too much, April.

433
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,445
Look, tell him exactly
what you told me,

434
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,594
and he won't care whether
you're a virgin or not.

435
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,516
He won't?

436
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,762
He'll be worried
you're mentally ill,

437
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,763
because you
sound like a nut job.

438
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,006
Good to have you back, pal.

439
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,820
Hey, I'm kidding.
No, I know. See ya.

440
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,076
Come on, April.

441
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,564
I guide the parachute
into the heart,

442
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,132
open it...

443
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,819
So it will block off the damage
caused by his heart attack.

444
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,315
It should keep
the rest of his heart

445
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,899
from working so
hard while it heals.

446
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,423
That is crazy balls.

447
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,091
I'm in position now.

448
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,987
What did your friend
at UC Davis say?

449
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,923
Are the other interns
still dropping like flies?

450
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,441
Yeah. There's at
least four openings.

451
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,585
What are you talking about?

452
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,650
Mousy, speak.

453
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,422
Um... Some of us
are talking about...

454
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,690
Looking elsewhere.

455
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,126
Why?

456
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,505
Last year, Seattle Grace

457
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,579
was the residency match
you dreamed of getting.

458
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,667
The last few weeks, it feels
like automotive trade school.

459
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,453
God.

460
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:54,332
Where is your sense of loyalty?

461
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,285
There are people here
fighting to make sure

462
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,137
this hospital stays open at all.

463
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,206
And at the first sign of trouble,
you show them your ass?

464
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,796
No. No, it's just that...

465
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:04,432
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,835
I only have five years to get
as good at this as I possibly can.

467
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,070
And I want to be excellent.

468
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,741
I want to be the best, so I
can't waste another minute.

469
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,143
I mean, would you have
when you were an intern?

470
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,578
Honestly?

471
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,386
There's the volvulus.

472
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,988
All right. Retract
there. I'll dissect.

473
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:31,942
Do you think they can work,
workplace relationships?

474
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,910
What? What do you mean?

475
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,679
Look at these two,

476
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,376
coworkers who wanted
a quickie and got a baby.

477
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,745
Well, they both seem
to want the baby.

478
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:41,929
Yeah, but they don't
want each other.

479
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,482
And now they're
stuck seeing each other

480
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,350
at the kid's recitals
and at staff meetings?

481
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,614
It's a disaster, right?

482
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,642
I don't know.
Everybody's different.

483
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,628
True.

484
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,298
You've had relationships
with coworkers.

485
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,099
Yeah. And look
how those played out.

486
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,484
You're single and alone.

487
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,698
When I met you, you had
a mattress and one bowl.

488
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,754
Come on. That's...

489
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,808
Yeah, well...

490
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,865
It's just... More trouble
than it's worth, right?

491
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,066
What happened?

492
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,784
Hematoma on the liver. It burst.

493
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,052
2-0 chromic.

494
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,748
Crap. It's tearing.

495
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,189
Pack him. Pack him gently.

496
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,558
I need thrombin and fibrin glue.

497
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,870
Get some factor VII in here now.

498
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,134
Right away, Doctor.

499
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,059
I got your page. I thought
you weren't doing the AVM.

500
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,316
Oh, we're not.

501
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,885
Pegasus wants to do some
photos of me in surgery.

502
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,682
It's not real. You
know, it's just pretend.

503
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,452
But we need some more bodies. I
thought you'd like to come in there.

504
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,276
Uh...

505
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,005
With all due respect,
sir, may I not?

506
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:41,062
What?

507
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,974
Dr. Yang's testing
a new protocol.

508
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,577
I'd learn more from watching
that than pretending to do surgery.

509
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,012
I mean, if you
really need me to...

510
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,369
No.

511
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,120
It's okay. Go.

512
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,391
Thank you.

513
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,923
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

514
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,625
I have had the same
schedule for six years.

515
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,421
And now we're splitting shifts?

516
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,796
My husband works two jobs.
Who picks up my kid now?

517
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:17,075
Pegasus breaks
up shifts differently.

518
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,198
I don't need this.

519
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,467
And we get shafted.

520
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,667
I'm not taking this.

521
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,253
Who's taking this?

522
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,674
If you know how to talk to your
people, you should start now.

523
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,353
I am. They keep coming
back... Cahill, chief.

524
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:29,938
Look, I'm sorry, but
this is not gonna work.

525
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,240
No, Shepherd. I'm sorry. I've
been waiting for 20 minutes.

526
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,632
Chief, I just wanted to ask you
again about the genetic screening.

527
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,000
Bailey, I'm sorry...

528
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,119
All right, look, I am
trying to work with you.

529
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:41,033
But I'm not gonna reschedule my
surgeries so I can do a photo op.

530
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:42,400
Maybe when this hospital is
on a firmer financial footing...

531
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,102
No, this isn't about me
looking for extra credit.

532
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:44,875
This is about a specific... No,
you have enough pictures of me.

533
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,088
Bailey... I want...

534
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,289
Now look, if you
just read the chart,

535
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,674
then you can talk
to the stupid board...

536
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,175
Bailey... And make
them understand...

537
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,132
Bailey, they
didn't say no. I did.

538
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,921
I didn't bring it up to them
because it will not be approved.

539
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,554
So we're just gonna...

540
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,863
The answer's no, Bailey.

541
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,693
Yes, sir.

542
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,312
Never mind then.

543
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,392
What is it, Shepherd?

544
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,420
Nothing. I'm good.

545
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:20,728
It's Derek Shepherd.

546
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,496
I have an idea, a crazy idea,

547
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,445
and I need you to
tell me how crazy.

548
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,772
Whoa. This isn't weird.

549
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,208
I know. I wanted to
meet outside the hospital.

550
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,626
And then with the rain...

551
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:53,972
No, I like it. It's very
cloak-and-daggery.

552
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,762
You must be Dr. Torres. Oh, God!

553
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,393
Callie Torres, Stan Grossberg.

554
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,116
He's my financial advisor.

555
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,729
I think I might have
died for a second.

556
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,420
I asked him about the
feasibility of our idea.

557
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,188
Stan, tell her what you told me.

558
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,091
Under federal law,
physicians cannot own

559
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,728
and run the hospital
for which they work.

560
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,329
So we're hosed.

561
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,298
However, you could ally
yourselves with a for-profit

562
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,967
or not-for-profit agency,

563
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,236
which would be owner pro forma.

564
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,817
Then the five of you could form
your own management company,

565
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,075
which would be hired
by this foundation.

566
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,944
So we're not hosed.

567
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,947
Basically, you would run
the day-to-day operations,

568
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,016
much like a board of directors.

569
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,552
And again I ask,
who wants to do that?

570
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,587
Just let him finish.

571
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,133
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be in

572
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,801
an operating room
than a boardroom.

573
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,803
Besides, I thought we didn't have
enough money to do this anyway.

574
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,427
Well, I'm working on that.

575
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,373
Estimating the number of beds,

576
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,097
the overall operating budget,

577
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,677
the property and business taxes,

578
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,779
the franchise tax
board payments...

579
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,804
Okay, right, right, right. I'm
asking, is it possible for us to do?

580
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,753
That's what he's
saying. It is possible.

581
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,175
It is very possible.

582
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,577
Okay, well, how much
more money would we need?

583
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,390
That's what I was
saying, I don't know.

584
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,182
Not until I see a hospital
financial statement.

585
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,017
How do we get that?

586
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,351
Owen can get that for us.

587
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,772
Um...

588
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:15,125
If we have a hope of
outbidding Pegasus,

589
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,595
the element of surprise
is sort of crucial here.

590
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,512
Owen can't know any of this.

591
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,027
We're gonna go behind
Owen's back to steal the hospital?

592
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,868
No, Owen will still be Chief.

593
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,436
He's legally obligated
to tell them of anything

594
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,916
that might interfere
with the sale.

595
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,407
He signed non-competes,
non-disclosures.

596
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,520
If he breaches them,
they will fire him.

597
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,494
They will sue him.

598
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,030
There could even be jail time.

599
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,515
He can't know any of this.

600
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,519
You want me to lie to him.

601
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,437
No, I want you to just
not say anything for now.

602
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,923
You want me to lie to him.

603
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:53,058
The nurses aren't being
unreasonable. They have valid concerns.

604
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,994
And I'm worried that you don't
know how to address those concerns.

605
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,329
Yeah, well, I'm worried
you're asking me

606
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,031
to sell them something
that I don't even believe in.

607
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,721
You're a doctor.

608
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,767
You know sometimes you
have to swallow some bitter pills

609
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,836
in order to get well.
This is a bad pill.

610
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,321
Yeah, well, why
don't you tell 'em that?

611
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,829
They need to hear it
from someone they trust.

612
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,233
Okay.

613
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:15,536
Do you remember last week
when we operated, the logger?

614
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:18,539
Before that, I didn't
think that I ever would

615
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:21,875
or could step up to
an OR table again.

616
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:24,811
I was scared the whole time.

617
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,813
As scared as I have
ever been in my life.

618
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,882
I had no idea. I know.

619
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,570
The only reason I
was able to do it...

620
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,573
Was because you were there.

621
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,892
And I barely even knew you.

622
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:43,380
But you were so calm and sure.

623
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,517
And if you were
okay, I would be okay.

624
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,029
Not many people
have this quality.

625
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,342
What happened? Can I ask?

626
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,311
It's not a good story.

627
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,864
Sorry. It's none of my business.

628
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,783
No, I mean, it's not
an interesting story.

629
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:05,130
You've heard it a hundred times.

630
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:06,586
I choked is all.

631
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,424
Listen...

632
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,382
I am good at this job.

633
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,952
So you can believe
me when I tell you

634
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,355
that only you can help
these people understand

635
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,358
that something that
hurts them in the short run

636
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,178
will help them in the long run.

637
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:35,615
When you tell someone
that everything will be okay,

638
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:38,369
they'll trust you.

639
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,751
You know you hold
this place together.

640
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,877
Every doctor and every
patient here knows that.

641
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,957
I know that you are
the cornerstones.

642
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,327
I need you to be strong
right now in this transition.

643
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,320
Transitions are scary, I know.

644
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,823
But believe me, I...

645
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,070
I would not be asking
you to go through this

646
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:05,395
if I did not believe that what
Pegasus Horizons offers

647
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,698
is the best thing for all of us.

648
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,401
I mean, if I didn't, I
would leave with you.

649
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,206
I'm asking you to stay,

650
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,674
trust me,

651
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,809
work with me.

652
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,444
Just...

653
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,480
Help me get us through this.

654
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,400
Can we do that?

655
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:33,724
We can try.

656
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,960
Right?

657
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,244
I'll try.

658
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,711
Give it a go.

659
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,566
<i>I can try to repair the liver,</i>

660
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,235
but it's incredibly delicate,

661
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,388
and there's a high risk that it
will be permanently damaged.

662
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,494
And the baby dies.

663
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:55,628
It's a risk.

664
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,475
The other option
is, we sit tight

665
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,399
and hope the bleeding
stops on its own.

666
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,750
And hope he survives that.

667
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:06,818
What? What, what?

668
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,124
Say something.

669
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,543
Decide.

670
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,276
Well, I say we wait.
Don't do anything.

671
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,699
Right.

672
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,167
No, that's stupid.

673
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,169
Do the surgery.
No, I don't know.

674
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:21,988
I don't know. I can't...

675
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,774
I can't decide.

676
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,409
I can't. I can't do this.

677
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,555
You do it. I can't.

678
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,611
Hey, hey, hey!

679
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,914
Listen,

680
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,383
we both decide.

681
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,686
Okay? I'm scared, too.
I'm as scared as you are,

682
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,022
but you are the biggest,
meanest, ball-busting,

683
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,425
ice-queen, nightmare
bitch that I have ever met.

684
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,177
So if I can do this, you can.

685
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,314
Okay?

686
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,705
Let's...

687
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,708
Wait.

688
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,111
Okay.

689
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,913
Can I have a glass
of water, please?

690
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,541
And a maxi pad for
my girlfriend here.

691
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:06,966
Nice.

692
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,236
Look at that.

693
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,748
It's bad enough that
they're up there at all,

694
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,267
and now I have
to deal with this?

695
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,491
We'll put a stop to it. I'll
have this one taken down.

696
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,410
I want them all taken down.

697
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,597
I didn't do it.

698
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,371
Do you believe it?

699
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
What do you mean?

700
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,275
What you said to the nurses,

701
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,277
"Pegasus will lead us
to a brighter tomorrow."

702
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,128
Do you really believe that?

703
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:38,631
It is the only option that we...

704
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,634
It's just us now. It's me.

705
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,122
No.

706
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,924
No, okay? No. No, I don't.

707
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,538
It's a bitter pill, and we
just have to swallow it.

708
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,939
And honestly, I don't even know

709
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,191
if this is gonna make
us better or worse.

710
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,426
Then why are you fighting
so hard for something...

711
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,690
There's no other choice.

712
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,567
This is our only shot.

713
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,703
Okay, but what, what
if it wasn't, though?

714
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,772
What if it's not all on
you to fix everything...

715
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,734
But it is. It is all on me.
No, Owen, Owen, listen...

716
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,492
I put you all on that plane.

717
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,414
I'm sorry. It's... Cahill.

718
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,323
Yeah.

719
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:15,652
What?

720
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,057
Today?

721
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,220
No, no, no, no, no. No, that is,

722
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,611
that's... Amazing.

723
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,396
I'll come find you. Okay.

724
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,576
What?

725
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,633
It's almost over.

726
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,024
This is so stupid.

727
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,636
This is the only way I can
think of getting in there.

728
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,854
So we're in a heist movie now?

729
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,406
Stan needs to see the
financial statements.

730
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,008
I will schmooze,
distract, and then you...

731
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,476
What, stick one down my shirt?

732
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,866
I don't know.

733
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,936
All right, just... Let's
go. Get me in there.

734
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,219
Gentlemen and ladies,
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

735
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,338
but I'd like to introduce you
to my wife, Dr. Meredith Grey.

736
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,161
What a pleasure it
is to meet you, sir.

737
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,279
Oh, my goodness.

738
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:00,425
I'm so sorry. Meredith.

739
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:01,542
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

740
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,399
I am a little clumsy.

741
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,679
They are not approving

742
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,152
the genome mapping at this time.

743
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,687
But you said that...

744
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:09,150
We were sure that it was
gonna go the other way.

745
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,840
So I'm sorry.

746
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,726
So now we're
back to a colectomy.

747
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:15,195
I want to wait another
day to see if A.J. improves,

748
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,531
but... It needs to be soon.

749
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,317
Is that our only option?

750
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,796
Yeah, I'm afraid that that's...

751
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,254
No. There's one other option.

752
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,774
You can go someplace

753
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:30,544
that will find an approach
that works for him,

754
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,213
someplace that will give
him the care that he deserves.

755
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,682
He won't get that
here. I say leave.

756
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,987
Leave Seattle Grace and
go someplace else, fast.

757
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,879
What the hell was that?

758
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,258
That was the only medical advice

759
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,659
I could give them
in good conscience.

760
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,195
I'm thinking I need
to take it myself.

761
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,784
Whoa. What are
you talking about?

762
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,337
I tried. I tried to
put on the smile

763
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:58,883
and knuckle down
and make it work,

764
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:02,075
but maybe I can get a job in
LA, be where my husband is,

765
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,726
and Tuck...

766
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,913
Tuck's dad's never gonna let
me move him out of the city...

767
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:08,226
No, no, maybe I
can talk to him, right?

768
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,693
Maybe we can work something out.

769
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,462
Stop it. Stop it. You and
Tuck aren't going anywhere.

770
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,767
I don't want to
work here anymore.

771
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,040
It makes me feel small.

772
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,059
I have to make myself
smaller to work here.

773
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,761
I feel like if I do that,

774
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,975
I feel like I won't want
to look my son in the eye.

775
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,177
I don't recognize
this place anymore

776
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,583
or the people.

777
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,551
I don't want to hang
around long enough

778
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,709
that I don't recognize myself.

779
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:48,237
I've had some sucky jobs here,
but doing nothing sucks the worst.

780
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,606
Shh.

781
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,936
If his SATs stay above
93 for one more minute,

782
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,543
he's out of the woods.

783
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,600
I think it could work.

784
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:01,985
What can?

785
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:06,089
You know, people,
coworkers getting together.

786
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,601
I mean, don't judge
it from those lawyers.

787
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,053
They don't even like each other.

788
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:11,411
Look at Grey and Shepherd.

789
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,624
I mean, they tried to avoid it,

790
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,492
but it was like
fate or whatever.

791
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,283
They had to be together.

792
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,884
It was just right, you know?

793
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:22,189
That's beautiful.

794
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,541
You should write
poetry or greeting cards.

795
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,709
I'm just saying it could
work. Ten seconds.

796
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,623
You have a blog that I
could follow? Shut up.

797
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:32,215
You ever write poems about
horses, just pretty, pretty horses?

798
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,350
Shut up. Five...

799
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,571
Four, three, two...

800
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,656
One.

801
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,444
Yes. Yes.

802
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,793
Shh.

803
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,799
Oh, shut up.

804
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,748
I'm sorry? No, not you. Sorry.

805
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,440
April.

806
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,844
Tell him who you are.

807
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:06,484
If he doesn't get it, then
you don't need him anyway.

808
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,923
But I really like him, and...

809
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,792
I think if I tell him,
it's all gonna be over.

810
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,560
So wait...

811
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,059
A little while, let him
get to know you better.

812
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,984
Once he does, he's gonna
want to follow you anywhere.

813
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,573
Trust me.

814
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,178
Thank you.

815
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,034
I could marry you
again right now.

816
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,818
You're so hot when
you're nefarious. Hold on.

817
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:51,404
Arizona wants to
meet with all of us.

818
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:55,615
Where is our van?

819
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:57,128
Someone moved it. Why?

820
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:59,164
It's what vans are
for. Bailey's quitting.

821
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,037
What?

822
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,251
If this can happen, we need
to make this happen, fast.

823
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,775
Wait, wait. Are you in?

824
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,044
I'm in.

825
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:12,665
So what's the next step?

826
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:14,262
Well, we don't
have enough money.

827
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,185
We're gonna have to find
the rest somewhere else.

828
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,463
Can we do that in three days?

829
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,982
Two now. What about
Cristina, is she in?

830
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,205
I don't know now.

831
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,341
Well, ask her.

832
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,009
It's happening, tonight.

833
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,455
Pegasus wants to
move up the closing.

834
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,839
They want to buy
the hospital tonight.

835
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,157
What? DEREK: How do you know?

836
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,960
Owen told me. Well, did
you say anything to him?

837
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,218
No, I didn't say anything,
but we have to do it, for Owen.

838
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:33,669
We have to do this now.

839
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,617
Before tonight? We can't.
No, there's not enough time.

840
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,107
We have to stop them.

841
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,135
How? There's
nothing that we can do.

842
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,146
There's one thing we can do.

843
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:50,536
Hey!

844
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:51,688
Stop right there.

845
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,552
We're thrilled.

846
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:58,644
Very excited.

847
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,916
Shall we start?

848
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:05,501
First is the letter of intent.

849
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,470
Sign here. Initial here.

850
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,285
Oh, Dr. Shepherd.
Come in. We were just...

851
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,829
Sorry to interrupt. I'd like to
talk to Dr. Hunt for a second.

852
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:15,996
What's up?

853
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,231
Guys?

854
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,153
I'd like to tender
my resignation,

855
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,572
effective immediately.

856
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,074
Me, too. I quit.

857
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,229
I quit, too.

858
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,647
Me, too.

859
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,295
I quit, too.

860
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,034
He thinks we stabbed
him in the back.

861
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,525
Well, all we did
was buy some time

862
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,671
to slow down the sale so we
can come up with the money.

863
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:04,872
I know. I know.

864
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,341
All right, Stan says he
can meet with us now.

865
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,664
Okay, I'll go get my stuff.

866
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,344
Yeah, we get all our
stuff 'cause we just quit.

867
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,812
What about our patients?

868
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,413
We'll get 'em
covered by someone.

869
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,121
Dr. Shepherd,

870
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,951
this young man has
something to say to you.

871
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,257
Did you get them all?

872
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,592
Pretty much.

873
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:20,910
Good work, Ross. Go home.

874
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,503
Something's going on here.

875
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,607
What's going on?

876
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,492
You'll know soon.

877
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,157
Did you see the
look on his face?

878
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,009
Oh, Richard will be fine.

879
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,361
No, Owen.

880
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,098
This is wrong. I'm gonna go
talk to him. I have to explain.

881
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,049
No. Cristina, no.

882
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:03,269
It's the right thing
to do, for his sake.

883
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,772
When the time is
right, we'll tell him,

884
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,256
and he'll understand.

885
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,445
I don't know if he will.

886
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,604
Wait.

887
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,678
Nothing. Never mind. Sorry.

888
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,365
Okay, we should, um...

889
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:33,966
We should, though,

890
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:35,502
uh, stop.

891
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,903
Um...

892
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,691
Okay, there's something
I have to tell you.

893
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,028
And I don't want to,

894
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:48,681
'cause I think it might
be the last I see of you.

895
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,071
Oh...

896
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:55,455
This is... This is only
gonna go so far tonight.

897
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,557
God.

898
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,393
'Cause I am, uh...

899
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:03,730
Saving myself for marriage.

900
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:07,933
Oh, God.

901
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,370
Oh, dear God.

902
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,905
Yeah, I know.

903
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,073
It's, it's weird

904
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:15,319
and it's not something
you hear every day,

905
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,010
but it is something
that I believe in.

906
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,981
And I can completely understand
if you can't hang with that.

907
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,816
No. No, I can.

908
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,168
I can hang. I do.

909
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,705
I...

910
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,306
I am, too.

911
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:35,406
Are... Are you messing
with me right now?

912
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,462
'Cause...

913
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,164
No. No. No.

914
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,501
I am, too.

915
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,841
Only there's, um...

916
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,610
There's just this one thing.

917
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:55,214
What?

918
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,521
Nothing.

919
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:04,891
I am, too.

920
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,474
What the hell was that?

921
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:23,287
Did you know that they
were gonna pull that?

922
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,061
There's a way to salvage this.

923
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,763
Salvage what?

924
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,164
They withdrew the offer.

925
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,473
Losing those surgeons,
losing Shepherd,

926
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,872
completely changes
the value of the hospital.

927
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,359
You'd better do
something and fast.

928
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,782
I, um...

929
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:51,654
There's, there's no way

930
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,056
that we can replace
them. There's...

931
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,493
I can't reposition.

932
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,563
I can't find new buyers.

933
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,799
By tomorrow morning, the
whole industry will know.

934
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,434
I can't. I can't.

935
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,436
You have to. I can't.

936
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,673
You say this is
what you're good at.

937
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,254
It better be, because everyone
that I thought was in my corner

938
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,695
just walked out, and you
are all that I have now.

939
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:18,965
So either go and get Pegasus
back or find another buyer.

940
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,383
You say you trust me.
Then trust me when I say

941
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,870
you can do this,
because you have to.

942
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,824
<i>They say that
negotiation is an art form.</i>

943
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,079
<i>Yet, when we negotiate...</i>

944
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:36,482
His BP looks good.
His labs look great.

945
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:37,795
We'll watch him
closely overnight,

946
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,046
but I think he's
gonna be just fine.

947
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,381
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

948
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,455
<i>We have a strategy,
we use tactics.</i>

949
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,236
All right, can you please move
your fat head so I can get a look?

950
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,610
Tool.

951
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:51,998
That's gonna be fun.

952
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:54,901
I'm especially excited
for that kid's next 18 years.

953
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,380
Hey, you want to go get a beer?

954
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:59,072
Oh, I would love to,
especially after today,

955
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,242
but, um, I actually
already have plans.

956
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,976
Tomorrow night? Is that cool?

957
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,778
Yeah, that's cool. Okay.

958
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,059
Hey. Who is that guy? Hmm?

959
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,368
That is...

960
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,103
Chest Peckwell.

961
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,605
What?

962
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,852
It's not his real name. We just
called him that before we knew it.

963
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,608
OB resident.

964
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,606
Jo's been mooning over
the guy since he got here,

965
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,973
and she finally grew herself
a pair and asked him out.

966
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,480
Yay, Jo.

967
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,243
She didn't tell you about him?

968
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,366
Yeah, she did.

969
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,668
Okay.

970
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:33,940
<i>"Strategies" and "tactics"</i>

971
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:37,326
<i>aren't words we use for
seeking a compromise.</i>

972
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,961
Cristina!

973
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,281
Cristina!

974
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,684
Cristina!

975
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,681
<i>Those are words
for going to war.</i>

976
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,025
The first thing you'll need
to do is to form an LLC

977
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:53,125
so that you can legally get
all your funds from one place.

978
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,554
And you'll need a name
for your new corporation.

979
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,614
What did we just do?

980
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,194
Do you know what you'd
like to call yourselves?

981
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,035
How about The Bitter Pills?

982
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,104
Epic Failure?

983
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:05,487
Death Spiral?

984
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,290
Blind Leading the
Blind, Incorporated?

985
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,460
It could be anything.
Let's keep thinking.
