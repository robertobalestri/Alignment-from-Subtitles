1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,981
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,532
Dr. Grey, you were on a
plane. You were in a plane crash.

3
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:07,722
Where's Lexie?

4
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:08,935
My sister is dead.

5
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,637
They're taking us home
tomorrow on a plane.

6
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:13,162
That's why I told Bailey
to just sedate all of us.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,747
Cristina, please. Say
something, please.

8
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,251
I'm worried that you're
just running away.

9
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:20,618
Yeah, I am. I'm fleeing.

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,582
<i>And so should you, 'cause
horrible things happen here.</i>

11
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,573
No, something horrible happened,
and we should stick together.

12
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,786
<i>How is Yang, by the way?</i>

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,021
<i>Does she like Minnesota?</i>

14
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,122
<i>Who says I have to like him?</i>

15
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:30,495
<i>He's my sex friend.</i>

16
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,758
How'd it go with Dr. Thomas?

17
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,999
I respect you. You're
a historical landmark.

18
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,978
<i>It's been a while
since I've had anyone</i>

19
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,903
who cared enough
to give me grief.

20
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,006
He is my bestie. He's
my you here in Minnesota.

21
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,607
<i>They call you Medusa...</i>

22
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,027
<i>The serpent-haired monster
who turns folks to stone.</i>

23
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,206
I don't think that
you're a demon.

24
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,513
Focus on what you're doing.

25
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,709
Are you firing him?

26
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,983
<i>We can't fire him.</i>

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,445
We can force him
to retire, though.

28
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,119
It's okay if you're
not ready to fly.

29
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,348
I said I'd come. I'll be there.

30
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,100
She's not gonna get
on that plane, is she?

31
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,607
Probably not.

32
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:01,195
<i>You are my person. You
will always be my person.</i>

33
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,570
<i>Sometimes things are
simply out of your control.</i>

34
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,205
<i>You can't change them.</i>

35
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,218
<i>You can't bend
them to your will.</i>

36
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,677
<i>It doesn't matter if you're
already 45 minutes late,</i>

37
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,956
<i>if your hair isn't brushed,</i>

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,641
<i>and you haven't fixed breakfast,</i>

39
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,410
<i>and you're hemorrhaging
brain cells by the second</i>

40
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:24,899
<i>while you sit here...</i>

41
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,084
<i>Dying...</i>

42
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,586
<i>Dying inside.</i>

43
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,956
<i>Pee.</i>

44
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,242
<i>Pee. Just relax and pee.</i>

45
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,077
Did you do it?

46
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:38,464
Did you do a pee-pee
in the big-girl potty?

47
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,698
Potty.

48
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,502
Pee-pee in the potty.
Pee-pee in the potty.

49
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,321
<i>Please don't make
me strangle you.</i>

50
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,495
<i>I can't move.</i>

51
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:54,897
<i>I need to move,</i>

52
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:56,397
<i>but I can't.</i>

53
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,003
<i>I think I may be
frozen to this spot.</i>

54
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,157
<i>Literally frozen.</i>

55
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,961
I could stay.

56
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,462
Keep you warm.

57
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,679
Do you like being the big
spoon or the little spoon?

58
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>I am not a spoon.</i>

59
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,784
<i>I'm a knife, and I'm gonna
stab you in the eyeball.</i>

60
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,908
You know, I think I'm gonna
try and get some sleep.

61
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,876
Oh... You sure?

62
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,577
<i>I can't look at you.</i>

63
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,079
I'm sure.

64
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,074
<i>I can't look at you either.</i>

65
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,442
Okay, please tell me
you're as miserable as I am?

66
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,145
We are potty training,
and I am wearing an apron.

67
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,947
No, I'm happy as can be.

68
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,832
My coat doubles
as a sleeping bag.

69
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,301
Here you go, Zo.

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,769
Hi, Zozo.

71
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,350
Now don't forget to tell
mommy if you have to go pee.

72
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,473
Okay?

73
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,952
It's all about the layers, Mer.

74
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,720
Good morning. How are you?

75
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,877
Morning!

76
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,623
We sure got a nice
fresh snowfall last night.

77
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,992
Sure did! Have a good one.

78
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,264
You too!

79
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,499
Who is that?

80
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,112
Just me being neighborly.
I'm neighborly now.

81
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,847
Oh, no. I think she just...

82
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,415
Did you just pee on me?

83
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,483
I think she just peed on me.

84
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,801
See, you have a fake voice, too.

85
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,437
Well, I'm using it on a
child. You're supposed to.

86
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,222
You know what? Tell her
she's got to get her act together

87
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,079
or she'll never be on
the Supreme Court.

88
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,731
She's gotta buck up.

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,977
Excuse me?

90
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,317
Buck up. All right.
It's a Minnesota thing.

91
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,319
We don't wallow
in our self-pity.

92
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,821
We're... We're tough.

93
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,890
We're friendly.

94
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,908
We're...

95
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,494
My car is buried under
a mountain of snow.

96
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,830
<i>Buck up.</i>

97
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,165
I hate you.

98
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,301
Okay, I'm almost ready.

99
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,631
Hi. Hey. Hi.

100
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,283
So she needs a change... Uh-huh.

101
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,572
And I am late.

102
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,319
Okay. Well, Daddy's
gonna take a train today

103
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:48,554
to give a boring paper to
a bunch of boring people.

104
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,078
Zola, your daddy's my hero.

105
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,457
I love you. Bye.

106
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,726
I'll see you in a
couple days. Oop.

107
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,182
All right.

108
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,717
I forgot the fish sticks.

109
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,302
What for?

110
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,282
Oh, it's, uh, Multicultural
Day at preschool.

111
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,440
We're Brazil. I
burned the first batch.

112
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,552
All right. I'll see you later.

113
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,696
Okay, bye.

114
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,490
Say "Goodbye, Mama."
Say "Goodbye, Mama."

115
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,159
Bye-bye, Mama. I know. I know.

116
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,164
Well, you're in a mood.

117
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,984
My car is buried under
a mountain of snow.

118
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,452
Don't get crumbs
on the upholstery.

119
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,741
Oh, you brought me a Danish.

120
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,677
Don't get
emotional. Just eat it.

121
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,226
You're going to need
your strength. Here.

122
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,046
Oh! A complete vascular ring.

123
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,403
And a huge aneurysm.

124
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,622
Biggest aneurysm
I have ever seen.

125
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,258
Considering how old you
are, that is saying something.

126
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,171
Now if you're gonna
start talking like that,

127
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,391
I'm going to get someone
else to scrub in with me.

128
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,215
This is ours?

129
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,666
Still in a mood?

130
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,313
Oh, thank you, God. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you.

131
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,570
Hey, hey, hey, I'm
trying to drive here.

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,422
Sorry, Dad.

133
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,924
That ginormous
thing is in my body?

134
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,726
Yes.

135
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,673
It formed because of a
congenital heart defect,

136
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,408
so it's been there a long time.

137
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,394
We'll need to
perform two surgeries.

138
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,546
The first one will
repair the aneurysm.

139
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,637
And the second will
deal with the defect

140
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,746
to prevent another
aneurysm from forming.

141
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,473
Wow.

142
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,020
And we thought we
were ready for everything.

143
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,388
All right, this is nothing.

144
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,906
We're prepared for
a nuclear holocaust.

145
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,597
This is just a few
days in the hospital.

146
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,483
Are we expecting a
nuclear holocaust?

147
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,151
No, we're trained for disasters.

148
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,387
Are you EMTs?

149
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,000
No, we're... Will.

150
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,024
What? These are my doctors,

151
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,852
and I don't want them
to think we're crazy.

152
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,443
Hey, we're not crazy.

153
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,497
We're doomsday preppers,
ready for the apocalypse.

154
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,581
Ah.

155
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,933
You think we're crazy.

156
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,345
No. No, no.

157
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,514
Look, we're not, like,
Mayan calendar nut jobs.

158
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,898
We're preparing
for the real stuff.

159
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,234
Ozone depletion, global warming,

160
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,435
melting ice caps.

161
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,777
We met at a workshop
on making bug-out bags.

162
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,545
Dare I ask?

163
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,930
They're survival backpacks.

164
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:24,166
You should really have
one or several, actually.

165
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,950
One in the home
and one in the car.

166
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,130
So your surgery
will be this afternoon.

167
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,833
We just need to run some
scans, and then we'll be all set.

168
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,823
Okay. That's okay, babe.

169
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,172
Small doses of radiation prepare
your body for ozone depletion.

170
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,463
I guess it's my lucky day.

171
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,299
It's huge. I e-mailed it to you.

172
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,823
Look at my giant aneurysm

173
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,635
and marvel at the
gift Thomas gave me.

174
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,992
I can't. I'm driving.

175
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:52,989
Besides, I'm jealous. You
have a new best friend.

176
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,279
I really do.

177
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,592
I might love him more than you.

178
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,726
I'm happy for the both of you.

179
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,383
And I get two
surgeries out of it,

180
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,092
'cause she has a
complete vascular ring.

181
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,436
Imagine your good luck.

182
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,465
Oh, are you still being
a bitter working mother?

183
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,590
I am. I have pee on my shoe.

184
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,508
You're a doctor.
Can't you call it urine?

185
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,744
Because "urine on my
shoe" is more appealing?

186
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,830
I need help!

187
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,024
Oh, there's an accident.

188
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,682
Is it bad? It
doesn't look like it.

189
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:19,687
I gotta go.

190
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,494
I'm fine. There was a
woman on a bicycle.

191
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,635
I think I hit her. I
heard my tire blow.

192
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,102
Hurry! Someone call 9-1-1.

193
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,365
I'll do it. I'll call.

194
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,900
She's being crushed under there.

195
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,223
Does anybody know CPR?

196
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,759
Can you hear me?

197
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,577
I'm a doctor. What's your name?

198
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,413
Melissa.

199
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,815
I can't breathe.

200
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,062
Okay, Melissa, we're gonna
get you outta here. Okay?

201
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,999
I'm a doctor. She can't breathe.

202
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,567
We gotta get
this car off of her.

203
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:55,868
I'm on with 9-1-1 and
they say don't move her.

204
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,620
The paramedics are on the way.

205
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,488
She can't breathe! She
will die before they get here.

206
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,525
Look, I don't wanna be
responsible if she's paralyzed.

207
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,348
Don't you see she's
dying under there?

208
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,184
Do you wanna be
responsible for that?

209
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,675
I need someone to
help me move this car.

210
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,076
Is anybody gonna help me?

211
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,770
Is anybody gonna help me?

212
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,740
Come on, guys. We got this.

213
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,599
Ready, guys. Okay,
everyone on three.

214
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,867
We got this, okay? Here we go.

215
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,837
One, two, three.

216
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,156
Come on!

217
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,402
Just a little higher.

218
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,436
Okay, let me help you.

219
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,927
Okay, easy, easy. Okay!

220
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,463
She's out.

221
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,398
Oh, she's blue.

222
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,950
Come on, damn it. Breathe.

223
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,585
Come on. Breathe.

224
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,086
<i>Breathe.</i>

225
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,922
<i>Breathe, damn it.</i>

226
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,610
<i>Oh, she's alive.</i>

227
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,111
<i>She's alive.</i>

228
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,714
<i>She's alive.</i>

229
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,754
Dr. Yang.

230
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,634
I hope you got some shut-eye.

231
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,092
A gastropericardial
fistula came into the ER,

232
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,105
and I'd like you to join me.

233
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,596
Uh, with a pneumopericardium?

234
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,741
A huge one.

235
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,699
Did you do a pericardial
decompression?

236
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,300
Just about to.

237
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,238
I can't. I'm scrubbing
in with Thomas.

238
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,606
Cristina...

239
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,311
I'm offering you a
gastropericardial fistula.

240
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,113
Chocolate? Pretzels?
No. Chocolate.

241
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,049
Dr. Yang.

242
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,767
Sorry. Not available.

243
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,867
Wilson, I've got
cyclist versus auto.

244
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,357
Multiple crush injuries.

245
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,037
I need you to call upstairs.

246
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,872
Tell them we need a trauma
OR. Open, and get Ross.

247
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,062
He's on my service.

248
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,976
You, I need you
to go get my car.

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,693
It's at the intersection
of Fourth and Pike.

250
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,696
In the backseat, there's
a box of frozen fish sticks.

251
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,715
Grab 'em, nuke 'em,
bring 'em up to daycare

252
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,071
for Brazil day.

253
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,217
Grey, you know you
just stole my intern?

254
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,341
Sorry.

255
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,288
It's interesting how
crazy you can be

256
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,756
and still comb your hair.

257
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,113
I find her delightful.

258
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,781
Yeah?

259
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,861
You got a bug-out bag
in that big ol' car of yours?

260
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,702
I have no desire to
survive Armageddon.

261
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:24,472
When the big one
hits, I want to go quickly.

262
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,717
Huh.

263
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,453
You didn't mention your surgery

264
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:30,077
was an aneurysm the
size of a honeycrisp.

265
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,024
It's an apple, the state fruit.

266
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,316
I don't recall mentioning
this surgery to you at all.

267
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,702
Dr. Yang, could I talk to you?

268
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,205
That aneurysm
is a disaster area.

269
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,062
We have a solid surgical plan.

270
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:50,176
Let me assign the
surgery to somebody else.

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,382
No.

272
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,062
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

273
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,386
Maybe you pity Thomas.

274
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,466
Maybe you actually
like him. Hell, I like him.

275
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,701
He's a great old guy.

276
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,225
But there's nothing to
gain by working with him.

277
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,310
Nothing.

278
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,679
There is, actually.

279
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,951
Suction.

280
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,031
There's a lot of blood.
Suction keeps clogging up.

281
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,816
Adjust the angle.
Lower your hand.

282
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,618
Ross, let's run the small bowel.

283
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,925
How do I do that again?

284
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,437
Just take them in your
hands, look for injuries,

285
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:19,744
nice and slow.

286
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,530
Hey, I just dropped
Sofia off at daycare.

287
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,293
Did you remember it
was Multicultural Day?

288
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,101
Yeah. I made fish sticks.

289
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,679
Ugh, I signed up for
plantains and I totally forgot.

290
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,499
I'm sure no one will notice.

291
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,991
Yeah, well, Mark always
kept track of that stuff.

292
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,743
Okay, the break is
near the femoral artery.

293
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:36,906
Ooh, she's losing
a lot of blood?

294
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,212
Um, yeah.

295
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,414
Suction.

296
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,714
I'm trying.

297
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,827
Okay, Wilson, just get in there

298
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,928
and scoop it out
with your hands.

299
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,652
Just scoop it out.

300
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,104
Just get right in there.

301
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,275
This would go faster
if I used scissors.

302
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,726
Well, when the tissue
is this thin and friable,

303
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:56,230
I find the fingers are easier
to isolate the anatomy.

304
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,476
Oh, there you go.

305
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,911
Okay, I've located
the insertion point

306
00:11:58,935 --> 00:11:59,996
in the carotid.

307
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,252
Ah, Dr. Parker.

308
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,621
Two visits in one
day. What a treat.

309
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,685
Well, it's my job to
ensure my department

310
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,219
is working to the
highest standard.

311
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,509
Oh, nonsense.

312
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,646
You want the front-row
seat to my inevitable demise.

313
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,114
I hope you'll forgive
me if I disappoint.

314
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:17,502
Dr. Yang, are we ready to
bypass to the subclavian?

315
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,982
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

316
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,090
Did the aneurysm
blow? Hold pressure.

317
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,537
I'm trying to. I'm trying to.

318
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,472
The hole's getting bigger.
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

319
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,446
Watch your language, Dr. Yang.

320
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,249
I run a respectable OR. Clamp.

321
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,662
Dr. Yang, I suggest
you get one, too.

322
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,214
Put her on bypass.
You need time to...

323
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:37,438
Listen to me.
Dr. Yang will tell you

324
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,491
that I have been doing this
since the Jurassic Period.

325
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,954
We'll have this done in a jiffy.

326
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,662
That's it. I'm scrubbing in.

327
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,064
Clamp on.

328
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,799
Let's go, Dr. Yang.
Time's a-wasting.

329
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,715
Okay. The liver's
exsanguinating.

330
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,717
Ross, suction. Wilson,
grab a clamp for this.

331
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,768
Right away. Which
one should I ask for?

332
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,275
Debakey.

333
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,738
Uh, good news. We tracked down

334
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:01,073
the young woman's
parents in Toronto.

335
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,374
They're getting
the first flight.

336
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,692
Suction, and let's
hang more blood.

337
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,616
That one makes 57.

338
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,129
Grey, we've replaced her
entire volume of blood four times.

339
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,504
I got this. More laps.

340
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,751
It might be time to
pack her and let her rest.

341
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,070
Looks like you're at a point
of diminishing returns, Grey.

342
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,171
There's a limit to how
much this patient can take.

343
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,674
She was crushed by
two tons of twisted metal.

344
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,176
That's a lot of
trauma for the body.

345
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,366
I know.

346
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,051
I know exactly how much
trauma that is for a body.

347
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,171
I'm not doing
damage control here.

348
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,985
I'm not gonna pack her
up and hope for the best.

349
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,009
I need you to stop.

350
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,153
She needs an intact liver.

351
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,404
Meredith, just take a second.

352
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,279
I am trying to save her life.

353
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,497
Hands off the patient. Now.

354
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,556
Grey.

355
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,997
Let's pack her up.

356
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,359
That was a train wreck in there.

357
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,895
We saved her life.

358
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,191
That aneurysm could have blown

359
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,809
no matter what we
did. You know that.

360
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,910
You should've listened to me

361
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,751
when I suggested
that you put her on...

362
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,186
You walk into my OR

363
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,798
in the middle of a surgery

364
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,301
and try to backseat drive?

365
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,735
I'm trying to help you, Craig.

366
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,877
I'm not Craig. I'm Dr. Thomas.

367
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,613
And I don't need
or want your help.

368
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,480
Dr. Thomas, you're a
danger to our patients.

369
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,670
I need to see a patient.

370
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,966
Surrender your license.

371
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,784
Go out gracefully. It's time.

372
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,442
I will not step down.

373
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,195
Okay. You want to go that
way, we can go that way.

374
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:44,282
Starting today, I sign off
on every patient you see,

375
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,417
every scan, every Band-Aid.

376
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,725
Talk to him.

377
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,161
Please.

378
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,814
So her liver has been packed.

379
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,339
The next 24 hours are crucial.

380
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,108
Monitor her closely.

381
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,977
Um...

382
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,525
Meredith, do you have a moment?

383
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,743
Do you want me to
take point on this?

384
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,362
On my patient? No.

385
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,473
Meredith, I'm concerned that...

386
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,826
This may be hitting a
little too close to home.

387
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,495
I mean, after what you've
been through, what...

388
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,496
What happened
with your sister...

389
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,199
Same injuries, same age.

390
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:53,768
What's your point?

391
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:58,039
Emotions might be
clouding your judgment.

392
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,841
They're not.

393
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:07,494
Excuse me. I have to
go check on my patient.

394
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,957
What happens now?

395
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,577
The next few hours are critical.

396
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,279
When she wakes up,

397
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,025
if she can speak and
move her arms and legs,

398
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,060
then we'll know she
got good blood flow

399
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,352
and that the grafts held.

400
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,354
I'm sorry... Uh...

401
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,289
Flowers aren't
allowed in the CCU.

402
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,725
We have a seed bank
in case, you know,

403
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,861
it all goes to hell.

404
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,879
We have every grain

405
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,081
and every fruit and
vegetable you need.

406
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,521
Katy was like, "What
about the flowers, Will?

407
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,727
"If the world is ending, I'm
gonna want something beautiful."

408
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,227
You know, I'll put
them just outside.

409
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,691
She can see them
from there. Okay?

410
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,627
This is my fault.

411
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,295
The aneurysm would've blown

412
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,113
no matter whose
hands were on it.

413
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:14,593
Her vessels are cotton candy.

414
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,128
I know, but Parker
wouldn't have given

415
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,363
that surgery a second thought

416
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:18,463
if I wasn't in there with you.

417
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,204
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

418
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,507
That man has been after
my hide for a long time.

419
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,695
Probation is one step
away from being fired.

420
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,610
You know, I find
it a little unseemly

421
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,413
to worry about my
employment prospects

422
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,850
when there's a woman's
life hanging in the balance.

423
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,652
Come on. I'm gonna
give you a ride home.

424
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,421
We have another
surgery tomorrow.

425
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,022
You need your sleep.

426
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,164
It's going to be fine.

427
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,611
Thomas made me leave my patient.

428
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,978
Now she's gonna
die, and he'll be fired.

429
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,536
Well, I'm leaving
my patient, too.

430
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,137
I have to pick Zola
up from daycare,

431
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,016
and Derek's out of
town so it has to be fine.

432
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,084
It's not gonna be fine.

433
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,541
She's surrounded by interns.

434
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,210
That's one of the signs,
Meredith, like locusts

435
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,057
or the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

436
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,292
Well, except there's
only three of them

437
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,316
and it's one night.

438
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,716
You need a bug-out bag.

439
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,850
What's that?

440
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,363
Like a diaper bag for adults.

441
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,431
I'm making mine right now.

442
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,721
Well, what do you have so far?

443
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,833
Tequila.

444
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,668
Well, that's a good
start. What else?

445
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,559
Well, the sign of a
well-packed diaper bag

446
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,328
is backups in case you run out.

447
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,363
- So more tequila?
- I am out

448
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,698
trying to have one night,

449
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,245
and my intern decides to
close my patient's wound,

450
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,329
an infected wound,

451
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,720
which I left open to heal.

452
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:28,088
Dumbass, over-eager,
barely-out-of-med-school child!

453
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,140
I'm staying.

454
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,609
I'm going back.

455
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,116
Hi. Hi.

456
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,388
Hey, cutie pie.

457
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:40,217
I gotta run. My interns
are with my patient.

458
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,069
There's extra
clothes in the bag.

459
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,822
Okay. Okay.

460
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,019
Hey.

461
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,643
No, no, no. No.

462
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,306
No, don't do that to yourself.

463
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,008
It's good for her
to see you work.

464
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,326
It is good for her
to see you achieve.

465
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,835
Yes. That's how she'll
become CEO one day.

466
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,687
Yeah? 'Cause mommy
works. That's good.

467
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,375
Okay. I owe you one.

468
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,987
My first surgery's at 10:00.

469
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,639
I'll just drop her off
at daycare with Sofia.

470
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,663
Okay. Bye.

471
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,450
Well, can't you just give
your sex friend more sex

472
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,020
in exchange for not
firing your old man friend?

473
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,421
Ew, I'm not a prostitute.

474
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,875
Besides, I thought of that.
It's just way too much sex.

475
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,611
She is barely hanging on.

476
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,446
Should I take her
back into surgery?

477
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,780
What does Webber think?

478
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,609
He thinks I'm too
emotional to handle this.

479
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,585
Vitals check.

480
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:32,920
Okay.

481
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,455
Are you still there?

482
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,746
Yeah. Why are you whispering?

483
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,055
Granola guy's asleep.

484
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,718
He brought his own hemp pillow.

485
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,456
Stable over here. You?

486
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,191
Stable-ish.

487
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,029
Maybe we should
try to get some sleep.

488
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,418
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.

489
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,869
Yeah. Me neither.

490
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,637
You know what we need?

491
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,247
What?

492
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,941
A 30-second dance party.

493
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,509
Okay.

494
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,812
I'm too tired.

495
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,447
Yeah, me, too.

496
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,724
You do it. Uh-uh.

497
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,063
Dr. Yang!

498
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,243
MEREDITH AND
CRISTINA: <i>Please be alive.</i>

499
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,477
<i>Please be alive.
Please be alive.</i>

500
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,533
Good news.

501
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,602
Ms. Doomsday is doing great.

502
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,318
While you were getting
your beauty sleep,

503
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,842
a lot has happened.

504
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,494
Katy, why don't
you fill in Dr. Yang?

505
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,663
Although she hasn't
had her coffee yet,

506
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,900
so maybe just give
her the broad strokes.

507
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,336
You guys are gonna go
ahead with my second surgery

508
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:56,405
this afternoon.

509
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,505
Dr. Yang will
start to prep you...

510
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,907
As soon as she
brushes her teeth.

511
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,890
She needs another surgery
to take out the packing

512
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,224
and check for more bleeding,

513
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:07,476
but right now she
would never survive it.

514
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
So what do we do?

515
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,661
There's a perfect window.

516
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,795
We have to correct her acidosis

517
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,997
and her hypothermia

518
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,565
and make sure her
coags are stable.

519
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:14,689
And until then?

520
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,770
Until then, we have to
try and keep her alive.

521
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,544
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.

522
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,497
I have surgery in ten minutes.
I tried leaving her in daycare,

523
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,798
but she's running
a little fever.

524
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,233
No big deal. I'm sure
she's just teething.

525
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,423
But they won't take her

526
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,835
if she hasn't been
fever-free for 24 hours.

527
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,091
Did I mention I have surgery?

528
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,110
In ten minutes. I'm sorry.

529
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,497
Dr. Grey, the patient's BP
just plummeted to 70 over 50.

530
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,300
Crap. Edwards.

531
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,735
No, I... No.

532
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,770
I did your fish stick
drop. I valeted your car.

533
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,150
I am here to practice medicine.

534
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,873
Great. Monitor her temp.

535
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,237
If it gets above 101, give her
a teaspoon of acetaminophen

536
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,455
and push fluids.

537
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,640
Her sippy cup is
in the bag. Bye, Zo.

538
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,164
Bye-bye.

539
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,376
This is a bad idea.

540
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,012
Parker will never
sign off on this surgery.

541
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:01,551
I can't tell you

542
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,689
how strenuously I object to
your extracurricular gymnastics

543
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,957
with that man.

544
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,927
He's making you
conventional and skittish.

545
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,345
You know, condoms
don't protect against that.

546
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,048
How did...

547
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:15,427
You were the first
one to point out,

548
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,795
I've been around a long time.

549
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,119
Now Katy is awake,
she's speaking,

550
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,804
she's moving her extremities.

551
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:21,972
Yes, but...

552
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,874
The repair worked, so
why put her in danger

553
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,093
of another
life-threatening aneurysm?

554
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,402
Well, what about Parker?

555
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:30,297
I spend very little
time thinking about him.

556
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,678
Can I assume that's
your child I hear

557
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:46,947
wailing outside those doors?

558
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,616
Well, she has a fever,

559
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,796
and Derek is out of town,
and I have this patient...

560
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,087
Dr. Grey, you know why men
think they can run the world

561
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,155
and women can't?

562
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,556
Because of crying babies.

563
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,103
I was hoping no
one would hear it.

564
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,293
Uh, we can all hear it.

565
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,862
I can hear it.

566
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,631
Dr. Ross out there can hear it.

567
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,833
Only difference is, the
crying doesn't affect him.

568
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,335
But you and I are
genetically predisposed

569
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:10,804
to respond to crying babies.

570
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,173
It's pulling your focus.

571
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,154
It's gonna be fine.
I'm almost done.

572
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,845
Okay, this is about
world domination.

573
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:21,181
If we're going to take over,
we need to have our babies

574
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,184
crying somewhere
other than the ICU.

575
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,099
Dr. Yang, could you go
over the risks of the surgery

576
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,389
one last time?

577
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,436
Will, Dr. Thomas went
over all of it already.

578
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,728
I could die or
turn into a potato

579
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,531
or start leaking unicorn
poop out of my ears.

580
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,250
I signed the scary paper
already. I'm doing it.

581
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,681
He also said that you
could live with this condition

582
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,025
for years without
another aneurysm.

583
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,890
Right?

584
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,459
Yes.

585
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,945
Last night, I didn't know
if you'd even wake up.

586
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:56,249
And now I know what the
end of the world feels like,

587
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,363
and I don't want
to feel that again.

588
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,519
You want me to live

589
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,005
with a sword hanging
over my head every day,

590
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,109
afraid to hiccup because I
might blow an aneurysm?

591
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,695
That's not living,
and you know it.

592
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,997
We take action, Will.

593
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,932
We look disaster in the eye

594
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,384
and we do not shrink with fear.

595
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,537
Tell him, Dr. Yang.

596
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,846
Tell him it's
gonna be all right.

597
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,757
Scissors. Get the tube ready.

598
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:26,781
Got it.

599
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:28,131
Hey. I'm here.

600
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,378
Lung collapsed. I have
to do this chest tube.

601
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:30,802
I can keep her
till 3:00, but then

602
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,169
I've got a hernia repair.

603
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,715
Hey, Brooks, see if
Zola's temp is down

604
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,657
and if you can sweet talk
daycare into taking her back.

605
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:39,443
Okay. Got it. Tube
is in. Zero silk.

606
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,527
I'll just go get her.

607
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,073
Okay, don't forget
her diaper bag.

608
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:43,808
She's got extra
clothes in there, diapers.

609
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,410
The sippy cup is
in the side pocket,

610
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:47,195
and if she goes
pee-pee in the potty...

611
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,169
Meredith, I'm not gonna
potty train your kid.

612
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,354
Right. Okay. Sorry. Forget it.

613
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,556
Already did.

614
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,860
He's doing it, Mer.

615
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,044
He's doing the surgery.

616
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:58,891
And if he does
it, he'll get fired.

617
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,414
Yeah.

618
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:01,960
I need to figure out

619
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,363
the exact right time
to reopen my patient.

620
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,331
A month ago, this would've
been someone else's decision.

621
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,333
I was just a resident
along for the ride.

622
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,390
Now if I misjudge...

623
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:11,459
Yeah.

624
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:12,604
Doomsday.

625
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:13,693
Yeah.

626
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,563
You know what we need?

627
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,743
Dance party?

628
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,866
Nope.

629
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,634
We need to buck up.

630
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,770
Yep.

631
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Dr. Parker.

632
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,226
Ah, Dr. Yang.

633
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,089
You're a day late
and a dollar short.

634
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,624
I just had to reopen my
gastropericardial fistula...

635
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:35,582
You need to take
Dr. Thomas off probation.

636
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,265
I take it you weren't
able to convince him

637
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,400
to go gracefully?

638
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:42,489
Why would I?

639
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,052
He's a liability.
Because he's old?

640
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,255
No, because he habitually
undermines my authority.

641
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,173
Look, you were in
that OR yesterday.

642
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:49,474
Yeah, he saved
our patient's life.

643
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,775
He was insubordinate
and reckless.

644
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,766
He cut out her aneurysm
and interposed a graft

645
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,034
in under 30 minutes.

646
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,402
Now I can't do that. Can you?

647
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,570
There's no good reason...

648
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,516
Cristina, there is no
point in belaboring this.

649
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,123
It's done.

650
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,462
Then undo it.

651
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,097
Let him ride out his tenure.

652
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,794
Firing him would be
bad for the hospital

653
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,950
and bad for you.

654
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,821
Please, just let this slide.

655
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:20,361
Look, I know you're
in an awkward position,

656
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:23,297
and it's partly my fault
for sticking you with him.

657
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:25,243
You came in a little strong,

658
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,379
and I felt like I needed to
temper your overconfidence.

659
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,836
But he's holding you back.

660
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:32,265
And once he's
gone, you'll see that.

661
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:48,172
Okay, her temp is 96.
What were her last coags?

662
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,706
Her INR was 1.3,

663
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,409
and I tested her pH levels
two hours ago, and it was 7.29.

664
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,078
Okay, let's run 'em again.

665
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,749
Why the hell are you
sitting out in the cold?

666
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,407
Sun's out. Gotta take advantage.

667
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:11,578
Let me do the surgery
with someone else.

668
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,691
Dr. Yang...

669
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,314
Or go kiss his
ass. Play politics.

670
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,733
I don't think you understand
how serious he is.

671
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,148
There is a path that a
doctor walks in this hospital.

672
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,423
They begin by thinking
that I'm some sort of God.

673
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:26,455
Then they start to
worry that I'm insane.

674
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,913
And then they take
some comfort in the notion

675
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,449
that it's just senility.

676
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,897
I mean, we've gone from
"A" to "Z" in no time at all.

677
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
Yeah, well, if this goes south,

678
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,989
it could be the end for you.

679
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,790
So be it.

680
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,525
Maybe I'm ready.

681
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,405
Well, I'm not. You can't
leave me alone here.

682
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,990
Oh, we're talking
about you now, hmm?

683
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,292
You should've raised the flag.

684
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,626
I couldn't work
here without you.

685
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,931
You're afraid to fly.
You're not going anywhere.

686
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,971
Hey, it's not funny.

687
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,774
No, it isn't.

688
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,477
You love me more
than anybody has

689
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,046
in a very long time.

690
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,731
Look, if I'm going,

691
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,160
I want to go down fighting
for something that I believe in,

692
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:10,871
for this young woman's future,

693
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,407
and these women who
have so much to live for.

694
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:15,625
Come on.

695
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,293
You know I'm right.

696
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,274
You know that she
deserves this surgery.

697
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,618
And we're the
best team to do it.

698
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:44,822
So...

699
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,190
You decided to go back in.

700
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,960
This is my window. Her
pH and coags are good.

701
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,372
She'll never make it
through another day

702
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,677
if I don't stop this bleeding.

703
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,367
What?

704
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,037
Oh, nothing. I just, um...

705
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,505
Don't. Don't say it.

706
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,107
Say what?

707
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,653
This is nothing like what
happened in the woods.

708
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,077
We are in a hospital
with medical resources

709
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,449
that we could only
dream of having out there.

710
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,964
And I'm gonna use them

711
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,473
and try like hell to
save this girl's life

712
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,821
so when her family comes
I can tell them she's alive.

713
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,627
So don't say this is
Lexie. It's not Lexie.

714
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,797
Good luck.

715
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,850
That's all I was
gonna say. Good luck.

716
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:31,835
Oh.

717
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,103
Thank you.

718
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:35,856
And it's the right call,
bringing her back in.

719
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,909
I was gonna say that, too.

720
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,993
So we'll take the
packs out slowly

721
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,298
so that we can
look for the bleed.

722
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,452
Wait. It's 4:30.

723
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,132
I thought you were with Zola.

724
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,289
No, yeah, 4:00 to 5:00,
that's Dr. Kepner's shift.

725
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,586
Yeah, that was before
my surgery went long.

726
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,323
23-year-old with more
gallstones than I've ever seen.

727
00:29:58,347 --> 00:29:59,991
It's weird, right,
23-year-old with gallstones?

728
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,815
April, who has my daughter?

729
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,418
Um... 4:30... Jackson, I think.

730
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,019
April.

731
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,799
When I realized my
surgery was going long,

732
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:09,133
I sent my intern to make sure

733
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:10,235
that Alex could
take her for longer,

734
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:11,820
but he couldn't push
his surgery again,

735
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,176
so he left her with Ted,

736
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,823
so I was just about to
go relieve him right now.

737
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,209
Unless Jackson got there
first. His shift was after mine so...

738
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,598
Who's Ted?

739
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,818
Nurse Ted from the ER.

740
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,548
And I can tell by
the look on your face

741
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,915
that you don't know who Ted is.

742
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,379
Um, don't worry about it.
I'm going there right now.

743
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:28,682
Zola will be fine. Okay?

744
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,371
Ross, follow her.
Do not leave her side

745
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,940
until my daughter is
physically in her arms.

746
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,463
On it.

747
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,200
Ready, Dr. Yang?

748
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,735
Ready, sir.

749
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,848
Scissors. WOMAN: Here you go.

750
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,192
Wire cutters. Wire cutters.

751
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,216
Balfour retractor.
Here you go, Doctor.

752
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,617
Sternal retractor.

753
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,603
Retractor. Here you go.

754
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,954
These vessels are so fragile.

755
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,757
Let's go gently.

756
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,853
You're gonna have to suction
like your life depends on it.

757
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,938
If your hands move even a
centimeter without my say,

758
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,229
she's gonna bleed out.
Where's my suction?

759
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,394
I'm trying, but there's a
lot of bleeding over here.

760
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,195
Okay, keep trying,
Wilson. Wilson, hold still.

761
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,519
I thought I was.

762
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,454
Ross, are you
sure my kid's okay?

763
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,401
It's like Camp Zola in
the attendings lounge.

764
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,737
She was smashing gummy
worms into her face when I left.

765
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,521
Who's letting her
have gummy worms?

766
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,968
You're right. It doesn't matter.

767
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:44,017
Get in here and help
retract. I need more visibility.

768
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,102
If this continues
to go this well,

769
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,038
I'm prepared to
put your name first.

770
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,807
When we publish?
That's big of you.

771
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,009
It is.

772
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,789
You know what? You
need it more than I do.

773
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,257
This could be your
last journal article.

774
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,997
Is that your version
of "thank you"?

775
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,111
No, it's my version
of, "This is the end.

776
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:01,979
"Get while the getting's good."

777
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,203
Thank God I never had
children. They'd be just like you.

778
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,642
I'd have drowned them
like puppies in the river.

779
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,044
Oh, come on. I'm
your dream come true.

780
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:14,197
That is the truth.

781
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,102
You're gonna make me gag.

782
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,222
BP's dropping.

783
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,424
This is really a lot of blood.

784
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,126
Who moved?

785
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,445
Somebody moved. Say it now.

786
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,549
I did.

787
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,111
Just a little. I'm sorry.

788
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,647
It's okay. It actually helps.

789
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,671
It means the bleeder's
in the retroperitoneum.

790
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,956
Okay, now literally this time,

791
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,708
nobody move.

792
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,276
Don't be crass.

793
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,112
Women of your generation
think they have to be crass

794
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,114
or no one will
believe their strength.

795
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,934
You're fighting a battle
that women of my generation

796
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,669
have already fought for you

797
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,472
so you could have the
grace to appreciate their work

798
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,524
and move on to something else.

799
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,059
Yeah, I'm still gagging.

800
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,504
You know what? These
sutures aren't holding.

801
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,123
Can I have another
4-0 Prolene, please?

802
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,913
BP is really down.

803
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,381
I'm well aware of that.

804
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,610
Stop looking at the monitors

805
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,068
and just help me
find this bleed.

806
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,620
Watch your dissection

807
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,117
and don't hold your breath.

808
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,734
Now you're gonna tell
me when to breathe?

809
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,353
Renal vessels are clear.

810
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:16,642
Damn it. Keep retracting.

811
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,445
You hold your breath
when you stitch.

812
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,980
When you stop breathing,
you stop thinking.

813
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,282
It's a mistake.

814
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,449
Now what?

815
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,784
Hang on.

816
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,752
I'm breathing.

817
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:27,853
Slowly.

818
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,972
Not like an anxious hyena.

819
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,920
Freeze. Keep your
hands where they are.

820
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,062
We have to find the
source or she's dead.

821
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,088
Okay, do not panic. Don't panic.

822
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,123
My name will be first.

823
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,709
Saw that coming a mile away.

824
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,462
You will be the surgeon
of your generation.

825
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,997
I knew it as soon as I met you.

826
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,750
People will try to diminish
you as they did me,

827
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,352
and they will fail.

828
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,388
I would like it to be known
in the medical community

829
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,024
that I helped train you.

830
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:05,108
Hmm?

831
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,282
Okay. Your name first.

832
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,714
Found it. Clamp.

833
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,182
Tiny tear in the external iliac.

834
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,850
Whew.

835
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,292
Okay, does anybody
know what we do now?

836
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,461
Ligate the artery. Nope.

837
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,090
Replace the clamp with a patch.

838
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,114
Nope.

839
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,866
Then what?

840
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,601
30-second dance party.

841
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,274
Dance or you're fired.

842
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,854
That clamp's coming
up. Can you adjust it?

843
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,875
Can you reach it, Pops?

844
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,646
Dr. Thomas?

845
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,266
Dr. Thomas?

846
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,087
Thomas! Dr. Thomas.
I need another clamp.

847
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,750
Move! Move! Move!
Someone get to him.

848
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:00,901
What's going on? I
don't have a pulse.

849
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,341
Get a crash cart. Right away.

850
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,305
Grab his clamp. Damn
it. I need a better angle.

851
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,329
Switching sides. WOMAN
2: Let's get an IV set up.

852
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,881
Get gowned and gloved.

853
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,666
What's happening?

854
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,179
Are the paddles on?
- He's in v-fib.

855
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,997
Charging. Shock
him. Charge to 200.

856
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,249
We're on it. Clear.

857
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,152
Nothing. What the...

858
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,686
He collapsed in the
middle of surgery.

859
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,787
We already shocked him once.

860
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,022
- Charge to 300.
- Charging.

861
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,423
Why is this surgery
even happening?

862
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,725
Don't worry about
that right now.

863
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,815
Clear!

864
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,977
Nothing. Go again.

865
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,179
Charging. Is there a pulse?

866
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:29,247
Clear!

867
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,711
Parker, is there a pulse?

868
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,092
Someone tell me what's going on.

869
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,857
Starting CPR.

870
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,909
Deal with your
patient, Cristina.

871
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:37,421
<i>Don't hold your breath.</i>

872
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,596
<i>You stop thinking
when you stop breathing.</i>

873
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,683
<i>Breathe. Please, God.</i>

874
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,819
<i>Breathe.</i>

875
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:58,898
Oh, God.

876
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,277
Please don't tell
me that she's...

877
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,484
She's okay.

878
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,987
Katy has a strong heart.

879
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,190
She should have a
long life ahead of her,

880
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,558
a long, long life.

881
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:09,926
Thank you.

882
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,364
Thank you.

883
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,602
She's okay.

884
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,479
<i>Breathe, Dr. Yang.</i>

885
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,848
<i>Don't be crass.</i>

886
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,182
<i>You're skulking.</i>

887
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:42,325
<i>Women of your
generation are graceless.</i>

888
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,011
<i>It's an affront to nature.</i>

889
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,038
<i>Mediocre surgeons will see you</i>

890
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,959
<i>and feel themselves
wilting in your shadow.</i>

891
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,279
<i>Do not shrink to console them.</i>

892
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,096
<i>Do not look for friends here.</i>

893
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,265
<i>You won't find them.</i>

894
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:25,602
<i>None of these people have
the capacity to understand you.</i>

895
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,505
<i>They never will.</i>

896
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,342
<i>If you're lucky,</i>

897
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,912
<i>one day when you're
old and shriveled like me,</i>

898
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,940
<i>you will find a young doctor</i>

899
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,484
<i>with little regard for
anything but their craft.</i>

900
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,887
<i>And you'll train them
like I trained you.</i>

901
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,924
<i>Until then, read a good book.</i>

902
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,660
<i>You have greatness in you, Yang.</i>

903
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,929
<i>Don't disappoint.</i>

904
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,040
Oh, my God. Where is she?

905
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,558
Who has Zola?

906
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,933
Ah!

907
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:16,286
There she is. There's your mama.

908
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,104
Kepner had to scrub
in on a colectomy

909
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:20,406
so I took her, right?

910
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:21,740
Hi.

911
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,306
You look like you're
feeling much better.

912
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,696
Mmm-hmm. Well, we
read <i>Goodnight Moon</i>

913
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,298
a couple times, didn't we?

914
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,035
And then you tried to show
me how to play patty-cake, right?

915
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,304
And it turns out, Uncle
Owen is pretty terrible at that.

916
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,473
Oh, and her fever broke
a couple hours ago.

917
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,625
Uh, 99.2 last time I checked.

918
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,927
Dr. Grey! Dr. Grey!

919
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,213
Is she crashing?

920
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,081
Melissa's asking for you.

921
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:47,950
Go, go. I don't need
to be anywhere.

922
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,501
Okay. Bye, Zozo.

923
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,020
Say bye. Say bye.

924
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,388
Hey, you, what we gonna do?

925
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,824
We're gonna do
high fives. Patty-cake.

926
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,926
Patty-cake,
patty-cake, patty-cake.

927
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,866
Melissa.

928
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,051
Meet Dr. Grey.

929
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:07,687
Hi.

930
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,538
Hi.

931
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,993
I...

932
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,546
don't know how
much you remember.

933
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,467
I was trapped...

934
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:23,403
Under something.

935
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,272
And you were there.

936
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,194
You were there, right?

937
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:34,663
I was. I...

938
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,508
Thank you. WOMAN:
Thank you, Doctor.

939
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,945
What's this?

940
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,731
My list of Tucker-tested
babysitters.

941
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,518
You need a deeper
bench, Dr. Grey.

942
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,836
You're an attending now,

943
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:58,148
you never know when
a crisis is gonna happen,

944
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,623
and this is gold.

945
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,374
I don't give it out
to just anyone.

946
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,644
Thank you.

947
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:16,261
<i>Don't wake up.
Please don't wake up.</i>

948
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,123
<i>Good girl.</i>

949
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,894
<i>Oh, God. No!</i>

950
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:23,837
<i>Not tonight.</i>

951
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,631
<i>Not one more thing.</i>

952
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,375
Oh...

953
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:41,814
I downed the tequila
bottle from my diaper bag.

954
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:44,049
I can barely...

955
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,902
I don't even know
what my name is.

956
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,396
Lexie's dead.

957
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,317
Yeah.

958
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,056
Everyone's dead.
