1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,513
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,164
<i>We were in a
plane and it crashed.</i>

3
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:07,150
We just can't let this
happen to other people's

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,824
Lexies and Marks.

5
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:09,958
The best strategy

6
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,507
will be to look for fault with

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,989
the people who put
you on that plane.

8
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,095
You're not responsible.

9
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,825
A bunch of people
made it possible...

10
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,677
And I am one of those people.

11
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,246
The lawyer called, and they
need us at the courthouse.

12
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,335
We won.

13
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,004
He's giving us
$15 million. Each.

14
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,466
So who pays? The hospital.

15
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,302
We don't have
that kind of reserve.

16
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,654
I don't sleep with my
boss. Yeah, it's messy.

17
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,562
I am sleeping with Stephanie.

18
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,075
I've never really had
a friend who was a girl

19
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,193
who didn't want to do it.

20
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:34,511
You really are a douche.

21
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,284
You're like my
brother. We hang out.

22
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,669
I'm pregnant.

23
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,599
Well, congratulations.
Congratulations.

24
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,989
Sorry to interrupt.

25
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:42,702
I thought you might need a
break. Maybe grab a cup of coffee?

26
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,743
Seattle Grace has
suffered a financial setback.

27
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,056
We're gonna have
to trim our budgets.

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,480
Alana Cahill. I'm a
physician advisor.

29
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,465
She's here to
advise and to help.

30
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,918
I am proposing that
we close your ER.

31
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,369
What?

32
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,316
Why don't you listen
to what she has to say?

33
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,717
Some of us don't have a
few million to fall back on.

34
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:58,784
You're getting us ready to sell.

35
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,991
I'll be making some changes.

36
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,711
You need to be part of
that change or get out.

37
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,567
<i>I'm not big into change.</i>

38
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:10,969
Okay, great.

39
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,704
Um, now let's just try a few

40
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,290
where you're actually smiling.

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,903
<i>In oncology, when a normal cell</i>

42
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,354
<i>changes into
something malignant,</i>

43
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,258
<i>it's called cellular
transformation.</i>

44
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,630
Look, I don't even want
to be the hospital mascot,

45
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,894
whatever you do...

46
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,183
Brand ambassador,

47
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,363
and you haven't
been appointed yet.

48
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,847
You're just a very
strong contender.

49
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,865
Handsome, good with kids...

50
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,101
Just what the buyers want.

51
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,690
I'm outta here.

52
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,227
<i>The damn cells turn toxic
right in front of your eyes.</i>

53
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,706
<i>So as far as I'm concerned...</i>

54
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,431
Look, you're going to have
some public relations reps

55
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,810
following you around tomorrow.

56
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,111
Try and be civil.

57
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,251
<i>Transformation sucks.</i>

58
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,898
Brand ambassador?
What does that even mean?

59
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:46,221
You get to wear a funny hat

60
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,867
and cut things with
oversized scissors?

61
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,971
All I know is, Cahill
creeps me out.

62
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,677
That creeps me out.

63
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,844
Who comes over to
somebody else's house

64
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,079
and starts sucking face?

65
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,369
You invited 'em.

66
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,584
What's that?

67
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,085
We are directly
underneath Yang's room,

68
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,242
and Owen's visiting.

69
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,031
What do you think?

70
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,581
Is that him or her?

71
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,344
Do napkins work as earplugs?

72
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,857
What the hell?

73
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,062
You're nuts.

74
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:33,451
What is that?

75
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,288
I don't know. A
giraffe. Dinosaur.

76
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,864
<i>I'm just saying, I
don't understand</i>

77
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:52,098
<i>how you and Jo aren't
jumping at each other yet.</i>

78
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:53,350
Is it a medical thing?

79
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,185
Need prescription
pills that are blue pills?

80
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,909
Is it like pent up frustration?

81
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,857
Is that why you're
resorting to animal noises?

82
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,124
We were just having
fun, like you and Avery,

83
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,435
only without all the groping
and bodily fluids and...

84
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,931
Yeah. Never mind.
Nothing like you and Avery.

85
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,618
For the millionth time, Jo
and I are not into each other.

86
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,008
Oh, please.

87
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,311
You and Ponytail McGee
were canines in heat last night.

88
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,008
Literally.

89
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,225
Told you they
were doing it, Avery.

90
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,011
Pay up.

91
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,095
I don't like him like that.

92
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,680
Guys don't just
hang out with girls.

93
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,802
It's not in their DNA.

94
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,304
That's not true.

95
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,058
Okay, it's true.

96
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,721
You two are, like,
one drink away

97
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,905
from crazy monkey sex.

98
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,891
Just stuff her turkey.
You'll feel better.

99
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,026
I feel fine.

100
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,844
Look, I'm not screwing
my ex every night,

101
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,028
and I'm not taking
advantage of interns

102
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,613
on someone else's sofa.

103
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,198
You're gonna pay to
have that thing disinfected.

104
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,133
Not taking advantage. It's
a really nice sofa, though.

105
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,197
Hey, Apes.

106
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,608
Hey, here's a question.

107
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:49,110
Um, whatever happened to
good old-fashioned romance?

108
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,513
No stuffing of turkeys
or disinfecting sofas,

109
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,528
but, you know, what
about nice normal dates

110
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,548
where people talk, share a
meal, get to know each other,

111
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,600
and then wind up together,
not because they're monkeys,

112
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,769
but because they have genuine
feelings in a committed way.

113
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:05,153
I mean, what is so
wrong with that, huh?

114
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,166
Are you gonna eat all of those?

115
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:19,574
I like this, seeing
you every morning.

116
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,610
It's... It's nice.

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,479
Yeah, it is. It's really nice.

118
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,616
I feel bad, though.

119
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,285
I mean, you guys
shouldn't even be here

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,498
now that the ER is closed.

121
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,821
Nicole's just
standing out there.

122
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:37,704
You sure you don't
want your seat back?

123
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:38,968
Aren't you cold?

124
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,814
My burrito will keep me warm.

125
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,944
You okay?

126
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,294
You seem a little off.

127
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,432
Yeah.

128
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,967
I worked all night.

129
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,668
Do you...

130
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,283
Do you know how boring a night
shift is with no incoming traumas?

131
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,373
I was praying someone's
appendix would burst

132
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,741
just to keep me awake.

133
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,772
How am I supposed to
train to be a trauma surgeon

134
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,395
with no ER,

135
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,797
no trauma?

136
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,603
I'm sorry. I'm tired
and I'm venting.

137
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,605
<i>Dispatch to Unit 33,</i>

138
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,941

male with chest pain,</i>

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,327

Pioneer Square. Over.</i>

140
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,475
Unit 33 responding.

141
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,380
You have to go already?

142
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:33,643
I'm afraid so.

143
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,900
Okay.

144
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,287
Hey, uh...

145
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,595
You want to come, too?

146
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,159
You're with me all day?

147
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,828
We just want to get to
know who you are, Dr. Karev.

148
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,742
See you in your element.

149
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,643
It's important we choose just
the right ambassador for our brand.

150
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,468
Your brand? This
hospital isn't a luxury car.

151
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,720
Hold, please.

152
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,306
Good morning, Dr. Karev.

153
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,486
Pre-rounds went
well. Got your scans.

154
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,840
Do you want to tell me who the
creepy lady is taking our photo?

155
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,363
I'm Amrita.

156
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,715
I do public image assessment
for Pegasus Horizons.

157
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,129
They're buying the hospital,

158
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,313
and they're looking for a
face to slap on some posters.

159
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,366
And they chose you?

160
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,726
Maya Noel, 13 days old

161
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,479
with gastroschisis
and staged silo repair.

162
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,708
She was born with her
intestines outside of her body.

163
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,151
They've been too
swollen to fit back inside.

164
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,899
Is that... Am I looking
at a bag of organs?

165
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,657
We've been gradually compressing
the organs a little bit each day

166
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,325
to help them fit
back inside the body.

167
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,273
Imagine going two weeks without
getting to hold your own baby.

168
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,131
Well, good news.

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,244
Looks like we're finally
gonna be able to close her up.

170
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,633
Today is the day.

171
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,885
Oh, my God.

172
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:45,904
Oh, thank you.

173
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,732
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

174
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,502
Hold, please.

175
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,349
Thanks, guys.

176
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,319
If I could just have
you sign this release.

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,473
Yeah.

178
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,220
These are real
people with sick kids.

179
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,521
This is not a photo op.

180
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,323
I was just trying... Look,
I don't care, all right?

181
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,692
The next kid I'm about to go
see is a very sensitive case.

182
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:13,993
All right? You don't say a word.

183
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,295
You do not take a photo.

184
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,863
You're a shadow, a
freaking shadow. Got it?

185
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,089
Protective of your
patients. Passionate. I like it.

186
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,102
Forget it. You're
waiting in the hall.

187
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:26,777
Great. Great.

188
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,291
Now if you could just...

189
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,226
Move a little
closer to her... Him.

190
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,161
Oh, I'm the him. She's the her.

191
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,019
I... No, I was born a
her, and Jess was a him.

192
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,823
I get it's confusing. You
mean, move to my left?

193
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,051
Yeah. You're kidding.

194
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,819
Cahill's got more of
you guys trailing me?

195
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,210
He's "trailing me."

196
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,123
It's for this brand ambassador
thing or something.

197
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,429
It's not a big deal.

198
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,209
Just... We'll be done
in a sec. Ready?

199
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,018
One, two and three.

200
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,754
How's that?

201
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,534
You really think it's okay
to let these people in here?

202
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,024
The patient's fine with it.

203
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,671
If he gets to
stay, I get to stay.

204
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,038
It's the ambassador thing.

205
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,507
You think this kid
makes you look good.

206
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,830
I always look good.

207
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
We're at UW together.

208
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,869
I'm a sophomore,
and Brian's a freshman.

209
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,264
And is that where you met?

210
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,572
Actually, no. Dr. Karev
introduced us.

211
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,307
A few years ago, I
booked an appointment

212
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,942
to see how old I had to be
to, you know, start the process.

213
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,911
He was 14.

214
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,948
And Dr. Karev told me about
this transgender support group.

215
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,783
That's where Jess and I met.

216
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,529
Brian walked in that first day,

217
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,121
and all I could think was,

218
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,923
"Oh, my God. He's so cute."

219
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,422
I thought he'd never notice me.

220
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,846
It's impossible
not to notice you.

221
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,967
I've been saving up for this
ever since that appointment.

222
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,349
Well, Dr. Karev, you
really changed Brian's life.

223
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,206
Well, you could also say
that I'm changing Brian's life,

224
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,675
today, in surgery,

225
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,822
where I'll be taking the lead.

226
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,307
And what is today's
surgery exactly?

227
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,508
A full gender reassignment?

228
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,415
Oh, no. Nothing
that drastic yet.

229
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,267
Today we're just
chopping off my boobs.

230
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,779
All right, enough questions.

231
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,084
Edwards, Wilson,
take these guys outside.

232
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,055
Jackson Avery as the
new face of Seattle Grace...

233
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,079
Now that makes sense.

234
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,048
Alex also makes sense.

235
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,436
If you want a face that's
unshaven and sweating light beer.

236
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,798
You've got this in the bag.

237
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,165
Walk with me.
Here's what I know.

238
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,934
They like Avery's looks
and they like his name.

239
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,836
Now you don't have
either of those. Gee, thanks.

240
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,970
But you have Africa.

241
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,561
Lead with Africa.

242
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,973
He's a scrapper and a fighter.

243
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,274
Now some people
find that charming,

244
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,538
but you're an Avery.

245
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,311
Use it. Own it. Impress them.

246
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,528
They want to be impressed.

247
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,047
And I saw your breakfast.

248
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,749
Your brain can't function
on powdered sugar.

249
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:50,872
Here.

250
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,874
You just carry those
around in your pocket?

251
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,389
Every time I touch this thing,

252
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,589
it deletes another patient.

253
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,058
It deletes a patient?

254
00:09:59,082 --> 00:09:59,981
I did the exact same
thing this morning.

255
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:02,461
Here. Let me see...

256
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,645
Something.

257
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,698
Who are your stalkers?

258
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,933
Oh, uh, the new guys are
looking for a hospital show pony,

259
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,135
a face for the brochure.

260
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,670
Yeah, Karev's my competition.

261
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,137
Mmm. If you can
call it that. You can't.

262
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,239
Bite me, pretty boy.

263
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,907
And why are there no
women in the running?

264
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,964
Oh, there was. I
turned them down.

265
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,367
This face only goes
on the Nobel brochure.

266
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,831
And here we have

267
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,440
a fully centralized
electronic records system.

268
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,326
Everything you need to know
about any client at any time.

269
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,339
Smart, streamlined, efficient...

270
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,062
Oh, efficient.

271
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,793
It would be more efficient

272
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,228
if it didn't keep
deleting my patients.

273
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,185
Sing it, Grey. Don't
encourage her.

274
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,948
Why not? Cahill deserves it.

275
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,400
This morning, she gave
me this whole load of crap

276
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,034
about how to talk to the buyers.

277
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,186
Emphasize sports medicine.
Don't emphasize my research.

278
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,555
She doesn't want anything
to jeopardize the sale,

279
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,245
and neither should you.

280
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,442
Research is risky.

281
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,377
The suits don't like it.

282
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,297
Whereas, if you've got
the Seahawks as patients...

283
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,215
Ah, she doesn't
call 'em "patients."

284
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,117
She calls 'em
"clients," like we're,

285
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,568
oh, I don't know,
real estate agents.

286
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,072
Real estate agents look happy.

287
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,988
Maybe we'll be happy.

288
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,046
Their benefits package
says they have dental,

289
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,848
including orthodontics.

290
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,550
Now I happen to have a family
history of very straight teeth,

291
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,320
but Tuck may grow
up and need braces.

292
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,488
I don't know.

293
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,356
But if he does,
they have dental.

294
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,525
That's... I'm just
gonna focus on that.

295
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,328
No, no, no. We cannot settle.

296
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,863
We have to rise up and
we have to do something.

297
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,134
You've done plenty.

298
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,434
Maybe those of us from the plane

299
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,490
should keep our
heads down for a while.

300
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:39,797
Am I crazy?

301
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,026
I mean, am I the
only one that thinks

302
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,351
these wonks are
gonna destroy the place?

303
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,501
No.

304
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,455
You're not crazy at all.

305
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,560
I just felt like, what
kind of doctor would I be

306
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,997
if I didn't try to help out
all those African kids?

307
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,410
It takes a lot of dedication

308
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,111
to get a program like
that off the ground.

309
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,119
This is your fault.

310
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,733
You put these
ideas into her head.

311
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,289
His head.

312
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,991
And while I do
support the decision,

313
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,955
believe me, he came
to it all on his own.

314
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,823
She's barely out
of high school...

315
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,224
He. For God's sake.

316
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,659
She is a child! He.

317
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,111
She doesn't know
what she wants! He! He!

318
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,255
Jess, is everything okay here?

319
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,371
Are you the one?

320
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,505
What?

321
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,224
Are you the one

322
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:24,653
who wants to hack
my little girl into pieces?

323
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,339
Hey, hey, calm down.

324
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,483
It's gonna be okay.

325
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,334
<i>Pegasus...</i>

326
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,837
<i>Racing you to a
brighter tomorrow.</i>

327
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,650
Oh. I'm gonna hurl.

328
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,314
Click there where
it says "hospitals."

329
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,477
Holy crap.

330
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,006
They must own half the
hospitals in the country.

331
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,992
They're the guys who bought
out Portland Gen last year.

332
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,048
Right there.

333
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:48,117
Hey.

334
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,717
Hey, look at this.

335
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,568
"Hand in hand,
we'll walk together,

336
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,638
"partners on the road to
your brighter tomorrow."

337
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,050
This is who's buying us.

338
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,486
That's a cute logo.
Sofia would like it.

339
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,536
She likes horses.

340
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,793
It's not a horse.
It's a Pegasus.

341
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,340
And it wants to hold your hand.

342
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,748
This web site has not one
tangible piece of information

343
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,244
about the company
or health care.

344
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,546
Why doesn't this bother you?

345
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,820
It does, but they're buying us.

346
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,033
And we are all about
to gallop down the road

347
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,218
towards a brighter tomorrow.

348
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,138
So, you know, cool your heels.

349
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,362
Chill out. There's
nothing we can do about it.

350
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,477
She just told me
to cool my heels.

351
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,935
Have you ever known
me to cool my heels?

352
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,337
How do you feel
about a road trip?

353
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,041
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.

354
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,342
You think?

355
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,428
It's just, I learned about
this surgery last night

356
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,047
in an e-mail.

357
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,165
I mean, a stupid e-mail.

358
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,117
I had no idea about...

359
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,220
Any of this.

360
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,105
Guys, you can go.

361
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,793
We're fine here. Scram.

362
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,562
Mmm-hmm.

363
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,231
Let's go.

364
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:56,795
A surgery like this

365
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,464
is a big adjustment
for any parent,

366
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,955
let alone if you're hearing
about it for the first time.

367
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,357
So let's just take
a breath and...

368
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,126
Dad.

369
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,834
What are you doing here?

370
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,030
Hi. Hi.

371
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,336
My name's Calliope...

372
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,505
Plant...

373
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,690
Tain.

374
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,826
Plantain.

375
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,706
And this is...

376
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,079
My husband.

377
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,580
Um, uh...

378
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,483
Julio Plantain.

379
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,968
And he needs a doctor.

380
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,353
Can I see some I.D.?

381
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,696
He has chest pain.

382
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,626
Yeah.

383
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:41,006
So by the end of this seminar,

384
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,664
I expect all of you
to be able to perform

385
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,967
basic wound closures

386
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:49,854
using the interrupted
two-layer technique.

387
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,617
I don't like that
guy in the back.

388
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,041
I can feel him watching me.

389
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,177
No, it's just me.

390
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,622
I like to look at you.

391
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,949
Quick question, Dr. Avery.

392
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:03,601
Do you use this
technique more often

393
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,531
when you perform butt
lifts or breast implants?

394
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,395
Actually, isn't
this the technique

395
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,391
you used to attach the face on to
your last face transplant patient?

396
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,670
Well, I've never
actually done...

397
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,488
Sidebar. What do
you find more fulfilling,

398
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,146
liposuction or body sculpting?

399
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,360
Sidebar. Isn't it true you've
completed more successful skin grafts

400
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,877
than any other
doctor in this hospital?

401
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,100
Um...

402
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,496
Yeah. What are you doing?

403
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,255
Saving your ass. You hit
a rock and you're sinking.

404
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,723
Iceberg ahead, Captain.

405
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,260
Larry.

406
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,507
You know, we've got a
free station right over here

407
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,065
if you want to try your
hand at some actual surgery.

408
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,613
Please.

409
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,837
Excuse me one moment.

410
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,734
Have a seat, please.

411
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,435
<i>What's up? I'm kind of in
the middle of something.</i>

412
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,805
I know and I swear I wouldn't
call unless it were an emergency.

413
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,779
Look, I did a ride along today,

414
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,274
and we got this call, a kid,
about 10 years old, hit and run.

415
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,664
Damn it. He's still locked down.

416
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,927
<i>We can't intubate.</i> APRIL:
<i>Can you ventilate him?</i>

417
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,312
Barely. His SATs
are still in the gutter.

418
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,397
Okay, let's get him backboarded.
We need to load and go.

419
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,349
Seattle Pres is slammed, so
they're diverting us to Redmond,

420
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,068
<i>but that's an hour
away, and this kid...</i>

421
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,938
He doesn't have an
hour, Jackson. He doesn't.

422
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,305
All right. All right.
How are his vitals?

423
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,873
Bad. We've got no airway.

424
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,013
I can't crike.

425
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,049
He's got sub-Q emphysema.

426
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:10,179
He will die en route if we
have to go way out there.

427
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,685
He will die.

428
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,682
Are you asking what
I think you're asking?

429
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,242
If I am, will you do it?

430
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,795
And a few years ago,

431
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,052
we renovated the
waiting room to provide...

432
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,787
Chief, a moment, please.

433
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,510
Give me a moment.

434
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,959
Kepner's calling
with a hit-and-run kid.

435
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,594
He's in bad shape. Wait.
Kepner's in the field?

436
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,795
They diverted her to Redmond.
Okay? We're closer. Much closer.

437
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,497
So I can arrange...
Absolutely not.

438
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:46,965
We are not a trauma
center anymore.

439
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,601
If we take them in, and
something happens to them...

440
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,865
Chief, it's a kid.

441
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,458
Protocol dictates
the patient goes

442
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,861
to the nearest trauma
center, and that's not us.

443
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,246
I'm sorry.

444
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,410
You need to get
back to the seminar.

445
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,379
And you have to step it up.

446
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,447
What do you need, a
pep talk, tough love?

447
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:04,233
No amount of tough love is
gonna make up for the babies

448
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,018
Alex saves on a daily basis.

449
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,343
Can I trust you?

450
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:11,173
<i>Why do I have to be the patient?</i>

451
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,508
'Cause you look the part.

452
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,198
Oh, and I'm naturally vivacious.

453
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,762
Yeah, "manic's"
more a word for it.

454
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,503
I'm so sorry for the wait.

455
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,971
We're gonna get a doctor to
you just as soon as possible.

456
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,701
Well, it really wasn't a wait.

457
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,058
Ew. Wow. You're a
happy one, aren't you?

458
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,688
He's up there, too. Hmm?

459
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:28,957
Ugh.

460
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,430
Oh, God. It's like...

461
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,861
Hello, I'm Dr. Mattoo. You
can call me Kan if you'd like.

462
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,396
You wouldn't be here if
you weren't experiencing

463
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,998
some pain or discomfort.

464
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,883
I apologize if we
exacerbated that with a wait.

465
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,985
Uh, we got here, like,
half a minute ago. It's...

466
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,426
Okay, Mr. Plantain.

467
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,839
Uh, it's like the
fruit. It's Cuban.

468
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,024
Can you spell that for me?

469
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,149
Um... P-L-A-N...

470
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,618
T-A-I-N.

471
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,548
Well, Mr. Plantain,
we know you have

472
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,517
a lot of options for your
health care management,

473
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,585
and we are honored that
you've chosen us today.

474
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,809
It's my pleasure.

475
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,855
Saw your EKG. It
looks pretty good.

476
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,090
How are you feeling today?

477
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,958
Uh, well, uh, Dr. Kan,

478
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,550
you know, the
last 24 hours, I've...

479
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,230
Uh, uh, sorry. Let me
put that another way.

480
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,065
What brought you in today?

481
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm sorry. What's wrong with

482
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,957
asking him how he feels?

483
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,603
That could take us
down the wrong road,

484
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,471
and because your
time is valuable to us,

485
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,641
we don't want to get
off on any tangents.

486
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,225
Well, if you ask
him how he's feeling,

487
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,667
maybe he'll tell
you that he's...

488
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,802
He's blue, 'cause...

489
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,114
Yeah. You know, his company

490
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,616
was just purchased
by a bigger company...

491
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,967
Yeah. That he doesn't like.

492
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,969
And, you know, he
can't talk to me about it

493
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,527
'cause I'm the
self-involved type.

494
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:34,928
You know, we just, like,

495
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,892
you know, shop online
and redecorate the house.

496
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,249
And so he's been...
He's been hanging out

497
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,819
at the local watering hole,

498
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,855
where he has been
bumming cigarettes.

499
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,890
And now he's experiencing

500
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,437
shortness of breath.

501
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,705
So if you ask him what
brought him in today,

502
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,206
he's just gonna tell you
"shortness of breath."

503
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,425
And then you'd miss the
whole cigarette connection.

504
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:56,117
I ask about smoking
on screen two.

505
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,071
Fine. Whatever.

506
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
Okay, let me get
back to screen one.

507
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,921
Darn it. The screen froze.

508
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,163
Sorry. Technical difficulties.

509
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,643
I'm gonna have
to exit the system

510
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,976
and take us back to the top.

511
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,360
Uh, it's okay. Take your time.

512
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,644
Can't really do that.

513
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,666
We've only got 15
minutes together today.

514
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,767
There we go.

515
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,835
Mr. Plantain,

516
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,253
can you spell that for me?

517
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:34,121
Wow. They really
cleared the place out.

518
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,506
Okay, where do we start?

519
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,436
You can start by
guarding the door.

520
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,960
Hey, no one can know about this.

521
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,690
No one comes in. You understand?

522
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,997
Mmm-hmm.

523
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,322
Okay.

524
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,724
Medusa me all you
want. You're not getting in.

525
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,338
I'm an attending and I'm
ordering you to let me in.

526
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,446
Well, you're not my
attending today, so...

527
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,042
Don't make me force you.

528
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,315
I'd like to see you try.

529
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,500
Hey.

530
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,834
Jo. It's okay.

531
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,681
I paged her. She's cool.

532
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,532
I hope you understand.

533
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,523
I would never ordinarily
speak to you that way,

534
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,437
and I look forward to working
on your service again soon.

535
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,688
How can I help?

536
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,412
You're barely 18.

537
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,225
You know, what if you wake up,

538
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,693
you realize this
was all a mistake?

539
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,534
This isn't a haircut or
some meaningless tattoo.

540
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,019
This is my life.

541
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,153
This is me.

542
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,559
All right. You feel different.

543
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,294
You want to belong. Okay.

544
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,391
I get that, but you have
your whole life ahead...

545
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,882
I mean, what... What's the rush?

546
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:36,561
I'm just asking for you to wait.

547
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,469
Brian feels like
he's dying inside.

548
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,421
We both do.

549
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,424
If you'd just listen,

550
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,860
Brian will tell you that

551
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,745
living inside of
a body like this...

552
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,853
I'm sorry.

553
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,248
Could you just give
us a moment alone?

554
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,544
No, I don't want her to go.

555
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:54,179
And I don't want you
mutilating yourself!

556
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,203
I'm not!

557
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,604
Brian's just trying to be...

558
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,966
Oh, for God's sake.
Her name is Brianna!

559
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,230
Dad, just get out.

560
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,226
Go.

561
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:03,927
Just get out!

562
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,013
You heard him.

563
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,541
I just snagged a monitor, a
ventilator and central line kits.

564
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,409
I have saline, infusion pumps,
a crash cart and Cristina.

565
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,046
I'm sorry. They overpowered me.

566
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,013
The fewer people who know
about this the better, guys.

567
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:24,159
I brought lackeys. What?

568
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,516
No, I don't need interns.

569
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,679
No, this room has
three internal exits.

570
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,952
You have a lookout on one.

571
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,003
Happy, Ponytail,
you man the doors.

572
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,289
Mousy, be the nurse.
We need gloves.

573
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,853
On it. Why do I
have to be the nurse?

574
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,104
We are gonna need lights.

575
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,172
No, if I turn on more overheads,

576
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,340
you can see it from the hallway.

577
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,424
We can use those.

578
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,065
Hello. Yep. Okay.

579
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,233
All right. They're
pulling up now. Let's go.

580
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,806
Oh, jeez.

581
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,875
I'm okay.

582
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,270
That's why we needed interns.

583
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:52,643
The door won't open?

584
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,265
Watch the I.V.s. Hurry.

585
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,578
April, what's going on?

586
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,018
I don't know. Jackson? Jackson!

587
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,999
Pull. It's starting to give.

588
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,253
More! More! Go sit down, Mer.

589
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,922
Oh, come on. Just because
my uterus is occupied...

590
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,146
Go sit down. I'm not kidding.

591
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,490
Give me your spot.

592
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:13,725
What... Don't worry.

593
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,589
I ditched my PR chick
before I got down here.

594
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,345
How did you know
that we... I paged him.

595
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,930
You've got an incoming kid. You're
gonna need kid-sized equipment.

596
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,566
I brought a peds cart
with a bunch of crap.

597
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,250
All right. Are we doing this?
All right, guys, on my count.

598
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,541
One, two, three!

599
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,858
Go, go, go, go.
Go. Come on, guys.

600
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,015
We need to do rapid
sequence intubation, stat!

601
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,529
We could only get a 20
and a 22-gauge in the field.

602
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,731
I'll start a central line.

603
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,377
I need some
lactated ringers. On it.

604
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,727
I got it. I can see the cords.

605
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,991
Paralytics are working.

606
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,860
All right, uh, I
need an ET tube.

607
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,773
Orange drawer. Orange drawer.

608
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,659
I knew that.

609
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,305
No chest sounds on the right.
I have to throw in a chest tube.

610
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:01,974
Uh, I think I saw
Betadine somewhere.

611
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:04,198
Wait a second. Does anybody
actually have chest tubes?

612
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,529
I'm trying to set
up this saline drip,

613
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,614
and I can't get this
thing to stop beeping.

614
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,932
Anyone? I can give it a shot.

615
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,716
All right, I'm not
finding chest tubes now,

616
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,869
but I got NG tubes. Did
anybody actually bring suction?

617
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,071
There's a portable
suction in the rig.

618
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,193
Okay.

619
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,904
I'll go get it. Thank you.

620
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:24,985
Incoming!

621
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,237
Lights.

622
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,150
All clear.

623
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,353
I'm in. Brooks, bag him.

624
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,823
So Dr. Avery is
taking a power nap.

625
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,892
He likes to rest up
before big surgeries.

626
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,805
And Dr. Karev had a
dentist appointment.

627
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,763
Even doctors have
to go to the doctor.

628
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,076
Meanwhile, have
you seen the skin lab

629
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,601
where Dr. Avery
grows actual skin?

630
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,903
Come on.

631
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,151
Okay, I'm back. I got it.

632
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,552
Help me secure this NG tube.

633
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,987
All right, hook it up
so we can suction.

634
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,056
Okay, who's got the
portable ultrasound?

635
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,309
We don't have one?

636
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,952
Happy? On it.

637
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,198
Wilson, get in here. We
need some more hands.

638
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,967
If this kid dies because
you brought Red along

639
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,231
on same lame idea of a date...

640
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,670
The ride along was a date?

641
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,621
I need some 4-by-4s to
control the bleeding on the scalp.

642
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:25,112
All three lines are patent.

643
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:26,958
We can start dopamine at
five mics per kilo per minute,

644
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,693
but we need to figure
out his I.V. drip rate.

645
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,145
It's different for kids,
depending on size.

646
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,713
Anybody have a calculator?

647
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,070
I always ask a nurse.

648
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,681
Not a real nurse.

649
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,737
Broselow tape
says he's 30 kilos.

650
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,107
Standard concentration of
dopamine is 1,600 mics per cc.

651
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,775
So five times 30 is 150,

652
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,476
times 60 minutes
in an hour is 9,000.

653
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,633
Divide that by 1,600.

654
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,942
Infusion rate is
5.625 cc's per hour.

655
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,057
What? I'm really good at math.

656
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,374
Okay, let's give him 5.6...

657
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:56,104
Except we don't have
any dopamine, guys.

658
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,956
We don't have access to any
non-code medications at all

659
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,207
unless we have a
nurse or a code...

660
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,313
Yes, you do.

661
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,449
You paged him, too?

662
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,179
Well, I knew we were
gonna need meds.

663
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,381
I have the codes. Tell
me what the patient needs.

664
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,718
"Don't smoke"? That
was his big advice?

665
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,062
Yeah, he examined me
and found nothing wrong,

666
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,355
which, in fact, is the case.

667
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,979
Oh, he was an idiot.

668
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,563
And now I feel like an idiot.

669
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,909
We're just wandering around.

670
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,733
We look like interlopers.

671
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:22,314
Hey, you know, let's
grab a cup of coffee.

672
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:24,749
You always look like you belong
when you're carrying a coffee.

673
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,856
Ah. Yeah.

674
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,245
No, walk with purpose.
Don't look shifty.

675
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,410
I don't.

676
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:31,111
Okay. Oh, look.

677
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,212
Okay.

678
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,424
Want to make sure
we're on the same page.

679
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,481
That makes sense.

680
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,627
I think one more diagnostic...

681
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:36,995
Do we have time for that?

682
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,197
Just one? MAN: I
think we're pretty good.

683
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,399
All right.

684
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:43,657
Fifteen minutes a patient?

685
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:46,059
Can a doctor learn
anything in that little time?

686
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,215
You get really efficient.

687
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,783
And patient
outcomes don't suffer?

688
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,317
Wow. You're that efficient?

689
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,626
Are you visiting a patient?

690
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,522
Oh, I'm Richard Webber.

691
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,025
This is my colleague,
Callie Torres.

692
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,463
Um... We're with Pegasus,

693
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,011
and we just wanted to
check in, get a little feedback.

694
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,235
See if you had any concerns.

695
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,188
Really?

696
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,338
Really.

697
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,276
Okay, you need propofol...

698
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,649
Gentamicin and...

699
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,452
You will be really impressed
by our next stop downstairs,

700
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,021
which will be the site
for our new hernia clinic.

701
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,567
Get down there now. Okay.

702
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,941
Alana. Is this the group
from Pegasus you mentioned?

703
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,743
Hi, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Good to see you.

704
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,607
Hi, very nice to meet
you. How's the tour going?

705
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,291
Good? We like what
we're seeing so far.

706
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:41,832
Ah. I'm glad to hear that.

707
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,617
You know this is more than
just a hospital for a lot of us.

708
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,115
And I don't want to
sound cheesy, but it's, uh...

709
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,171
It's like family.

710
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:49,651
It's like home. Good.

711
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,595
Hey, have you ever seen
a human brain up close?

712
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:53,505
I can't say that I have.

713
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,689
You know what? I'm gonna
give you the unofficial tour

714
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,074
by way of the
third-floor coffee cart.

715
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,248
We'll have some coffee
first. You're gonna love it.

716
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,557
It's a little taste of Seattle.

717
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,570
I've got free fluid in
the left upper quadrant.

718
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:04,749
Crap. What time is it?

719
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,423
We have surgery on
Brian in 20 minutes.

720
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,869
Cahill will definitely
notice if we don't show.

721
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,237
If you guys need to go,
go. We can handle this.

722
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,705
Look, I'm seeing a
pneumopericardium.

723
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,474
Okay, we should put in
another chest tube on the left,

724
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,242
just to be sure. Well,
this kid needs an OR.

725
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,527
Guys, we've gotta move him.

726
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,045
We can't. Not till we have
someplace for him to go.

727
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,281
There's no time. Cahill's on
her way down here right now.

728
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,332
Okay. We're staying.

729
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,302
Are you hungry?
Can I buy you lunch?

730
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,071
Actually, we have a
very tight schedule.

731
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:27,906
We need to get down
to the hernia clinic now.

732
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:30,697
Oh, yeah.

733
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,867
Okay.

734
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,889
You know what?
Why don't I join you?

735
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,473
We gotta move the rig.
It's still parked outside.

736
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,241
It's okay. Go. JACKSON:
Move, guys, move.

737
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,280
Hurry!

738
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:48,644
We gotta get this thing mobile.

739
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,513
What happened?
He's bradying down.

740
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,198
We gotta keep moving.
I'm not getting a pulse!

741
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,554
Ross, start CPR.

742
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:56,401
Damn it. His trachea
is deviated to the left.

743
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,353
His SATs are dropping. I
think he has a tension pneumo.

744
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,626
He has bilateral chest tubes.

745
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,089
It must have gotten blocked.

746
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,824
Someone find me a 14-gauge
cannula or a 16-gauge.

747
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,142
Whatever you can
find, the biggest.

748
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,110
Got it! Guys, what about Cahill?

749
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:07,612
Oh, God. What if he dies?

750
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,564
What if we brought him
here and what if he dies?

751
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,750
Hernias are one of the most
common general surgery procedures.

752
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,094
And as it turns out, also
one of the most lucrative.

753
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,341
Why did I agree to this? JO:
Guys, we gotta keep moving.

754
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,525
I can't even think!

755
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:21,932
We have to move!

756
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,245
Cahill's coming down
right now. If we don't move...

757
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,380
We're moving. Yang.

758
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,431
Wait one second. One second.

759
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,155
Now keep in mind,

760
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:30,623
the site is still
under construction,

761
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,703
but you'll just have to
use a little imagination.

762
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,361
Before we go in
there, I'd like to...

763
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,532
Okay, right this way.

764
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:42,001
And watch your step please.

765
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,034
Last month, I had to do a
cardiac cath on a patient

766
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,531
with no signs of heart disease.

767
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,489
It's putting the patient
at risk for no reason.

768
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,958
Forget physician
advocacy. It doesn't exist.

769
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,744
We have no say
in anything... At all.

770
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,248
Yeah, and if you decide to
go crazy and think for yourself,

771
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,650
they know, like, instantly.

772
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,468
I swear the walls have ears.

773
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:16,937
Are you the reps from Pegasus?

774
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,473
Dr. Webber and Dr. Torres.

775
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,191
Hi.

776
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,628
Callie Torres from
Seattle Grace?

777
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:25,962
Uh...

778
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,825
I'm... Do I... Do I know you?

779
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,417
No. Kenton Giles.

780
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,830
I'm an ortho just like you.

781
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,054
Yeah, I read all about your
cartilage generation work.

782
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,184
It's incredible.

783
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,458
I didn't realize you
stopped practicing.

784
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,343
So you work for Pegasus now?

785
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,578
Yeah.

786
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,891
Yeah, I guess I...

787
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,928
Needed a... I needed
to mix it up a little, so...

788
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,853
She peaked, you know,
with the cartilage generation.

789
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,806
You know, sometimes it's best
to get out before you decline.

790
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,107
Yeah.

791
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,858
And after the anesthesia
is administered,

792
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,793
Brian will be ready for surgery.

793
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:04,868
And when exactly are we gonna
see Doctors Avery and Karev again?

794
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,387
No offense, but we're
here to trail them, not you.

795
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,134
Edwards, nice work. Ah.

796
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,202
No problem.

797
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,536
We're ready to scrub in.

798
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,388
Wilson, could you show
our friends up to the gallery?

799
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,995
You guys can
watch from up there.

800
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,675
You have a little bit of
blood on your left shoulder.

801
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,619
Everyone, right this way.

802
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,197
Here we go.

803
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,320
By streamlining the process,

804
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,918
we will significantly decrease the
hospital's hernia complication rate

805
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:28,820
and become a
destination medical center.

806
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:30,955
How many patients will this
place accommodate at a time?

807
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,045
Upwards of 30...

808
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,864
Once everything is...

809
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,200
Finished.

810
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,512
Shepherd, would
you mind taking over?

811
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,863
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

812
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,251
Right. Uh, yes.

813
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,870
I was gonna try a
similar research project,

814
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,838
but now that I'm the
face of Portland Gen,

815
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,740
I don't have that
kind of time. Really?

816
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,242
Yeah. I do a lot of press.

817
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,082
About orthopedic
surgery? That's great.

818
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:12,352
Well, more like, you
know, wellness, nutrition,

819
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,988
get eight hours
sleep, take a walk.

820
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,524
Sometimes I do a
photo op in the OR.

821
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,087
They don't want to
shoot a real person,

822
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,006
so they have me cutting a
chicken breast or something.

823
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,396
Oh.

824
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,561
Well, I work on the Portland
Trail Blazers, though.

825
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,280
Real guys, not chickens.

826
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,881
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

827
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,472
Nothing innovative
like Dr. Torres does.

828
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:35,908
Or... Did, I guess I should say.

829
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,578
You know what?

830
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,581
I was wondering,

831
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,968
can this stay between us,
not get back to Pegasus?

832
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,570
Nothing you say to us will
ever get back to Pegasus.

833
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,867
Great.

834
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:52,325
Well, now that
you're not practicing...

835
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:55,294
Is there an ortho
opening at Seattle Grace?

836
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,936
Well, I hope you get it, the
brand ambassador thing.

837
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,883
I don't want to be the
face of any hospital

838
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,185
where I have to sneak
around and risk my job

839
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,520
just to do the right thing.

840
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:10,977
Screw that. I hope you get it.

841
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:15,782
All right, well, this
keyhole incision is done.

842
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,412
We're ready to begin closing.

843
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,736
Who are you
operating on, Dr. Avery?

844
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:21,989
Um...

845
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,190
My transgender patient, why?

846
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,533
What did you do?

847
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,217
This part of the lung is fried.

848
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:40,451
I'm gonna have
to do a resection.

849
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:41,715
The spleen is out.

850
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:44,710
Let's irrigate with
antibiotic solution.

851
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,815
Does somebody want to tell me
where the hell this patient came from?

852
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,316
Whose patient is this?

853
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,699
Fine. You don't have to tell us.

854
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,767
We can just look it up.

855
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,657
All I need is the
patient's name.

856
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,142
Wait. No.

857
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,762
I can do it. I'll look it up.
It's my patient. You got this?

858
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:02,946
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

859
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,731
Appreciate your cooperation.

860
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,727
Sure. No problem. I'm happy to.

861
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,818
Okay.

862
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,486
I just have to get
into the patient file.

863
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,733
Oh, no. What?

864
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,690
This keeps happening to me.

865
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,193
I try to go into the patient
file and I guess I deleted it.

866
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,032
What happened?

867
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,684
Cahill figured it out?

868
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,320
They're taking us in one at a
time to see who'll break first.

869
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,228
I can't lie. I'm no good at it.

870
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,383
They'll see right through me.

871
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:48,124
Stay strong, Dopey.

872
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,359
You can do it.

873
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,468
They started with the interns.

874
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,358
I'm just trying to find
out what happened.

875
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,094
You want to know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

876
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,495
A kid was dying,
and we kept him alive.

877
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,635
Dr. Karev, hello.

878
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,271
You mentioned the word "we."

879
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,388
Who else was involved?

880
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,220
I was. This was my call.

881
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,887
I took the kid in. I
decided to treat him.

882
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,394
We did the right thing.

883
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,174
We saved his life.
And that's what matters.

884
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:13,065
Not these idiotic new policies
or some stupid ad campaign.

885
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,595
So you can punish
us however you want.

886
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,139
We don't care,
because... That's enough.

887
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,940
Just go.

888
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,293
Oh, that's it? You're not
going to discipline them or...

889
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:24,377
Go.

890
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,083
You paged me?

891
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,251
No. Yes.

892
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,440
We have a problem.

893
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,526
My presence seems to
have ignited an uprising,

894
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,539
which makes it a little
tough for me to do my job,

895
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,846
especially when
you help them. What?

896
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:48,434
It was your code that accessed
the medication case on floor five.

897
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,536
Is that true?

898
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,539
That stuff you
said, Dr. Shepherd,

899
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,924
about how this hospital
is such a family?

900
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,737
Mmm-hmm. It was lovely, really.

901
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,328
I even think you meant it.

902
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,946
But it means nothing
if there is no hospital.

903
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,617
Do you know how much this
stunt would've cost this place

904
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,752
if that kid had
died on our watch?

905
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,138
Pegasus would've backed out.

906
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,457
And without them, you're done.

907
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,493
I am trying to help you.

908
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:18,932
But I can't do that if you are
undermining me at every turn.

909
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,717
If you care anything
about this hospital

910
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,253
or the people in it,

911
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,987
then it's time that
you get on board.

912
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,690
Otherwise the next doors
to close will be yours.

913
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,417
Jess, the surgery
went very well.

914
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,019
Brian should be
in recovery soon.

915
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,643
You'll be able
to visit him then.

916
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,467
Mr. Weston?

917
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:55,852
Is that you?

918
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,420
I'm sorry.

919
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,422
I just want to hear

920
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,841
how Bri... How everything went.

921
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,695
I sent you the
e-mail last night.

922
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:08,982
Not Brian. It was me.

923
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,533
He wasn't gonna tell you.

924
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,436
I know you guys don't talk
that much since he moved out,

925
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,505
but he talks about you

926
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:17,908
a lot.

927
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,860
He admires you.

928
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,229
I think he wants to
grow up and be you.

929
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:25,965
And you're his dad.

930
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:29,736
It was a major surgery. I
thought you should know.

931
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:31,871
I get why you blame me for this.

932
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,723
He met me

933
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,325
and started changing,

934
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,994
dressing differently

935
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,096
and acting differently.

936
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,131
But...

937
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,067
I'm not...

938
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,303
It's hard...

939
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,106
Being like us...

940
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,409
Trying to fit into this...

941
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,611
This mold that

942
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,313
doesn't fit.

943
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,716
He just wants you to
love him, Mr. Weston...

944
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,501
The way he loves you.

945
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,540
He didn't tell you because
he didn't want to mess that up.

946
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,867
You guys okay on rent?

947
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:21,937
Here.

948
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,840
That's all I have on me.

949
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,942
You don't want to be
there when he wakes up?

950
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,750
<i>Change is a funny thing.</i>

951
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,571
<i>Not everyone can handle it.</i>

952
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,573
Hey. So I know you keep saying
that you and Wilson aren't a thing.

953
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,613
'Cause we're not.

954
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,627
Well, maybe you should be.

955
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:51,811
She kinda kicked ass today.

956
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,340
Just saying.

957
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:00,327
Come on.

958
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:02,006
Come on where? Just come on.

959
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,696
<i>It can sneak up on you.</i>

960
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,449
It's funny how you
don't appreciate a thing

961
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,467
until you're about to lose it.

962
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,057
No.

963
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,505
No, don't... Don't
say that. That's...

964
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,729
We can still fight this.

965
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,415
You can fight this.

966
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,883
Me?

967
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,987
I've got an early
retirement package waiting.

968
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,891
Maybe I'll take it.

969
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,315
Good night, Torres.

970
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,885
Good night.

971
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,381
<i>Things aren't what
they used to be.</i>

972
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,194
Matthew?

973
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,630
Oh, hey. I was
hoping to catch you.

974
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,766
How's the kid?

975
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,169
He is doing great.

976
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:18,537
He made it through
surgery with flying colors.

977
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,927
Oh, that's... That's great.

978
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:22,091
That's good.

979
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:23,676
Yeah.

980
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:25,878
Uh, April, I...

981
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,233
Oh, man.

982
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,002
I had this whole thing
that I wanted to say to you,

983
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,431
and then you look
at me, and I just...

984
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,307
Okay. Pull it together.

985
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,978
Um...

986
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:46,716
You are the strongest, most
fearless, beautiful woman I've ever met.

987
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,763
You were incredible today.

988
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,520
You are incredible.

989
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,421
And...

990
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,825
I like you.

991
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,276
I really like you.

992
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,181
And I

993
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,427
just thought I should say that

994
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,931
so you knew, because I...

995
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,078
<i>Your whole world
has transformed.</i>

996
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,251
What are we doing in here?

997
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:28,807
Just wait.

998
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,996
I stole them from
the nurses in derm.

999
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,866
They won't eat 'em anyway. They're
all "no sugar" and "gluten-free."

1000
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,227
Cheers to an incredible day.

1001
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,629
You deserve it.

1002
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,481
Actually, I helped,
too. So cheers to us.

1003
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,704
Hey, powdered
sugar's your favorite.

1004
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:04,410
Yeah, no. This is great. Thanks.

1005
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:07,963
What?

1006
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,600
Nothing.

1007
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,151
<i>You realize...</i>

1008
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,860
<i>The ground beneath
you has shifted.</i>

1009
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,128
You guys are killing me.

1010
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:23,841
It was the right thing to do.

1011
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:24,964
Yeah.

1012
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,683
You're still killing me.

1013
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,580
<i>Things are uncertain.</i>

1014
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,251
Mmm.

1015
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,298
<i>And there's no turning back.</i>

1016
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:48,621
She's not answering.

1017
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,100
I really want to
wait for Cristina.

1018
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:51,868
Okay, fine. Fine.
Let's wait for Cristina.

1019
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:53,503
Let's just wait downstairs
where it's warm.

1020
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,989
Yeah. No, we can't.
The walls have ears.

1021
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,757
I'm outta here. Okay, all right.

1022
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,108
Look, I called this meeting

1023
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:01,033
because we can't just keep
our heads down and lay low.

1024
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,196
Okay, we're the reason
the hospital's in trouble.

1025
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,364
We have to do something.

1026
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,534
We can't let Pegasus take over.

1027
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,603
We have a responsibility.

1028
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:09,867
Which is why I think

1029
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,942
we should buy the
hospital ourselves.

1030
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:20,853
<i>The world around
you is different now...</i>

1031
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:24,423
Hi.

1032
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:26,125
<i>Unrecognizable...</i>

1033
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:30,262
<i>And there's nothing
you can do about it.</i>

1034
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,999
<i>You're stuck.</i>

1035
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:36,830
<i>The future's staring
you in the face.</i>

1036
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,572
<i>And you're not sure
you like what you see.</i>

1037
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,724
<i>Like I said,</i>

1038
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,426
<i>I'm not big into change.</i>
