1
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,039
DYING CHANGES EVERYTHING.

2
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:08,542
THERE'S THE EMOTIONAL FALLOUT,
SURE.

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,145
BUT THERE'S ALSO
THE PRACTICAL STUFF.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,347
WHO'S GOING TO DO
YOUR JOB?

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,517
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY?

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,452
THE ONLY GOOD THING
FOR YOU IS,

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,388
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,524
PEOPLE YOU NEVER KNEW
WILL BE LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE,

9
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,259
WORKING YOUR JOB.

10
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:27,128
THE WORLD
JUST KEEPS ON GOING...

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,796
WITHOUT YOU.

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,398
STEPH, I NEED A FAVOR.

13
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,533
I'LL DO YOUR SCUT
FOR A WEEK--

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,634
TWO WEEKS--
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO,

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,436
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY TODAY.

16
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,138
AND YOU'RE THE MOST TALENTED
INTERN IN OUR CLASS,

17
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,406
AND I'M IN NO WAY TRYING
TO BUTTER YOU UP

18
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,807
SO YOU DNO.T SAY NO.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,409
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU YET.

20
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,810
YES, I DO. I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR MEDUSA FOR YOU.

21
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,080
I WANT TO LIVE
SO I WILL SAY IT AGAIN--NO.

22
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,188
NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF.
SHE'S JUST AN ATTENDING.

23
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,856
WE ONLY CALL HER MEDUSA
BECAUSE--

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,492
BECAUSE SHE'S A MONSTER
OF MYTHIC PROPORTIONS.

25
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,636
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

26
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,472
I HAVE THESE LABS
FOR DR. GREY.

27
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,374
WELL, THEN GIVE THEM
TO HER.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,209
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THOSE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

29
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,344
I HAD TO DO AN ADMISSION--

30
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:17,878
STOP MAKING EXCUSES.

31
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,846
SORRY.

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,181
STOP APOLOGIZING.

33
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,249
OKAY.

34
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:22,350
STOP TALKING.

35
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:26,220
HIS LACTIC ACID IS NORMAL.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

36
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,156
YOU CAN TALK NOW.

37
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,390
THAT HE'S PROBABLY
NOT SEPTIC,

38
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,658
SO HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

39
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,661
ALTHOUGH HIS WHITE CELL COUNT
IS ELEVATED

40
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,263
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.

41
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,165
IN FACT, I WILL KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT

42
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,666
GO TO THE PIT
AND TRY NOT TO KILL ANYBODY.

43
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,906
IMPRESSIVE.

44
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,677
I WOULD'VE EXPECTED THAT LEVEL
OF INTIMIDATION FROM YANG MAYBE.

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,145
NOT YOU.

46
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,415
HOW IS YANG, BY THE WAY?
DOES SHE LIKE MINNESOTA?

47
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,418
SHE LOVES IT.

48
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,591
DR. PARKER.

49
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,193
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
I REALIZED...

50
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,460
DR. PARKER.

51
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,196
THAT THERE WAS
A TUMOR

52
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,297
I MEAN, WE HAD SPENT, UH,
THREE HOURS

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,564
TRYING TO DEAL
WITH THE VALVE--

54
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,433
OH, DR. YANG.

55
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,202
YOU'VE GOTTA HEAR ABOUT
THIS CASE DR. THOMAS HAD--

56
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,936
MUST BE WHAT,
TEN YEARS AGO?

57
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,837
YEAH.

58
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,706
UM, I LOOKED AT
THE OBERMAN BABY'S SCANS.

59
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,908
UH, I KNOW WE DISCUSSED
DOING A THORACOTOMY,

60
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,244
BUT I THINK A V.A.T.S.
MAKES MORE SENSE.

61
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,345
FANTASTIC.

62
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,580
BUT LET DR. THOMAS TELL YOU
ABOUT THIS STORY FIRST.

63
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,182
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
YOUR EARS.

64
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,318
HOW ABOUT I SCRUB IN
WITH YOU

65
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,320
AND THEN I CAN TELL YOU
THE WHOLE STORY?

66
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,454
WHEN'S YOUR SURGERY?

67
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,722
11:00.

68
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,458
OH, THAT WON'T WORK.
00.

69
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,592
OH.

70
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,261
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE
YOUR SURGERY BACK

71
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,329
AND THEN I CAN JOIN YOU?

72
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,430
UH, THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

73
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,932
AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE
00.

74
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,336
IT'S A PORT-CABG.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE?

75
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,338
I'VE DONE ONE.
THREE IN FACT.

76
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,940
WELL, THEN YOU'LL APPRECIATE
MY APPROACH.

77
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,742
IT'S EVEN BETTER.
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

78
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,345
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
MY AMBULANCE ISN'T HERE YET.

79
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,480
I CAN START THE STORY NOW.

80
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,350
THE PATIENT WAS 66.

81
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,218
ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD START

82
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,420
WHEN I FIRST MET THE MAN.

83
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,701
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALL SET FOR TONIGHT.

84
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,003
UNLESS YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS
OR CONCERNS.

85
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,239
I DON'T.

86
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,441
OKAY. UM...

87
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,244
5:00.

88
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,412
OKAY.

89
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,555
HOW OFTEN SHOULD HER
CALCIUM LEVELS BE MONITORED?

90
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,756
EVERY 12 HOURS.

91
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,627
AND WHAT'S THE PRIMARY CAUSE
OF HYPOCALCEMIA

92
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,662
AFTER PARATHYROID SURGERY?

93
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,331
UM...

94
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,266
REALLY?

95
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,735
ARE YOU TELLING ME
NOT ONE OF YOU KNOWS THAT--

96
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,537
HUNGRY BONE SYNDROME...

97
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,407
WHERE CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS
ARE RAPIDLY DEPOSITED

98
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,574
INTO THE BONE.

99
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,009
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

100
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,278
GOT A LAST-MINUTE FLIGHT.
COULDN'T PASS IT UP.

101
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,280
NOT ANYMORE.N CALL TONIGHT?

102
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,316
I SWITCHED SHIFTS.

103
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,419
WHAT'S YOUR TURNAROUND
THIS TIME?

104
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,721
12 HOURS. AND I PLAN TO MAKE USE
OF EVERY SINGLE ONE.

105
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,694
OCCUPIED.

106
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,296
MM. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO.

107
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,399
LISTEN... I WISH I COULD
PUT OFF HOPKINS

108
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,401
SO YOU AND I COULD SPEND
MORE TIME TOGETHER,

109
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,438
BUT I'VE ALREADY
POSTPONED THEM ONCE.

110
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,040
MM. I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO LIKE IT.

111
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,608
I REALLY HATE GOOD-BYES.

112
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,410
WELL, YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE.

113
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,589
OKAY, WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THE STARING?

114
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,558
I'M FINE, AND EVEN IF
I WEREN'T,

115
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,560
STARING AT ME
WOULDN'T MAKE ME MORE FINE.

116
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,762
I'M SORRY, DR. TORRES.

117
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,598
REALLY, AVERY? YOU TOO?

118
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,533
NO, NOT STARING.
UH, DEFINITELY NOT.

119
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,868
EXCUSE ME.

120
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,336
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

121
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,604
HEY, YOU TELL ME.

122
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,539
LOOKS LIKE A TRANSVERSE
PROCESS FRACTURE

123
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,341
AT L-3, L-4,
BUT SEE THIS SWELLING?

124
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,442
I CAN'T TELL IF IT'S
UNSTABLE OR NOT.

125
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,843
IT'S UNSTABLE
OKAY.FOR SURE.

126
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,579
BOOK AN O.R.
WE NEED TO GET IN THERE

127
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,846
AND RELIEVE THE PRESSURE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,348
WAIT. "WE"?

129
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:15,616
AS IN YOU AND ME?

130
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,117
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

131
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,586
ACTUALLY, IT IS.
IT'S--IT'S--

132
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,853
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

133
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,121
I'VE BEEN CLEARED FOR SURGERY
FOR WEEKS.

134
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,590
YEAH, I KNOW,
'CAUSE I CLEARED YOU,

135
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,857
BUT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T READY S--

136
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,393
WELL, NOW I'M SAYING I AM.

137
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,360
WOW. OKAY.

138
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,528
AGAIN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

139
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,530
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

140
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,665
I WILL BE DONE
00.

141
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,133
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

142
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,369
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING
THIS PRESSURE ON YOURSELF?

143
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,738
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR WEEKS. I FEEL GOOD.

144
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,908
I JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND
LOOKING AT THE CLOCK.

145
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,778
YOU REALLY NEED
TO DO THIS TODAY?

146
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,814
YEAH, I DO...

147
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,383
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

148
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,484
OKAY.

149
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,623
I MEAN,
HE SAYS HE'S READY.

150
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,391
AND HIS NERVE GRAFT
SEEMS TO BE READY.

151
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,927
SO I GUESS TODAY'S THE DAY
HE'S GONNA OPERATE...

152
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,430
WITH HIS BRAND-NEW HAND.

153
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:09,403
AND IT IS GONNA WORK.
IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA WORK.

154
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,608
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA WORK,
RIGHT?

155
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,810
I THOUGHT I MIGHT FIND YOU
IN HERE.

156
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,812
I KEEP THINKING
IF I SAY SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH

157
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,181
OR...
SHOCKING ENOUGH,

158
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,484
HE'LL JUST--
HE'LL OPEN HIS EYES.

159
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,185
MM-HMM.

160
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,189
00.

161
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,959
HIS DIRECTIVE
WAS VERY SPECIFIC.

162
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,663
IF, AFTER 30 DAYS, THERE ARE
NO SIGNS OF RECOVERY,

163
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:39,433
MARK WANTED TO BE LET GO.

164
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,969
THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING...

165
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,204
HONORING HIS WISH.

166
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,840
I KNOW. I JUST...

167
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,212
OH, GOD.
IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.

168
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,848
I THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.

169
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,684
OH, YEAH. THAT'S BETTER.

170
00:06:56,717 --> 00:07:00,588
OH, YEAH, IT'S SO MUCH COOLER
WITH MY BOOBS OUT.

171
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,492
WELL, IF THAT
DIDN'T WAKE HIM,

172
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,526
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

173
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,761
YEAH.

174
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,008
YOU ALWAYS HAD TO BE
THE FIRST.

175
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,487
YOU ARE A TERRIBLE BEST MAN.

176
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,622
ADDISON'S GREAT,

177
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,890
BUT ONE WOMAN
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

178
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,526
IT'S NOT WHAT GOD INTENDED.

179
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,761
ESPECIALLY FOR MEN
WHO LOOK LIKE US.

180
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,897
GOD INTENDED FOR US
MANY, MANY WOMEN,

181
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,534
A STAGGERING NUMBER
OF WOMEN.

182
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,771
I JUST HOPE YOU DIDN'T
FORGET THE RINGS.

183
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,906
DEREK...
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

184
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,043
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER

185
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,278
FIND ANOTHER FRIEND

186
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,048
AS GOOD AS ME, EVER.

187
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:13,561
E YOU FILMING THIS?

188
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,866
OKAY, WE'RE NOT DOING THIS,
OKAY?

189
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,734
I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS...

190
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,069
SO YOU CAN PUT IT ON
YOUR CREEPY BOOKCASE

191
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,304
WITH ALL YOUR OTHER
CREEPY VIDEOS.

192
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,006
THERE'S NO BOOKCASE.

193
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,608
AND I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS EITHER,

194
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,009
BUT TRUST ME,
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

195
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:33,547
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO RELIVE
OVER AND OVER.

196
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,552
MM. ONE SECOND.

197
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,926
UH, THE INTERN APPY--
YOU GOT YOUR GUY?

198
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,628
I

199
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,030
AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS TODAY?

200
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,565
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

201
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,566
OKAY.

202
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,001
UH, GREY. HEY.

203
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,571
UM, I NEED YOU TO TAKE
00 LAP CHOLE.

204
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,672
OH, I CAN'T.
I HAVE THE INTERN APPY.

205
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,107
OH.

206
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,842
GREY, LIVING UP
TO YOUR NICKNAME.

207
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,812
NICKNAME?
I HAVE A NICKNAME?

208
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,584
UH, THEY CALL YOU MEDUSA...

209
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,855
THE SERPENT-HAIRED MONSTER
WHO TURNS FOLKS TO STONE.

210
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,857
HEY, THIS IS NOT A BAD THING.

211
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,660
YOU WANT TO BE THE ATTENDING
WITH THE SCARY NICKNAME.

212
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,695
IT KEEPS YOUR RESIDENTS
IN LINE.

213
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,597
IT STRIKES FEAR
IN THEIR HEART.

214
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,600
TAKE IT FROM THE NAZI,
IT'S GOOD TO BE FEARED.

215
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,735
YOU RETIRED THE NAZI.

216
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,102
THEY CALL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

217
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,704
THEY DO?

218
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,839
THEY DO.

219
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,006
WH--

220
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,643
MM-HMM.

221
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,679
EXCUSE ME, DR. PARKER,
QUICK QUESTION.

222
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,648
OKAY, HANDS UP, EVERYBODY.

223
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,616
ONE, TWO, THREE.

224
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,918
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU,
DR. YANG?

225
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,887
OH, I-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO STOP YOUR PROCEDURE.

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,622
YOU CAN JUST KEEP GOING
WHILE I TALK.

227
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,757
WE CAN'T, ACTUALLY.

228
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,892
WE FIND THAT MULTITASKING
LEADS TO ERRORS IN HEARING

229
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,628
AND ERRORS IN HEALING.

230
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:57,030
OKAY. UH, WELL, UM,
DR. THOMAS INVITED HIMSELF

231
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,632
ONTO MY V.A.T.S.
THIS AFTERNOON--

232
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,033
MM-HMM.RMAN BABY.

233
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,035
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD DO
THE PROCEDURE ON MY OWN,

234
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,637
WITHOUT HIM.

235
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,038
HOW COME?

236
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,909
UH, WELL... DR. THOMAS
IS A BIG TALKER AND--

237
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,944
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT IS THE TRUTH.

238
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,647
DR. THOMAS CAN CHEW YOUR EAR
RIGHT OFF.

239
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,649
I-I TELL YOU, ONCE HE CORNERED
ME WITH A STORY,

240
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,750
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE GENTLEMEN'S ROOM.

241
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,151
I HATE TO INVOKE POTTY HUMOR,

242
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,754
BUT I WASN'T SURE
I WAS GONNA MAKE IT.

243
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,790
THAT'S HOWSTORY WAS.

244
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,191
EXACTLY. SO--

245
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,660
MY ADVICE TO YOU IS,
VISIT THE LADIES ROOM

246
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,195
BEFORE YOU ENTER
YES.Y.

247
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,130
I WILL, BUT ANOTHER SOLUTION
WOULD BE

248
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,699
IF HE JUST DIDN'T SCRUB IN.

249
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,667
YOU'VE GOT A TOUGH ROW
TO HOE THERE, DR. YANG.

250
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,902
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

251
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,436
THANKFULLY,
YOU'RE A TOUGH COOKIE.

252
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,038
YOU'RE UP TO THE TASK.

253
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,773
WE SALUTE YOU.

254
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,849
GUESS WHAT.
I HAVE A NICKNAME.

255
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,418
MEDUSA.
I'M MEDUSA GREY.

256
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,820
I HAD TO PUSH
MY FLIGHT TONIGHT.

257
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,955
OH.

258
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,457
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
IT'S NOT LIKE LAST TIME

259
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,927
or the time before that.

260
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,695
My surgery got pushed.
That's it.

261
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm on standby
for a later flight.

262
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,065
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE
NOT READY TO FLY.

263
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,734
I SAID I'D COME.
I'LL BE THERE.

264
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,135
Well, you won't make it
by 5:00 anyway,

265
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,770
so why push yourself?

266
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,772
I WILL BE THERE, MEDUSA.

267
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,873
OH, SO YOU DID HEAR ME?

268
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,742
I like it.

269
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,209
Snakes in the hair--hot!

270
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:18,846
Okay, bye.

271
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,014
CRISTINA'S COMING TONIGHT?

272
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,449
00,

273
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,851
BUT SHE SAYS
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE.

274
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,485
HUH.

275
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,723
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET
ON THAT PLANE, IS SHE?

276
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,860
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

277
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,863
PROBABLY NOT.

278
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,007
YOU REALLY DOING
THE INTERN APPY?

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,141
JEALOUS?

280
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,409
HE'S TOO BUSY
JUST DOING THE INTERNS.

281
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,879
ARE YOU GONNA SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR FAN CLUB BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

282
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,046
I'VE BEEN SAYING GOOD-BYE
ALL DAY.

283
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,482
GROSS.

284
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,616
THEY'RE GONNA BE SAD
TO SEE ME GO.

285
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,986
YOU MAY HAVE TO STEP UP,
AVERY. COMFORT THEM A LITTLE.

286
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,088
NO SLOPPY SECONDS FOR ME,
THANK YOU.

287
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,522
YOU'RE A SURGICAL FELLOW.

288
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,824
MIGHT AS WELL
ENJOY THE PERKS.

289
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,092
BESIDES,
YOU NEED TO GET LAID.

290
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,227
YOU HAVEN'T BANGED ANYBODY
SINCE LEXIE.

291
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,967
SORRY, MER.

292
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,169
I-I HAVE...

293
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,171
BANGED PEOPLE.

294
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,773
I'M SCREWED.

295
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:20,774
AS LONG AS MEDUSA'S
MY ATTENDING,

296
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,310
I WILL NEVER GET TO SEE
THE INSIDE OF AN O.R.

297
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,778
UNLESS YOU'RE THE PATIENT.

298
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:25,846
OH.

299
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,547
DON'T BE ALARMED,
BUT MEDUSA'S WALKING OVER HERE.

300
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,182
DEPENDING ON HER MOOD,
I MAY HAVE TO PRETEND

301
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,550
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

302
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,785
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

303
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,854
AS YOU ALL PROBABLY ALREADY
KNOW, WE HAVE A TRADITION HERE.

304
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,989
THE HONOR OF PERFORMING
YOUR FIRST SURGERY

305

350
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,661
NOW PAN UP TO MY FACE.

351
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,663
YOU SEE THAT?
NOT A DROP OF SWEAT.

352
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,665
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I'M THAT GOOD.

353
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,034
NOW GO GET SCRUBBED.
YOU'RE GONNA FINISH UP HERE.

354
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,103
WAIT. REALLY?

355
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,372
HURRY.
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

356
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,242
AND I FINISHED
THE RECONSTRUCTION

357
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,444
WE TALKED ABOUT ON
THE YOUNG MASTECTOMY PATIENT,

358
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,213
UH, AND THE RESULT
IS FULL SLOAN.

359
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,481
I MEAN, SHE IS GONNA LOOK

360
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,050
A SCALE HOTTER
THAN GOD INTENDED.

361
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,220
UH, AND GRANDPA'S LABS
CAME BACK.

362
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,291
STABLE. UM, SCARRING IS GONNA
BE A PROBLEM, OBVIOUSLY.

363
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,493
BUT THE RESULT
IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING.

364
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,364
AND YOU THINK
WE CAN DO BETTER.

365
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,133
I DON'T KNOW. RECONSTRUCTION?

366
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,135
THAT'S PRETTY RADICAL
FOR A GUY HIS AGE.

367
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,372
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

368
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,074
WE CAN DO BETTER.

369
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,714
HEY, I WISH YOU COULD
SEE THE SURGERY I'M WATCHING.

370
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,149
IT IS A TRAIN WRECK.

371
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,118
So you're not gonna make it
by 5:00.

372
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,385
Do you want

373
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,221
TO FaceTime OR SKYPE
OR SOMETHING?

374
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,156
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE.

375
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,424
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

376
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,393
HE TURNED A PORT-CABG
Why? A STERNOTOMY.

377
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,996
WHY? BECAUSE THIS SURGEON
IS 103.

378
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,098
BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THIS
FROZEN TUNDRA

379
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,733
IS TOO DAMN POLITE TO SAY,

380
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,867
"HEY, RETIRE, OLD MAN,

381
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,204
BEFORE YOU KILL SOMEONE
WITH YOUR BRITTLE, BONY HANDS."

382
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,340
I'M SORRY. WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING THAT OUTSIDE?

383
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,741
I'M TRYING TO TAKE NOTES.

384
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,176
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO LEARN HERE.

385
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,410
HE'S JUST POKING HOLES

386
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,112
in a guy's pericardium.

387
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,547
HE'LL NEVER COME OFF BYPASS.

388
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,748
I just wish

389
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,250
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

390
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,351
Owen e-mailed me today,

391
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,220
WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I HAD PEOPLE AROUND ME TONIGHT.

392
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,190
I don't know why everyone
is so worked up about 5:00.

393
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,458
I mean, Mark is
still gonna be gorked

394
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,360
no matter when my plane lands.

395
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,228
OH, FOR PISS SAKE.

396
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,463
HE'S DOING ANOTHER GRAFT.

397
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,532
TALK ABOUT LIPSTICK ON A PIG.

398
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,808
HEY, WHOEVER THAT IS BETTER HAVE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT FOR ME...

399
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,777
'CAUSE I'M A BUSY WOMAN.

400
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,313
I'M SORRY, DR. BAILEY.

401
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,581
IT'S YOUR INTERN--
SHANE ROSS.

402
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,383
YOU LEFT ME
WITH MRS. COGGINS,

403
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,784
AND HER C.T. SCANS
JUST CAME BACK--

404
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,519
SLIDE IT UNDER THE DOOR.

405
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,322
OH, SHOOT.
HE DID. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

406
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,427
UH...

407
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,498
YEAH, UH, YEAH, SHE HAS
A SMALL... HEMATOMA.

408
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,167
UM, JUST MONITOR IT CLOSELY.

409
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,435
ONLY YOU

410
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,804
CAN MAKE A SMALL HEMATOMA
SOUND SEXY.

411
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,407
CRAZY. AHH.

412
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,279
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

413
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,481
B.C.B.'s
AT IT AGAIN.

414
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,618
WAIT. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

415
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,286
BE RIGHT BACK.

416
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,554
OH.

417
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,101
ALEX KAREV. RIGHT.

418
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,303
UH, HUNT MENTIONED THAT
ROBBINS REALLY LIKED YOU.

419
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,372
MEL BARNETT.
HERE FROM MIAMI.

420
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,840
OH, THE NEW PEDS GUY.

421
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,275
YOU'RE HEADED TO?

422
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,643
UH, HOPKINS, FELLOWSHIP.
LEAVING TONIGHT.

423
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,311
THAT'S RIGHT.

424
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,648
SO IS THIS, BY THE WAY.
HUNT'S BEEN FILLING ME IN.

425
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,151
OH, DID HE, UH, TELL YOU ABOUT
OUR EXCHANGE PROGRAM YET?

426
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,653
WE BROUGHT OVER 32 KIDS
FROM 5 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

427
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,520
IN AFRICA.

428
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,656
HUNT DID MENTION THE PROGRAM,
DR. KAREV.

429
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,858
ADMIRABLE WORK,
BUT I'M AFRAID

430
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,560
IT DOESN'T
FIT WITH MY AGENDA.

431
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,328
WE OPERATE ON SICK ORPHANS.

432
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,863
HOW DOES THAT NOT FIT
YOUR AGENDA?

433
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,200
NOT TO WORRY. I'VE ALREADY
REACHED OUT TO U.C.L.A.

434
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,635
THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE,
JUST...

435
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,736
NOT HERE.

436
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,139
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M TRYING
TO CLOSE ON A HOUSE.

437
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,647
WELCOME BACK.

438
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,451
TORRES.

439
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,687
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

440
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,689
OKAY. I HAD A LITTLE
TO DO WITH THIS.

441
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,691
WELL, THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

442
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,427
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

443
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,201
WHAT?

444
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,902
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

445
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,509
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
TO SAVE LIVES.

446
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,447
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE PULLS THIS OFF.

447
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,216
SHE MIGHT, AS LONG AS SHE
DOESN'T LOOK UP AT MEDUSA

448
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,350
DURING THE SURGERY.

449
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,219
YEAH, THAT FACE
WILL CALCIFY HER.

450
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,321
DO YOU THINK
MEDUSA'S ALWAYS BEEN MEDUSA?

451
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,357
Probably. I heard
her mom was even worse.

452
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,691
Yeah, but...

453
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,427
that doesn't give her an excuse
to act like a demon

454
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,195
from the depths of hell
itself.

455
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,333
IT'S LIKE SHE CAN HEAR US.

456
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,967
YEAH,
THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT...

457
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,603
MEANS THE INTERCOM
IS ON.

458
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,939
OHH. OH.

459
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,508
Now sit up straight.

460
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,710
I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'RE A DEMON.

461
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,712
FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

462
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,751
THERE IT IS.

463
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,219
HUH.

464
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,354
LOOK AT THAT.

465
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,955
GOD, I NEEDED THIS.

466
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,390
IT FEELS SO GOOD
TO FINALLY HAVE MY HANDS

467
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,225
ON A PROBLEM I CAN FIX.

468
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,438
NELSON IS ON STANDBY.
LET'S HAVE HIM COME FINISH.

469
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,539
DEREK, JUST TAKE A SECOND.
JUST--

470
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,808
I'LL MEET YOU IN POST-OP.

471
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,019
I HAD A PATIENT ONCE

472
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,953
WHO TOLD ME ABOUT
HIS WEDDING DAY

473
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,789
AND HOW THEY ASKED
ALL THE MARRIED COUPLES

474
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,791
TO COME TO THE DANCE FLOOR
TO DANCE TOGETHER.

475
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,360
AND THEN THEY ASKED
THE COUPLES

476
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,762
WHO'D BEEN ONLY MARRIED
A YEAR TO SIT DOWN.

477
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,631
AND THEN FIVE YEARS,
THEN TEN YEARS,

478
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,766
20, AND SO ON,

479
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,037
UNTIL THEY GOT TO
THE LAST TWO COUPLES.

480
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,040
UH, TWO SETS
OF GRANDPARENTS.

481
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,809
BEEN TOGETHER 60 YEARS.

482
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:47,314
60 YEARS
WITH THE LOVE OF THEIR LIFE.

483
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,815
THAT'S GONNA BE YOU TWO

484
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,384
AT OUR
GRANDDAUGHTER'S WEDDING.

485
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,786

CONGRATULATIONS.
I LOVE YOU.

488
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,127
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

489
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,696
WON'T YOU BE DANCING
AT YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER'S WEDDING?

490
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,798
GOTTA HAVE A PARTNER
FOR THAT.

491
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,368
WELL, IF YOU HAD A PARTNER,
WHO WOULD IT BE?

492
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,071
OH, WELL, THAT'S EASY.

493
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,673
LEXIE GREY.

494
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,581
DR. TORRES.

495
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,715
UH, NOT A GOOD TIME.

496
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,850
HEY, LOOK, THE NEW GUY,

00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:24,851
HE'S SHIPPING
THE--THE ORPHAN PROGRAM

498
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,319
OVER TO U.C.L.A.

499
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,454
YEAH, REALLY NOT
A GOOD TIME.

500
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,588
I'M LEAVING,
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

501
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,423

AND I KNOW--I KNOW DR. ROBBINS
WOULDN'TOH, ALEX.S HAPPEN.

00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,628
I'M UP TO MY EYEBALLS TRYING
TO SAVE THINGS AROUND HERE,

505
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:36,863
AND YOUR PEDS PROGRAM

506
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,798
REALLY DOESN'T MEAN
THAT MUCH TO ME, OKAY?

507
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,066
SOMETIMES THINGS DIE, ALEX,

508
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,870
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

509
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,506
TOLD YOU,
NOT A GOOD TIME.

510
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,876
APPENDIX IS OUT.

YEAH!

512
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,546
ALL RIGHT.

513
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,714
WHOO!!

514
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,848
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED.

515
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,385
I KNOW. NEXT I...

516
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,086
PULL UP
ON THE PURSE STRINGS

517
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,090
AND INVERT THE STUMP
INTO THE CECUM.

518
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,659
OH, NO

519
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,794
Okay, you ripped the cecum
wide open.

520
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,729
WHAUM...EXT?

521
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,097
WILSON, YOU HAVE TO THINK,
QUICKLY.

522
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,865
Come on. What's next?

523
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,367
THINK.

524
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,469
Go in and grab
your purse strings.

525
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,537
B.P. IS DROPPING.

526
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,806
YOUR PATIENT IS IN TROUBLE.
GO.

527
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,842
OKAY, MOVE. CLAMP.

528
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,677
IRRIGATION.

529
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,381
Irrigation.

530
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,649
Suction over here.

531
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,422
I KNOW WHY YOU FAVOR
A LESS-INVASIVE APPROACH.

532
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,791
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A CREATURE OF YOUR GENERATION.

533
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,927
I MEAN, YOU BELIEVE IN
30-SECOND RICE

534
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,929
AND INSTANT OATMEAL

535
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,765
AND THE--THE, UH,
NEWS BRIEF.

536
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,733
WELL, NO.

537
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,768
YOU'RE--YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE--FOR THE BULLET,

538
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,937
THE MEMO, THE TEXT.

539
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,805
OKAY. UM, BUT--

540
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,173
LOL. OMG. HA!

541
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,642
OKAY, WELL, AS I SAID,

542
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,176
I WILL OPEN HIM UP,
BUT HE'S A BABY,

543
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,946
SO THERE'S ONLY ROOM
FOR ONE HEADLIGHT.

544
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,583
SO YOU UNDERSTAND?
ONE HEADLIGHT, ONE SURGEON.

545
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,884
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

546
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,153
AND YOU OWE ME ONE,

547
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,457
BECAUSE I'M GIVING
THOSE FINGERS A GOOD...

548
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,858
THREE HOURS OFF.

549
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,593
OH, WAIT, WAIT.
OH, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

550
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,961
I'M--I'M SORRY. JUST STOP.

551
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,697
THIS IS MY CASE.

552
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,432
YOU WANT ME TO DITCH
MY ORIGINAL PLAN, FINE.

553
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,668
YOU WANT TO BACKSEAT DRIVE,
ALSO FINE.

554
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,835
YOU'RE THE ATTENDING.
I'M THE FELLOW.

555
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:23,970
I'LL RESPECT THAT.

556
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,972
BUT YOU'RE NOT STEALING
MY SURGERY.

557
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,774
YOU'RE WELCOME TO ASSIST,
TO OBSERVE,

558
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:28,941
TO YAMMER ABOUT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS,

559
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,810
BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

560
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,945
THIS IS MY PATIENT,
MY PROCEDURE.

561
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,184
HEADLIGHT. NOW.

562
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,486
YES, DOCTOR.

563
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,596
WE--WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRIED THE SURGERY TODAY, OKAY?

564
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,897
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

565
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,932
BEING IN THE O.R.,
THINKINTORRES--MARK--

566
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,934
NO, LOOK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN OPERATING EITHER.

567
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,636
LOOK AT US. WE'RE EMOTIONAL.
IT WAS JUST--IT WAS BAD--

568
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,805
MY HAND WENT NUMB
IN THERE.

569
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,483
00.

570
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,922
SO I DISCHARGED
OUR CLEFT BABY.

571
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,924
HE'LL BE BACK
IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

572
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,529
OH, AND I...

573
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:26,766
I DECIDED AGAINST
RECONSTRUCTION... FOR GRANDPA.

574
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,235
I KNOW IT'S NOT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT, BUT...

575
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,671
AND DON'T TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY, ALL RIGHT?

576
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,541
BECAUSE...

577
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,976
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME A LOT.

578
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,946
BUT I THINK, UM...

579
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,549
I REALLY KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

580
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,951
SO...

581
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,920
I'M GOOD.

582
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,290
THE PLASTICS POSSE'S...
GONNA LIVE ON...

583
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,931
BECAUSE, UH...

584
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,734
BECAUSE I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

585
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,326
AFTER I STOP HIS MEDICATION,
I'M GONNA EXTUBATE HIM.

586
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,095
OKAY, WE'RE ALL DOCTORS HERE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THIS.

587
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,031
I'M NOT SAYING IT BECAUSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PROCEDURE.

588
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,068
I SAY IT BECAUSE EVEN IF
YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED

589
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,104
FOR WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

590
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,672
YOU'RE NOT.

591
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:43,676
YOUR BRAIN CAN'T FULLY ABSORB
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO.

592
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,079
BUT BY SAYING THIS...

593
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:50,983
I'M GIVING YOU
A LITTLE TIME TO CATCH UP.

594
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,123
SO...

595
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,358
AFTER I STOP
HIS MEDICATIONS...

596
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,930
I'M GONNA EXTUBATE HIM.

597
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:13,740
AS INDICATED
IN HIS LIVING WILL,

598
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,042
DR. SLOAN ASKED THAT,
IF LIFE-SUSTAINING PROCEDURES

599
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,845
WOULD ONLY PROLONG
THE MOMENT OF DEATH,

600
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:23,049
THAT THESE PROCEDURES
BE DISCONTINUED.

601
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,352
SOMEWHERE TO BE,
DR. YANG?

602
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,021
NO. IT'S...

603
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,724
00 IN SEATTLE.

604
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,093
00 A.M. IN MOSCOW...

605
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,763
00 A.M. IN SINGAPORE.

606
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,065
MM.

607
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,366
CLAMP.

608
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,804
DR. SLOAN ASKED THAT IF
HE WERE UNABLE TO MAKE

609
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,939
HIS OWN MEDICAL DECISIONS,

610
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:50,910
THAT HIS DIRECTIVE BE HONORED
BY HIS CHOSEN PROXY.

611
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,887
HIS FINAL REQUEST WAS THAT
ONLY COMFORT CARE

612
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,190
BE GIVEN TO HIM
IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS.

613
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,195
ONCE SUPPORT IS REMOVED,

614
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:12,064
HE MAY ONLY HOLD ON
FOR A FEW MINUTES...

615
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,437
OR THE PROCESS
COULD TAKE HOURS.

616
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,674
I'M TURNING THE VENTILATOR OFF.

617
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,449
WE'VE SEDATED HIM
WITH MORPHINE

618
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,420
SO HE'S NOT FEELING
ANY OF THIS.

619
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,123
THANKS.

620
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,243
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME PRIVACY.

621
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,053
WE TRIED SO HARD...

622
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,891
OUT THERE IN THE WOODS.

623
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:48,294
WE THOUGHT IF WE COULD JUST
GET HIM BACK HERE ALIVE...

624
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,147
I-I CAN'T STAY HERE.

625
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,083
I'M--I'M--TELL DEREK THAT
I WAS HERE AND I HAD TO GO.

626
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,919
I AM, UH...

627
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:16,789
I'M GOING TO THE AIRPORT.
I'M GONNA GO SEE CRISTINA.

628
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,124
OKAY.

629
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,937
WHAT'S WRONG?

630
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,871
CHIEF, SORRY.

631
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:35,908
I WAS JUST GOING
SOMEWHERE ELSE, ACTUALLY.

632
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:41,080
THAT SURGERY WAS DESIGNED
FOR YOU TO FAIL.

633
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,049
THE INTERN APPY--

634
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,084
IT SETS YOU AS THE EXAMPLE.

635
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,318
OKAY?

636
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,154
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

637
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,322
WHY IS SHE SO MEAN?

638
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:52,825
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO TEACH YOU.

639
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,162
NO, WHY IS SHE SO MEAN?

640
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,164
IS IT THAT PLANE CRASH?

641
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,265
WHAT?

642
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,235
I HEARD SHE WAS
IN A PLANE CRASH

643
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,237
WITH SOME OTHER DOCTORS.

644
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:09,108
THEY WERE STRANDED IN THE WOODS
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

645
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,243
PEOPLE DIED OR ALMOST DIED
OR SOMETHING.

646
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:15,214
YEAH, YEAH, PEOPLE DIED
OR ALMOST DIED OR...

647
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,249
SOMETHING.

648
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:25,925
DR. GREY ISN'T MEAN.
SHE IS STRONG.

649
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,360
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA GO EASY
ON YOU BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT

650
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,629
THAT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE
TO YOU.

651
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,231
YOU ARE A SURGEON.

652
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,266
IT IS YOUR JOB TO FIX THINGS
OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T.

653
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,268
NOW IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT,
LEAVE NOW.

654
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,037
IF NOT...

655
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,007
DON'T STAND AROUND
IN HALLWAYS AND CRY.

656
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,409
CRY SOMEWHERE ELSE,

657
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,078
WHERE I WON'T SEE YOU.

658
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,254
YEAH, COME ON IN.

659
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,356
DR. CRISTINA YANG

660
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,893
OF SEATTLE FAME,
FORMERLY OF CALIFORNIA.

661
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,895
SIT.

662
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,966
HOW'D IT GO
WITH DR. THOMAS?

663
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,268
UH, WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO, UH,

664
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,903
TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM,

665
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,905
UH, BUT I'D APPRECIATE
IF YOU STEERED HIM

666
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,440
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S DIRECTION.

667
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,442
MM.

668
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,911
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

669
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:21,313
SEE, I'VE ASKED HIM
TO HELP YOU OUT,

670
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,950
NAVIGATING THE WATERS
AND ALL.

671
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,384
I FOUND THE CAFETERIA.

672
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:30,656
YEAH, IT'S...
MORE THAN THAT.

673
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,325
MY WORK HAS BEEN IMPECCABLE.

674
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,261
MY RECORD HERE IS PERFECT.

675
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,162
MM-HMM.

676
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,331
IF ALL YOU LOOK AT
IS OUTCOMES, MAYBE.

677
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,301
BUT ON OUR YARDSTICK,

678
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,203
YOU DON'T
SEEM TO BE THRIVING.

679
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,205
I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

680
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,009
BUT THE FACT IS,
WE WORK AS A TEAM HERE.

681
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,044
NO ONE HERE
IS A SUPERSTAR.

682
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,146
OUR HOSPITAL
IS THE SUPERSTAR.

683
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,281
AND OUR PATIENTS...

684
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,249
THEY'RE SUPERSTARS.

685
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,718
WE PRIDE OURSELVES
ON THAT.

686
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,255
NO EGO,
NO PROPRIETARY ATTITUDES,

687
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,357
NO COMPETITION.

688
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,959
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

689
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,961
WE'RE SENSITIVE
TO ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

690
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,163
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
TO SOMEONE,

691
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,398
I'M HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU NAMES.

692
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,166
DR. PARKER, THAT WON'T--

693
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,368
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A FEW DAYS...

694
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,337
SEE THE LAKES,

695
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,239
CHECK OUT
THE MALL OF AMERICA?

696
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,207
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY SAYS

697
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,109
THEY RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER
FOR THEIR KIDS,

698
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,511
BUT THE ADULTS
EAT IT UP.

699
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,346
GO GET SOME R&R.

700
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,348
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

701
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:33,052
SOFTEN UP THOSE SHARP
SEATTLE EDGES.

702
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,187
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

703
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:38,157
I'M SORRY. IS THIS R&R
A SUGGESTION OR--

704
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,992
IT'S MANDATORY, YANG,

705
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,994
STARTING NOW.

706
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,301
ANYTHING?

707
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,403
NO, NOT YET.

708
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,407
HERE YOU GO,
DOCTOR.

709
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,443
THANK YOU.

710
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,299
D-DOES MY NICKNAME
COMMAND RESPECT?

711
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,101
NO.

712
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,103
STRIKE FEAR IN THE HEARTS
OF RESIDENTS?

713
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,171
NO.

714
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,538
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

715
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,442
MM.

716
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,449
YOU'VE BEEN... HAPPY.

717
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,452
AND THE INTERNS NOTICED
THAT YOUR HAPPINESS

718
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,189
OFTEN COINCIDES

719
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,457
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF--
OF DR. WARREN.

720
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,326
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

721
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,096
OH, OH, COME ON NOW.
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

722
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:51,230
NO, I CAN'T.
I AM A GENTLEMAN.

723
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,365
AND ALSO, I DON'T WANNA.

724
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,105
WH--WH--UH...
OH, COME...

725
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,373
OKAY, I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS
BECAUSE I'M LITERALLY

726
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,475
ABOUT TO WALK OUT
OF THIS HOSPITAL FOREVER.

727
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,543
MNH-MNH. KAREV. KAREV.

728
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,378
YOUR NICKNAME'S B.C.B.

729
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,579
B.C.B.?

730
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,448
BOOTYILEY.

731
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,449
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL YOU.

732
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:17,456
THANK YOU.

733
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,558
GOOD-BYE, DR. BAILEY.

734
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,294
YEAH. BYE, KAREV.

735
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,446
HEY. SO THAT'S IT?

736
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,181
I'M NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS ONE OF
YOUR INTERN GIRLS, HUH?

737
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,415
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME?

738
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,451
MER, WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

739
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,452
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

740
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,653
DON'T MAKE THIS A THING.

741
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,221
DON'T MAKE THIS A THING?

742
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,456
MARK IS DYING RIGHT NOW.

743
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,624
AND THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE, TOO?

744
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,460
I'M JUST--I'M GONNA BE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.

745
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,262
IT'S, UH, WE'LL TALK.
IT'S NOT LIKE--

746
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,496
THAT'S WHAT CRISTINA SAID.
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

747
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,131
NOTHING IS THE SAME.

748
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,065
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

749
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,268
EVERYONE'S LEAVING
AND EVERYONE IS DYING.

750
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,535
DON'T MAKE THIS MY PROBLEM.

751
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,404
I'M FINALLY GETTING
THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

752
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,273
I CAN'T KEEP STANDING AROUND
BEING THE GUY

753
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,175
WHO SHOULD'VE BEEN
ON THE PLANE THAT CRASHED.

754
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,876
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE, MER.

755
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,678
I... I SHOULD'VE LEFT
THIS FREAKIN' PLACE

756
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,413
THREE MONTHS AGO.

757
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,282
GET OFF.

758
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:17,416
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA STAY
IN SEATTLE

759
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,518
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE.

760
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,454
LOOK,
HOPKINS WON'T WAIT FOREVER.

761
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,423
I GOT A PLANE TO CATCH,
SO BYE.

762
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,198
WATCH IT.

763
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,238
THIS IS
YOUR FINAL BOARDING CALL

764
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,174
FOR ALL PASSENGERS
FOR FLIGHT 3-9-8-4.

765
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,376
HOLD ON, PLEASE.

766
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,611
YOU JUST MADE IT.

767
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,713
YEAH.

768
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,316
THANK YOU.

769
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:26,011
SHH.

770
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,781
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

771
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,428
ON BEHALF OF THE CAPTAIN
AND OUR ENTIRE CREW,

WITH NONSTOP SERVICE
FROM SEATTLE...

774
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,399
TO ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA.

775
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,767
AT THIS TIME, PLEASE MAKE
SURE YOUR SEAT BACKS

776
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,636
AND TRAY TABLES
ARE IN THEIR UPRIGHT

777
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:52,070
AND LOCKED POSITIONS.

778
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,305
THIS AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED
WITH SEVERAL...

779
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,677
I HAVE TO GO.

780
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,645
IN THE EVENT OF
AN EMERGENCY LANDING...

781
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,414
I HAVE TO GET UP.
I HAVE TO GO.

782
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,082
FIND THE NEAREST EXIT...

783
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,916
I HAVE TO GO.

784
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,051
IN THE EVENT
OF AN EMERGENCY...

785
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,454
I'M SORRY, MISS. IF YOU COULD
PLEASE STAY IN YOUR SEAT--

786
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,656
YOU NEED TO RETURN
NO,TO YOUR SEAT.AVE.

787
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,458
NO, NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE HEARING ME.

788
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,526
I'M SORRY. WE'RE ABOUT
I NETO CLOSE THE DOORS--ANE.

789
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,861
OPEN THE DOOR, OR I'LL PULL
WE CAN'T--MISS, I NEED YOU--

790
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,329
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.
OPEN THAT DAMN DOOR...

791
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,597
AND LET ME THE HELL
OFF THIS PLANE!

792
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,731
I NEED YOU TO CALM--

793
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,633
LET ME OFF THE PLANE!

794
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:28,073
THEY SAY DEATH
IS HARDEST ON THE LIVING.

795
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,508
I HAD THE BOARDING PASS
IN MY HAND.

796
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,776
I WAS...

797
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,879
STANDING THERE
WATCHING THEM BOARD THE PLANE,

798
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,849
BUT I... COULDN'T MOVE.

799
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,851
NEXT TIME.

800
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,387
We have to get past this.

801
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,655
I KNOW.

802
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,491
What are you doing here?

803
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,360
HEY, WHO IS THAT?
POINT ME.

804
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,397
I'm sorry about before.

805
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,764
You should be.

806
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,367
I'M SORRY, TOO.

807
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:56,902
I thought you said
he was leaving.

808
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,370
I thought
you said you were leaving.

809
00:38:58,404 --> 00:38:59,638
The guy replacing Robbins

810
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,906
is just gonna
mess the place up.

811
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,642
Besides, I don't even
like Baltimore.

812
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,843
So what are you saying?

813
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,545
I couldn't get
on my plane, okay?

814
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,913
I COULDN'T GO.

815
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,581
YOU'RE SAYING YOU DITCHED
THE FLIGHT

816
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,883
'CAUSE YOU CHICKENED OUT.

817
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,485
WHAT A LOSER.

818
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,390
When Hunt lands,

819
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,791
tell him I'm staying.

820
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,394
What?

821
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,529
I just saw him here
at the airport.

822
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,497
Isn't he coming
to see you?

823
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:29,134
IT'S TOUGH
TO ACTUALLY SAY GOOD-BYE.

824
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,902
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

825
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,704
AX. SLOP TIME.

826
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,840
JUST ABOUT
TO GET YOU OVER THERE.

827
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,776
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET--

828
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,877
DR. HUNT?

829
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,413
HEY. UH, YOUR DAD TOLD ME
WHERE I COULD FIND YOU.

830
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,949
WHAT ARE--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

831
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,685
MARK SLOAN DIED YESTERDAY.

832
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,588
OH, GOD.
UM... I'M SO SORRY.

833
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,990
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK
AND WORK AT THE HOSPITAL.

834
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,560
WHAT?

835
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,963
NOTHING IS THE SAME
OVER THERE.

836
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,932
IT'S ALL...

837
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,635
I KEEP TRYING...

838
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:04,903
I KEEP TRYING
TO THINK OF WAYS

839
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,171
I COULD'VE
DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

840
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,773
AND, UH...

841
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,875
IF I'D REALIZED
THEY WERE MISSING SOONER,

842
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,210
IF I'D TOLD CRISTINA
HOW MUCH I...

843
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,812
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR THE DO-OVERS,

844
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,482
AND THERE'S NO DO-OVERS.

845
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,183
THERE'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,

846
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,985
AND I CAN'T FIX THAT,

847
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,588
EXCEPT FOR THIS,
FOWH--U.

848
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:23,955
I DIDN'T TEACH YOU,
NOT THE WAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE.

849
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,457
I-I SHOULD'VE HELPED YOU
BE STRONG

850
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,726
INSTEAD OF KICKING YOU
WHEN YOU WERE DOWN.

851
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,697
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN
YOUR JOB FROM YOU.

852
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,600
YOU DON'T BELONG OUT HERE
ON A...

853
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,001
A FARM.

854
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,637
YOU BELONG IN SEATTLE,

855
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,739
SAVING LIVES.

856
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,508
NOW COME HOME.

857
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,588
UH, I CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS ALONE, ARIZONA.

858
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:58,023
I JUST CAN'T.

859
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,695
GET UP.

860
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,264
GET THE HELL OUT OF BED
AND SNAP OUT OF THIS...

861
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,699
IF NOT
FOR ME, THEN FOR SOFIA,

862
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:09,835
BECAUSE SHE LOST A PARENT
LAST NIGHT.

863
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,269
AND I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

864
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,738
AND I WILL BE DAMNED
IF I LOSE YOU, TOO.

865
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,239
SNAP OUT OF THIS?

866
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,608
SNAP OUT OF THIS?

867
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,647
HOW THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO SNAP OUT OF THIS

868
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,849
WHEN YOU CUT OFF MY LEG?

869
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,663
YOU NEVER REALLY STOP
FEELING THE LOSS.

870
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,799
EVERYBODY...
CHEESE!

871
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,034
CHEESE.

872
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,536
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

873
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,071
OH, COME ON.
I THINK IT'S ON VIDEO.

874
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,706
SHOULD I GO OVER THERE?

875
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,274
NO, JUST GIVE HER
A SECOND.

876
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,709
WELL, NO, IT'S--I'M--
I'M PRESSING THE BUTTON.

877
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,077
IT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

878
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,545
WELL...

879
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,680
MAYBE IT'S BROKE AND--

880
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:55,814
I'M TAOH-- OVER.

881
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:56,948
NO, NO, NO. OH, NO.

882
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,083
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
I DON'T NEED--

883
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,818
WE HAVE A KID TOGETHER,

884
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,687
SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME

885
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,689
IT'S WHAT MAKES THINGS
SO BITTERSWEET.

886
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,757
WE LEAVE LITTLE BITS
OF OURSELVES BEHIND...

887
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,293
LITTLE REMINDERS...

888
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,796
A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES,

889
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,031
PHOTOS, TRINKETS...

890
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,299
HOH.

891
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,767
I GOT IT.

892
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,004
THINGS TO REMEMBER US BY

893
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,706
EVEN WHEN WE'RE GONE.
