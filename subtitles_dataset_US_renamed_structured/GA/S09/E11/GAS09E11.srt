1
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,872
Mmm.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,840
It's a big day.

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,720
Yeah. I'm excited about it.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,205
Really? Mmm.

5
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,389
You finally gonna tell
Cristina that you're pregnant?

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,299
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,102
Today is the last day
of your first trimester.

8
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,416
I'm talking about
the plane crash.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,951
The judge could
have a decision today

10
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,853
about whether the
hospital is at fault or not.

11
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:29,444
Well, that's not gonna happen.

12
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:31,224
The lawyers moved
for summary judgment.

13
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,460
Well, that is a formality.
Then it's gonna go to trial.

14
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,216
It's gonna take
months for a decision.

15
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,618
Maybe not.

16
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,488
Meredith, your first
trimester is over.

17
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,324
Let's focus on that.

18
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,559
Try and relax a
little bit. Enjoy it.

19
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,378
Tell your twisted sister.
She'll be happy for you.

20
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,164
<i>The big day is here,</i>

21
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,043
<i>the day you're
gonna hear the news,</i>

22
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,634
<i>the test result.</i>

23
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,570
<i>Is the biopsy
malignant or benign?</i>

24
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,489
<i>Am I gonna live or die?</i>

25
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,863
<i>You just want to know.</i>

26
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,076
Breakfast for two? Oh!

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,615
<i>Even if the news is scary.</i>

28
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,562
God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

29
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,497
I'm sorry. I thought you
were Cristina, and you're not.

30
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,571
Definitely not.

31
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,639
No.

32
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,324
<i>Because then you can move on,</i>

33
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,759
<i>whatever that means.</i>

34
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,039
You didn't? Yeah.

35
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,094
I did.

36
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,899
It's...

37
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,312
It's not funny. Oh!

38
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,602
I know. I know.

39
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,382
God. It's not.

40
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,889
It's hilarious.

41
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,059
It was humiliating.

42
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,288
If you wear pants, it
doesn't happen as much.

43
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,012
I just got up.

44
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,958
I was looking for a glass for
water 'cause I'm hung over.

45
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:41,466
And why are there no
glasses or mugs or anything?

46
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,929
You're pretty loud
for a hung-over girl.

47
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,737
The Chief of Surgery
just felt me up.

48
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,739
And I had to sleep on
your living room floor

49
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,886
because you have no furniture,
and now I have a neck ache.

50
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,830
Being your friend is
basically ruining my life.

51
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,145
I've heard that before.

52
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,934
You're a douche. Get a couch, or
I'm never drinking with you again.

53
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,945
Look, if you're
thirsty, all you gotta do

54
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,869
is stick your face
under the faucet.

55
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,470
Okay.

56
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,007
I'm going to the hospital where
there's food and paper cups.

57
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,097
Sir. From my mom. Cookies.

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,077
Oh, you know, that's not...

59
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,551
And there's a message

60
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,286
that I am supposed to read
to you, make sure you get it.

61
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:21,690
"Richard, I am in town
doing a case at Seattle Pres.

62
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:24,942
"Left you several messages
and wasn't sure you got them.

63
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,179
"I just want to make
sure you're okay.

64
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,032
"I'm worried about you, baby."

65
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,167
To be clear, that
was her and not me.

66
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,413
Well, please tell her I'm fine.

67
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,872
Oh, no, you gotta
take the cookies, sir.

68
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,241
That's such a nice gesture,

69
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,305
but I'm trying to avoid sweets.

70
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,761
Uh... Would you like them?

71
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,664
Um...

72
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,417
I can put them in the lounge,
and everybody can enjoy them.

73
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,385
That's a fine idea.

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,926
Morning.

75
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,211
Hey, I heard there might
be a judgment today.

76
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,235
I hope it works out for you.

77
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:09,304
No, you don't.

78
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:10,717
A judgment comes
down that quickly,

79
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,051
it means the
hospital's negligent.

80
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,742
It means you did
something wrong.

81
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,043
Which you did.

82
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,492
Well, you've obviously
been thinking that for a while.

83
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,182
I'm glad you...

84
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,962
Finally got it out in the open.

85
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,105
And for the record,

86
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,455
I really do hope it
works out for you.

87
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,619
I heard your girlfriend
did a little panty dance

88
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,214
in the kitchen this morning.

89
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,883
She's not my girlfriend.

90
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,267
Look, I know it's weird.

91
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,302
She's hot and
she's always around,

92
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,805
but I don't even
think of her like that.

93
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,252
It'd be like you and I
sleeping together. Ew.

94
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,671
I'm trying to eat my breakfast.

95
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,855
Did you hear your husband
accidentally copped a feel?

96
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,396
Yeah.

97
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,065
Oh, and he's not my husband.

98
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,917
That's why he's sneaking
in at the crack of crack.

99
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,036
You are a messed up broad.

100
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,233
Dr. Webber rejected
my mother's cookies.

101
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,151
That sounds dirty.
She's worried about him.

102
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,437
She wants me to assess his
mood. She thinks he's depressed.

103
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,772
Well, his wife died a month ago.

104
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,724
Isn't he supposed
to be depressed?

105
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,665
Of course, but, like, normal
depressed or too depressed?

106
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,245
I mean, he's fine.
He's back at work.

107
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,552
Nah, but he's not operating.

108
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,170
Maybe you should hold him.

109
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,506
And I'm done.

110
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,025
Enjoy the cookies.

111
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,309
Thanks.

112
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,074
So what do you mean,
he touched your boobs?

113
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,442
Like...

114
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,950
He's not a 13-year-old girl.
He's the Chief of Surgery.

115
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,618
Well, I'm sorry that
I don't know how

116
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,254
the Chief of Surgery
touches boobs.

117
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,022
But was it, like, a glancing
thing, like side boob?

118
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:36,369
Heather. Show me what happened.

119
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,260
No. Was it... Look.

120
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,594
Was it like this?

121
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,280
No, it was like a
move up the front.

122
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,498
Yes.

123
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,183
Ahem!

124
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,196
Murphy, let's go. We
got a facial reconstruction.

125
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,570
I gotta go, too. I'm
working with Dr. Shepherd.

126
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,607
I think he's back for
real today, operating.

127
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,276
I think we're all
happy about that.

128
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,861
I've got post-ops with Yang.

129
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:59,614
I'm on Grey. With Grey.

130
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,249
"On Grey" sounds...

131
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,362
Dr. Avery, I'm just on scut. If
you don't mind, can I tag along?

132
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,204
I don't know. Um,
sure, I guess. Come on.

133
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,156
Quick question about the case.

134
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,642
That was good.

135
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,288
You like that, throwing
Murphy on my service?

136
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,712
And made me beg to tag along.

137
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,659
Now you understand that
it's in both of our interests

138
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,460
to keep this thing
quiet, right? Relax.

139
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,062
Do you really think I
want anyone to think

140
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,787
I'm getting surgeries because
I'm sleeping with my boss?

141
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,890
I want to get them because
of my awesomeness.

142
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,171
Well, that's true, because
you are extremely awesome.

143
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,460
Hmm.

144
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,041
And that is how... Oh,
what were you saying?

145
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,842
They invented the
shunt. That is fascinating.

146
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,449
Yeah.

147
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,632
Hey. Hey.

148
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,976
So I think our big
mistake last time was,

149
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,302
we tried to get
you back too fast.

150
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,637
So this time, baby steps. Mmm.

151
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,628
Torres... Who's the patient?

152
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,658
I'm the patient.
That's right. Now...

153
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,143
This is the same muscle movement

154
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,777
you use with the
Leksell Rongeur.

155
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,913
Basically, the same motion
as hitting a ping-pong ball.

156
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,049
So that is what
you're gonna do today.

157
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,505
For how long?

158
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,001
How long did your last
meningioma removal take?

159
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,119
It was eight hours, I think.

160
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,243
Well...

161
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,972
We're gonna play
ping-pong for eight hours?

162
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,180
Not me. I've got
surgery. Well, then who?

163
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,382
Morning. We back in the saddle?

164
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,780
What?

165
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,771
You're gonna love this one.

166
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,512
What, MVC, GSW?

167
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,264
Better. Stripper pole.

168
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,731
Vitals stable in the field.

169
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,118
Has abdominal tenderness
from a crush injury.

170
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,880
She slipped. Make
sure she's all right.

171
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,871
Off a pole? It was
our anniversary.

172
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,106
They installed it
right in the bedroom.

173
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,242
I wanted it to be a surprise.

174
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,945
It was. I thought I
was getting an iPad.

175
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,722
Mmm.

176
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,518
Hey. Where'd you
get the cookies?

177
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,231
Webber didn't
want the pity cookies

178
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,866
from his girlfriend
about his dead wife.

179
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,855
He's not operating, so
Jackson's "mommy" was worried.

180
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,372
Whatever. These
cookies are awesome.

181
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,897
What about Jackson?

182
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,993
Are you still pining
over Jackson?

183
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,084
No. God. No.

184
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,536
Why? Is he seeing someone?

185
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,338
April, April...

186
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,189
Jackson is like a cookie.

187
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,476
People want to lose weight,
they don't eat the cookie.

188
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,079
But then they get so hung
up on not having the cookie

189
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,393
that their whole life
is about the cookie.

190
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,550
My whole life is not
about the cookie.

191
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,402
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,151
Is your whole life
about the cookie?

193
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,275
What do you mean?

194
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,583
You and Owen, are you
guys a thing again or...

195
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,085
I don't know.

196
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,295
All I know is,

197
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,682
having sex with a man
who used to be your husband

198
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,684
is way more fun than
when he is your husband.

199
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,784
That's all you know?

200
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,973
That is all I know.

201
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,707
Unless there's something
else you want to tell me?

202
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,459
No. Nothing I can think of.

203
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,861
Okay, then.

204
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,570
Okay.

205
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,049
Hey, Cristina.

206
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,515
Ah! Whoa.

207
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,754
Nice shot, Dr. Shepherd.

208
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,268
You put a little something
on that backhand?

209
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,641
Seven serving two.

210
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,270
Hey, Derek. Answer your phone.

211
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,589
We're in the middle of a game.

212
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,340
Well, you know
what? Not anymore.

213
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,125
The lawyer called, and they
need us at the courthouse. Now.

214
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,374
Did I miss it?

215
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,821
Damn it. I'm sorry. I got out
of the OR as fast as I could,

216
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,480
but I didn't think it was
gonna happen today.

217
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,215
Oh, God. Was it bad?

218
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,068
It wasn't?

219
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,368
We won.

220
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,220
He said the airline company

221
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,368
had a history of mechanical
problems with the plane.

222
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,925
It was in public record, and
the hospital should've known.

223
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,710
He found the hospital negligent.

224
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,430
So we won.

225
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,611
When's he gonna tell us
about the award? I mean...

226
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:39,979
I hate to be all
about the money...

227
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,269
He already did.

228
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,406
He's giving us $15 million.

229
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,709
Whoa!

230
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,061
Each.

231
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,726
So what happens now,

232
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,796
the hospital hands us
a check for $15 million?

233
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,831
Well, their insurance
company does,

234
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,662
and it'll probably take
some time to get through

235
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,687
all the bureaucratic
rigmarole, but, yeah.

236
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,655
Pending appeal,

237
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,442
the insurance company will
issue each of you a big check.

238
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,356
In the meantime, I have
a ping-pong ball to hit.

239
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,881
Yeah, I gotta get back, too. I
have James Leggett's surgery.

240
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,761
Oh. How is James?
Well, that's right.

241
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,696
You and Mark did his
original cranial expansion.

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,749
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why is everyone rushing off?

243
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,138
This is a momentous event.

244
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,127
Shouldn't we do
something, like celebrate or...

245
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,045
Okay, maybe "celebrate's"
too strong a word.

246
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,962
Dinner. We should
have a dinner. Come on.

247
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,560
We've been sitting in rooms
with each other for months

248
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,533
talking about this,
and we just won.

249
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,952
What's wrong with
sitting in one more room

250
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,770
with food in front of us?

251
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,641
I'm gonna do a quick exam.

252
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,689
I don't know what happened.

253
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,147
I was doing a sexy flexy,

254
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,483
next thing I know,
I was on the floor.

255
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,118
A sexy flexy?

256
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,437
It's a move. I could
do it perfectly in class.

257
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,118
Uh. Uh. You have a
bruise near your tailbone.

258
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,070
You must have landed
on a hard surface.

259
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,027
I landed on my husband.

260
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:16,280
And there was
nothing hard about him.

261
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,617
Leonard Olsen, 67,
came in via EMS.

262
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,431
His wife was on a
stripper pole and fell on him

263
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,568
while trying to execute a
move called a sexy flexy.

264
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,726
His physical exam indicates
possible internal injuries.

265
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,563
So why don't you get
Mr. Olsen's past medical history

266
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,466
while I order a scan?

267
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,485
See that?

268
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,736
Your face?

269
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,139
Now imagine how I felt.

270
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:49,563
We could buy a house.

271
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,744
We have a house. We
could buy another house.

272
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:52,862
We could buy five houses.

273
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,401
We could buy five houses

274
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,320
with yards as big
as football fields.

275
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,190
We could buy the team
to play on the football field.

276
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,674
Who would play against them?

277
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,827
Well, we'd buy
another team. Mmm.

278
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,496
I just wanted a house.

279
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,648
Mo' money, mo' problems.

280
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:08,266
Mmm.

281
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,455
I should've been
on that damn plane.

282
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,891
James was born with
Crouzon syndrome,

283
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,494
a genetic disorder characterized

284
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,513
by the premature fusion
of certain skull bones,

285
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,425
resulting in... A
weird-looking face.

286
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,750
James. Fine.

287
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,731
A tall, narrow head, wide-set
eyes and a small midface.

288
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,350
Now over the years, Dr. Sloan
has operated on James

289
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,641
five separate times to...

290
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,721
Try and make me less
weird-looking. James.

291
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:37,723
What? Even Sloan
said I was weird-looking,

292
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:38,997
and you worshipped him.

293
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,382
My mom thought Sloan
walked on water. No pressure.

294
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,367
Dr. Sloan was great with him.

295
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,002
I really can't
believe he's gone.

296
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,750
I know, and I know that this
isn't easy, trusting the new guy.

297
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,057
You were Sloan's guy.
That's all we need to know.

298
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,555
The only person who liked Sloan
more than my mom was my dad.

299
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,312
Again... No pressure.
I got it. Okay.

300
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,216
I know that Dr. Sloan's plan
called for this final operation

301
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,735
to consist of simply moving
the upper jaw forward.

302
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,633
I am recommending a
monobloc advancement,

303
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,342
which means, Dr. Edwards?

304
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,554
Cutting into your skull and
moving the whole midface

305
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,744
forward in one block.

306
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,079
Excellent job, Dr. Edwards.

307
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,781
Thank you, Dr. Avery.

308
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,861
Uh, if this is a
better procedure,

309
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,518
why didn't Sloan suggest it?

310
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,537
For one thing, Dr. Sloan
did not anticipate

311
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,389
that James'
forehead would still be

312
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,241
this disproportionately
underdeveloped.

313
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,549
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

314
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,312
What's up?

315
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,897
Dr. Avery was just
explaining the new plan.

316
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,932
Mark had a plan.

317
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,513
And I have a different plan,

318
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:34,914
which gives James a
more normal appearance.

319
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,470
But Mark knew
James for 16 years.

320
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,322
You've known him
for, like, uh, 16 minutes.

321
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,951
You know what? If Mark was here,

322
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,120
then I would be glad to
have this argument with him.

323
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,544
He was a plastic surgeon.

324
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:44,956
This is not your
area of expertise.

325
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,409
So if you want me to walk you
through my thought process,

326
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,178
I guess I can do
that as a courtesy.

327
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,730
What I'm not gonna do is
stand here and argue with you

328
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,831
about this procedure.
This is what I'm doing.

329
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,941
You'll walk me through your
thought process as a courtesy?

330
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,543
Are you kidding me?

331
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,490
I'll wait. All right.

332
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,434
I'm just not ready for
Callie's dinner tonight.

333
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,560
It's too weird. I know.

334
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,862
How long do you think till these

335
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,079
parasites are hitting
us up for a lung?

336
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,714
Dr. Grey. That was fast.

337
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:09,999
Glad you're back.
I have a patient.

338
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,601
She's a 19-year-old college kid,

339
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,136
nauseated with a
distended stomach.

340
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,703
And she says there's no
way that she's pregnant.

341
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,110
Oh, everybody always says that,

342
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,573
and then they always
end up pregnant.

343
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,930
Okay, but if the
pregnancy test is negative?

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,101
Okay, I will come with you. But
I am not taking point, you are.

345
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,182
Yeah, you know, that
really is a problem,

346
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,624
people claiming not to be
pregnant when they really are.

347
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,777
You know?

348
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,145
Of course I know.

349
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,025
Her boobs got huge
about two weeks ago,

350
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,326
and she's eating
everything in sight.

351
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,045
But she didn't
tell you? No, but...

352
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,951
She knows I know.

353
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,355
So you know she knows
that you know? Mmm-hmm.

354
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,568
She'll tell me when she's
ready to be happy about it.

355
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,832
Congratulations.

356
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,231
Taylor?

357
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,201
You're not pregnant.

358
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,636
Of course she's not pregnant.

359
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,883
Taylor knows better
than to bring boys home.

360
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,068
She knows she needs
to focus on her studies.

361
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,770
Get your hair out of your mouth.

362
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,588
Taylor, do you mind if I
take a look at your stomach?

363
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,052
Of course you can take
a look. You're the doctor.

364
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,441
Does that hurt?

365
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,393
Have you been constipated?

366
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,662
I don't know.

367
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,491
Speak up. No one can hear
you when you're mumbling.

368
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,810
Yes. Yes, what? Yes,
you're constipated?

369
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,580
The doctors aren't mind readers.

370
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:31,986
Okay, she's not constipated.

371
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,699
Okay. She's just throwing up.

372
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,217
Mrs. Lanz, do you
mind if we step outside

373
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,451
while the doctor
examines Taylor?

374
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,937
Taylor doesn't mind
if I stay. Do you?

375
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,281
Oh, it'll just take a second.

376
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,530
Wow.

377
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,932
That was awesome.

378
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:46,733
So...

379
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,180
You need to talk to the
patient, not the mother.

380
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,982
If the mother interrupts
you, you stop her.

381
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:51,990
So, let's start again.

382
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,241
Robbins is concerned.

383
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,604
Yeah, well, she shouldn't
be. I've thought this through.

384
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,705
I've got a solid plan.

385
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,262
So did Sloan.

386
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,825
I did James' first
surgery with Mark

387
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,410
when we still lived in New York.

388
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,061
Yeah, I know. I've read
through Sloan's notes.

389
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,746
How old is James now? He's 16.

390
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,166
When you're 16, you're worried
about your SAT score, your future.

391
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,706
Yeah, well, so am I.

392
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,619
This is gonna improve his
appearance by 5% to 10%.

393
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,504
But at what cost? It's riskier.

394
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,290
It's complicated recovery time.

395
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,034
I would stick with Sloan's plan.

396
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,795
Oh, hey. Hey.

397
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,385
I got a message about a consult.

398
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,165
Oh, yeah. Chest X-ray came back.

399
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,072
Turned out to be heartburn.

400
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,041
Oh, God. There's...

401
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,387
Why is she coming over here?

402
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,823
She's on my service. Relax.

403
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,532
Dr. Yang, I did
orthostatics on 21-14.

404
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,735
Hey, you know, uh,

405
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,121
you know, your hair and hers...

406
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,538
You know, from behind kind of...

407
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,907
Yeah, no. Totally
honest mistake.

408
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,343
Yeah.

409
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,829
Okay, these results are
weird. Schedule a tilt table test.

410
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,291
Mmm.

411
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,715
I said, "Relax,"
not make it worse.

412
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,359
Grabby. Just grabby.

413
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,039
What?

414
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,902
Are you trying to see if it's
really me or some intern?

415
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,827
I'm relieved.

416
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,879
I heard about the judgment.

417
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:06,747
Yeah?

418
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,869
It hasn't really sunk in yet.

419
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,622
Hey, will you come to
this thing with me tonight?

420
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,091
Uh, depends. What's the thing?

421
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,426
Oh, it's dumb.

422
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,561
Callie wants to have
a survivors dinner.

423
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,150
It sounds morbid
to me, actually.

424
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,298
But if you come,
it could be fun.

425
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,784
I mean, I could get drunk
and dance on a table.

426
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,130
Promise.

427
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,087
That's... I...

428
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,666
Shepherd doesn't want me there.

429
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,740
Why?

430
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:35,309
He blames me. And I get it.

431
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,911
I'm the bad guy.

432
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,847
And I don't know if I
want to be forgiven.

433
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,931
Don't play martyr.

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm not. I'm... This is...

435
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,371
I am partially responsible.

436
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,100
So if Shepherd doesn't
want me around...

437
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:50,841
Okay, you know what I
think? I think Derek Shepherd...

438
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,109
Mmm. Mmm.

439
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:58,110
Let's just leave the case and
the crash in the past outside

440
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,767
and just be here right now.

441
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,286
Just you and me.

442
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,756
Okay.

443
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,309
So now what?

444
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,478
Now...

445
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,674
You take your shirt off.

446
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,763
Okay.

447
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,432
You can take off your pants.

448
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,668
Bailey said I would find
you here. What is this place?

449
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,509
Well, it's my hall of horrors.

450
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,439
At least that's what
Adele used to call it.

451
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,531
Malignant teratoma
resected from a liver in 1985.

452
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,266
This thing is 27 years old?

453
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:34,212
It was the first
in my collection.

454
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:35,770
I'm cataloging it,

455
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,283
and then the medical waste is
gonna come and take it all away.

456
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,606
I remember this guy.

457
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:40,819
This is the guy who
swallowed all the pennies.

458
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,109
This was my intern year.

459
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,762
That's Ron Newsome.

460
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,358
He swallowed these
scissors a year later.

461
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,210
And why do you want
to get rid of all this stuff?

462
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,750
What do you want, Grey?

463
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,465
I came to ask you if you would
like to scrub in on a surgery.

464
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,183
A very cool case,
a 19-year-old girl

465
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,817
with an unknown
mass in her abdomen.

466
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,124
I'm busy.

467
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,259
Richard, I'm worried.

468
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,427
No need to worry.

469
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,740
I've heard you
haven't been operating.

470
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,615
I'm fine. I don't
need your help.

471
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,416
I need to be left alone.

472
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,852
So please let me
do what I'm doing.

473
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,554
Okay.

474
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,085
You called Shepherd on me?

475
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,456
He's not on James' case anymore.

476
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,408
He's a trusted colleague
and a respected surgeon...

477
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,932
And I'm a plastic surgeon.

478
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,085
Hey, quick question
about the sitter for tonight.

479
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,364
Yeah. Hold on for one second.

480
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,682
Well... I don't know
about the dinner.

481
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,772
It just, it feels weird.

482
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,557
We're doing the dinner, okay?

483
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,092
Um. Curly hair can't sit.

484
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,543
So I was gonna...

485
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,641
So I was gonna call art student,

486
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:37,075
'cause she's fun
and Sofia loves her,

487
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,577
but unibrow cleans.
What do you think?

488
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,321
I think that you should
learn their names,

489
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,702
and you should call Claudia

490
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:43,415
because Kelli has
only sat for us once,

491
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,667
and I don't want Sofia
with someone new.

492
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,907
Great. Claudia is... Okay...

493
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,086
Unibrow. Right.

494
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,861
Yeah. This is why I
went to Derek, okay?

495
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,209
Mark knew James. He was
with him from the beginning.

496
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,577
And you're just
the new babysitter

497
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,395
who doesn't know where
we keep the extra wipes at.

498
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,147
I waited around here for
you to insult me again?

499
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,987
I'm sorry. It's been
a weird morning.

500
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,390
But Mark was so
invested and so...

501
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,169
I was coming to tell you
that I changed my mind.

502
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm now doing the
procedure Sloan's way.

503
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,562
Oh, great. Thanks.

504
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:09,713
Sorry.

505
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,149
Your husband's
scans show that a rib

506
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,385
punctured his
diaphragm when you...

507
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,653
Landed on him.

508
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,221
We're gonna need to operate,

509
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,750
but I'm confident we
can fix the problem.

510
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:21,659
Oh, thank God.
I feel so terrible.

511
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,161
Here you go, Sheila.

512
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,190
This will make your ride to
radiology more comfortable.

513
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,291
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,848
Now about that X-ray,

515
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,802
is it okay if I have
metal on my... Cookie?

516
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,643
I'm sorry. I don't
understand. Oh.

517
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,181
You bedazzled your vagina?

518
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,600
It's called vajazzling.

519
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,152
All the stars are doing it.

520
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,904
Oh, it's a butterfly. Look.

521
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,440
That's the body and
those are the wings.

522
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,480
That's game.

523
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,415
You win again, Dr. Shepherd.

524
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,017
Wait. Just stop.

525
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,451
Great. This was fun.

526
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,880
I think you're letting me win.

527
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,655
You're a smart man.

528
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,018
I am. So am I.

529
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,687
That's why I'm
absolutely letting you win.

530
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,372
Whupping your ass
wouldn't be a smart move,

531
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,407
especially since you're a
competitive guy who likes to win.

532
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,625
Do you know who else is
a competitive guy, Ross?

533
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,316
A neurosurgeon.

534
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,330
I thought you had
what it takes to be one.

535
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,305
Mmm. See? I am a smart man,
and you are now goading me.

536
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:26,568
But you won't like
it when you lose.

537
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,892
Oh, when I lose?

538
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,488
You'll be angry and
never want to see my face.

539
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,323
That won't help me on
my quest to become you.

540
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,925
Yeah, I've told you, it's
creepy when you say that.

541
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,748
Sorry. It is what it is.

542
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,977
I need a real test, Ross, okay?

543
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,420
Dr. Ramsey has a Chiari
decompression tomorrow,

544
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,167
and I'm sure she needs
someone to help assist.

545
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,692
If you beat me in this
game, I will put in a...

546
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,510
One-love.

547
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,581
Is that for me? Thanks.

548
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,464
Catherine, what
are you doing here?

549
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,804
I'm taking you to lunch.

550
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,154
We have reservations
at The Firefly.

551
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,287
I don't have
surgery until later on,

552
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,355
and I couldn't
just sit in my hotel

553
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:06,024
knowing that you're
five miles away

554
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,859
and I haven't laid eyes on you.

555
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,795
Well, I've... I've been busy.
I haven't had time to check...

556
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,503
Richard, Jackson told
me you're not operating.

557
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,741
I'm worried about you.

558
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,059
You look thin.

559
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:20,155
Are you eating?
Are you sleeping?

560
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,611
Look, you're not my wife.

561
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:23,714
So you don't get to...

562
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,284
My wife died.

563
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,663
While I was carrying
on with another woman,

564
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,286
my wife died, Catherine.

565
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,256
So what I'm eating and how
I'm sleeping is not your concern.

566
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,025
I haven't returned your calls
because I don't want to go to lunch.

567
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,111
I don't want cookies.
I don't want you here.

568
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:44,418
If you'll excuse me now,
Grey and I have a surgery.

569
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,255
So what's the
plan for the house?

570
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,639
I'm sick of sitting
on the floor.

571
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,449
Nice!

572
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,833
Shepherd scores.

573
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,268
Ah, waiting out Yang.

574
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:03,554
She's gonna break down
and furnish the whole house.

575
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,407
What? It's genius.

576
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,976
Yes! You got it, Shepherd.

577
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,473
Wilson, your friend's choking.

578
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,841
You want to make
this interesting?

579
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,231
A hundred bucks says Shane wins.

580
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,477
You don't have 100 bucks.

581
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,133
I won't eat for a month.

582
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,931
Hey. Who's, uh... Who's winning?

583
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,195
He's got Shane on the ropes.

584
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,573
Please. Shepherd's meat.
Watch Shane's dead ball.

585
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,541
Ah!

586
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,388
That's my wrist in there.

587
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,139
Wilson, it's not too
late to back down.

588
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:30,123
I'm a gentleman.
I'll let you walk away.

589
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,618
Ah, damn it! Ah!

590
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,754
Ouch.

591
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,155
Five hundred bucks.

592
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,153
Okay, how about we take a break?

593
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:42,404
Let me take a
look at that wrist.

594
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,261
The wrist isn't the
problem. It's his feet.

595
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,981
They're not as fast as
mine 'cause he's an old man.

596
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,961
Sorry, Dr. Shepherd. I don't
know where that came from.

597
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:51,535
I occasionally get carried
away while engaging in athletic...

598
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,670
Okay. Nine-eight.

599
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,855
Let's go, bitch.

600
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,473
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

601
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,520
Okay, boys, I trust that you
remember, this is not Wimbledon,

602
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,055
but a hospital
conference room table

603
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,606
where you are working on
strengthening your muscles

604
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,542
so that one day soon,
you can operate again.

605
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,543
Also, respond to my e-mail
about the dinner tonight,

606
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,195
and let everyone know
you're very excited about it.

607
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,319
What if I'm not?

608
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,687
Come on, Derek. If
you go, everyone will.

609
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,507
Play is continuous.

610
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:23,750
What dinner?

611
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,786
They won the crash
case, 15 mil each.

612
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,271
Oh!

613
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,573
Hey, Dr. Yang, congratulations
on winning the case.

614
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,003
Are you gonna spend
some of that money

615
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,326
on furniture for the house?

616
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:34,228
Why? It's not my house.

617
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,283
Yeah. You're a genius.

618
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,271
My turn.

619
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,763
You need to forgive Owen.

620
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,827
For what? You're
holding a grudge.

621
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,429
You make it sound like he stole
my lunch from the refrigerator.

622
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,303
Derek, we won.

623
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,771
We get to move on.

624
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,340
And we have to let
Owen do the same.

625
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,176
He put us on that plane.

626
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,877
You know what?
You were chief once.

627
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,586
You make a bunch of decisions
based on what you know at the time.

628
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,181
Forgive him.

629
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,918
It's not that easy.

630
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,504
I know.

631
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,574
Forgive him anyway.

632
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,566
Let's go.

633
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,003
Wilson, you're working,
not playing ping-pong.

634
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,352
Five hundred bucks.
Let me know how it goes.

635
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,378
You are gonna do great.

636
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,807
I'll come back tomorrow
after volleyball practice.

637
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,041
Hey.

638
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,310
I know.

639
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,796
My girlfriend's hot.

640
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,941
You're wondering how I do it.

641
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,499
No. No.

642
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,534
Yeah.

643
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:06,870
Sloan... Telling me
I was weird-looking.

644
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,238
He wasn't being a jerk.

645
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,708
It was just that surgery was
only gonna take me so far.

646
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,976
I was never gonna look
completely normal, so...

647
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,546
I was gonna have to develop
some moves to get the women.

648
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,377
So he gave you a couple of tips.

649
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:20,651
Getting women was
kind of his specialty.

650
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,687
Nah. Sloan said his moves
would never work for me.

651
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,555
I had to come up with my own.

652
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,641
So I blind them with
my amazing personality.

653
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,743
They don't even notice
the weird-looking face.

654
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,324
Well, it looks
like it's working.

655
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,747
I do all right.

656
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:36,416
Although not being
weird-looking would be cool, too.

657
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:37,884
Again, no pressure.

658
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,038
Let's see what we
can do about that.

659
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,642
Whatever happened
to just regular old sex,

660
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,980
without poles or vaginas
dressed up in rhinestone?

661
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,417
When did just plain old
"get naked" become boring?

662
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,801
Antibiotic lavage.

663
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,671
And I suppose men do it,
too, bedazzle their penis?

664
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,417
I'm really trying
not to think about it.

665
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,657
Somebody look that up.

666
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,925
On it.

667
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,311
Just foolish.

668
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,912
Idiotic.

669
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:11,218
Kepner, you ever
vajazzled yourself?

670
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:14,971
Oh, right. Jesus isn't
a fan of the vajazzle.

671
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,241
Boki?

672
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,613
Feel good being back in the OR?

673
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,133
Grey, let's focus
on the patient.

674
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,302
Opening the stomach.
Babcock clamp.

675
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,654
Here you go.

676
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,922
Lap pads.

677
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,842
Whoa.

678
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,590
Look at that thing.

679
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:41,799
Well, would you
look at that. A bezoar.

680
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,867
It's a giant hairball.

681
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,814
Like, from eating your hair?

682
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,558
Like, from eating your hair.

683
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,556
I used to eat dirt.

684
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:52,834
I haven't in years.

685
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,820
Excuse me.

686
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,533
Mmm. You got here
just in time to lose.

687
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,267
Final point, advantage Ross.

688
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,958
Ah, Shepherd's got this.

689
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,093
Double or nothing.

690
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,495
What's the matter, you scared?

691
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,399
Fine. You're on, 1,000 bucks.

692
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,412
Whoo! Shane! Come on, Shepherd!

693
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,602
You got it!

694
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,561
Ah, yes!

695
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,513
Damn it.

696
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,165
Yes! Oh, yeah.

697
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,867
One more game.

698
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:35,447
No way. I won it. I get to
assist on Ramsey's surgery.

699
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,982
Get on that phone right
now and you call her,

700
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,622
or I swear to God, I'll...

701
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:41,825
Sir, again, I don't know
what came over me.

702
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,243
What I meant to say is,

703
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:46,029
I'd appreciate the opportunity.

704
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,866
Yeah. Fine. One more game.

705
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,215
This time, I play with
my dominant hand.

706
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,321
Oh, yeah. It feels so good.

707
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,851
A thousand. I'll
get it to you later.

708
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,658
I gotta go to the cash machine.

709
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,989
Oh, I'm headed that way
myself. I'll come with you.

710
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,196
Uh-huh. Ah, ah, ah.

711
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,229
It's too cool to let it
go to medical waste.

712
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,966
How are you gonna
throw all this stuff away?

713
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:17,544
You know what I see
when I look at the scissors

714
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,012
Ron Newsome swallowed?

715
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:23,000
I see the Thanksgiving
that I didn't take off

716
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26,170
so I didn't join
Adele in London.

717
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,740
The teratoma kept me
from our anniversary party.

718
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,857
Black tie.

719
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,225
She planned the whole thing.

720
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,361
I got there in time for dessert.

721
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:36,396
All this stuff that I saved,

722
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,398
that I'm so proud of...

723
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,601
Just reminds me of my failures.

724
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,174
So...

725
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:49,743
You must be happy
about the judgment.

726
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,323
What are you gonna
do with all that money?

727
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:54,747
It's blood money.
My sister's dead. It's...

728
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,082
Meredith,

729
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,383
it's a good thing.

730
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,286
Haven't you suffered enough?

731
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,239
Haven't you?

732
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,491
Well, it's just a bruised
tailbone. You can go home now.

733
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,993
And your husband
shouldn't be too far behind,

734
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,095
just maybe a couple of days.

735
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,618
Thank you.

736
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,154
No driving for him,
though, for at least a month.

737
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,706
And that goes for
sexual activity, too.

738
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,274
Uh, and...

739
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,996
So stay off the pole.

740
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,446
You just got back
from your honeymoon.

741
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,321
You come talk to me
after 45 years of marriage

742
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,822
and raising three kids.

743
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:37,357
You get tired.

744
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,337
You just want to
sit in front of the TV

745
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,812
and say it's done, it's over.

746
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,915
But you know what?
I'm not doing that.

747
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,717
I'm trying. At least I'm trying.

748
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,154
She's sorry. She
didn't mean to judge.

749
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,573
And the worst part is,

750
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,724
he looked embarrassed for me.

751
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,395
I mean, that hurts.

752
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,000
That hurts more than
a bruised tailbone.

753
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,670
I mean, I survived
45 years of marriage.

754
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,316
Is it so wrong for me to want

755
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,508
to celebrate my
anniversary with a little sex?

756
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,435
Well, is it?

757
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,673
No, it's not. No, no.

758
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,841
It's not. It's a good idea.

759
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,945
It's not. I said no.

760
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,080
So I'm gonna teach you two
how to prep for a monobloc.

761
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,636
Wait. What? No, no, no.

762
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,399
You told me that you
were reverting to Mark's...

763
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,268
Yes, but I'm just not
comfortable with that.

764
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,703
Well, you can't just
change your plan in surgery.

765
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,061
I didn't. I spoke
with Dana and Phil

766
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,041
and Dr. Jovan, the plastics
attending who's overseeing me.

767
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,397
Dr. Avery, Mark had a very good

768
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,910
reason for wanting
to do a simple jaw...

769
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,951
Of course he did. But
Mark is not here anymore.

770
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,271
So I need to do what I
think is best for my patient.

771
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,641
So...

772
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,711
I'm going to begin by shaving a
short strip along the coronal incision

773
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,142
instead of cutting
off all of his hair.

774
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,432
Hey. Maybe he can't
get it up anymore.

775
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,700
Maybe that's why he
looked embarrassed.

776
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,540
Or maybe, like the woman said,

777
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,219
he was just embarrassed for her.

778
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:05,244
Oh, come on. They're sweet.

779
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,874
You just got back
from your honeymoon.

780
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,626
I'd think you of all people
would appreciate an older couple

781
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,133
with a healthy sex life.

782
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,686
No, I do appreciate
a healthy sex life.

783
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,337
It's just...

784
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,493
Okay, look, I had sex
once on my honeymoon,

785
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:23,397
one time, the very first night.

786
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,299
We arrived in the Bahamas,

787
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:27,279
and my husband
wanted to have sex,

788
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,637
not in our well-appointed
suite, but on the beach.

789
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:33,584
So off to the beach we
went, where we had sex,

790
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:37,076
and I got sand
up in my... Cookie.

791
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:38,578
Ew.

792
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,887
Yes, a vagina full of sand

793
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:43,633
that gave me a
bad, bad infection,

794
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,647
requiring a trip
to the local doctor,

795
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,287
who confirmed the infection

796
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:51,491
and also diagnosed a few
sand flea bites on my buttock.

797
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,493
Yeah, his word. Buttock.

798
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:55,873
He also went on to
say that my buttock

799
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,137
would become very itchy,

800
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,714
and he was right.

801
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,319
So a painful infection
and an itchy buttock

802
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,165
are what I had on my honeymoon.

803
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,541
So, no, no, I am not a
fan of the beach or the pole

804
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,776
or anywhere at this point.

805
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,745
I am a fan of a bed.

806
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,698
Oh, that's right.

807
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,669
Go on, friend. Laugh.

808
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:29,896
How's everyone's dinner?

809
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,648
Good. Good.

810
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,776
Good. Good.

811
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,111
Yeah. It's good.

812
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,268
Good.

813
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,917
How'd the surgery with James go?

814
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:39,973
Uh...

815
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,224
Jackson didn't listen.

816
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,087
He went ahead with the
monobloc readvancement.

817
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:44,461
Really?

818
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,674
How long did that take?

819
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,280
Five hours. Yeah.

820
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:50,367
I stood there, you know, just to
make sure he didn't mess it up.

821
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,701
Ma'am?

822
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:53,085
Uh, perfect.

823
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,421
Okay, very good.

824
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:56,684
I'd like to make a toast.

825
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,141
Callie, no toasts.

826
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,386
You know what? Let's just
get this dinner over with...

827
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,677
Arizona stood for five hours.

828
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,091
- That's not the point.
- Yeah, I know.

829
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,826
Do you realize
how big a deal it is,

830
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,383
you standing for five
hours isn't the point?

831
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,913
Do you know what
else happened today?

832
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,264
Derek played ping-pong.

833
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,805
And lost.

834
00:33:11,874 --> 00:33:14,407
And wanted to keep on playing
'cause his wrist wasn't sore.

835
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,643
What are you doing?

836
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:18,962
Oh. Sorry. I'm just
quick texting Owen.

837
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,680
Sexting.

838
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,644
No, she's trying is
what she's doing.

839
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,719
Yeah. You just divorced the
guy, and here you are texting him.

840
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,386
Mer's right. I'm sexting.

841
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,536
Oh, well, even better.

842
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:33,660
Mark would've loved that.

843
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:36,162
Sex was the thing he loved
more than anything else.

844
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,331
And we're all
having it, so that's...

845
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,583
- Well, we're trying.
- Yeah, okay.

846
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,052
We're...

847
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,421
Don't you see that?
We're all trying.

848
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,442
We're trying to move
on, which is progress.

849
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,310
And it feels weird.

850
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:52,912
And sad and wrong,

851
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,981
but it also feels exciting.

852
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,917
I miss Mark...

853
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,255
And Lexie. And I'm...

854
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,370
Heartbroken that
they're not here tonight.

855
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:06,959
I'm heartbroken, but...

856
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:11,864
I'm also grateful...

857
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,683
That all of you are.

858
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,785
And I'm gonna celebrate that.

859
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,637
And we are gonna toast.

860
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:21,107
Come on. Toast. Pick
up your glasses and toast.

861
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,993
Oh, no, thank you.

862
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,640
Yes, she's having champagne.
Grey, we're all having champagne.

863
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,830
No, I can't.

864
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,132
Just try. Try.
Come on. Just try.

865
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,444
Is it too much
to ask you to try?

866
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,708
I can't because I'm pregnant.

867
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,771
What?

868
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,989
Aww.

869
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,307
What?

870
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,336
And I'm happy,
so let's celebrate.

871
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:41,661
Oh, my God.

872
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,791
Well, congratulations.

873
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,815
Congratulations.

874
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,549
Cheers.

875
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,829
I should've been
there, Catherine.

876
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,231
I know.

877
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,106
I failed her.

878
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,421
When she needed me
the most, I failed her.

879
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:32,085
Richard... No, I...

880
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,081
I feel like I can't grieve.

881
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,453
Like I lost the right to grieve
when I started seeing you.

882
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:43,240
But you are grieving, baby.

883
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,210
And you shouldn't
have to do it alone.

884
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,815
I would like to just
hold your hand.

885
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,734
Could you let me do that?

886
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,506
Could I just hold your hand?

887
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,306
Well, the good news is,
the surgery went great.

888
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,918
The bad news is,
you're just gonna

889
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,436
be another pretty
face from now on.

890
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,661
Thank you so much.

891
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,407
Yeah, well, Dr. Sloan
did most of it.

892
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,191
I just took us
into the end zone.

893
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:27,750
Yeah.

894
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,498
You know Jackson
told me he thinks James

895
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,099
may not even need
another major surgery?

896
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,757
Really? Jackson told you that?

897
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:38,144
Did Jackson have his hands
on your boobs when he said it?

898
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,357
What are you talking about?

899
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:41,147
You made fun of me
for sleeping with Karev.

900
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,381
Called me a skank,

901
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,761
made this "I don't
wanna be like Leah" thing,

902
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,152
and now you're
sleeping with the boss.

903
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,271
How'd you know?

904
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,406
Oh, well, I didn't.

905
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,140
Now I do.

906
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,649
Everything looks good.

907
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,763
So... You're gonna have to learn

908
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:00,000
how to stand up for yourself.

909
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,202
I know it's not
gonna be easy, but...

910
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,037
Your mom makes
me want to eat my hair.

911
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,926
I just found out it was hair.

912
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,294
I don't understand.

913
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,674
It's a condition
called trichotillomania.

914
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,175
And it makes you
want to pull out your hair

915
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,699
and, in some cases, eat it.

916
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,646
So we're gonna set
her up with a therapist

917
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,515
who's gonna help her to... No.

918
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,579
Here's what's gonna
happen, she's just gonna stop,

919
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,590
like I did when I
stopped eating carbs.

920
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,075
You just decide and that's it.

921
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,344
This is not like you
not eating carbs.

922
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:31,898
It's a medical condition, and...

923
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,326
You're gonna take
me to see a therapist.

924
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,829
Hey.

925
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,365
Hi.

926
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:55,487
I am kind of sleeping
with Stephanie.

927
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:01,894
I was hoping that you wouldn't
have to find out about it at all.

928
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,063
But of course, it's
probably gonna get out.

929
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:05,598
So I just wanted to make sure

930
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,735
that you didn't have to hear
about it from anyone else.

931
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,488
Okay.

932
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,622
Okay?

933
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,398
I miss you.

934
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,142
I feel like we were friends,
and now everything is just so...

935
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,862
So we can still be friends.

936
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,429
You know what I'm
thinking about right now?

937
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,020
Kissing you.

938
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,609
Standing here looking at you,
and all I want to do is kiss you.

939
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,994
So, no, I... I'm...

940
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,729
I'm not ready to
be your friend yet.

941
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,315
You sure?

942
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,468
Yes.

943
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,271
Yes, I'm sure.

944
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:07,927
Thank you for telling me.

945
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,162
Okay.

946
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,183
I just checked in on your wife.

947
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,824
Medically, she's fine.

948
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,492
Otherwise...

949
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,150
Your wife is horny, Leonard.

950
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:33,987
All there is to it. She wants
some sex. She needs it.

951
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,388
Oh.

952
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,707
Is the equipment working, sir?

953
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,159
Yes. Good, good. Then use it.

954
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,394
You're married.

955
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,514
If I were married, I would
be doing it all day long.

956
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,749
Just...

957
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,917
Do it.

958
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,227
Slowly.

959
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,095
Okay.

960
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:04,750
I got you a couch
with the money I won.

961
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,519
This is such a girlfriend thing.

962
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,233
Okay, I think what
you want to say is,

963
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:11,538
"Thank you for the
awesome couch."

964
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,692
Okay.

965
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,940
But we're not doing it, if
that's what you're thinking.

966
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:17,608
Why would we do
it? That's disgusting.

967
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:20,432
You're like my brother.
We drink beer and hang out.

968
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,037
Okay.

969
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,126
I mean...

970
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,906
I've never really had
a friend who was a girl

971
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,607
who didn't want to
do it, so it's weird.

972
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,682
Except Mer, and she probably
wanted me at some point.

973
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,885
Wow. You really are a douche.

974
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,820
Just shut up and drink.

975
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:45,869
Hunt, come over here.

976
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,193
<i>I can't.</i>

977
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,411
It's not your fault.

978
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,947
<i>I know that. We're
moving forward.</i>

979
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,493
<i>Just please come over
here and have a drink.</i>

980
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,577
Shepherd, I...

981
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,601
Cristina.

982
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,314
Tell your husband to come
over here and have a drink.

983
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:59,372
No, no. He's not my husband.

984
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,140
I mean, I don't
know what you are.

985
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,920
I mean, I don't know
what we are, but...

986
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:04,277
<i>You know, it doesn't matter.</i>

987
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,812
<i>All that matters now is
that I'm drunk and happy,</i>

988
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,847
<i>and I want you to be here.</i>

989
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,066
Drunk and happy with me.

990
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,386
Plus the bathrooms lock, so...

991
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:16,906
Whatever you're doing,
just... Let somebody else do it

992
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,285
and come on over
and have a drink.

993
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,242
<i>They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

994
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,694
Another time.

995
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:22,978
<i>Enjoy your party.</i>

996
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,685
<i>Because once you know
about the tumor or the prognosis,</i>

997
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,120
<i>you can't go back.</i>

998
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,522
So where are we at?

999
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,957
The insurance company
found a loophole.

1000
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:38,711
Apparently, there's a rule that
no more than two attendings

1001
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,830
are allowed on a medi plane.

1002
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:45,684
So when Dr. Robbins took
Dr. Karev's place on the flight...

1003
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,636
Anyway, they say
they aren't gonna pay.

1004
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,850
Okay, so who pays?

1005
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,073
We do.

1006
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,375
The hospital.

1007
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,756
We don't have
that kind of reserve.

1008
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,230
No, we don't.

1009
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:58,414
So?

1010
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:00,833
We go bankrupt.

1011
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:03,586
The hospital closes its doors.

1012
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,655
<i>Will you be strong</i>

1013
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,090
<i>or will you fall apart?</i>

1014
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,442
<i>It's hard to predict.</i>

1015
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:12,377
<i>So don't worry about it.</i>

1016
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,324
<i>Enjoy the time you have
before the news comes.</i>

1017
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:16,348
Around the mommy.
Around the mommy.

1018
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:19,652
<i>Yep. Ignorance is bliss.</i>

1019
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:21,241
Baby!
