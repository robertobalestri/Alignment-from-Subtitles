1
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:05,837
What have we got?

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,484
Kayla Wayne, 32,
hypotensive and tachycardic.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,252
Hypoxic even after intubation.

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,587
Severe open wound to
the mid and lower abdomen.

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,721
We're with her.
She's part of our act.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,340
I said, "Titanic"! I said it!

7
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,141
Well, I didn't hear you!

8
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,842
<i>There's no such
thing as magic...</i>

9
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,266
<i>As far as we know.</i>

10
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,201
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,848
Okay, slow down and
tell me what happened.

12
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,839
She's my wife and assistant.

13
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,693
Please don't let her die. We
were performing at a trade show.

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,228
Yeah, we weren't ready.

15
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,847
<i>And while, as surgeons,
we study the secrets behind</i>

16
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,449
<i>the human body's
intricate network of cells,</i>

17
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,735
<i>tissues, and organs,</i>

18
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,119
<i>when things go wrong...</i>

19
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,299
Performing what?

20
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,900
It was saw the lady in half.

21
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,041
No way.

22
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,127
<i>Horribly, horribly wrong...</i>

23
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,764
And he really did
with a chain saw!

24
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,984
<i>There are only so many
tricks we have up our sleeves</i>

25
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,469
<i>to put a body back together.</i>

26
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:55,653
Page Bailey!

27
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,489
Here you go.

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>But there is a kind of
power, more of a spell, really.</i>

29
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,206
I'm Lauren.

30
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,374
<i>And when we get it right...</i>

31
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,448
Um, okay. Hi, Lauren.

32
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,467
<i>It can be pretty damn magical.</i>

33
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,221
No, I'm the Lauren as in "Lauren" on
the coffee you're way over-sugaring.

34
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:15,090
Oh, yikes. I am so sorry.

35
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,436
You know what? I
didn't even look up there.

36
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,737
It's okay. I just
grabbed it, so...

37
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,306
Really, it's not a big problem.

38
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,379
This you?

39
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,381
Yeah, that's me.

40
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,117
Mmm. Well, now it's me.

41
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,770
See you around, I hope.

42
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,994
Grey, uh, whoa.

43
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,095
Yeah.

44
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,441
It looks like the
pelvis is involved.

45
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,742
We'll get more X-rays in the OR.

46
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,344
Yeah, no, no. Clearly,
you have bigger fish to fry.

47
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,196
I couldn't hear
"Titanic." The song?

48
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,599
No, it's our safe word. And I
yelled it, like, a hundred times

49
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:46,866
when the spring
flap wouldn't open.

50
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,234
Shut up, Cherise. You
don't reveal the secrets.

51
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,686
Someone get them outta here.

52
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,521
Brooks is on my moyamoya
case, but if you need her here...

53
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,379
Well, I have Ross, and I paged
Bailey, so you can take her.

54
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,081
What? But she's cut in half.
This is gonna be amazing.

55
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,384
You know what else is
amazing? A moyamoya.

56
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,596
I got paged.

57
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,698
Chain saw to the abdomen. Yeah?

58
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,888
I paged Bailey.

59
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,185
Yeah, I have Bailey's patients.

60
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,541
What? Still?

61
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,450
But she's infection-free.
Uh, clear to operate.

62
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:11,107
Okay, well, page me when
she's stable enough for X-rays.

63
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,748
How is she still alive?

64
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:13,856
I have no idea.

65
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,241
He spent the entire night? Yeah.

66
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,344
He heard you say eight days.

67
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,245
He wants to be here
when his dad wakes up.

68
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,714
You understand that
might not happen.

69
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,699
Well, of course I do.

70
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,351
But Ethan's just a little boy.

71
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,231
Nancy, you need to talk to him.

72
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,365
Prepare him for
the possibility...

73
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,743
I can't be the one
to add to his burden.

74
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,173
You talk to him, please.

75
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,763
Did I miss it? Is he awake?

76
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,754
Just because a family

77
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,543
overhears you say eight days,

78
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,746
it's not like, magically on day
eight, the guy's gonna wake up.

79
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,264
I mean, it could be
day four or day 10.

80
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,705
Oh, what is that?

81
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,108
The soundtrack of
your broken heart?

82
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:14,421
You gotta get
over that hairball.

83
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,323
I'm trying, but I
keep running into her.

84
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,278
Out of order, hairball.

85
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,951
Take the stairs.

86
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,051
Hi Kim, I'm Dr. Kepner. I hear
you're having some stomach pain.

87
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,650
She was over-served.

88
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,843
Or roofied.

89
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,845
The bartender
was a total skeeve.

90
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,681
He tried to grab my ass.

91
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,148
No, he caught your ass.

92
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,017
You threw it at him.

93
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,766
Bam! Aah!

94
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,487
Ow!

95
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,656
Is she gonna boot?

96
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,758
She should. Good call.

97
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,262
You only turn 21 once,
Kimmy. Boot and rally.

98
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,042
Can you guys focus for a second?

99
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,967
Can you remember
when the pain started?

100
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,336
At Kappa Sig.

101
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,671
No, she was making out
with Eric at Kappa Sig.

102
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,367
I think it was at brunch.

103
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,724
Oh, you're right.

104
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,337
It's probably just food
poisoning or something.

105
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,760
Can't you just pump her stomach?

106
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,330
No. Can you...

107
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,759
Smile, beeyotch.

108
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,665
Uh, I need to run some tests.

109
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,183
You'll wait for her?

110
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,618
How long?

111
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,522
'Cause my econ study
group starts in, like, an hour.

112
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,582
Who's Lauren?

113
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,317
Huh?

114
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,264
Oh, God. It's actually
a funny story. I was...

115
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,132
Did you know that Webber is
still taking all of Bailey's patients?

116
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,034
Oh, yeah. She's probably
holed up in the genome lab

117
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,457
because of that CDC thing.

118
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,004
Well, we're not the
ones who called them.

119
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,006
If she's gonna be pissed
at anyone, it should be him.

120
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,696
Who's pissed at me now?

121
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,326
Well, you called the CDC,
and now Bailey hates all of us.

122
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,593
We all called the CDC.

123
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,657
I didn't. We should,
uh, go talk to her.

124
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,353
Oh, no. I have a consult.

125
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,262
How can you go work when
you know Bailey is mad at you?

126
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,655
Hey. Oh, God. I totally
forgot about last night.

127
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,923
We were supposed
to have dinner and sex.

128
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,187
Dinner. Or just the dinner.

129
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,609
Maybe the sex
was all in my head.

130
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,994
Or it could've been
in your mind, too,

131
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,261
but it doesn't matter
because it didn't happen.

132
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,318
I forgot. But I
remember right now.

133
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,498
And I feel terrible. Okay.

134
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,133
I'm gonna make
it up to you tonight.

135
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:08,857
Yes. Tonight.

136
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,642
I...

137
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,127
<i>Dr. Rymoff, call 566...</i>

138
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,697
Miranda?

139
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,966
Oh.

140
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,235
Miranda, it's Callie.

141
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:23,638
How you doing? Can I come in?

142
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,395
Bailey.

143
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,211
I just thought you should know that
it was Jackson who called the CDC.

144
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,969
I mean, we all, you
know, we all approved it,

145
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,882
but I never thought
you did anything wrong.

146
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,785
I never thought you did anything
wrong. It was to clear your name.

147
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,160
And which is now clear, so yay!

148
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,829
I feel better. Do
you feel better?

149
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,500
Bailey.

150
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,437
Bailey, seriously?

151
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:57,906
I'm standing right here.

152
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:59,986
You're not really gonna
ignore me, are you?

153
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,554
Bailey.

154
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,011
Bailey?

155
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,720
All right.

156
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,356
Take the goal.

157
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,042
No, not again!

158
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:37,623
4-0.

159
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,247
3-0.

160
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,433
The first one didn't
count. I wasn't ready.

161
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,787
What if he never wakes up?

162
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,923
We're not there yet. Okay?

163
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,992
Hey. 5-0.

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,994
I wasn't ready.

165
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,328
Ethan.

166
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,114
Let's go, dear.

167
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,745
We're going to go back to
the hotel, just for a few hours.

168
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,963
I need a nap.

169
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,353
I'd rather stay here with you.

170
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,701
I think it's a good
idea, buddy, okay?

171
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,742
You can go get a
snack, watch some TV.

172
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,745
I promise I will call you if
anything changes, okay?

173
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,860
The kidney's shredded.
There's nothing to salvage here.

174
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:29,074
And here is part of
the large intestine.

175
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,110
I don't know where this
bleeding is coming from.

176
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,262
I mean, there's too much.
Where is it all coming from?

177
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,953
Ross, ligaclip.

178
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,437
Good God.

179
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:38,284
There are even chain
saw cuts on her vertebrae.

180
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,275
Ross, get your hands in there if
you have to and scoop out the clots.

181
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,395
PH is 6.9 and temp is 96.7.

182
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,132
It's too much. We
have to pack her.

183
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,613
I just took a look
at the films you did.

184
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,248
I'll need to plate the fracture
as soon as she's stable.

185
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, if she's ever stable.

186
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,153
Okay, we're doing
damage control. Got it.

187
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,828
Um, oh, I went to see Bailey,
and she didn't say a word.

188
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,140
Dr. Webber, has
she spoken to you?

189
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,691
Right now my attention
is on this patient,

190
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,217
who's headed for a
metabolic collapse.

191
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,296
Okay. Just let me know
when you need me.

192
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,887
Ross, faster.

193
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,990
The sooner we get her to ICU,
the better a chance she'll have.

194
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,795
That's okay, Iris. Yeah, her
arm is still weak from the TIAs,

195
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,296
but we'll take care of that.

196
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,764
Brooks, please.

197
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,599
Iris Kane, seven years old,

198
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,319
here for an omental flap that
will treat her moyamoya disease.

199
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:26,504
Moyamoya.

200
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,100
Boring! Hey, David.

201
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,225
Hospital behavior,
okay? Let me go!

202
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,071
No, no, no, honey. Mommy
and Daddy need to hear

203
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,439
how the doctors
are going to fix Iris.

204
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,463
Buddy, here. Look what
I brought from home.

205
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,118
I'm sorry. He just feels
left out. I'm sorry. Go on.

206
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,953
Karev.

207
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,750
Some of the blood vessels in Iris'
brain have narrowed and been choked off.

208
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,134
So I'll take tissue with healthy
vessels from Iris' abdomen.

209
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,256
And I will take that
tissue, place it in her brain,

210
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,763
where it'll absorb the vessels

211
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,376
and get the blood
supply it needs.

212
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,716
And this will help
with her arm strength.

213
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,152
David, buddy, come here.

214
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,686
Just sit still, okay?

215
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,322
Um, hey. David, I'll
play army men with you...

216
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,552
David!

217
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,036
I want to go! I want to go!

218
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,171
What did we talk about?

219
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,527
I'm so sorry.

220
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,057
Hands are for hugging!
We'll be right back.

221
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,425
David! Honey! DAVID: I
want to go! I want to go!

222
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,899
Go ahead. You
could just tell me.

223
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,285
They're gonna be a while.

224
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,709
Dr. Robbins, we were
just getting started.

225
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,212
Arizona.

226
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:25,341
You guys know each other?

227
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,609
Yeah. No.

228
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,133
We met briefly.

229
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,569
We had coffee.

230
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,987
Dr. Boswell is the
craniofacial specialist

231
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,873
we flew in to help
with Tyler's case.

232
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,785
You're Dr. Boswell? Mmm-hmm.

233
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,654
Yeah, how about this little guy?

234
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,796
Brain on the outside. That
can't be comfortable, huh?

235
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,793
Well, uh, welcome.
We're glad to have you.

236
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,316
Oh, are you kidding?

237
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,752
I mean, the combination of
encephalocele and facial cleft,

238
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,890
surgeons go their whole career without seeing
one of these. So I'm thrilled to be here.

239
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,607
Um, what's your approach?

240
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,078
Um, I'd like to get a couple more
scans before I commit to anything.

241
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,041
Okay, go ahead. Yeah.

242
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,015
We can talk strategy later.

243
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,324
I'll look forward to that.

244
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,240
Can't believe we got her,
huh? She's a rock star.

245
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,112
Yeah, she seems, um, competent.

246
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,316
She's too unstable.

247
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,663
We want to let her body rest
before we take her back to surgery.

248
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,631
But we're not gonna
lose her? I can't lose her.

249
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,066
You should've thought
of that before you added

250
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,774
a chain saw to
the trick. Illusions!

251
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,172
And I only added the chain
saw to try to get us better gigs.

252
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,779
Your chain saw drowned us
out when the trap door got stuck.

253
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,576
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. Magician's code.

254
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,550
Oh, my God. Really?

255
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:39,704
Okay, well, we'll let you know when
she's ready to go back into surgery.

256
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,458
So let's say I pursued a
different course of therapy.

257
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,231
Okay. Don't speak.

258
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,688
Patient suffered aortic transection,
miraculously repaired by me,

259
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,925
and then had a post-op inferior
MI that led to cardiac arrest.

260
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,194
So I induced hypothermia.

261
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,207
Let's say, hypothetically,
that I did not.

262
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,471
What else could I have done?

263
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,166
Don't answer that.

264
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,552
I could've taken him
straight to the cath lab.

265
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,172
But, no, I could not have
because had he had heparin

266
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,241
after his surgery, that would've
caused his aorta to blow.

267
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,139
And then I'd have to tell the kid
that Daddy's a goner 'cause I blew it?

268
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:22,280
No. So I was right. Right?

269
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,215
Right. I'm not asking you.

270
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,603
Girls, I really, really need
your help here, okay?

271
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,784
I need to know everything
that she ingested last night.

272
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,519
Every single thing that
went into her mouth.

273
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,943
Everything?

274
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,880
Kim's studies show that she
has a rupture in her abdomen,

275
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,799
which is bad. It
is very, very bad.

276
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,167
Hello? Okay.

277
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,618
Who is that?

278
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:48,339
Holy panty dropper. Can
he be our doctor instead?

279
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,342
Uh, Doctor. Excuse me.

280
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,227
Hi. Can you help me?

281
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,528
Please.

282
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,963
What's up?

283
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,010
Yeah, they're
drunk... No, we're not.

284
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,579
And don't care that their friend
has a serious abdominal injury.

285
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,636
Just ignore them.

286
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,671
No, my breasts are sick.

287
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,369
And I was wondering if you
had time to give me an exam.

288
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,633
I need one, too.

289
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:10,094
All right. Enough.

290
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,958
Your friend could die if
you don't start cooperating.

291
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,281
Do you understand that?

292
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,882
Fine. Jeez.

293
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,584
Chillax.

294
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,522
We pre-partied with
lemon drops at O'Briens.

295
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,724
Then cosmos at Bar Nouveau,

296
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,620
tequila shots at Kappa Sig.

297
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,177
Smoking nipples at Brunch.

298
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,528
What? What was that?

299
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,096
Smoking nipple.

300
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,333
Sweet, lots of rum,
comes out all smoky.

301
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,019
Hold on. Like, actual
smoke or dry ice?

302
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,150
Kimmy! Oh, God.

303
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,158
Let's get her down.

304
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,709
So his wife goes in the box.

305
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,577
But at some point,
there's another girl. Where?

306
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,912
That's what I can't figure out.

307
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,236
She's already in the box.

308
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,531
I know, but where?
There's no room.

309
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,721
Like my new apartment.

310
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,578
Living with Peckwell not
everything you hoped it'd be?

311
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,534
Oh, my God. Here
comes the chain saw.

312
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,673
No, no, no, no, no!
I can't watch that.

313
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,275
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

314
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,110
I can't unsee that.
I can't watch it.

315
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,568
That was amazing.

316
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,403
I can't watch it.

317
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,939
Someone's got his
bummer face on.

318
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,307
Everywhere I turn, she's there.

319
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,575
Oh, so we'll walk this way.

320
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,255
Oh, but I have to go that way.

321
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,490
Yeah, but Alex's little broken
heart needs to go the long way.

322
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,977
Oh, okay. Well, if it's for
Alex's little broken heart.

323
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,735
Alex's little broken heart
wishes you both would shut up.

324
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,805
So I'm worried about Bailey.
You know she's mad at all of us.

325
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,174
Why is she mad at
us? The CDC thing.

326
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,754
She's locked herself in that lab and will
not come out and will not talk to anyone,

327
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,822
and that's weird for her.

328
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,096
I'll talk to Bailey.

329
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,332
Yeah, see if you can
get through to her.

330
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,502
Where was I going?

331
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,974
Oh, no.

332
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,819
What happened?

333
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,955
Abdominal compartment
syndrome. Ross?

334
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,123
She's distended
and hemorrhaging,

335
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,741
causing her intra-abdominal
pressure to skyrocket.

336
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,432
We have to get her
back to the OR, stat.

337
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,951
Kayla, honey, I'm
sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

338
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,931
Ma'am, I'm gonna need the
two of you to please step out now.

339
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,499
Cherise, come on.
Please don't let her die.

340
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,584
Please save her. Ma'am.
Please step outside. Please.

341
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,086
Cherise, now. I
really need you to...

342
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,504
Come on, Cherise. Get
your hands off of me, Danny!

343
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,873
Cherise, I'm her husband,
okay? I know. I get it! I get it!

344
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,257
You don't know anything,
Danny. We're in love.

345
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,845
Which you would've figured out
by now if you paid her any attention.

346
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,986
She wanted to leave
you, but I told her to stay

347
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,805
till you got your freakin' dream
of having a show in Vegas.

348
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,192
I didn't listen to Kayla when she
said she was dying in the marriage,

349
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:26,013
dying in the stupid costume, dying every
time you made her get into that stupid box.

350
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,132
Okay. We're on the move.

351
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,785
No, I know what
you're thinking. EEG.

352
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,961
I've already done one, and he's not
having seizures. So why hasn't he woken up?

353
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,331
Yeah. I've asked every
doctor in the hospital

354
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,001
for their opinion, and
no one has any ideas.

355
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,707
Oh, my God. You're
right. Go global.

356
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:55,576
Bailey, you are a genius.

357
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,240
Oh, Cristina. How'd
it go with Bailey?

358
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,247
So great. Did you
get her to talk?

359
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,549
No. Why?

360
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,398
Okay, just remember,
bright and sunshiny.

361
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,679
Hi, Bailey. It's Arizona.

362
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,251
Listen, I understand
that you're mad.

363
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,277
But you know, there's no
reason for you to be mad alone.

364
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,835
You can be mad at us.

365
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:25,990
You can yell and scream and
throw things, 'cause we can take it.

366
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,011
She's a grown woman

367
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,424
giving us the silent
treatment. It's a cry for help.

368
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,699
Or it's her way of
saying "Leave me alone."

369
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,038
Fine. You want to give
me the silent treatment?

370
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,774
Well, I can give it right back.

371
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,245
Oh, come on,
Bailey. Just talk to me.

372
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,304
So? What'd you find
on smoking nipple?

373
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,485
The restaurant said the drink
is made with liquid nitrogen.

374
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,192
Damn.

375
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,661
Well, it blew out her stomach,
so happy birthday, Kimmy.

376
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,774
There's hardly any
gastric remnant.

377
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,342
What's your plan
here? A Roux-en-Y.

378
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,333
I'm gonna remove
the stomach completely

379
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,935
and then reattach the
intestine to the esophagus.

380
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,937
I need another surgeon,
so I paged Bailey.

381
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,690
Bailey's not operating.
Webber's taking her cases.

382
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,226
And he's with Dr. Grey
on that chain saw lady.

383
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:20,672
That's okay. I'll
just get an intern.

384
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,725
You're not doing
this with an intern.

385
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,265
I'll do it with you.

386
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,549
Really?

387
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,096
I don't get to see a
torched-out stomach that often.

388
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,332
I want to scrub in.

389
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,489
Jackson.

390
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,424
I am so sorry
about the other day.

391
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,862
Just blaming you for
everything, my whole crappy life.

392
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,597
I'm just...

393
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,015
You know, I'm crazy.

394
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,234
I know.

395
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,603
I know you are.

396
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,122
But you're about
to do a Roux-en-Y.

397
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,318
I'd say your life's
pretty good right now.

398
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,297
Hey, I heard you guys are
going back in. What happened?

399
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,899
Abdominal compartment syndrome.

400
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,217
We need to decompress
her abdomen.

401
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,602
Okay, obviously,
you don't need me.

402
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,260
By the way, it's not just
me. Bailey hates all of us.

403
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,611
Not now, Torres.

404
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,307
She won't even turn around
when someone comes to the door.

405
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,959
I mean, you'd probably
get her to open it

406
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,811
if it were you, Richard.
That's probably true.

407
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,618
I said not now. Scissors.

408
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,765
No, I'm just saying, you're probably
the one person who'd get through to her.

409
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,085
No! I am the one person Bailey
does not want to see right now.

410
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,954
I hurt her, deeply, and I'm
not sure I'll be able to repair it.

411
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:31,065
So let's leave it alone. And let's focus,
please, on saving this woman's life.

412
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,152
Sorry, Richard. I'll come back
for the pelvis when you're done.

413
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,312
Are you still on the phone
with France about the coma fix?

414
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,470
No, I'm booking us
a vacation in Nice.

415
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,316
You want a facial the first day?

416
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,577
Their trial was specific to
coma patients with head trauma.

417
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,718
Um, Mexico City's
trial focused on

418
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,254
comas triggered by
diabetic ketoacidosis, so...

419
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,189
So you have nothing.

420
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,701
Oh, good. You're
here. Come on in.

421
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,283
Uh, don't you think it's a
little packed in here already?

422
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,739
Moyamoya's rare.

423
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,519
Everybody's gonna want
to see an omental graft.

424
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,754
Come on a little closer.

425
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,745
Make room.

426
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,976
Wilson, step forward. You
can't learn from back there.

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,066
Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.

428
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,513
At what point do you
lay down the omentum?

429
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,103
That's a good question.

430
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,156
Uh, well, after you expose

431
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,642
enough of the brain to check
the blood supply with a doppler.

432
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,413
Which is good. Nice work, Karev.

433
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,401
Okay, show time. Here we go.

434
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,498
Wow. Look at that. Where?

435
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,999
Right there. In the
field. Do you see it?

436
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,391
The brain is just
so starved for blood.

437
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:07,027
If all goes well, in several
weeks, it'll suck the vessels dry.

438
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,529
It's like a vampire.

439
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:09,930
Okay. Show's over.

440
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,267
Anyone who's not
needed can head on out.

441
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,853
So if we're lucky,
in several weeks,

442
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,956
something may or may not happen.

443
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,993
Well, I'm sorry I am
boring you, Brooks.

444
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,561
Wilson, you interested?

445
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,070
Yes. Scrub in. You
can help me close up.

446
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,252
Nobody likes a dumb trixie,
but this surgery is so much fun,

447
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,672
I kind of love her for
burning a hole in her stomach.

448
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,129
Metzenbaum, please.

449
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,517
I know.

450
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,770
I know you're thinking
I'm an awful person.

451
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,089
I was actually
admiring your technique.

452
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,170
Do not get a big head about it.

453
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,660
You should talk.

454
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,462
Fancy plastics fellow who
also happens to own a hospital.

455
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,959
Which means I spend half my
time in meetings and not the OR.

456
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,762
You know, I just flew out a facial
reconstruction specialist that...

457
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,919
I don't know.

458
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:09,657
She gets to fly around the
world and perform miracles.

459
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:15,997
You're holding this
place together, Jackson.

460
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,881
That's pretty miraculous.

461
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,552
Thank you. You're welcome.

462
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,195
So the good news is,
the ultrasound revealed

463
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,316
the encephalocele itself contains
only fluid, no actual brain matter.

464
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,551
So I will resect it,

465
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,198
and hopefully, this little guy's
looking at no developmental defects.

466
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,306
Amazing.

467
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,341
It's just luck.

468
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,245
Hi, sorry.

469
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,113
Arizona, when you have a
second, I need help with Bailey.

470
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,382
Yeah. Hey. Hold on. No.

471
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,150
This is Dr. Boswell.

472
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,264
She's consulting
on the sims baby.

473
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,956
Uh, hi. Dr. Callie
Torres. Ortho.

474
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,242
Do you mind if I sit in?
You see these, like, never.

475
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,894
No, yeah. Yeah. Please come in.

476
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,880
The more, the
merrier. Yeah. Yay.

477
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:11,669
So then I will take a calvarial
bone graft from the parietal skull

478
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,772
and then use it to form
the base of the skull.

479
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,540
I mean, you can use synthetics,

480
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,809
but where I can
use his own bone,

481
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,293
farm local, right, Dr. Torres?

482
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,695
Yeah.

483
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,131
After that, it's really just
a standard cleft lip repair,

484
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,117
which I'm sure you and
Dr. Avery can do in your sleep.

485
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,752
Uh, well...

486
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,455
Yeah, but since you're here,
we could watch and learn.

487
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,739
All right, then.

488
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,528
In that case, I'll try
to show off a little.

489
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,014
I'm a little bit
in love with her.

490
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,823
Oh, good. I didn't miss it.

491
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,659
Nope. Just in time. I think.

492
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,140
Well, it was her idea.

493
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,485
No, you won't come out of the
lab. You gave us no other choice.

494
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,675
Bailey, just hear us out.

495
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,878
Yeah, Avery wants to apologize.

496
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,490
We all want to apologize.

497
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,883
Yes, he screwed up. He knows
that. He should've had your back more.

498
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,629
Derek, go. Yeah, you know,

499
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:18,897
I would be just as
mad as you are.

500
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,681
You've seen me mad.
I hang out in the woods

501
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:22,333
and I drink myself
into a stupor.

502
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,435
But the thing I've learned from
hiding out is, it doesn't work.

503
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,637
And, Bailey, we need you.

504
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,957
This hospital does
not work without you.

505
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,192
Ugh.

506
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,734
9-1-1 in the ER. Gotta go.

507
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,207
Guess what, lady?
This isn't even your lab.

508
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,776
Okay? We bought it for you.

509
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,656
Was it too much?

510
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,330
Yeah.

511
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,579
What's going on?

512
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,465
He got into his grandma's sleeping
pills. Unresponsive. BP 74 systolic.

513
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,202
Okay, let's get him to trauma room
one. Let's prep for a gastric lavage.

514
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:58,859
No! You're too
close to this. I got it.

515
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:01,428
All right, let's start a
flumazenil drip, now.

516
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:03,514
When I woke up from my nap,

517
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,095
he was on the floor.
I couldn't wake him.

518
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,687
You know what happens now? She is legally
obligated to contact social services.

519
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:14,077
It was an accident. He took an
overdose, Nancy. What were you thinking?

520
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,275
Were you thinking?

521
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,812
Please, he can't die. Oh, God.

522
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:22,149
He can't die, too. He can't.

523
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,052
<i>Dr. Meadow to
labor and delivery.</i>

524
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,943
<i>Dr. Meadow, labor and delivery.</i>

525
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,044
Is he stable?

526
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,479
I think so.

527
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:40,434
We're still monitoring him.

528
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,464
But we got him in time to
administer the flumazenil

529
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,237
to reverse the effects
of the zolpidem.

530
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:46,323
So hopefully,
he'll wake up soon.

531
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,859
Okay. Listen, about
the social services...

532
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,228
I already called them. The
social worker's on her way.

533
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,139
It's a GABA agonist. Yeah.

534
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,259
Owen, zolpidem is a GABA
agonist. We can reverse the effects.

535
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,931
Wait. We want him to wake up.

536
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,577
So why are we giving
him sleeping pills?

537
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,847
Zolpidem triggers the GABA pathway,
causing drowsiness in normal brains.

538
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,888
Where the chemical
balance has been disturbed,

539
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,435
studies have shown that the
drug can reverse the effect.

540
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,226
This could actually wake him up?

541
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,505
So how long before we...

542
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,613
All the cases said
it took only minutes.

543
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,896
Is she gonna be okay?

544
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:46,049
Um, the next 24 hours
is gonna be critical.

545
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,902
I'm hoping to see her liver
and kidney function improve.

546
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,032
So she's out of the woods?
He didn't say that, Danny.

547
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,335
Okay, you two, stop it.

548
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,991
Stop fighting.

549
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,729
Whatever happened, whatever
the history, you need to get over it.

550
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,564
It's not important.

551
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,966
She needs you.

552
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,746
You know, I...

553
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:20,851
I saw how unhappy she
was, and I just ignored it.

554
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,422
She tried to talk to me a
couple of times, and I just...

555
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,040
I just shut it down.

556
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:33,546
You know, I thought if I could get us
better gigs and make some more money

557
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,851
and become more famous that...

558
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,022
maybe she'd love me again.

559
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,278
Danny, right now we need
to be thinking about Kayla.

560
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,851
I am.

561
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,420
She doesn't need
me. She needs you.

562
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,705
You...

563
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,158
You see her. You love her.

564
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,626
You...

565
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,313
You're the one who can help her.

566
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:33,940
Alex, come on.

567
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,904
Can we at least try
and talk to each other?

568
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,041
I'd like to feel like I don't
have to avoid pediatrics,

569
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,742
that we could
still work together.

570
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,145
So that's what you're worried
about, not being on my service? Nice.

571
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,617
No. That's not...

572
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,665
I've done nothing but
try and help you. Really?

573
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,816
Because every time you say
anything, my life gets worse.

574
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,741
Things with Jason
were perfect...

575
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,405
I'm sorry if your boyfriend's an
idiot and can't deal with your past.

576
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,974
But that's on you. Obviously,
you like them like that.

577
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:58,809
As for me, I'm sick of
crazy chicks with problems.

578
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,035
Stay out of my business, okay?

579
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:02,969
Don't worry. I'm out.

580
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,426
Give it a good
squeeze. Squeeze tight.

581
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,111
There you go. There you go.

582
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,547
That's amazing. Her hand's
already stronger. I can't believe it.

583
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,633
Yeah, and no more TIAs?

584
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,070
Well, ideally, her brain will learn to
soak up the blood she's been missing.

585
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,773
Not right away. In a few weeks.

586
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,169
I want to go. Now! Now! Now!

587
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:27,472
No. No, no, love. Just a
few more minutes, okay?

588
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:28,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
We're almost done here.

589
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,631
Hey, listen. Hey, listen to me.

590
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,779
Your sister needs rest
today. You want to know why?

591
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:39,123
'Cause we opened up her
head and we put magic inside.

592
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,709
So I'd be nice to her if I were
you, 'cause she has special powers.

593
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:44,778
You understand?

594
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,646
That's what I'm talking about.

595
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:56,273
He put a vampire in her
head. I'd watch out, kid.

596
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,900
What do we do
about spring break?

597
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,668
Maybe she'll be better.

598
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:12,039
I mean, if she can eat without a
stomach, she can probably still drink.

599
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,207
Plus she'll be super thin.

600
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,409
No.

601
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:18,361
No, she can't drink.

602
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,942
Why don't you skip spring break
and help your friend get better?

603
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,778
But we already put the
deposit down on the condo.

604
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,334
Yeah.

605
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,887
Then go to the condo and
bring your books. Study.

606
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,035
You could be a doctor
or a CEO of a company...

607
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,560
or a senator one day.

608
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,474
Help each other get good
grades and become awesome.

609
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,965
Don't you want to
be awesome? Um.

610
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,244
Totally. I guess. Yeah.

611
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,519
Good! Yes. Aspire to greatness.

612
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,535
Nice work.

613
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,870
You think you got through to
Dr. Dumbass and senator Skank?

614
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,460
Not even a little bit.

615
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,164
Is it weird that all I want to
do right now is go for a drink?

616
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,632
Hey, you want to go to Joe's?

617
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,857
No, actually, thanks. I have
something. I have plans.

618
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,792
So...

619
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,428
You know what? I
just remembered,

620
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:12,098
I'm supposed to meet up with Matthew
anyway, so maybe another time?

621
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:15,419
Yeah. Good night.

622
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,605
Damn it.

623
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,007
Give it another minute.

624
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,204
Some patients woke up
after five minutes. Others...

625
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,178
Cristina, it's been an hour.

626
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,465
And there's a social worker
downstairs waiting to take Ethan away.

627
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:56,109
Dr. Bailey.

628
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,046
I put a woman back
together today, Bailey.

629
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:03,466
She was split in
two, and I fixed her.

630
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,103
Dr. Webber and I, we fixed her.

631
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:11,544
You know, I don't know what's going
on with you two, but you need to stop it.

632
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:16,546
It's childish and selfish.

633
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,749
You need to stop.

634
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,486
Dr. Bailey.

635
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:42,222
<i>It's an unusually
aggressive infection.</i>

636
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,092
<i>Do you have my results?</i>

637
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:50,441
<i>The infection came from one
doctor, and one doctor alone.</i>

638
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:52,810
<i>She's been isolated and the
infection has been contained.</i>

639
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,279
<i>This is going to be a nightmare.</i>

640
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:57,015
<i>First patient, Joyce
Basche. She didn't make it.</i>

641
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,407
<i>Dr. Miranda Bailey is a
carrier of MRSA USA600.</i>

642
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,486
<i>The only doctor who
touched all three patients...</i>

643
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,754
<i>Did you scrub? Was you.</i>

644
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,379
<i>For how long did you scrub?</i>

645
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,791
<i>It's an unusually
aggressive infection.</i>

646
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:07,959
<i>And one doctor only.</i>

647
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,361
<i>But we're gonna
take care of her.</i>

648
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:11,212
<i>- Did you scrub?
- It's a third one.</i>

649
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,080
<i>You have my results. Can
you get me my results, please?</i>

650
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,782
<i>For how long did
you scrub? I did.</i>

651
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,384
<i>One doctor alone.
She's been isolated.</i>

652
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,488
<i>Dr. Miranda Bailey...</i>

653
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,142
<i>I have the strain of staph?</i>

654
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,110
<i>5:30 p.m.</i>

655
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,099
<i>Did I do this?</i>

656
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,151
<i>Did I do this?</i>

657
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,719
<i>Did I do this?</i>

658
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,014
Hey.

659
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,613
You want to tell
me what happened?

660
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:05,939
I just wanted to go to sleep.

661
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:09,326
Ethan, you know how dangerous it
is to take medicine that isn't yours?

662
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:14,998
You could've died. Never take any
pills without a parent's permission.

663
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,418
I don't think I have
any parents anymore.

664
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,988
Hey. Hey, that's...

665
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,365
That is not true.

666
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:25,536
Your dad is...

667
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:29,896
Can't you try something else?
Why aren't you trying anything?

668
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,664
We are.

669
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:35,252
We're trying everything we can
think of to wake him up, Ethan.

670
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,020
We haven't given up on him.

671
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,606
Neither should you.

672
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,662
Hey. Hey. Come on.

673
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:58,558
It's gonna be okay. Okay?

674
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,405
Hey, you want to go
split a few dozen pitchers?

675
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:02,462
Yes. Yes, I do.

676
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,117
What is up with that?

677
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,130
I don't know and I don't care.

678
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,322
I told her the guy was a
douche. Whatever. Let's go.

679
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,364
What did the social worker say?

680
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:25,068
Uh, she said these were
extraordinary circumstances,

681
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,204
which is why she wouldn't
take Ethan into custody.

682
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,456
But I think maybe she should.

683
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,205
Nancy, he is okay.
You can do this.

684
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:38,214
No. That boy needs his mother.

685
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:43,670
A mother or father. I mean, he needs
a home, a place to run, and a school.

686
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:46,172
I can't even drive
anymore. I have cataracts.

687
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,059
I take the bus to see
my husband at the facility.

688
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,205
Is there anyone?
Anyone in the family?

689
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,007
A cousin, a distant
relative, that...

690
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,349
No, no. Rachel lost
her parents young, and...

691
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,251
No. No.

692
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
It's just me.

693
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,788
What am I gonna do?

694
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,474
Nancy, take a breath.

695
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,721
Let's just focus on finding
a solution for right now.

696
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,346
But it's not just for right now.

697
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,316
You know it as much as I do.

698
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,418
Paul...

699
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,722
is gone.

700
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:27,013
My God, how could we have
lost both of them all at once?

701
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:31,952
He Needs someone
to look after him,

702
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:34,754
and I can't.

703
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,257
I just can't.

704
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,054
Oh, crap.

705
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,190
Good luck.

706
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,227
I know. I know.

707
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,639
I have not been...
No, shut up. Shut up.

708
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,841
The most available
or attentive... Shut up.

709
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,743
I know. I'm just... Shut
the hell up. Shut up.

710
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,167
Right now I need for
you to not talk, okay?

711
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:09,989
It's 'cause you're head
of the hospital now, right?

712
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,858
That's why you haven't
called me in 11 days.

713
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:14,895
Because I hate myself. I hate
that I know how many days it's been

714
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,246
since we hung out.

715
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,434
And I hate myself even
more for asking you about it,

716
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,352
like some needy, boring,
boy-obsessed little girl.

717
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,704
Who I'm not. Let's
be clear about that.

718
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:28,991
But I do need to know
why it's been 11 days.

719
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,663
Now you can talk.

720
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,562
Because I'm the
head of the hospital.

721
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,130
Come on. That's no
excuse for standing me up.

722
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:40,798
You just said... I don't care.

723
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,300
I deserve to be treated better.

724
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:43,623
So...

725
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:46,793
You know, do that.

726
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:50,030
'Cause I just...

727
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,795
Hey.

728
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,331
I was hoping I'd run
into you again today.

729
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,954
Has there been a
change in Tyler's surgery?

730
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:15,288
No.

731
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,188
People tell you all the time
you have really pretty eyes?

732
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,711
What are they, hazel?

733
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,846
Blue?

734
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,142
They're blue.

735
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,599
I'm married.

736
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,334
I'm happily married.

737
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:31,137
Um, you met her earlier today.

738
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,990
Dr. Torres. Ortho.
Hot. Brunette.

739
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,642
And wow, talk about eyes.

740
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,464
Pretty eyes. Hers are just
magical. And I'm married.

741
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,732
Also, I have one leg.

742
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,000
I know.

743
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,709
Do you know how many Arizona
Robbins there are on the Internet?

744
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,164
One.

745
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,276
See you tomorrow.

746
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,512
You put a chain-sawed lady back together
while I suffered through a moyamoya.

747
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,308
The moyamoya fix is amazing.

748
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,411
Using the omentum
for revascularization...

749
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,380
You still trying to figure
out how the trick worked?

750
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,814
I think I figured out
where the trapdoor is,

751
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,649
but I still don't understand
when the switch happens.

752
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:27,076
You don't want to know,
kid. Trust me. It'll ruin it.

753
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,862
Hey.

754
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,584
You made the flight?
Yeah, just barely.

755
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:53,973
Thanks for the call. Sure.

756
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,156
She needs you.

757
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,066
<i>As surgeons, we are no stranger</i>

758
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:09,402
<i>to the breaks and
tears in the human body.</i>

759
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,672
<i>In fact, we sacrifice the
better part of our 20s...</i>

760
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:16,209
<i>learning every possible
way to make it whole again.</i>

761
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,845
Miranda. Open the door.

762
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:22,332
<i>But there are some wounds
a surgeon can't repair.</i>

763
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:27,370
<i>Not on our own. It takes a
kind of power we just don't have.</i>

764
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,317
I got on a plane
as soon as I heard.

765
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,840
Who called you?

766
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,075
It doesn't matter.
Yeah, it does.

767
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,479
Your intern exams
are coming up soon.

768
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:40,617
And I'm your husband. Being
there for you is my main job now.

769
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:44,119
There's no need to keep doing
things by yourself anymore.

770
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,455
Come here.

771
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,092
This wasn't your fault.

772
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,560
Yeah. Yeah, it was my fault.

773
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,695
No, you were cleared.

774
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,496
No, it was my infection.

775
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,778
I put my hands in those
patients, and they died.

776
00:38:56,802 --> 00:39:00,670
I operated on
them, and they died.

777
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:05,858
A son, and a mother
and a teacher.

778
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,593
I knew their families.

779
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:11,514
And they all died because of me.

780
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,617
Now they want me
to go back in an OR.

781
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,269
I mean, they say that it...

782
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,573
It doesn't happen again,
but nobody knows that.

783
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:25,178
I've been testing myself

784
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:28,031
and testing myself

785
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,665
and testing myself.

786
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:34,403
But it doesn't go
away, the feeling.

787
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,672
I feel so...

788
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,244
dirty.

789
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,548
Just all the time.

790
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,017
So dirty.

791
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,385
No.

792
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,156
They all died

793
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,792
because of me.

794
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,004
No.

795
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,361
They died.

796
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,696
No. No.

797
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:17,363
You've changed.

798
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,669
You want a kid.

799
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:25,805
Don't you?

800
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:30,427
I want you.

801
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,761
Owen...

802
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,747
I want you.

803
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,833
<i>There's no such thing as magic.</i>

804
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,022
Yeah!

805
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,869
<i>Not in the traditional...</i> Hi.

806
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,271
<i>Abracadabra,
genie-in-a-bottle kind of way.</i>

807
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,995
So good.

808
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:11,734
Thank you. Thank you. Cheers.

809
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,136
Mmm. Oh, my God.
She's so perfect.

810
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,754
Yep.

811
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,056
What if he's a monster?

812
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:19,792
He's not gonna be a monster.

813
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,061
What if he hates her?
What if he steals her toys?

814
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,631
Well, he is gonna steal her
toys because that's what kids do.

815
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,416
Can I have some more?

816
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,385
Lookit. She's just so happy.

817
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,532
You don't have any idea
what's gonna happen, do you?

818
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,423
I think she will
handle him just fine.

819
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,837
You're wearing a
princess crown. I am.

820
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,207
She's very good at getting
people to submit to her will.

821
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,894
Mmm. Good pinkie action.

822
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,264
Won't you give me some
more tea, sweetness?

823
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:47,528
Delicious.

824
00:41:56,898 --> 00:42:00,099
Oh, man. You're killing me here.

825
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,845
I'm trying to leave you alone.

826
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,882
I'm trying to get out of your
freakin' life, but you're everywhere.

827
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:07,407
And now you show up
to tell me the same thing?

828
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,321
Well, guess what.

829
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:11,855
<i>But there is a magic in knowing</i>

830
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:13,857
<i>that while not everything
can be repaired...</i>

831
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,381
Can I stay here?

832
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,117
Please.

833
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,821
<i>Most everything can be survived.</i>
