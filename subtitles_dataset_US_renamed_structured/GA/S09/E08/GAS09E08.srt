1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,871
<i>Most people hate hospitals.</i>

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,439
<i>But not the interns.</i>

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,976
<i>For them, the hospital
is a magical place.</i>

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,311
<i>It's poetic...</i>

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,557
<i>The rhythm of the machines,</i>

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,548
<i>the crackle of a trauma gown.</i>

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,184
<i>It's a place full of promise,</i>

8
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,619
<i>excitement,</i>

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,421
<i>surprises.</i>

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,141
<i>It's a place where
dreams can come true.</i>

11
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,288
Just look at them. They're so...

12
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,694
Fresh and shiny.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,358
Laughing, talking.
It's pathetic.

14
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,615
They're pathetic.

15
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,361
I can't believe we
used to be them.

16
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,363
Why are they
still staring at us?

17
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:38,749
Just keep busy and look cool.

18
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,739
Come here.

19
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,836
Shane's right. Just gotta focus.

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,392
On what, your boobs?

21
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,755
Breast awareness is the first,

22
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,823
most important
part of breast health.

23
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,126
My cousin thought that
she had breast cancer once.

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,945
But it turned out
it was just a big zit.

25
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,496
Hey, if you need
a breast exam...

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,752
I don't.

27
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,900
Are they still out there?

28
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,924
Rounds are in five
minutes, freaks.

29
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,210
Coast is clear.

30
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,378
Oh, thank God.

31
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,580
You're on peds, right?

32
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,326
Do you want to
switch? I'm with Yang.

33
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,695
No, I am not feeding your
creepy obsession with Karev.

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,669
Well, guess you'll be stuck

35
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,682
watching me outshine
you all day, Murphy.

36
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,307
Don't take it personally.
Yang loves me.

37
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,355
No way I'm trading. I've got
outpatient surgery with Kepner.

38
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,539
Sounds like I'll
be cutting all day.

39
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,679
Kepner... Dud of attendings.

40
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,648
No way you're doing
something that cool.

41
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,495
I like Kepner. She's the only
one who's actually nice to us.

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,759
'Cause she's the dud.

43
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,631
Well, I'm in the pit
with Medusa today

44
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,866
if anybody wants
to trade with me.

45
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,989
Nope. No.

46
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,324
No.

47
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,515
You're late. I hate late. NICU.

48
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,439
Who's presenting?

49
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,807
I guess I am.

50
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,822
Samantha Morgan,
three months old.

51
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,379
Born with idiopathic
neonatal cardiomyopathy.

52
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,592
She's currently status 1b
on the heart transplant list.

53
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,528
What did I miss? Is there
any update on a heart?

54
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,069
I know how hard it is
to just sit here and wait.

55
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:02,649
But sometimes
that's all we can do

56
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:04,084
until a heart becomes available.

57
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,390
Seventy-seven days.

58
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,237
That's how long she's
been on the list already.

59
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,338
But who's counting, right?

60
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,977
She'll get a heart.
I know she will.

61
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,490
The good news is, your
daughter's stable for now.

62
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:12,614
Oh, no, she's not...

63
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:13,782
He isn't...

64
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,551
I'm not, um... Laura
and I met here.

65
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,163
Our kids were born
about a week apart.

66
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,431
My son Rhys is right over there.

67
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,889
We're both doing
all of this alone.

68
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,301
It helps to have a
second set of ears

69
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,070
to hear all the medical jargon.

70
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,126
My turn next?

71
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,294
Yes.

72
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:31,249
Rhys Rutstein, status 2
on the heart transplant list,

73
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,612
born with a
single-ventricle defect.

74
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,219
Post-op from
receiving a central shunt

75
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,987
and recovering very well.

76
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,918
It's possible you might
be able to take Rhys home

77
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:38,957
sometime next week.

78
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,092
Home? Next week?

79
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,140
Ah, yes. There's no reason
Rhys has to wait for a heart here.

80
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,613
Oh, Noah. That's amazing.

81
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,964
Oh, I'm not...

82
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,449
I don't think I'm
ready for this.

83
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,784
I mean, I am, but...

84
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,837
Home...

85
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,439
Without all the doctors
or nurses or you...

86
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,237
You can do this. You and
Rhys are gonna be just fine.

87
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,501
We'll check in with you later.

88
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,097
Dr. Yang, did you read

89
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,693
the recent <i>West Coast
Surgical Journal</i> article

90
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,760
on central shunts?

91
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,151
They listed some very
compelling statistics.

92
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,319
No, I didn't.

93
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,921
I'll get you a copy.

94
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:14,876
Check out the new girl.

95
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,411
I was gonna call her Droopy.

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,313
But maybe Perky now.

97
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,914
Or Doc.

98
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,219
Hey.

99
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,689
Damn. Look at that thing.

100
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,724
What do those run, like, 5k?

101
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,621
I don't know. It was a
gift. Oh, from daddy?

102
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,344
No. All right.

103
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,908
Don't get defensive,
princess. Just a question.

104
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,414
Here.

105
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,582
What's this?

106
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,794
That's your job this morning.

107
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,185
I'm on my way into surgery.

108
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,687
But little Carter
Kaynig in room nine,

109
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,239
he swallowed some crayons.

110
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,952
Crayons aren't toxic. Don't
we just wait for them to pass?

111
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,253
That's exactly what his
parents have been doing

112
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,488
for the past eight days.

113
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,672
Bowel's impacted.

114
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,962
The kid's in a lot of pain,

115
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,775
and he won't be passing
it on his own, so...

116
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,416
You don't want me to...

117
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,900
Start digging, princess.

118
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,753
Oh. You might want to
take off your watch first.

119
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,025
Dr. Kepner.

120
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,927
I'm here, I'm
ready, I'm excited...

121
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,056
Stop right there.

122
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,892
That... All of that
fake enthusiasm...

123
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,093
I see through it,

124
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,983
and I don't appreciate
insubordination.

125
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:15,036
Okay? So just order these
by date of appointment made.

126
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,188
Uh... Okay.

127
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,890
Problem?

128
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,259
No, no, no. It's just...
Outpatient surgery.

129
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,229
I was hoping I'd be doing
some surgery on the outpatients.

130
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,964
Oh, you'll be cutting.

131
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,548
It's lump and bump day.

132
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,635
Yay?

133
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,314
This hospital likes to schedule

134
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,283
all of its outpatient mass
and growth removals

135
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,605
on one day.

136
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,969
So one lucky surgeon
will find herself

137
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,193
carving out glorified
pimples for 12 freakin' hours.

138
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:40,846
It's called whittling.

139
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:44,232
A hillbilly with a
pocketknife could do it.

140
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:46,334
Come with me.

141
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,173
Mr. Publer?

142
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,809
Pube-publer?

143
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,227
Pu-publer?

144
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,179
We're seeing all of them today?

145
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,110
Oh, this is just this morning's.

146
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,294
Sharpen your
pocketknife, Jethro.

147
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,639
Mrs. Crossley's getting
a pacemaker today

148
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,974
for a complete heart block.

149
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,275
Barring any complications,

150
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,788
she'll be going
home this afternoon.

151
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,078
What'd they say?

152
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,125
I'm going home
later today, honey.

153
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,360
Sorry. He's deaf in one ear.

154
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,917
We'll be prepping
you for surgery soon.

155
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,548
It should be a fairly
simple procedure.

156
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,788
Well, I wasn't planning
on staying here overnight.

157
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,119
No one's arguing
with you, honey.

158
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,742
Okay. See you soon.

159
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,191
I took the liberty of
reserving OR 3 for you.

160
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,259
I know you prefer it.

161
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:34,816
And I e-mailed you a list

162
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,195
of Mrs. Crossley's
latest rhythms

163
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,619
for reference.

164
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,724
Perky...

165
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,110
Man the NICU.

166
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,179
Check my post-ops.
Grumpy, scrubbing in.

167
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,949
Ah, look at that.
Guess I'm scrubbing in.

168
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,667
What are you doing?

169
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,621
Uh, I'm sorry. I
was... I was just...

170
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,606
Never mind. I don't
care. Go away.

171
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,910
Help. We need a doctor. Help.

172
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,345
Sir, sir. Just calm down.

173
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,875
Please. Just tell
me what happened.

174
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,027
I think we killed
Bigfoot. Bigfoot?

175
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,134
Yeah.

176
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,497
I was just having a
go at some whitetails,

177
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:45,787
and I heard this scream.

178
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:46,954
You shot someone?

179
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,690
I didn't see him. I swear.

180
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,091
It just happened so fast,

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,437
and then I saw this
thing coming at me,

182
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:52,555
like... Like a monster.

183
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,778
Did you shoot him again?

184
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,796
I may have fired a warning shot.

185
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:55,975
And I was just headed into town

186
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,398
and it jumped into the road.

187
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,645
I tried to swerve, but...

188
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,585
Wait. You shot Bigfoot?

189
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,437
And then you ran him over?

190
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,522
Yes.

191
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,311
Well, where's
Bigfoot now exactly?

192
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,559
You're doing great.

193
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,978
Ultrasound shows
the baby has C.D.H.

194
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,113
I'm sorry. What?

195
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,320
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

196
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,334
He may not be able to
oxygenate well when he's born.

197
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,952
Well, why didn't
you page Dr. Karev?

198
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,553
He's in surgery. He sent you.

199
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,005
Okay. Okay. Um,
how old is she...

200
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,389
The mom? 15.

201
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,793
Don't just stand
around watching.

202
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,182
Do something. My baby's in pain!

203
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,912
Could you page
Dr. Karev again, please?

204
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,335
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

205
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,049
I can't do this. Yes,
you can, Kimmy.

206
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,153
One last push. Here we go.

207
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,485
You're doing okay.

208
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,412
Okay.

209
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,014
Watch the monitor.

210
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,366
He's so small. He's just...

211
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,480
What do we do? What do we do?

212
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,253
You're the surgeon,
hon. You tell us.

213
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,632
Dr. Wilson, what do
you want us to do?

214
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:27,772
Okay, okay.

215
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,352
His sats are low.
We need to intubate.

216
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,308
Get me a laryngoscope
and intubation tray.

217
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,627
It hurts.

218
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,240
It's okay, sugar.
It's okay. Right?

219
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,441
Everything is okay?

220
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,865
Okay, hand me a size 4 ET. Tube.

221
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,317
No, no, no. A smaller one.

222
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,780
Sats are dropping. There you go.

223
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,587
Okay, hang on. His
epiglottis is floppy.

224
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,117
There's no time to hang
on. What's happening?

225
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,418
Somebody want to tell
my baby what's happening?

226
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,920
If I could just get
this tube to pass.

227
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,293
Dr. Wilson...

228
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,079
Got it. Got it. I got it.

229
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,625
You're doing just fine. Okay.

230
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,792
Now what's next?

231
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,017
Um, I think that...

232
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,336
How about suction?

233
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,449
And maybe you want to
put in an umbilical catheter.

234
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,739
Yes. Right. Yes.

235
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,775
And please page Dr. Karev again.

236
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,176
I'll page him.

237
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,994
Guy's crazy, wearing this thing.

238
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,546
It's like he wanted to get shot.

239
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,495
Brooks, get over here
and help with the cutting.

240
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,546
Did you cut him?

241
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,937
Don't cut my ghillie suit.

242
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,705
His what?

243
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,485
It's army issue. Best
damn camouflage there is.

244
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,142
Yeah, for war. Not hunting deer.

245
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,694
We wear orange
coats for a reason.

246
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,490
Oh, I got it. I got it.

247
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,698
You know, I myself
prefer hobbies like

248
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,250
stamp collecting or crochet...

249
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,019
Something that doesn't
involve guns and...

250
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,550
Helpless little creatures.

251
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,170
Brooks, escort the gentlemen outside.
- Okay.

252
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,926
This way.

253
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,306
Hi, Dr. Torres, we just heard
back about the cadaver nerves,

254
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,891
but the longest they
have is seven centimeters.

255
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,259
Oh, damn it. We
need more than that.

256
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,283
Okay.

257
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,694
No blood in the pericardium.

258
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,529
There's definite
abdominal guarding.

259
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,349
Brooks, reach in my left
pocket. Get my phone.

260
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,638
Go into my phone book.

261
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,957
Go to "Shepherd...
Nancy, Amy, Liz and Kate."

262
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,109
Call all of his sisters.

263
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,554
See which one's
willing to donate a nerve.

264
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:56,672
First one that bites, grab me.

265
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,129
Okay, Derek was very clear.

266
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,143
He wants to use a cadaver
nerve for his hand surgery.

267
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,615
You're on sister duty. Go.

268
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,997
You're sure you don't need
more hands, you know, in here?

269
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,131
We got this. Nope.

270
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,738
We got it. We
should turn him over.

271
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,117
Yes. See if there's
an exit wound.

272
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,640
Yeah? Okay.

273
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,543
Fill me in. Baby born
with C.D.H. I intubated him.

274
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,677
But the SATs are still low.

275
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,046
Ah, it could be
pulmonary hypertension.

276
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,613
You ever hooked a
baby up to ECMO before?

277
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,715
I never intubated a baby
before five minutes ago.

278
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,385
Okay, we hook up
catheters into his neck,

279
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,919
pump his blood into
the ECMO machine,

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,183
which puts in oxygen, and
takes out the carbon dioxide.

281
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,390
Then it cycles it all back in.

282
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:31,629
Okay.

283
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,765
You need to make sure
that you get good borders

284
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,366
so we can send this to path.

285
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,286
Whoa. That's...

286
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:39,571
Whoa.

287
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,150
What do you mean? What's "Whoa"?

288
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,619
I don't know. It
just keeps coming.

289
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,175
You don't know?

290
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,382
Hi.

291
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,850
I know how scary
this must be for you.

292
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,752
But I want you to
know that we are taking

293
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,872
really good care of you, okay?

294
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,206
Dr. Ross...

295
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,642
A word.

296
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,932
What was that?

297
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,562
I don't know, but
it's disgusting.

298
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,720
You were, like, a magician
with a handkerchief.

299
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:16,524
Ross, these lumps
are attached to people.

300
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,392
Scared people.

301
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:22,346
You need to acknowledge
that fear and ease it.

302
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,282
You look them in the eye,
you talk to them like you care.

303
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,184
Imagine if it were
you and I was pulling

304
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,019
a wormy handkerchief
out of your flesh.

305
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,457
I... I'm sure you think
this is beneath you.

306
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,792
Okay? I get it.

307
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,594
I know you guys
call me "the dud."

308
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,346
But that doesn't mean
that these patients

309
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,348
don't deserve your
respect and care,

310
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:41,749
no matter how crappy you feel.

311
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,070
Do you understand?

312
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,588
I...

313
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,322
I think so.

314
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,590
Enough with the attitude.

315
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,592
Hello?

316
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:00,568
And here you go.
I'll see you soon.

317
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,956
Dude, I am a rock star.

318
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,309
I just rocked a pacemaker
post-op dictation on my own.

319
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,295
That is how much Yang trusts me.

320
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:11,446
That's cool.

321
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,709
Not as cool as this maybe.

322
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,181
That's disgusting.

323
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,129
Yeah. Hey, have you seen Leah?

324
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,769
'Cause I have some
more gloating to do.

325
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,277
Oh, yeah. I just passed
her. 9-1-1 in the NICU, I think.

326
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,474
What do you see?

327
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,171
Is that an effusion
around his heart?

328
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,397
How could he have
C.H.F.? He has a shunt.

329
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,676
His shunt might be leaking.

330
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,961
He's tamponading. What happened?

331
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,262
He was fine, and then
he just... He wasn't.

332
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,429
It's okay. It'll be okay.

333
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,719
Let's prep him for transport.

334
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,566
What can I do? Do you need
another set of hands in there?

335
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,485
I need you to keep an eye
on my patients and call the OR.

336
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,841
Tell them we're coming up.

337
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,176
Huh. Look at that.

338
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,711
Guess I'm
scrubbing in this time.

339
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,804
The bullet's torn
through the colon.

340
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,539
We're gonna
have to re-sect this.

341
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,128
Um... She belong to any of you?

342
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,693
Brooks, do I look like
I enjoy multitasking?

343
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,884
What's the report?

344
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,014
I left messages for
Kathleen and Amy.

345
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,515
Nancy hung up on
me. I called her back.

346
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,484
She hung up on me again so
I'm guessing that she's a "no."

347
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:13,753
But I did talk to Lizzie,
and she might be in.

348
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,160
Also, she wanted to know
what size Zola wears now.

349
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,746
And I thought maybe a
2T, but that's just a guess.

350
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,109
Anyway, can I scrub in?

351
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,265
Meredith.

352
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,862
I just got a call from Lizzie.

353
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,170
She's under the impression
she's gonna donate a nerve

354
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,321
to me.

355
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,538
Yay!

356
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,091
Not yay.

357
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,205
I thought I made it clear, I
didn't want my family involved.

358
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,128
Well, a live donor
nerve is preferable,

359
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,708
and it's definitely
easier to find.

360
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,165
My hand, my
sisters, my decision.

361
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,579
The longer we wait,
the less chance we have

362
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,785
that it will work.

363
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,086
And we need this to work,

364
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,587
sooner rather than later.

365
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,097
Sounds like a no-brainer to me.

366
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,358
But what do I know?
I don't have sisters.

367
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,926
Who'd you get to make the calls?

368
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,566
Call them all back
and undo what you did.

369
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,283
Now.

370
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,788
Don't undo a thing.

371
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,724
You're doing great.

372
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,926
You've isolated the
jugular and the carotid,

373
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,277
avoided the vagus nerve.

374
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,257
Now you need to put in a
venous drainage cannula.

375
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,610
I hadn't even...

376
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,633
He's coding. Switch with me.

377
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,363
You need to do CPR while
I hook the kid up to ECMO.

378
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,848
At the same time?
How will that work?

379
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,573
Start the compressions now.

380
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,492
Stop.

381
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,413
Go.

382
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,747
Keep going.

383
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,567
Stop.

384
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,886
Okay. Keep going.

385
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,090
Stop.

386
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,729
Go.

387
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,451
How long have we been going?

388
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,752
Twenty minutes.

389
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,971
Stop.

390
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,887
Karev, I heard you
had a crash ECMO.

391
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,356
You need my help? You
need me to take over?

392
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,308
No, no, just connecting
it to the circuit.

393
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,464
Okay.

394
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,550
Initiate bypass.

395
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,142
We did it.

396
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,709
Son of a bitch.

397
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,240
And it seems like only
yesterday that I was

398
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:16,425
showing you how to do your
first pulmonary hypoplasia.

399
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,515
I hope you're
taking notes, Wilson.

400
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,917
He's one of the good ones.

401
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,589
So what's next?

402
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,318
Well, now that he's
hooked up to ECMO,

403
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,119
the baby needs to
be monitored 24/7.

404
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,344
Gonna be a long day
and a longer night.

405
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,597
You might want to go
grab a power nap, princess.

406
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,083
Why do you keep
calling me princess?

407
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,085
Have you seen yourself?

408
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:50,965
You see anything?

409
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,700
Looks great so far, ma'am.

410
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,322
What is it?

411
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,595
Hi.

412
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,164
I know this must be
scary for you right now.

413
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,334
I want you to know we're gonna
take really good care of you, okay?

414
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,704
There's just a little
gross... Growth... Bump

415
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,607
on your...

416
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,009
Bottom.

417
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,077
Excuse me.

418
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,435
What do you do
when you need to...

419
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,952
Sorry.

420
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,305
When you need the
lab to fast-track a...

421
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,440
A specimen?

422
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,025
What is wrong with you?

423
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,777
That lady has the most
disgusting butt scab. It's just...

424
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,144
Oh, my gosh. You're a child.

425
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,524
Tell the lab to...

426
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,627
Tell them that I said

427
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,446
to push this to
the front of the line.

428
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,648
We're gonna need
those results stat.

429
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,860
Would you mind doing it?

430
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,318
Nope. Yours.

431
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,474
Leah's a shark.

432
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,120
Don't know why
Yang can't see it.

433
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,344
Oh, how great does this feel?

434
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:14,114
Hit me, vitamin D.
Mama needs a power nap.

435
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,749
I smell crab cakes.

436
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,618
We're by the kitchen.

437
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,470
No, it's not crab
cakes. It's meat loaf.

438
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,872
I love/hate it so much.

439
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,860
Oh, man. It's like
Vegas in there.

440
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,378
No idea when it's day or night.

441
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:30,815
Sun, meet Shane. Shane, Sun.

442
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,750
Nice change from
the black hole of sepsis

443
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,530
I've been staring at
for the past half-hour.

444
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,388
You should see the thing
growing on this one woman's ass.

445
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,573
It is so nasty.

446
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,710
Wouldn't bother me. I am
just fine with nasty things.

447
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,078
Although all Karev does
is call me "princess."

448
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,416
What is that? I don't
act like some priss, do I?

449
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:53,537
Am I prissy?

450
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,443
What?

451
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,078
I am not prissy.

452
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,932
How do you like that?

453
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,201
You spit like a priss.

454
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,417
Stop.

455
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,266
Just let it go to voice mail.

456
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,251
I can't handle another
raging Shepherd sister.

457
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,025
Actually, I think
you should take this.

458
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,077
It says "Bigfoot. 9-1-1."

459
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,447
I'm here. I got your
page. How can I help?

460
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,748
Oh, sorry, sorry. That was me.

461
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,732
I needed Grey. I forgot
you had her phone.

462
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,284
Well, maybe I can
help since I'm here.

463
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,028
I could... I could
irrigate that wound or...

464
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,929
Are you gonna get that?

465
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,130
Hello. Dr. Grey's
phone. Heather speaking.

466
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,686
Oh, hey, Lizzie.

467
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,075
Yeah, I know. She just
keeps getting cuter every day.

468
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,107
Um... Okay.

469
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,442
I'll ask.

470
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,394
Great. Bye.

471
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,695
What did she say?

472
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,309
That Zola's the
cutest niece ever

473
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,265
and she's wondering if
you're visiting for Christmas,

474
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,149
'cause there should be snow.

475
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,278
Okay. What about the nerve?

476
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,734
Uh, she's getting back to me.

477
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,738
Hi, again.

478
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,574
Mmm-hmm. I understand.

479
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,775
It is a lot to ask.

480
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,278
Hey, hang on.

481
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,448
Heather Brooks.

482
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,665
Hi, Kathleen.

483
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,945
How did you get my
cell phone number?

484
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:15,136
Sorry. Hang on.

485
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,037
Yes, Liz.

486
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,117
I have Kathleen on another line.

487
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,925
I don't know if she
booked her flight yet.

488
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,638
Please don't make me
repeat all of that to her.

489
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,341
Sorry. The other line's going.

490
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,098
Hello. Oh, hang on.

491
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,578
Dr. Grey, it's
Dr. Simpson's office.

492
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,712
They want to confirm
your ultrasound.

493
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,119
Hang up. Right now.

494
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,924
Oh, is Rhys out
of surgery already?

495
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,281
No.

496
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,411
I just... I couldn't wait in
the surgical waiting area.

497
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,047
It's where I found out my wife
had died. It's not my favorite place.

498
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,171
Oh. I'm sorry.

499
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,451
They'll page me when it's done.

500
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:53,690
And in the meantime,

501
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,004
I get to watch Laura play
solitaire on her phone.

502
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,510
I'm addicted. It's pathetic.

503
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,190
She never takes her
eyes off the screen.

504
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:00,008
You know, I don't even know
if she knows what I look like.

505
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,250
Big nose, receding
hairline, tiny, beady eyes.

506
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,231
Well, I've been told I
look like George Clooney.

507
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,433
Dr. Edwards, I've got UNOS
on the line for Dr. Yang.

508
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,269
Oh, my God. It could
be Samantha's heart.

509
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,558
Or it could be a routine call.

510
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,538
This is Dr. Edwards.

511
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,939
Part of my job is to
keep you from letting

512
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,283
your emotions get away from you.

513
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:17,347
Remember?

514
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,395
But, yeah, it
could be her heart,

515
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,702
and by the end of the day,

516
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,370
she could have a
chance at a real life.

517
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,700
And Rhys is gonna
get out of surgery.

518
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,800
He's gonna be fine. Wait. What?

519
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,158
And they're both
gonna be regular kids.

520
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,971
And you and I are gonna keep
being there for each other...

521
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,873
'Cause I can't imagine going
through any of this without you.

522
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,531
I mean, I... I can't
imagine life without you.

523
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,436
How is that for not letting my
emotions get away from me?

524
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,154
Okay. Good-bye.

525
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,667
Was that... Is there a heart?

526
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,943
I'm... I'm gonna
go find Dr. Yang.

527
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,716
Dr. Yang,

528
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,263
I just received a
call from UNOS.

529
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,664
A heart's available.
We have an hour

530
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,968
to let them know if we want it.

531
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,290
We want it. Call
them back right away.

532
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,127
Charge to 5.

533
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,856
Is there a heart for Samantha?

534
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,476
Mr. Rutstein,
could I talk to you?

535
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,956
Uh, what is it? Is Rhys okay?

536
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,312
He's still in surgery.

537
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,163
He's in critical condition.

538
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,844
Oh, God. It's gonna be fine.

539
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,901
Mr. Rutstein, could I
speak with you privately?

540
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,831
I'll be outside if
you need anything.

541
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,555
No.

542
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,808
Stay. I want you
here. I need you here.

543
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:11,478
Rhys has gotten worse,

544
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:14,264
much worse, causing
his status to change.

545
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,850
He's been moved to the
top of the transplant list.

546
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,252
There is a heart.

547
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,654
Our team is harvesting
it as we speak.

548
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:22,072
But if it's in good condition,

549
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,607
it's not going to Samantha.

550
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,741
It's going to Rhys.

551
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,935
<i>Dr. Stein, call dialysis.</i>

552
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,793
<i>Dr. Stein, call dialysis.</i>

553
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,082
Don't even try to get in
on the transplant. It's mine.

554
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,466
We don't have to do this.

555
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,068
The fighting, the
competing, it's...

556
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,297
What's wrong?

557
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,316
You worried that Yang's
starting to like me better?

558
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,367
Please tell me that
heart is on its way.

559
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,431
The harvest team will
be here in 30 minutes.

560
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,560
Good.

561
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,795
What's wrong with your face?

562
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,893
I had to tell Noah his
son gets a transplant

563
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,716
in front of Laura.

564
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,985
It's like I personally
stole her daughter's heart.

565
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,789
An equation decides
where the heart goes,

566
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,035
not us. I know.

567
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,592
Scrub in on the
transplant, Grumpy.

568
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,260
It'll cheer you up.

569
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,249
"Gosh. I'm so sad and sensitive.

570
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,718
"I really could use some
cheering up, Dr. Yang."

571
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,622
Nicely done.

572
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,292
You're saying, the baby needs
that machine to stay alive?

573
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,994
Well, for now. ECMO, it
works a little like bypass

574
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,546
to give your
grandson's heart a rest.

575
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,087
For how long?

576
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,766
'Cause my friend Nikki's
having a party for me on Friday,

577
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,240
and I'm supposed
to bring the baby.

578
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:48,792
Kimmy, your baby will be
here a lot longer than Friday.

579
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,595
How much longer? Weeks? Months?

580
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,330
It's hard to know at this point.

581
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,448
I'll have to call Nikki.

582
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,149
She ordered cupcakes and stuff.

583
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,869
Mom, where's your
phone? Oh, here.

584
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,488
Kimmy, would you like to
go in and see your baby now?

585
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,590
No, thanks.

586
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,759
Are you sure? You
won't hurt anything.

587
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:09,013
I can wheel you right
up next to the bed.

588
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,698
It's not like he's gonna
know who I am or anything.

589
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,751
I'm tired. Can I just
go back to my room?

590
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,035
Sure, baby.

591
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:24,028
Oh, I can't believe we didn't
get through everybody today,

592
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:27,881
and now... I am on lumps
and bumps again tomorrow.

593
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,110
Still, we got
through a bunch of...

594
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,266
Word of advice.

595
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,302
You want to avoid lump
and bump day again,

596
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,131
just make sure you
pass your stupid boards,

597
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,890
or you will always
get stuck doing...

598
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,811
Sorry.

599
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,430
You can go, Ross. That's all.

600
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,809
You want me to help tomorrow?

601
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,383
Don't mock me, Ross.

602
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,918
It's been a long day. Just...

603
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,436
Get outta here.

604
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,746
Oh, my God, congratulations.

605
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,882
No!

606
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:03,671
Did the doctor call back?

607
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,702
Yes.

608
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,133
To confirm your appointment
for the eight-week ultrasound?

609
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:09,256
So you know that?

610
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:10,741
I do?

611
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,259
Okay, let's be clear.

612
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,979
You never heard
anything. You know nothing.

613
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,650
And you don't ever mention any
of this to anyone, ever. You got it?

614
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,065
Is there anything else
you would like to say

615
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,321
before we drop this subject
for the rest of eternity?

616
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,260
Congratulations?

617
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:24,231
I can't wait to scrub in
on something like that.

618
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,432
That should be me down there.

619
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,901
Look at that.

620
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,931
Yang just ligated
the pulmonary artery

621
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,655
with one stitch.

622
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,973
She's incredible.

623
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,282
Yes, she is.

624
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:44,484
You sure you're not
asleep with your eyes open?

625
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,353
You've been staring
at that kid for an hour.

626
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,333
She didn't even want to see him.

627
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,052
She cared more about her
best friend's stupid pizza party

628
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,316
than seeing her child.

629
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,743
Well, she's 15.

630
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:54,956
It doesn't matter. She oughta...

631
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,563
You don't know her story.

632
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,049
Not everybody lives in a
perfect little world like you.

633
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,096
I never said my
world was perfect.

634
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,871
Oh... Princeton,
Harvard, perfect G.P.A.

635
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,023
Look, not all of us go
to Ivy League schools

636
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,725
or drive fancy cars

637
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,910
or rely on our
richy-rich daddies

638
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,477
to bankroll our
pretty little lives.

639
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,431
Some of us have to
overcome more than others.

640
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,765
I know that.

641
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,068
So... Get over it, princess.

642
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,920
You're in no position to judge.

643
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,760
Did you also know that I
blow my nose with $100 bills?

644
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,411
Ha-ha.

645
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,125
And my one-year-old birthday
cake was made out of caviar.

646
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,699
Gross.

647
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:36,169
Also, in one of the rooms of
my obscenely big mansion,

648
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,300
instead of paint, I just
lined the walls with mink.

649
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,423
Shut up.

650
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,590
It's true.

651
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,337
Guess how many
fireplaces I've got.

652
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,443
Four.

653
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,861
Twenty-seven.

654
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,375
Well, 28 if you count
the butler's room.

655
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,831
But, please, he's the help.

656
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,751
Explains a lot.

657
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,574
Obviously, the next 24
hours will be critical, but so far,

658
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:00,260
he is the poster
child for transplant.

659
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:05,082
Do an ABG every two hours
and monitor his pH level.

660
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:16,844
Hey.

661
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:20,347
We've been waiting
for a heart for months.

662
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,483
Her SATs aren't budging.

663
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,734
She's dying.

664
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:30,123
I sit here and play solitaire
because I can't watch my baby die.

665
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:31,458
And I...

666
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,813
That was her heart.

667
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,518
That was her heart, and you...

668
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,989
I want to be happy for you.

669
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,007
But right now I can't.

670
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,877
I just can't.

671
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,737
Oh, give me that coffee.

672
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,584
I'm so tired right now, I'm
sleepwalking. Which I do, by the way.

673
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,653
In college, I sleepwalked
into this guy's room,

674
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,077
and when I woke
up, we were doing it.

675
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,379
Ew.

676
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,547
No, he was hot.

677
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,450
Oh. Where did you get that?

678
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,885
The coffee cart's closed.

679
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,265
Would you judge me if I told you

680
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,169
I stole it from a nurse
when she wasn't looking?

681
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,502
She's a stealer, too.
Little baby hearts.

682
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,076
No wonder you guys
get along so well.

683
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:25,123
Aren't you supposed to be
with Karev in the ECMO room?

684
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:26,713
Yeah, but I keep falling asleep,

685
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,793
so he sent me out to walk
around and wake myself up

686
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,562
because a tiny,
fragile baby's life

687
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,464
is in my very tired hands.

688
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:33,587
That's frightening.

689
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:35,389
No, it's not. It's awesome.

690
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,902
All the attendings are asleep
right now, and we're in charge.

691
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:39,442
We're saving lives.

692
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,877
I'm making phone calls.

693
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,145
Uh, lifesaving phone calls.

694
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,446
And you're removing warts.

695
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,664
And saving lives.

696
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,253
And she's stealing
surgeries from me.

697
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,567
Stop complaining.

698
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,620
This is it, you know?
We're surgeons.

699
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,766
We're no longer med students
waiting to be surgeons. We're...

700
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,756
Help! Someone help us!

701
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,924
What the...

702
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,093
Oh, my God.

703
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,243
Oh, hell, no.

704
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,262
God, I love this job.

705
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,965
Mr. Crossley, you need
to put your wife down.

706
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,645
I've got her. Just
let go of her ankles.

707
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:04,795
I'm not putting her down.

708
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,347
If I put her down, she goes out.

709
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,999
Sir, we're doctors. We can help.

710
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,089
Show 'em, honey.

711
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,269
I can't feel a pulse.
Starting CPR.

712
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,550
I'll grab a crash cart.

713
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,679
I'm picking her back up.

714
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,053
Sir, sir. You need to back away.

715
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:24,299
Found one.

716
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,459
What the hell?

717
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,647
Now get us a real damn doctor!

718
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:42,589
So, Mrs. Crossley,

719
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:44,337
you went home,
you were feeling fine,

720
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:47,310
you had a coughing spasm,
and then you passed out?

721
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,357
Yes. She slipped when
I tried to pick her up,

722
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,109
so I just grabbed
her by her ankles.

723
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,883
And she regained consciousness.

724
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,148
Please tell me I
don't have to spend

725
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,683
the rest of my life upside down.

726
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,335
Oh, no. Your coughing episode

727
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,942
knocked the ventricular lead
from your pacemaker loose.

728
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,411
We're gonna have to open you
back up and reposition the lead.

729
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:08,815
This is it, people.

730
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,617
Your chance to scrub
in on one of the coolest,

731
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,354
most innovative
surgeries you will ever see.

732
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:17,874
Was that a yawn? Avery,
did you see a yawn?

733
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,325
Brooks, you're out.

734
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:20,726
But...

735
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,424
If you can't handle
one overnight shift,

736
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,692
you can't handle this surgery.

737
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,265
Look alive, people.

738
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,733
All right. Now the rest of you

739
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,463
will each get a chance
to examine our patient

740
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,003
before we move on to the
skills lab portion of the contest.

741
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,907
Dr. Avery, will you
bring in our patient?

742
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,159
Now Dr. Torres and I

743
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,761
will be performing
a nerve transplant

744
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,295
on Dr. Shepherd's injured hand.

745
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,797
We need an intern we can trust.

746
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,215
And that's saying a lot,

747
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,518
because we don't trust
any of you people yet.

748
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,736
Wilson, you're up.

749
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,610
I'm not gonna bite you, Wilson.

750
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,228
Right.

751
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:57,764
And you're done.

752
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,784
Edwards.

753
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,644
Did you do a proximal or
a distal repair the first time?

754
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,008
You should know the answer
to that by looking at the scars.

755
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,949
You're done.

756
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,884
You're done.

757
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,535
Ross.

758
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,590
Hi. I'm Dr. Ross.

759
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,608
Yeah, I know who you are, Shane.

760
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,277
I know. I was just...

761
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,236
Do you have any pain with
prehension or pronation?

762
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,068
Yeah. It's getting
worse, though.

763
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,687
Okay.

764
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,359
I know this must
be scary for you.

765
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,128
It would be for
me. That's for sure.

766
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:22,332
But Dr. Torres and Dr. Avery,
they're really talented.

767
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,640
They're gonna take
really good care of you.

768
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,083
I know it.

769
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,738
Okay, we're done.

770
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,972
I've selected our winner.

771
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,574
Ross is the only one

772
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,271
who actually treated
the patient like a patient.

773
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:34,522
Congratulations.
You're on the team.

774
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,745
Thank you.

775
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,207
Thank me later. He gets grouchy.

776
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,397
It's true.

777
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,483
All right. You can leave now.

778
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,256
Mrs. Crossley's
mine. I'm prepping her.

779
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,191
Not if I get there first.

780
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,279
Hey, no running!

781
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,354
Oh. Damn it.

782
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:03,656
I'm prepping her. Not you.

783
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,270
Looks like I'm the one who's
got the portable monitor.

784
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,405
I'm the one that's got
her leads. I got the chart.

785
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:08,745
Excuse me. Can I...

786
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,591
You don't get to
steal this from me.

787
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,776
You stole the
transplant from me.

788
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,667
I'm sorry, but I...

789
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,518
Gimmie!

790
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,787
Can you guys just
hold on one second?

791
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,056
Too late. I'm done.

792
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:22,542
Oh, my God.

793
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,127
Pull it out. Pull it out. What?

794
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,140
You hooked her O-2 to the IV.

795
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,408
No, no, no, no, no. If an air
embolus gets into her heart,

796
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,642
it'll kill her. What?

797
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,533
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God. Oh, my...

798
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,818
What's going on?

799
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,247
They're trying to kill me!
That's what's going on.

800
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,741
Kimmy, hey.

801
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,221
If you want to get
up to the NICU,

802
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,789
the south elevator's
actually a little bit closer.

803
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,457
I could take you
there... That's okay.

804
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,721
Were you discharged already?

805
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,817
Where's the damn elevator?

806
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,646
My shift's not over for
another couple of hours.

807
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,764
What time are you coming back?

808
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,266
You don't have to
talk to her, Kimmy.

809
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,322
I...

810
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,192
I'm not coming back.

811
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,460
Wait. What? Of course you are.

812
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,678
Whoa. Hey, hang on.
You can't just leave.

813
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,302
You have a baby. She
has a baby upstairs.

814
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,464
He's one day old.

815
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,933
Yeah, and he's all messed up.

816
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,351
- So you're just gonna...
- You can't...

817
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,402
You can't abandon him.

818
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:13,343
No, you can't. No.

819
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,538
No! Let me on.

820
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:15,856
No. You don't want
to mess with me.

821
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,375
You don't want to mess with me.

822
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,616
No, stop. You can't
walk out on that baby!

823
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,750
You can't do that!

824
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:21,846
Get off me!

825
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,214
No! Let her go!

826
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:24,637
No! Hey, let 'em go.

827
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,856
You're crazy! Let 'em go.

828
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,753
Yeah, stack the
pallets over there.

829
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,012
Why aren't you in the tunnels?

830
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,814
Interns always hang
out in the tunnels.

831
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,566
This place smells like fish.

832
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,919
We've got a
delivery in a minute.

833
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,921
Look, I don't know
what your deal is,

834
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,717
but you can't go around
assaulting patients.

835
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,641
She was abandoning her baby.

836
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,029
Then let the cops handle
it. It's not your job, princess.

837
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,329
Stop calling me princess!

838
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:15,338
My mother left me at a fire
station when I was two weeks old.

839
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:18,102
I got bumped around
foster homes till I was 16,

840
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:19,987
when I took matters
into my hands

841
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,822
and started living out of a car.

842
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,957
I parked it behind the
gym of my high school

843
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,716
so I could sneak in and
use the showers before class.

844
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,462
My home ec.
Teacher... Ms. Schmidt...

845
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,481
She let me do my
laundry there for free.

846
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:34,240
And, yeah, I got into good schools
because I worked my ass off.

847
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:36,520
And when I walked across
that stage at graduation,

848
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,222
I didn't have a cheering section

849
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:39,857
filled with my
richy-rich family.

850
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:42,081
I had one person... Ms. Schmidt.

851
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,235
That's it.

852
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:48,544
She's the one who gave me
this watch when I got the job.

853
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,057
Her son works for the company.

854
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,185
It is a nice watch.

855
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,257
Thanks.

856
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,629
This was not just my fault.

857
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,892
It sure as hell wasn't mine.

858
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,666
You could have killed her.

859
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,102
I understand
competition and drive,

860
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,636
but you two,

861
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,049
you need to figure out
how to work together,

862
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,339
and you better do it fast.

863
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,585
You're both off my service.

864
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,720
I'll do you one better.

865
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,288
You're both banned from the OR

866
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,828
until further notice.

867
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:29,897
Thank you.

868
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,726
Guess what.

869
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:46,028
Butt-scab lady was seen
by oncology last night.

870
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,275
The mass was malignant.
They said I might have got it all.

871
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,999
What are you doing here?

872
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,996
I told you I'd come help with the
rest of your lumps and bumps today.

873
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,753
Who put you up to this?

874
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:56,000
Because nobody slums it
down here unless they have to.

875
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,440
I'm here because I want to be.

876
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:02,762
All I ever wanted
to be was a surgeon.

877
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:04,831
And now Torres just
chose me to scrub in

878
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,633
on one of the coolest surgeries
I'll ever see because of you.

879
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:12,939
You gave me 27 solo
procedures yesterday.

880
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,307
At least one of them
saved a woman's life.

881
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,085
I'm grateful for this job
and I'm grateful to you.

882
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,247
I'm hardly slumming it.

883
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,717
So I'm gonna glove up

884
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,836
and I'm gonna help
you with your lumps...

885
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,423
And you're gonna like it.

886
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,296
Okay. Fine.

887
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:40,565
But you get the nasty-smelling
green one in bed two.

888
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,992
I'm off Dr. Yang's service now.

889
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,734
But I wanted to come
by one last time to...

890
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,002
I'm sorry, but...

891
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,599
Could you excuse
me for just one minute?

892
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:02,789
Yes.

893
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,366
You okay?

894
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,587
They say there's still a
chance he may reject the heart.

895
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,568
He won't reject it.

896
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,959
This happened before.
It has nothing to do...

897
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,049
Hey, you.

898
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,266
Yeah, you.

899
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:48,767
Dr. Shepherd.

900
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:51,282
Did you or did you not shut
things down with my sisters?

901
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,955
Don't bring Brooks into this.

902
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,657
You brought Brooks into this.

903
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,009
They are your family
and they want to help you.

904
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,278
Right?

905
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:01,397
Oh, oh. You're asking me? Yes.

906
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,065
Um, they seemed willing to help.

907
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,145
Of course they want to help
me. I practically raised them.

908
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,681
But if my sisters find
out that I need help...

909
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,116
Look, who did you call so I
can call and shut this down?

910
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,267
Don't tell him that.

911
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,468
Don't tell her not to tell me.

912
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,859
All right, enough.

913
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,110
You know that live nerves
are better than dead ones.

914
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,659
Even I know that,
and I'm an intern.

915
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,081
And you. You put me in a
really awkward position today.

916
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,549
You just threw me to the wolves.

917
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,518
Not that I'm comparing
your sisters to wolves.

918
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,320
But, oh, my God.
They're out for blood.

919
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,056
They are furious with you that
you didn't call them yourself.

920
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,858
And they told me some things.

921
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,709
Okay? Unkind things.

922
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,712
And now I know stories
about you. And you, too.

923
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,281
I know things about both of
you that I don't want to know.

924
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,001
I don't want to be in on
your secrets or your fights.

925
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,670
It makes me really,
really, really uncomfortable.

926
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,658
Let me guess. Your parents
had a messy divorce...

927
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,952
And always put you in
the middle. Am I right?

928
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,075
How'd you know that?

929
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,304
Lucky guess. Lizzie.

930
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:49,078
One of the wolves.

931
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:51,171
Good to see you, Mer.

932
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,510
I hope you got some
baby pictures handy

933
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,034
because I did not
take the red-eye

934
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,481
just so my brother could hack
my nerves into hamburger meat.

935
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:59,333
<i>There don't have
to be harps playing</i>

936
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,851
<i>or birds singing or rose petals</i>

937
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,942
<i>falling from the sky...</i>

938
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:08,181
I have never been
this tired, ever.

939
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:11,484
I have a jacket.

940
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,652
It's so far away.

941
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,487
I just want to go home.

942
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,596
Hunt really put you
guys on probation?

943
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:33,272
<i>And there are definitely days
when the romance is dead.</i>

944
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,077
<i>But...</i>

945
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:39,612
<i>If you look around...</i>

946
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,580
Coming through!

947
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,616
<i>Things are pretty amazing.</i>

948
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,604
<i>So stop for a second.</i>

949
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,855
<i>Enjoy the beauty.</i>

950
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,575
<i>Feel the magic.</i>

951
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,364
<i>Drink it in.</i> MAN:
Watch your back!

952
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,462
<i>'Cause it won't last forever.</i>

953
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:59,932
<i>The romance will fade.</i>

954
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,101
<i>Things will happen.</i>

955
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,636
<i>People will change.</i>

956
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:05,282
Out of the way! Out of the way!

957
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,972
<i>Love will die.</i>

958
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:08,709
<i>But...</i>

959
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,327
<i>Maybe not today.</i>

960
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,547
I can't believe
they used to be us.
