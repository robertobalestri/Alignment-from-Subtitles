1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,138
<i>In order to properly
treat a problem,</i>

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,524
<i>a surgeon needs as much
information as she can get.</i>

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,171
Wasn't this stupid thing
supposed to start already?

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,829
<i>So we ask questions.
Questions like...</i>

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,164
a central line kit, please.

6
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,732
<i>"When did the pain begin?"</i>

7
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,329
It started about 45 minutes ago.

8
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,083
<i>"Have you experienced
these symptoms before?"</i>

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,742
<i>"Do you have a family history?"</i>

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,910
<i>"Are you currently
sexually active?"</i>

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,253
<i>"Have you recently
undergone surgery?"</i>

12
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:40,756
<i>If you're unwilling or unable</i>

13
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:42,958
<i>to answer these
and other questions,</i>

14
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:46,128
<i>we're forced to rely
on tests for insight.</i>

15
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,127
<i>It's possible that I
may have, by mistake,</i>

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,562
<i>said that if she had any
doubts, she should flee.</i>

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,651
<i>What?</i>

18
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,753
She was nervous.

19
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:55,822
How nervous?

20
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,007
How nervous was she, Callie?

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,202
<i>Until those test
results come back,</i>

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>there's nothing
we can do but wait.</i>

23
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,205
Damn it.

24
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,269
What is it?

25
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,740
There's too much bleeding.

26
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,126
Look, even with the scope,
I can't see a damn thing.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,466
Okay. Let's get a
CT. And call the OR.

28
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,747
I want them ready the second
we know what we're dealing with.

29
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,948
Should I call anyone else?

30
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,890
You're going into
surgery. You'll be a while.

31
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,075
Yeah?

32
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:34,276
Dr. Bailey.

33
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:38,692
I didn't forget.

34
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,533
I know that. Should
I call your fiance?

35
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,401
Yes, please.

36
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,905
Oh...

37
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,376
What does this mean?

38
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,914
I don't know.

39
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,949
The lawsuit is...

40
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,634
Maybe...

41
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,370
Maybe we'll be fine.

42
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,946
Maybe we can...

43
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,134
Look, just, could we
not talk about that?

44
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,195
Not right now.

45
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,075
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

46
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,339
My beautiful wife-to-be

47
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,220
has been pulled into
an emergency surgery,

48
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,310
so things are gonna be
delayed for a little while.

49
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,363
Those of you who are
doctors will understand.

50
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,698
And those who aren't...

51
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,768
Well, they're setting up the
buffet, the bar's open in the back.

52
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,882
Drink, eat, and just
as soon as we're able,

53
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,006
we'll have a little wedding.

54
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,773
That poor handsome fool.

55
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,159
Bailey's probably hopped
a boxcar to Mexico by now.

56
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,844
I am the worst
maid of honor ever.

57
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,145
Who made you maid of honor?

58
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,618
I called it.

59
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,354
And then I tanked it.

60
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,750
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

61
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,169
Right now? I'll go.

62
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,788
I'm the general surgeon. Maybe
I can tag her out of surgery.

63
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:16,932
Put this in water
till I get back.

64
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,383
You really told Bailey to run?

65
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,597
I didn't say she should
run. I said she could run.

66
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,372
And I was joking. I was...

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,558
Aw! Funny... Funny me.

68
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,260
No? Okay.

69
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,089
Who needs a drink?

70
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,434
I can stay.

71
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,022
We'll be fine. You should go.

72
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,882
I don't really feel like
going to a wedding

73
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,684
if I'm gonna be
signing divorce papers.

74
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,947
Wow!

75
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,367
I don't know what happened. I
heard a crash, checked my rearview.

76
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,409
Half the club is eating asphalt,
banging around like tenpins.

77
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,072
I mean, it's real, real nasty.

78
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,295
Bowling for bikers?

79
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,803
Maybe you should
stick around. Yeah.

80
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,301
You just gonna stand there
with your junk in your hand,

81
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,725
or you gonna do something, Doc?

82
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,174
Multiple contusions.
Pelvis stabilized in transport.

83
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,343
Coming through. Watch your back.

84
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,523
You know, I used
to ride a donor cycle.

85
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,247
Really? Why'd you stop?

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,818
Chest tubes hurt like a bitch.

87
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,890
Stuart Loeb, 35.
Vital signs stable.

88
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,637
Alert before we
pushed 5 of morphine

89
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,321
for a left arm degloving injury.

90
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,206
Ooh! He must have
been thrown out of his car.

91
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,441
He was on one of the bikes.

92
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,491
Seriously, this guy?

93
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,515
I know, right?

94
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,228
Okay. Let's get him in trauma 1.

95
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:04,663
And start making some calls.
We need more hands in here.

96
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,087
Right away, Doctor.

97
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,462
Hey, look at these.

98
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,076
Macaroni and cheese
in the form of a cupcake.

99
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,760
Might be the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

100
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,335
I just did something.

101
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,947
I got us a room. Just now.

102
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,883
And the guy at the desk
said that it's really nice

103
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,440
and it has a view.

104
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,819
Though, honestly, I only
care that it has a bed.

105
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,603
Are you tired? No.

106
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,131
Oh!

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,033
You got us a room.

108
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,134
Yes.

109
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,769
So we could... Yes.

110
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,554
Okay.

111
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:41,722
Excuse me.

112
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,737
Sorry, but if you knew,
you'd understand.

113
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,322
What is she doing? Wait.
Okay. Hold on. Listen.

114
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,473
We should take
some of that to go.

115
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:48,707
You know, in case
we work up an appetite.

116
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:49,931
Right.

117
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,286
Finally.

118
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,291
I'm so sorry.

119
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,337
You're sorry? No, you're not
sorry. You're criminally negligent.

120
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,906
Dr. Webber... My
wife has Alzheimer's,

121
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,770
and you told me my
visits were agitating her.

122
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,631
So instead of
monitoring her myself,

123
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,199
I allowed you to do it.

124
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,963
You want to look at me right
now and tell me you're sorry?

125
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,797
Sir, I understand you're upset.

126
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:12,999
Though to be clear,

127
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:14,533
when I said you should
visit less frequently,

128
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,769
I certainly didn't mean
for you to stop altogether.

129
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,426
What did you just say to me?

130
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,390
What did you just say to me?

131
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,647
Dr. Webber, they
need you in OR 2.

132
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,155
Thank you.

133
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:36,978
Don't thank me. Just go.

134
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,118
Is she in the OR already?

135
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,715
I don't know. I just said that so
you wouldn't punch that guy out.

136
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,183
Is this why she
isn't at the wedding?

137
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,389
Oh, God. The wedding.

138
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,002
I'm gonna go find
her. Are you okay?

139
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,759
Yeah, go. Go.

140
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,582
According to the article,

141
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,651
the doctors discovered
that her hair follicles

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,870
had actually been growing
nails instead of hair.

143
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,538
Like fingernails.

144
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,863
Cool story, bro.

145
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,026
Can I get anybody a coffee?

146
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,694
Mmm-mmm. No.

147
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,180
It's like having dinner with
Ripley's Believe It or Not!

148
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,940
So you're starting to regret this
whole "let's bring dates" idea?

149
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,074
No.

150
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,137
No. I love Ripley's
Believe It or Not!

151
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,723
I love easy wedding sex,
which I'm gonna miss out on now

152
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,348
'cause you jerks can't keep
your hands off each other.

153
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,827
You made me bring
sand to the beach,

154
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,229
and it's sand I
can't sleep with.

155
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,687
Since when can you
not sleep with interns?

156
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,838
I'm a homeowner
now. I've grown up.

157
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,828
Besides, they get
all hung up and sad

158
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,087
when you don't want
to be their boyfriend.

159
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,227
It's not worth the hassle.

160
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,096
You are one classy guy, Karev.

161
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,115
I make an effort.

162
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,862
He was just trying to be nice, and
I got him in trouble with his boss.

163
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,586
I can barely look
him in the eye.

164
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:54,072
Dr. Avery has nice eyes.

165
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,786
Do you think they're
blue or green? Or both?

166
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't. Don't you
dare sleep with him.

167
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,445
I'm not. Why not?

168
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,675
'Cause that's the kind
of thing Leah would do.

169
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,898
You want to be like Leah?

170
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,116
Oh! Gross. No.

171
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,779
Besides, he's probably
not even interested.

172
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,331
Of course he's interested.

173
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,633
Interns are like sexual
catnip at this hospital.

174
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,435
Look at me. I was
enjoying a perfectly healthy

175
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,886
teacher-student
relationship with Kepner,

176
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,277
and now she's all over me.

177
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,391
I brought notes so I can keep
the conversation about medicine,

178
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,260
but she keeps asking me
all these personal questions,

179
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:21,616
and I'm running out of cards.

180
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,367
Did you just get paged?

181
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,781
Both of you? All of us.

182
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,649
Big trauma back at the
ranch. You kids coming?

183
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,050
Yes, indeed. Yeah,
I'm coming, too.

184
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,208
Nope. You don't get
to practice medicine

185
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,355
with booze in your
system, Hobo Jo.

186
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,544
You're Hobo Jo?

187
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,457
Like "rides the rails and
eats beans from a can"?

188
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,915
I don't know. Weird.

189
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,599
Shane, you can ride with me.

190
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,570
A beer for me and
another round for Hobo Jo.

191
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,804
You got it. Let me guess.

192
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,240
Thunderbird or is it just
straight paint thinner?

193
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,011
I told your fiance it
was an emergency.

194
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,547
But not who the patient was?

195
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,814
Should I have? No, no.

196
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,638
He'd just send everybody home.

197
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,507
I am still getting
married today.

198
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,106
What are you doing here?
Oh, tell me he didn't call it off.

199
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,808
No one called anything
off. I'm here to help.

200
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:09,942
What's the situation?

201
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,268
Well, CT shows an
aortic aneurysm so big,

202
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,669
it's torn into the duodenum.

203
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,099
I've never seen one that big.

204
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,956
Yeah, me neither. Scrub fast.

205
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,476
Chief, where do you need us?

206
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,311
Just a second, Avery.

207
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,874
Guess Dr. Bailey
beat us to the fun.

208
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,413
Dr. Bailey's here?

209
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,393
She and Dr. Grey are working
on Adele Webber in OR 1.

210
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,429
Dr. Webber's wife? Should we...

211
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:32,119
You have a degloving
injury in trauma 1.

212
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:35,573
Take care of your patient. Let
Bailey and Grey take care of theirs.

213
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,542
Don't touch me!

214
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,143
Dr. Hunt, a little help, please.

215
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,547
You come at me
with that thing again,

216
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,950
and you will not
like where it ends up.

217
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,234
You two make the rounds.

218
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,453
I want status reports
on all the injured,

219
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,588
and find out what
happened out there.

220
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,857
You two aren't going anywhere
except the waiting room.

221
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,403
And, ma'am, you
need to sit back.

222
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,893
Don't call me "ma'am."

223
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,379
It's Gasoline.

224
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,059
And you don't want to get
in the way of club business.

225
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,534
You screw with one of us,
and we will all screw with you.

226
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,737
Okay.

227
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,110
You want your
guys taken care of?

228
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,898
That's all my guys
are trying to do.

229
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,731
Now I'll let these gentlemen
conduct their investigation

230
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,701
as long as they do not
bother any of my patients.

231
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,321
And you settle down and
let Dr. Brooks here do her job.

232
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,395
Deal.

233
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,985
How's Gasoline?

234
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,532
And The Hammer?
These are people?

235
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,300
Yeah. Those are
their road names.

236
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,936
You get to pick your road
names, and you went with Stuart?

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm not officially in the club.

238
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,063
They let me hang around,
ride along with them.

239
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:51,099
It has been the greatest
time of my entire life.

240
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,086
And I ruined it. That
crash was my fault.

241
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,617
My sister was right. I had no
business being on that bike.

242
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,024
I think your arm would agree.

243
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,394
I don't know. I think guys
on motorcycles are hot.

244
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,306
All right, Stuart, your
injuries are extensive,

245
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,292
but I do think it's possible
we can salvage your hand.

246
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,561
We're just gonna get you up
to the OR and debride your arm.

247
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,468
Edwards, you're with me.

248
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,197
Unless you'd rather
I took Dr. Ross.

249
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,755
Are you kidding?
No. Shane's my guy.

250
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,981
Nice. Ooh!

251
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,718
Nice view.

252
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,923
Um...

253
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,258
Open or closed?

254
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,511
Closed.

255
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,431
Lights, on or off?

256
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,083
Um...

257
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:44,312
Whichever. How about...

258
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,574
That's great.

259
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:12,196
Um, I'm sorry. I just
suddenly got so nervous.

260
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,225
Me, too. Really?

261
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,167
Okay, hold on. Okay.

262
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,991
I'm sorry. It's okay.

263
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,540
I think I should
take the leg off first.

264
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,664
Of course. Yeah.
I can help if...

265
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,616
No, no, no.

266
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,497
Velcro straps and plastic
sockets aren't exactly sexy,

267
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,841
and I wanted this evening
to be all about sexy,

268
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,924
so I think that I need to
take the leg off myself.

269
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,221
And I need you not to watch.

270
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:44,128
You want me to
go in the bathroom

271
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,124
until your leg's off and
you're under the covers?

272
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,465
Would you?

273
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,034
Oh.

274
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,803
Okay.

275
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,037
Sure.

276
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,528
Murphy, get your hands in here.

277
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,792
Dr. Bailey.

278
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,705
I need you to put
pressure on the aorta,

279
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,356
there under the diaphragm.

280
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,826
It's just a stopgap until we
can mobilize the duodenum

281
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,227
off the aneurysm.

282
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,349
Grey.

283
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,353
Murphy, I got this.

284
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,532
Go up in the gallery
and sit with him.

285
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,571
Okay.

286
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,807
Have you got a little brown
paper bag you can put that in?

287
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:36,007
Would you stop?

288
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,049
I had no parents.
I lived in my car.

289
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,751
So, yes, I have trust issues.
Comes with the territory.

290
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,915
You need to stop acting
like you're the only person

291
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,483
who ever had a crappy childhood.

292
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:47,325
Yeah? How many foster
homes did you get kicked out of

293
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,776
before you moved into your car?

294
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,811
Seventeen.

295
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,925
And I didn't live in
my car. I went to juvie.

296
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,581
Stop making fun of me.

297
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,816
I'm not.

298
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,303
Really?

299
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,967
And you're actually lucky
that your folks abandoned you.

300
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,735
Means you didn't have
to watch your schizo mom

301
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,959
go after your baby
brother with a steak knife.

302
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,596
Fine. Fair.

303
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,276
But you never woke up
in the middle of the night

304
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,500
with junkies banging on
your bedroom windshield,

305
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,246
praying they'd
get tired or bored

306
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,998
before they put a
rock through a window.

307
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,133
No, I didn't, because
the junkie was my dad,

308
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,624
and he didn't break
windows, just fingers.

309
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,697
Well, did you ever
have foster parents

310
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:30,235
that made you and 19 other kids
sleep on cots in the basement?

311
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,270
Locking the doors at lights out,

312
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,217
so that if you had to pee
in the middle of the night

313
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,957
you had to use buckets
they set up along the wall?

314
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,827
Buckets you couldn't see
because if you turned the lights on,

315
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,628
the bigger kids
would hold you down

316
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,999
and take those buckets and...

317
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,104
No. Never.

318
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,972
Me neither. Saw it
in a movie on cable.

319
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,326
How did you get
cable in your car?

320
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,216
I don't live in my
car anymore, jerk.

321
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,303
Stuart?

322
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,072
He went down first.
Everybody else followed.

323
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,175
Emily Bennett?

324
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,322
The last person
that called me that

325
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,386
is somewhere
choking on a tire iron.

326
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,732
Excuse me.

327
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,767
Gasoline?

328
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,368
I'm Dr. Yang.

329
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,888
Dr. Brooks found that you have
some fluid around your heart.

330
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,790
So I would like to do
a pericardiocentesis

331
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,025
to relieve that pressure.

332
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,994
No, thanks. You've
seen my X-rays.

333
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,398
My body's 85%
metal. I get over stuff.

334
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,350
Well, you just don't get over
this. Untreated, you could die.

335
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,804
Treated, I'm stuck in a
bed. No dice, Dr. Yang.

336
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,385
I can't be out of commission,

337
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,177
not when my boys need
me to take care of business.

338
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:50,481
Actually, they brought
a guy in with us, Stuart.

339
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,817
Have you seen him? No.

340
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,219
I'll tell you what,

341
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,390
you find him, you
take me to see him,

342
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,859
and then I'll let you
do whatever you want.

343
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,936
Ow! Damn it, kid.

344
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,173
There's no way you're doing that
right. Call the redhead over here.

345
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,919
There's no need to...
No, no, I ain't gonna suffer

346
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,571
just because you're
avoiding your old lady.

347
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,835
My what? I seen the
way she looks at you.

348
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,361
She's not looking
at me. Not now.

349
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,505
Now she's ignoring you,
which means she really digs you.

350
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,240
Ow! Damn it!

351
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,525
What is going on?

352
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,621
This kid's a
menace, that's what.

353
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,111
Okay.

354
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,714
Sir, just calm down.
This is a teaching hospital.

355
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,815
All right? Just...

356
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,768
Allow me to assist Dr. Ross
with his technique, okay?

357
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,838
Yeah.

358
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,571
Okay.

359
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,492
All right, so for a corner stitch
like this, it's usually best to use

360
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:55,630
a half-buried horizontal
mattress stitch.

361
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,731
So you go in like that...

362
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,687
Okay. I think I got it.

363
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,773
I mean,

364
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,842
it's like this, right?

365
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,895
Yes. Great work.

366
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,198
You're such a quick
study. Keep it up.

367
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,452
Keep it up.

368
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,023
Her aorta is like a rock.

369
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,225
I don't know how we're
gonna sew in this graft.

370
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,856
Where is this
bleeding coming from?

371
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm not sure. Hold pressure.

372
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,428
You should be down there
watching what they're doing.

373
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,718
I can see from here.

374
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,520
Primary aortoduodenal fistulas,

375
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,905
they almost never happen.

376
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,601
- My finger.
- Why not?

377
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,377
This usually would present
as a kind of pulsating mass.

378
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,991
Something like that, a patient
wouldn't wait to seek treatment.

379
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,648
The fistula would never develop.

380
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:51,168
With Alzheimer's, they don't
remember if they told anyone.

381
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,771
Someone should've been there.

382
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,107
Paying attention.

383
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,410
All right. Let's see.

384
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,639
You should be down there.

385
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,131
Sir, respectfully, I am
not going down there.

386
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,251
You should stop asking.

387
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,637
The proximal clamp fractured
the atherosclerotic plaque.

388
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:11,850
We have to get
above the bleeding.

389
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,051
What are they doing now?

390
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,259
Aneurysms like these
are caused by a buildup

391
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,244
of atherosclerotic plaque.

392
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:20,031
Their clamp broke off a
chunk of one these plaques.

393
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,032
And that aorta
opened right back up.

394
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,530
They think they'll be able
to move the clamp up higher

395
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,220
and control the bleeding,

396
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,167
but they're already up to
the superior mesenteric artery.

397
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,285
There isn't any place
left for them to go.

398
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,376
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

399
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,581
It means, they've just
about run out of options.

400
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:47,475
I don't know what else to do.

401
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,463
Just wait. Just... Just
a minute. Just a minute.

402
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,696
Is there anyone I
can call for you?

403
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
Shh!

404
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,025
Bailey. Try dividing
the renal vein.

405
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,904
That might get you
above the fractured plaque.

406
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,112
But she's exsanguinating.
I don't think...

407
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,430
Just try it!

408
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,684
Okay. Scalpel.

409
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,219
Here you go, Doctor.

410
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:27,481
Hey. Hey. Are you...

411
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,334
Hey. Look, I was kidding.

412
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,243
Come on. That wasn't
even the worst thing I said.

413
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,855
Oh, God. Please.

414
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,685
You're not a garbage
eater, okay? I'm sorry.

415
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,047
Look at your face.

416
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,749
I got you. I so got you.

417
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,684
What? Tears, baby.

418
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,987
The number one
tool of the street kid.

419
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,673
Turn on the water works,
you can get out of anything.

420
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:54,503
Wait, wait. You
can just cry like that?

421
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,360
Got three surgeries
out of you, chump.

422
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,357
Come on. That's not fair.

423
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,259
Chicks can get away with junk like
that. That would never work for me.

424
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,084
You're wrong. A girl
crying is one thing,

425
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:06,220
but a guy crying
freaks everybody out.

426
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,433
Really?

427
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,189
For sure. Show me how.

428
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,676
Coming up.

429
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,528
Hello. Hey, you're awake.

430
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,617
No, not really.

431
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,470
<i>Oh! Sorry.</i>

432
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,582
I wanted to check your
post-op vitals. How's your BP?

433
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,791
You know who would
know that would be a nurse.

434
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,019
<i>Why don't you call a nurse?</i>

435
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,910
Right. I'll do that.

436
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,078
Why are you whispering?

437
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,630
<i>I'm in a hotel bathroom.</i>

438
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,449
And I'm about to have sex.
For the first time in months.

439
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,224
I'm hanging up now.

440
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,405
<i>Okay. Well, rest up.</i>

441
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,575
Hey.

442
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,911
I decided to take a bath,

443
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,863
which you're gonna appreciate.

444
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,898
'Cause I smell amazing.

445
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,270
I'm sorry, Callie. I'm...

446
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,822
I wanted to be
spontaneous and fun.

447
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,658
But I...

448
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,827
I can't.

449
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,365
And I'm so sorry, Callie.

450
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:25,599
I'm, I...

451
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,936
I'm not...

452
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,504
I'm not ready.

453
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,575
Please don't be mad.

454
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,677
What are you doing?

455
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,479
Calling room service. We're
gonna need champagne

456
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,343
to go with our mac
and cheese cupcakes.

457
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,129
What?

458
00:21:55,197 --> 00:22:00,634
Sorry. It's just your
technique. It's kind of beautiful.

459
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,981
It's Dr. Sloan's
technique, actually.

460
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:04,421
But I am pretty good at it.

461
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,939
Here. You try.

462
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,202
Okay.

463
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,224
Hey, just checking
in. What's the story?

464
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,527
Stuart's afraid he's not
gonna be able to ride anymore

465
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,245
because he wiped
out and hit Chicken Bill,

466
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,830
and Chicken Bill hit
Roach Clip, who ended up

467
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,665
taking out Gasoline, The
Hammer, and Blue Corner Pete.

468
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,024
Medically. I meant
what's the story medically?

469
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,837
Well, his limb is still viable.

470
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,137
And we're almost done
with the debridement.

471
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,327
So as soon as he heals up,

472
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,091
I will get him back in
here for a skin graft.

473
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,748
That sounds good.

474
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:48,832
Thank you.

475
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,604
I think I'll take it from here.

476
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,961
Okay. Definitely.

477
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,722
You need to stop.

478
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,326
You are not gross
and you are not Karev.

479
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,162
Owen.

480
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,541
Oh, Cristina, I'm sorry.

481
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,743
I haven't had two
seconds to think about...

482
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,099
Oh, no, me either.

483
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,578
Actually, I wasn't
looking for you.

484
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,714
Is Avery still in there
with Stuart? Yeah. Why?

485
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,515
Oh, my patient needs
a pericardiocentesis,

486
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,384
and she won't let me touch
her until I take her to see him.

487
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,053
Let me guess. We're
talking about Gasoline?

488
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,175
You know Gasoline?

489
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,061
Oh, we go way back.

490
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,824
A couple of hours ago, she
threatened to have me beaten senseless.

491
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,397
Sounds like her. What a doll.

492
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:38,706
Wait.

493
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,195
She wants to get
close to Stuart?

494
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,753
Yeah. What?

495
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,535
I need you to page security

496
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,603
and have them meet me in
the ER as soon as possible.

497
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,547
Right away, Doctor. Owen, what?

498
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,210
Where the hell did she go?

499
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,835
Stuart's the reason
they all crashed.

500
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,471
You screw with one of
them, they all screw with you.

501
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,717
We don't keep any tire
irons around, do we?

502
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,975
We need to find her. Now.

503
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,610
They're sewing in the graft now.

504
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:12,733
Onto the aorta?

505
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:13,867
Yes.

506
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,241
What's her BP?

507
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,337
100 over 60.

508
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,244
Heart rate?

509
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,542
98.

510
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,165
What's happening, sir?

511
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,206
Dr. Webber?

512
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,396
It's working.

513
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,414
It's working.

514
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,883
Don't you freakin' touch me!

515
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,863
Move your ass or
he'll move it for you!

516
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,165
Gasoline, this wasn't our deal.

517
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:08,239
Shove your deal.

518
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,152
You cagers wouldn't
let me see Stuart,

519
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,759
and now my guys find
out he had to have surgery?

520
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,578
I need to see him now!

521
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,647
He is one of us and he's
hurt and he might freakin' die,

522
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,583
and I need to see him!

523
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,006
What did you do
with the room key?

524
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,173
The room key?

525
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,531
Oh, come on!

526
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,982
I gave you the room key
before we left the freakin' room.

527
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,979
No, you didn't. Did you?

528
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,570
You do this all the time.

529
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,834
You did this last week with the
check for Becky's piano lesson.

530
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:43,985
What is wrong with you?

531
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,459
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

532
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,626
What's the problem?

533
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,380
I lost the key to our room.

534
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,934
Look. I'm sorry.

535
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,486
It's been a very long day.

536
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,256
And obviously we

537
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,491
are both very drunk.

538
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,943
Oh, no. What's your room number?

539
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,112
220.

540
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,565
Jordan Shouse? That's it.

541
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:09,634
There.

542
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,286
Thank you. Thank you so much.

543
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,544
I think that every food should
be turned into a cupcake.

544
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:27,767
Mmm.

545
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,102
Lasagna cupcakes.

546
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,403
Mmm.

547
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,267
- Mashed potato cupcakes.
- Mmm!

548
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Callie. Mmm.

549
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,157
Please don't run.

550
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,767
What?

551
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,103
It's all been awful.

552
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:49,273
And I've been awful.

553
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,675
But I'm just starting to
feel like myself again.

554
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:56,096
And I know that not everything
can be about my leg all the time.

555
00:26:56,164 --> 00:26:57,209
And I don't want it to be,

556
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,399
but right now, it just...

557
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,902
It is.

558
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,574
But I can't lose you.

559
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,677
So please.

560
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,679
Don't run.

561
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:17,351
After the car accident,

562
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,354
you never left my side.

563
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,589
Not once.

564
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,442
There's no way
I'm leaving yours.

565
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,339
What would you say to

566
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,476
a good old-fashioned
junior-high make out?

567
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:56,423
Thank God you were
there. You saved her life.

568
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,392
I almost got her killed,
leaving her in that place.

569
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,872
You did what you
thought was best.

570
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,829
No, I did what I was told.

571
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,447
I never thought it was best.

572
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:06,917
It won't happen again.

573
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,637
Miranda.

574
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,824
You have to get going.

575
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,759
Go.

576
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,922
Richard.

577
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,493
You came.

578
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,178
You're here.

579
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,678
I'm here, baby.

580
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,433
Stay with me.

581
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:40,622
Just stay.

582
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,936
I'm not going anywhere.

583
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,689
I'm here.

584
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,349
Hey. Hey.

585
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,078
Promise me you won't put me
in a home if I get Alzheimer's.

586
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,913
You okay?

587
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,282
Yeah. Just promise me.

588
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,384
I promise.

589
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,886
Thank you.

590
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:25,178
Insert the needle
just below the xiphoid.

591
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,847
Good.

592
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,118
That's good.

593
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,249
Dragging her all over the
hospital wasn't the best idea.

594
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,538
You've met her.

595
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,586
How well do you think
it goes when I say no?

596
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,541
You're gonna need
to explain Stuart.

597
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,697
He's our accountant.

598
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,715
Got us on a group health plan,

599
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,534
helped us set up a
Christmas toy drive.

600
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,430
He wanted to ride, so
we let him hang around.

601
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,054
Thought it was funny.

602
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,823
Now he's like family.

603
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,010
She got him one of these.

604
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,596
Which means he's
one of us for life.

605
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,105
If he was gonna die, she
wanted him to at least see it.

606
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,035
Have you seen his arm?

607
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,215
Doesn't look like he's
gonna get on a bike again.

608
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,288
What do you drive, Doc?

609
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:09,822
Pickup.

610
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,657
Yeah. Figures.

611
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,043
You're a cager.

612
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,579
Whenever you hit the road,
you're stuck in a metal box.

613
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,681
But the day you
step out of that cage,

614
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,284
say <i>sayonara</i> to your
job, your marriage,

615
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,387
or whatever the hell
else is boxing you in,

616
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,839
you'll never give that up.

617
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,621
Oh, I... I'm... I'm coming.
I have to get my dress.

618
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:41,826
Okay, take a breath.

619
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,273
Just... I didn't forget.

620
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,774
It was Adele Webber.

621
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,121
I mean, if it was
anybody else...

622
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,277
Well, is she okay?

623
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,146
Stable in the ICU.

624
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,725
We thought she
wasn't gonna make it.

625
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,793
Look, if I'd known
it was her, I...

626
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:52,861
Hey, we're gonna make it.

627
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,295
I don't know what
they did with my dress.

628
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,803
Look, Miranda.
Miranda, slow down.

629
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:58,471
Slow down.

630
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,858
Okay, I forgot.

631
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,994
Just for like 20 minutes.

632
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:07,064
We... We were in
the trauma room,

633
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,066
and she'd lost so much blood,

634
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,733
and we had to rush
up to endoscopy,

635
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,770
and in those 20 minutes,

636
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,872
I forgot

637
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,741
about you and the wedding.

638
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,810
Somebody had to remind me.

639
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,412
Well, was a person dying?

640
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,074
I mean, really
dying, right then?

641
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:25,132
Well, yeah.

642
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,527
Well, then you're
supposed to forget.

643
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,963
Anyway, you were never so crazy

644
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,314
about the wedding
in the first place.

645
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,837
Yeah, but I...

646
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,400
You were crazy about me, right?

647
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,790
Yeah.

648
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,409
About marrying me?

649
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,878
You were sure about that?

650
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,283
I'm just so scared.

651
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,586
See, I'm scared
that you get it now

652
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,855
only because it
was Adele Webber.

653
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,674
And see, and this is not gonna
be the last time that I forget,

654
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,110
because I have so
many things I want to do,

655
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,213
things I want to be.

656
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,383
See, my ambition, it
killed my last marriage.

657
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,319
I don't want to do that to you.

658
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,220
Miranda, Miranda, you...

659
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,934
You do know that I'm not at home

660
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,519
waiting around with
a roast in the oven?

661
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:09,604
Yeah. No, I... I'm
in Los Angeles,

662
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,828
becoming a surgeon, too.

663
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,698
I have things I
want to do and be.

664
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,334
And... And... And...

665
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,482
We may only be together
five minutes every two months,

666
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,888
but, hey, when we do,

667
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:25,708
we will savor every second.

668
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,240
Because we both know how
valuable those five minutes are.

669
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,514
Do you love me?

670
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,033
More than I can
hold in my heart.

671
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,245
You're sure about that?

672
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,171
I am completely sure of that.

673
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,573
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life with me,

674
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:44,060
even if it is only in
five-minute increments

675
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,561
every two months?

676
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,603
I do.

677
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:57,207
Then by the power vested in
me by the state of Washington,

678
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:00,177
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

679
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,371
All right.

680
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,303
I am so sorry. I didn't mean...

681
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,322
Hey, you cut that
crap out right now.

682
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,858
You didn't do anything.

683
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:06,404
The Hammer saw the whole thing.

684
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,562
That minivan
drifted into our lane.

685
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,330
Could've made any one of
us wipe out the way you did.

686
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,015
That's right.

687
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,722
That...

688
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,640
Is that mine?

689
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,443
Does this mean that
I get my road name?

690
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:27,697
We were all thinking
maybe "Road Rash."

691
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,500
God. That's freakin' hard-core.

692
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:37,256
All right. Give it
up for the little guy.

693
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,403
We missed the whole thing.

694
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:52,939
Well, maybe she won't notice.

695
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:58,495
I hope whatever you
were doing was worth it,

696
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,907
'cause you're a
terrible maid of honor.

697
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,749
Easy, easy, easy.

698
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,729
What did I miss? Oh,
pretty much everything.

699
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:07,136
And Bailey calling
me her maid of honor.

700
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,713
Look at this ring.
Did you see the ring?

701
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,701
And we missed the ceremony.

702
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,102
Oh, shoot.

703
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,573
So...

704
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:27,657
What do we...

705
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,965
I could take you home.

706
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,497
I can't sleep with you.

707
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,748
That's not what I was...

708
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,250
It wasn't?

709
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,230
You're great, it's just that I
don't... I don't sleep with interns.

710
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:41,854
I don't... I mean, I... I
don't sleep with my boss.

711
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:43,456
Yeah, it's messy.

712
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:45,102
And I've had enough
drama lately, so...

713
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,059
We are entirely
on the same page.

714
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,394
Great.

715
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,548
The lawyer sent over
the divorce papers.

716
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,154
We don't have to
do this right now.

717
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:18,024
Let's just...

718
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,260
Let's just take a minute and
think about what this means.

719
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm done thinking
about it, Cristina.

720
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,464
And?

721
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,314
We should never have
gotten married in the first place.

722
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:33,289
When we did, we took
something beautiful

723
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,543
and we put it in this box.

724
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,313
And for the last two
years, all we have done

725
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:44,583
is beat against those walls
and tear each other apart.

726
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,220
Now we sign these papers,

727
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,106
that ends.

728
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:52,024
We get out of that box.

729
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:55,278
We don't hurt each
other anymore.

730
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,253
You're gonna want to
remember tonight, Shane.

731
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:45,677
That is what a great
night in the ER looks like.

732
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,224
We deserve to celebrate.

733
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:49,749
Let's just get stupid drunk

734
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,551
and dance and...

735
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:52,752
Dr. Kepner,

736
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:55,204
I know what you think

737
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,372
is gonna happen,

738
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,575
but it can't.

739
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:04,480
Look, I worked too hard to
get into this program to start

740
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,899
sleeping with my mentor.

741
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:11,855
So thank you for the
interest, but, no, thank you.

742
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:15,107
What makes you think
that I want to sleep with you?

743
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,877
You touched my shoulder

744
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:20,029
and you brought me wine.

745
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,916
I was being nice.

746
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,301
Oh.

747
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,849
But you feel that you're
being sexually harassed?

748
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,289
No. No, I'm not... No.

749
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:32,291
Okay, good. Good.

750
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,327
Good. I'm glad
that's all cleared up.

751
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,916
So now we can just have fun.

752
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,201
Cheers.

753
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,993
Where is everybody else?

754
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,533
Oh, Lord.

755
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,479
What? You want
me to put it back on?

756
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,321
Are you kidding? Don't
ever put it back on.

757
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,759
Oh, sorry.

758
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,927
Wait.

759
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:09,178
This is so soft.

760
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,747
It's like it's made
out of polar bear.

761
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,699
I think this is my room.

762
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,295
What happened to the
mac and cheese cupcakes?

763
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,897
Are you kidding me?

764
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,044
You kept your guests
waiting five hours.

765
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,702
Now I saved a woman's life.
You couldn't save me some food?

766
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,737
You...

767
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,907
Go take care of
your guests, baby.

768
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,412
You look beautiful.

769
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,981
So I'm... I'm glad you
made it. Now how's her BP?

770
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,149
<i>All right.</i>

771
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:05,329
<i>Where's our bride and groom?</i> Go.

772
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:07,698
You've been keeping him
waiting long enough tonight. Go.

773
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,343
<i>Everybody's been waiting
a while for this dance.</i>

774
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,991
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's
give it up for the newlyweds!</i>

775
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,297
<i>The next time you're
in your doctor's office,</i>

776
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,688
<i>remember,</i>

777
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,791
<i>she's not asking all those
questions for her health.</i>

778
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,626
<i>She's asking them for yours.</i>

779
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:31,744
You're here?

780
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,682
No.

781
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:40,019
When?

782
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:42,154
<i>Tell her everything.</i>

783
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:45,991
<i>The small details aren't trivial.
They actually make the story.</i>

784
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,328
A little while ago.

785
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:50,530
What happened?

786
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:55,068
It was a heart attack.

787
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,439
The surgery fixed the aneurysm,

788
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,941
but it was too
much for her heart.

789
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,711
I shouldn't have...

790
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,363
No.

791
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:11,167
You did everything right.

792
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,401
Everything.

793
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:22,812
<i>There's no rush.</i>

794
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,465
<i>Take all the time you need.</i>

795
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,810
<i>Start at the beginning.</i>
