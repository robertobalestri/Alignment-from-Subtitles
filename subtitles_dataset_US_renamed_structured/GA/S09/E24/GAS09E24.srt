1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,637
<i>I had this badass
professor in med school.</i>

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,106
<i>She seemed invincible.</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,277
<i>Then one day, she
needed her gallbladder out.</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,945
<i>And the surgery killed her.</i>

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,550
<i>Her platelets stopped clotting.</i>

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,219
<i>She bled out on the table.</i>

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,256
<i>Everything that
could've gone wrong...</i>

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,425
<i>Did go wrong.</i>

9
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,794
<i>Surgeons have a name for it.</i>

10
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,898
<i>We call it a perfect storm.</i>

11
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,668
<i>Funny.</i>

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,438
<i>Never thought it
would happen to me.</i>

13
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,037
Ethan, so they're
moving you and your dad

14
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,305
to a safer hospital
for now, okay, buddy?

15
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,879
Can't you come, too?

16
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,650
They need me here. Okay?

17
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,403
Hang out a minute. We'll
send the gurney back down.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,451
It won't be so loud
once you're inside,

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,915
and then it's just...
It's just fun, okay?

20
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,596
I don't know how you can
even pretend this isn't an issue.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,753
Because it's not.

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,189
Were you even gonna tell
me you wanted to adopt him?

23
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:15,401
Well, that didn't happen, so...

24
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,536
But you wanted to.

25
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,627
Owen...

26
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:20,845
You want kids.

27
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,981
This is about one kid,
this kid who needed...

28
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,495
Okay, but the fact that
you are lying to yourself

29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,697
doesn't make me feel
better about you lying to me.

30
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,755
I am not lying about
the fact that I love you

31
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,290
and I want my
life to be with you.

32
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,286
You don't think you're
gonna look at me one day

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,288
and only see the things
I couldn't give you?

34
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,690
God, has it ever occurred to you

35
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,881
I might know my own
mind better than you?

36
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,736
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,888
Figures you'd go into labor
in the middle of a super storm.

38
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,489
Okay, we need to go
over your birth plan.

39
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,208
We never talked
details. Hang on.

40
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:57,209
I can't bully people unless I
know what to bully them about.

41
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,345
Maybe you should get back into
bed. You want to go back to bed?

42
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,929
No! She says no.

43
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,532
What do you need, a
pillow, a bouncy ball?

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,916
Ice chips. She says ice chips.

45
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,100
Are you gonna do
this the whole time?

46
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,137
Okay, I'm gonna check on Connie,
see what's taking her so long.

47
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,479
She's with other laboring
moms right now. She's busy.

48
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,811
You're the only one I care
about. The rest can wait.

49
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,368
Did you talk to Owen?

50
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,769
Yes and no.

51
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,587
God, how is your
pain now, seven, eight?

52
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:22,157
Nine. Talk to me
about Owen. It helps.

53
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,226
Owen is...

54
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:26,595
At a 10.

55
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,183
This guy was cleaning his
gutters in hurricane-force winds.

56
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,013
It's like he wanted to spend
the night on an OR table.

57
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,486
Not that I'm complaining.

58
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,617
You're awfully excited about
another man's misfortunes.

59
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,820
No, I just meant I'm glad
Dr. Bailey's getting back into an OR.

60
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,244
Yeah, so am I.

61
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,672
I can't do this.

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,257
Miranda...

63
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,979
Go back inside.

64
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,061
All right, what is our
risk of flooding here?

65
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,713
You got water pumps.
You got sandbags.

66
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,915
The lights keep flickering.
Now are the generators...

67
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,071
I tested 'em last month.

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,951
Listen, you guys got
patients to worry about.

69
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,842
You take care of them.
This hospital's my patient.

70
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,646
These beds are filling up fast.

71
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,593
Yeah, people think this is the
safest place to sit out a storm.

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,862
Half these people aren't
even sick. They're just scared.

73
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,670
Yeah. Christian.

74
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,955
<i>Dr. Chaney to ER Triage...</i>

75
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,941
Not used to it yet?

76
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,127
It just feels really weird on my
finger. I keep running it into stuff.

77
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,845
Pin it to your scrub top.

78
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,980
Oh. Cool.

79
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,365
Mmm-hmm.

80
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,217
Chief. Hey, there's
a patient in OR two

81
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,380
who needs an exploratory
lap immediately.

82
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,782
The patient's already under.

83
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,126
Do you have any general
surgeons available?

84
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,675
You look available.

85
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,428
I'm not, sir.

86
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,946
Excuse me.

87
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,113
Excuse me.

88
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:54,232
You're my son's doctor,
Jimmy Strickland?

89
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,700
Is he done with surgery already?

90
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,452
No, sir. We haven't started yet.

91
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,722
Is everything okay?

92
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,275
Everything is fine, sir.

93
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,472
I'll be the doctor
operating on your son.

94
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,114
Will you walk with me, Mr. Strickland,
and fill me in on what happened?

95
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,916
<i>Dr. Simmons to the ER.
Dr. Simmons to the ER.</i>

96
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,597
I would like to help out,
Chief, however I can.

97
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,205
Well, it makes it hard when
you won't touch a patient.

98
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,874
Actually, I was gonna
suggest that we get someone

99
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,644
to make sure there's enough
surplus blood in the ORs.

100
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,797
<i>Dr. Grant, extension 2-2-7-9.
Dr. Grant, extension 2-2-7-9.</i>

101
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,832
Yeah. Okay.

102
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,100
Cut her some slack.

103
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,337
What happened to you?

104
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,973
A tree.

105
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,541
Karev, if you're free,

106
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,937
the NICU needs help getting
all these babies out of here.

107
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,378
I thought Arizona
was overseeing this.

108
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,980
Has anyone seen her?

109
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,652
Hey, you okay?

110
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,121
Yeah, no.

111
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,923
The NICU's just understaffed,
and I should be there already.

112
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,169
You need an extra set of hands?

113
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,495
Oh, no. Please, just...

114
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,830
No.

115
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,343
I understand your concerns, Tim,

116
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,287
but we were just told to
evacuate the highest priorities first.

117
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,538
So Crystal's baby gets taken
to safety and mine is stuck here?

118
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,701
It's perfectly safe
here, Tim. Okay?

119
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,304
The pit says we have to suspend
evacuations due to the weather.

120
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,194
Wait. We were just down there.

121
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,903
The last rig to leave couldn't
even make it out of the parking lot.

122
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,716
Okay. Don't worry. Don't worry.

123
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,588
All of our staff is very well trained, and
your babies are in very good hands, okay?

124
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,769
I only see two nurses. No one
else made it in for their shift?

125
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,922
Okay. All right.
This is important.

126
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:31,007
The makers of tiny
humans get easily spooked.

127
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,132
It is our job tonight to keep
the tiny human makers happy,

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,012
or they will mutiny, and
we are outnumbered.

129
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,164
We remain calm.
We remain confident.

130
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,318
Because everything is
just fine. Understood?

131
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,591
You need some help?

132
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,726
Yes. No.

133
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,093
I thought that I told you...

134
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,562
I'm not gonna sit on my hands

135
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,592
while there's a roomful of babies
that need help. What can I do?

136
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,284
You can cross-check the med rec
forms so we can get the correct dosages.

137
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,504
We're outnumbered. Keep the
tiny human makers happy, right?

138
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,026
Well, I didn't expect to
see you again so soon.

139
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,773
Her contractions are
every three minutes.

140
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,174
And she doesn't want drugs.

141
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,543
I have Dr. Knox available in
case she changes her mind.

142
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,882
Look, she doesn't want drugs.

143
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,795
Okay, can everybody
just please shut up?

144
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,520
I want to push. I feel like I
need to push. Can I push?

145
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,472
I just need to check first...

146
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,503
What's going on?

147
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,205
Meredith, I need
you not to push.

148
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,529
Why?

149
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:23,515
There's face presentation.
I can feel your baby's face.

150
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,211
So we're gonna need
to do a C-section.

151
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,380
A C-section? I do not want
to have surgery. I know.

152
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:31,050
All right. You know what? It's
just a "C." That's barely surgery.

153
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,314
A moron could do a "C."

154
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,760
I... No offense.

155
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,563
Okay.

156
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,577
Well, don't panic. It's
just a power outage.

157
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,712
We have generators. The
power's gonna go on any second.

158
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,335
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

159
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,355
Derek?

160
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,507
Yeah, any second.

161
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,521
Okay, stay calm.

162
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,155
Let's get some flashlights,

163
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,157
all the light that you can find.

164
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,903
- Somebody get me a headlamp.
- Right away, doctor.

165
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,261
Dr. Warren, how's the gas?

166
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,190
Good. Backup battery
switched itself on.

167
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,341
His BP is still
dropping, though.

168
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,115
I can't see what the problem is.

169
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,934
Why isn't the echo
on battery power?

170
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,664
There should be a manual
switch. Ross, go look.

171
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,300
I know the generator
should be on.

172
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:21,756
I'm asking why it's not.

173
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,185
Webber, I'm checking
in. Do you need anything?

174
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,725
Some light would be good.

175
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,506
The emergency lights should
have kicked on. Well, they didn't.

176
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,730
Frank, when the
generator went out in '06,

177
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,309
you said there was
air in the fuel system.

178
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,261
Then you told me that it
would never happen again.

179
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,901
Yes, sir.

180
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,915
Well, then maybe you should get
your ass down there and get lookin'.

181
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,440
I've got a man open on
the table here. Yes, sir.

182
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,470
Hang in there, people.
We're working on it.

183
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,895
That probably helped.
Yelling at the guy.

184
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,063
Yes! I got it!

185
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,048
Damn it. Pericardial effusion.

186
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,432
Page Russell.

187
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,363
I don't believe he made it
in, sir, because of the storm.

188
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,997
Dr. Yang's the senior
cardio surgeon in charge.

189
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,805
Okay, then get Yang.

190
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:57,676
Can't you just rotate the
baby and push his face away?

191
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,111
It's very risky, for
the baby, for Meredith.

192
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,312
Dr. Yang.

193
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,809
Dr. Webber needs you in OR two.

194
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,027
To do what? I can't
operate in the dark.

195
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,113
No one is operating in the dark.

196
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,177
Okay, just go. I'll be fine.

197
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,707
Okay, happy, come here

198
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,076
and update me as soon
as they've made a decision.

199
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,611
So what are the risks of
repositioning the baby?

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,832
Not the minor risks.
The big, ugly, scary risks.

201
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,612
Because I'm a
lightning rod for those.

202
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,486
It's not an option. Why not?

203
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,215
Are you saying babies with face
presentation can't be born naturally?

204
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,655
It's not a good option.

205
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,368
Neither is cutting into
my wife in the dark.

206
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,855
How many babies have you
delivered in your career, Dr. Shepherd?

207
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,245
What, a couple, maybe more?

208
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,548
When I say a vaginal
delivery isn't an option,

209
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,432
I mean, it's not an option.

210
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,102
Now I could stand
here and waste time

211
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,305
explaining how your baby is
in a mento-posterior position

212
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:46,374
and how pushing a baby like that

213
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,211
will hyperextend its
neck, which can be fatal,

214
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,831
or I can better spend my
time prepping your wife

215
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,467
and baby for a delivery that will
not endanger either of their lives.

216
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,087
So, which do you prefer?

217
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,354
We're having a
C-section in the dark.

218
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,179
Yes. We are.

219
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,114
The vents kicked
on to battery power?

220
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,994
I checked them all
twice. They're working.

221
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,145
All the babies are breathing.

222
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,819
Good.

223
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,005
Listen, uh...

224
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,392
We were talking before the
whole tree thing happened...

225
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,405
It's fine. We... You
can just forget that I...

226
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,779
No sudden moves.
Wilson, don't turn around.

227
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:28,349
Karev, can you discreetly
check out that monitor behind me,

228
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,830
the one for Crystal's baby
vent? Do you see that red light?

229
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,565
Yes. That's the
low-battery light, right?

230
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,172
Oh, crap. Keep smiling.

231
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,470
Okay, Wilson, will you go
check the drawer over there

232
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,889
where we keep the spare
batteries? Tell me what you see.

233
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,646
Slowly and casually.

234
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,454
No batteries.

235
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,021
Okay.

236
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,324
Okay. No one panics.

237
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,389
I am going to look for spare batteries
while you all act like nothing's wrong.

238
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,346
Understand me? Nothing's wrong.

239
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,914
Something's wrong?

240
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,098
No.

241
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,670
Blood's here.

242
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:08,964
Thank you, nurse.

243
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,339
I'm sorry, Bailey. I
thought you were...

244
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,158
I'm just trying to do
what I can to help out.

245
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,365
Four units AB neg.

246
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,276
I yelled at her.

247
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,421
I thought it would work,

248
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,702
that tough love is what she
needed to get her back inside the OR.

249
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,372
I joined in as an
anesthesiologist on this surgery

250
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,891
because I thought that
would get her back in this OR.

251
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,966
My way didn't work either.

252
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,113
There's blood in
there, exiting the heart.

253
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,504
I can't find out where
unless I open him up.

254
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,042
And I'm not opening
his chest with no light.

255
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,929
I am not operating
on people in the dark.

256
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:50,331
Sir, I cannot operate
under these conditions.

257
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,828
Didn't we just teach the Syrians
how to operate under these conditions?

258
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,619
I'm not in Syria. Yang!

259
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:58,773
This is James Strickland. He's got a
wife, Carol, and four kids back in Arizona.

260
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,743
James' dad is 80 and alone since
James' mom died on Christmas.

261
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:05,491
And he's far too stubborn
to move into assisted living,

262
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,210
which is why James found
himself on his father's roof

263
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,785
trying to clean out his
gutter when the storm hit.

264
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,995
He was just trying to
take care of his dad.

265
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,776
He's a good man.

266
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,247
And he will die on this table
if you don't operate, Yang.

267
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:26,867
While we stand around
and watch, this man will die.

268
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,708
I'll scrub in.

269
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:40,042
You two own the hospital.

270
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,345
Can I request that ORs be stocked with
more than one flashlight in the future?

271
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,063
You get this baby
out of me safely,

272
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,767
and you can have
whatever you want.

273
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,308
What about William?
I like Sebastian.

274
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,893
Sebastian Shepherd?
That's a bit of a mouthful.

275
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,311
Brooks?

276
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,725
I'm not giving birth
to a country singer.

277
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,817
No, It's... I see
Heather. Brooks.

278
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,986
Dude, you're operating
in the dark on your wife?

279
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,103
Yeah.

280
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,000
Chief Hunt asked
me to go to the ORs

281
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,636
and let them know that the guy is
trying to fix the emergency lights.

282
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,220
We could use a
hand with these lights.

283
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,547
Okay, here we go.

284
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,082
Wait. I'm scared.

285
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,735
There is nothing to be
scared of. We can do this.

286
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,619
Everything will be fine.

287
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:19,887
Okay?

288
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,276
Don't mess this up.

289
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,729
Sit down, please, so I can work.

290
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,869
Okay, let's go. Ross, light.

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,868
A couple of people have
asked for two blankets.

292
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,435
One per person. That's it.

293
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,537
Matthew, what
are you doing here?

294
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,263
My rig stalled out in the river
that used to be Pike Street.

295
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,076
I walked the rest of the
way here. How can I help?

296
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,766
Grab some blankets. Okay.

297
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,369
Okay, now ordinarily, I'd discharge
you, but for now, this is home, all right?

298
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,372
Torres, blood's been distributed.
Anything else I can do?

299
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,125
You hear that noise?

300
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,063
Oh, my God!

301
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,276
It flipped right over.

302
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,620
Oh, my God. MAN 2: Oh, man.

303
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,069
- What happened?
- I don't know. I just...

304
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,773
Oh, my God. Fire!

305
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,792
Oh, my God. MAN 4:
The bus caught on fire!

306
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,910
Hurry! Hurry!

307
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:21,966
I smell gas.

308
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,896
There's a fuel leak somewhere.

309
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,182
We were coming from the
church, trying to wait out the storm.

310
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,706
Careful. The roof,
it caved in on us.

311
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,157
We didn't know where else to go.

312
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,904
We've got to get everyone
away from this fire.

313
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,260
Easy. Easy.

314
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,941
All right, if you can walk,
let's get you inside! This way!

315
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,693
We're gonna need to setup
an emergency triage inside.

316
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,401
We're gonna need meds.
Bailey, can you handle this?

317
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,869
Yeah. Murphy!

318
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:44,016
We gotta move, Hunt.
This thing's gonna blow.

319
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,139
Avery, hurry up!

320
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,991
I got one more.

321
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,900
She's jammed between two
seats. Help me get her out.

322
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,491
This is not how I
wanted to do this.

323
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,549
Well, you once said
that about marrying me.

324
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:55,850
Look how that turned out.

325
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,469
I love you.

326
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,055
And your baby is out.

327
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,267
What do you see?

328
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,707
I don't know. It's too dark.

329
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,177
I don't hear him crying.
Why isn't he crying?

330
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,015
Somebody talk to me.
I don't hear him crying.

331
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,096
All right.

332
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,114
Here you go.

333
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,055
Look at that.

334
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,459
He's perfect.

335
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:39,960
He's just perfect.

336
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,341
Derek?

337
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,843
His breathing is
shallow. His sats are low.

338
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,144
Why are his sats low?

339
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,958
Well, in the dark like
this, it's hard to be sure.

340
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,581
But it's not uncommon,

341
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,294
especially in babies like
these that come out early.

342
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,729
We'll get him to the NICU and
make sure everything checks out.

343
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,483
Derek, go with him. Do not
leave his side for a second.

344
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,757
Do you hear me? Okay.

345
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,625
Okay, guys, don't
leave her side.

346
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,921
Make sure she's okay.
You understand me?

347
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,429
Got it, boss. Yes, sir.

348
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,656
Another battery light
just went on in there.

349
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,069
Any luck? No.

350
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,993
No one thought
about spare batteries.

351
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,873
And pretty soon, all those
machines are gonna die out there,

352
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,258
and then all those
babies are gonna die,

353
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:35,260
and all because I didn't think
ahead to stockpile batteries.

354
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,802
And also, I cheated
on my wife with that...

355
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,705
Woman out there, and
I'm a horrible person.

356
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,239
I'm horrible.

357
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,611
Hey.

358
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,213
I'm in love with that intern
out there, but I won't tell her.

359
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,859
And I keep saying to
myself I won't tell her

360
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,595
because everyone I
love turns out to be crazy

361
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,436
or mean or cancer-y or leaves.

362
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,422
But the thing all those
women have in common is me.

363
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,759
They were all fine
before they met me.

364
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,228
I'm damaged goods or something.

365
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,098
So you're not the worst
person in this closet.

366
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,919
There are no batteries in here.

367
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,131
What the hell are we gonna do?

368
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:14,383
I have no idea.

369
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,141
Okay, we need antibiotics,
anti-inflammatories,

370
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,211
and pain meds,
lots of pain meds.

371
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,124
I've never heard
screams like that before.

372
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,498
Oh, no. It's dead.

373
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,467
There's no way for me to...

374
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:28,069
Punch in my code.

375
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,105
How are we supposed
to get meds if...

376
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:34,559
Come on. Open.

377
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,228
He looked good,
right? That cry was loud.

378
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,640
And he looked good.
You saw him, right?

379
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,392
I guess so. I didn't
get a good look.

380
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,656
Say good things.

381
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,062
When you don't
have the information

382
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,480
and you're talking to
the mother of a newborn,

383
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,220
you say good things.

384
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,733
'Cause nine out of 10 times,
that's what's going to happen...

385
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,340
The good things.

386
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,719
What are you teaching
these guys anyway, Dr. Grey?

387
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,071
I know, right?

388
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,861
Dr. Ryan, it's an emergency.

389
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,810
I've got a mom with
a placental abruption.

390
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,999
Okay, Meredith, I've
closed your uterus,

391
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,878
and I just started to
suture your incisions.

392
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,279
Do you trust these
guys to finish?

393
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,764
Have you taught them
that much? I'll do it.

394
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,867
No, you stole neuro.
You're not stealing this.

395
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,326
This is my surgery, my
patient, my incision, mine.

396
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,322
Dr. Grey, I'm sorry.
That was inappropriate.

397
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,508
It's okay, Ross. I
like the enthusiasm.

398
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,708
Go scrub. Thank you.

399
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,776
Thanks, Connie.

400
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,361
Good luck, Mommy. Congrats.

401
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,587
More light.

402
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:20,972
To your left.

403
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,957
I can't find the source.

404
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,627
Everything I look at
turns out to be a shadow.

405
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:28,139
I could kill him if I do this.

406
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,792
Well, you'll certainly
kill him if you don't.

407
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,136
Will you stop saying that?
It's not helping. I can't see.

408
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,067
Then don't look.

409
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,514
Everyone, turn out your lights.

410
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:36,949
What do you mean?
I'm sorry. What?

411
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,456
Yang.

412
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,807
Listen for it.

413
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,644
You know what a
healthy heart sounds like.

414
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:47,214
Listen and tell me
where the problem is.

415
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:52,069
Now, everyone, lights out

416
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,570
and quiet.

417
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,686
It's...

418
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,890
Wait.

419
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,559
I think it's...

420
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,296
It's here.

421
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,198
I got it.

422
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,284
I got it. I have my
finger on the leak.

423
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,651
It's ventricular.

424
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,207
Lights, please.

425
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,225
If the ventilators stop working,

426
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,650
then these babies die
unless we manually bag them.

427
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,446
Crystal's battery light
has been on a while,

428
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,521
so when it dies,

429
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,102
you switch her baby over to
manual ventilation calmly and quietly.

430
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,204
You guys, go check
on the other babies.

431
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,560
Dr. Shepherd?

432
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,390
His sats are low, even with
oxygen. I think he needs c-pap.

433
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,674
This yours? Yeah.

434
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,976
Congrats, man. Let's
take a look at him.

435
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,066
Thank you.

436
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,268
Wilson, go. Excuse me.

437
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,005
Hey, Crystal.

438
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,159
I'm just gonna switch your little
girl over to a manual vent, okay?

439
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,674
Look at her. I think she's
grown since yesterday.

440
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:13,278
Found another red light, on
the Hitchens baby in the back.

441
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,780
That makes two more so far.

442
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,782
Three. I just found another
one, too, but it's fine.

443
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,839
I'll just jump in and bag
my baby when it's time.

444
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,241
And Dr. Edwards can bag hers.

445
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,720
We don't know how long
the power's gonna be off.

446
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,005
We could be bagging
these babies all night.

447
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,295
We'll bag all night.

448
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,980
It's fine. We can do this.

449
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,534
Thank you.

450
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,481
Okay, the important
thing is that we keep calm

451
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,483
and we don't alarm the parents,
cause there's no reason to...

452
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,635
Excuse me, Dr. Robbins?
Yes, Tim. What is it?

453
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,899
This red thing right here,
is this a low-battery light?

454
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,711
Where are Hunt and Avery?
That fire's getting bigger.

455
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,302
Where are the pain meds? I
got a patient in pain over here.

456
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,987
I tried to get the meds.

457
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,150
The machine, it won't
open without power.

458
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,019
I can't get it to open.
All right. Never mind that.

459
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,855
I've got at least two open fractures
and some nasty lacerations.

460
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,273
You want to jump in over there?

461
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,130
I... I don't...

462
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,168
Uh, you need meds.

463
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,386
I'll figure out the
meds. Murphy.

464
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,519
Smell that? There's
gas everywhere.

465
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,303
I have a daughter. She's three.

466
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,190
Have you seen her? Is she okay?

467
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,659
All right, I'm gonna have to
wrap this arm to stop the bleeding.

468
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,983
No, no, she's
wearing pink high-tops.

469
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,763
Her name is Evelyn.
I call her Evie.

470
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,087
Everyone's inside, ma'am.
I'm sure that she's there.

471
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,686
If we can move this thing even an
inch, I think we can get her out of here.

472
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,009
Let's do it fast.

473
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,588
Need some more light over here.

474
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,718
Ross, what is taking so long?

475
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:40,421
It's fine. It's just... It
won't stop bleeding.

476
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,773
Oh, God. That's...

477
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,158
That's a lot of blood.

478
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,960
How much blood?

479
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:48,862
I don't know. It's not
coming from your uterus.

480
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:53,166
Brooks, shine a light over here.
I feel something on my hand.

481
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:56,436
There's blood coming out
around my IV. I'm in DIC.

482
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,974
I need FFP, packed red
blood cells, and platelets.

483
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,202
I had a fall. What?

484
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,360
Yesterday, I fell
down the stairs.

485
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,206
I might have injured
something in my abdomen.

486
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,309
Did you feel any
pain? I've been in labor.

487
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,665
Go get help, now.

488
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,301
Ross, we don't have time.

489
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,548
You need to open me back up
and find the source of this bleed.

490
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,954
I can't. I've never...

491
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:18,175
Shane, it's a basic midline
laparotomy. Pack the four quadrants.

492
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,944
Find the source of the bleed.

493
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,590
Do not let me bleed
out on this table.

494
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,948
Dr. Grey... Shane,
do it, right now.

495
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,052
Good. Good. It's moving.

496
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,120
Pull her out. Pull her out.

497
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,878
All right, go, go. I got her.

498
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:39,641
All right, we're gonna walk
you out through the door.

499
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,759
We're gonna... You're
gonna have to walk...

500
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:43,050
No, no, no. My leg, I can't.

501
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,511
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to cover your eyes, all right?

502
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,263
Ready? Here we go.

503
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,465
Stay down.

504
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,384
All right.

505
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,138
This is ridiculous.

506
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,134
So you're saying you don't
have any extra batteries?

507
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,652
Manual ventilation
is just as effective...

508
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,154
My monitor just
went black. I'm on it.

509
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:11,139
My baby can't die. Is
my baby gonna die?

510
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,043
Mine's out, too. All
right. I'm on my way.

511
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,793
See? We're handling it.
Everything is under control.

512
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,616
Under control? Do the math.

513
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,114
You have doctors on four
different babies right now.

514
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,754
You're the only one left.

515
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:23,543
You're telling me you can ventilate
a dozen babies all by yourself?

516
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,093
Okay, okay...

517
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,177
This is not okay!

518
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,564
Everybody.

519
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,049
Everybody, shut up!

520
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,366
You're right. There are not enough doctors
in this room to ventilate every baby.

521
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,039
But there are enough people.

522
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,941
He's right. We can teach you.

523
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,687
You want us to
bag our own babies?

524
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:44,044
Actually, it's pretty easy.

525
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,141
I learned how to do it
my first day in med school.

526
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,447
I'll show you.

527
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:50,000
You just take the bag
with your dominant hand,

528
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,503
give a good, hard
squeeze every second.

529
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,304
So one, one thousand,

530
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:57,374
two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.

531
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:58,842
You want to try?

532
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,256
Not really. No, you'll
be fine. I'll be right here.

533
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,520
Come on.

534
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,467
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

535
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:09,169
That's great. That's great.

536
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,775
Everything's gonna be just fine.

537
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,810
It looks like the spleen is
the source of the bleeding.

538
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:26,386
Okay, so mobilize the spleen, divide
it by its ligamentous attachments...

539
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:27,649
I can't. I've never done it.

540
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,740
You can. You've seen me do it.

541
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,593
Mobilize, assess the injury,
and stop the hemorrhage.

542
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,730
Okay. Okay.

543
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,532
I need metz and
lap pads, please.

544
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,135
And follow me with suction.

545
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,070
That's right, Ross. That's it.

546
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,355
You got this. This is your OR.

547
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,335
You don't need
my help. Yes, I do.

548
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,011
No, you don't, because I'm gonna
lose consciousness in a few seconds.

549
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,674
And you're gonna be on your own.

550
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,242
And you're not gonna freak out.

551
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,635
And, Shane, if I arrest
for more than nine minutes,

552
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,703
let me go.

553
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,484
Don't revive me. I do not
want to be a vegetable.

554
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,007
Do you understand me?

555
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,227
Shane, I need you to respond.

556
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,863
I need to know
you understand me.

557
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:15,535
Dr. Ross,

558
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:20,324
your superior is
asking you to respond...

559
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:21,603
Yes, Dr. Grey.

560
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,478
Ross, you can...
You can do this.

561
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:26,513
And...

562
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,616
Tell Derek

563
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,468
I know

564
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,354
the baby's name.

565
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,056
It's...

566
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,795
You okay?

567
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,698
That was...

568
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,071
You made me a better
doctor tonight, Dr. Webber.

569
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,625
Thank you.

570
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,395
You're welcome.

571
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,646
I'm gonna go check on Meredith,
see if we have a baby yet.

572
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,303
Grey's having her baby?

573
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:07,804
Well, what do you know?

574
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,842
Well, I oughta see
what's holding up Frank.

575
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,477
Now I see what she means...

576
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,679
Miranda, when
she talks about you.

577
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,104
She says that you can

578
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:26,673
pull greatness
right out of people.

579
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,397
I wasn't able to pull it
out of her, apparently.

580
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,468
It's not working. It's jammed.

581
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,615
"In case of emergency,
use the key."

582
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,873
A bus crashed. This
is an emergency.

583
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,509
We are using the damn key. Here.

584
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,161
Dr. Bailey, can you help?

585
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,596
It's Dr. Grey. She's in
surgery, and she's in bad shape.

586
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,065
Dr. Grey is very capable.
She'll figure it out.

587
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,767
She's not operating.
She's the one on the table.

588
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,346
Dr. Bailey!

589
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,577
Dr. Bailey?

590
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,819
Don't just stand
there. Get the meds.

591
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:50,691
Let's go.

592
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,923
Move fast. This thing's
a ticking time bomb!

593
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,124
Come on. Come on. Come on.

594
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,325
Almost there. Done.

595
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,589
All right. Let's go.

596
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:04,855
Start a large-bore
IV. Where's Jackson?

597
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,844
Right behind us. No, he's not.

598
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,595
Hey. Your name is Evie, right?

599
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,267
I like your shoes, Evie.
Those are really cool.

600
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,852
Bet you can run pretty
fast in those, huh?

601
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:22,489
Hey, you want to race?
I bet I could beat you.

602
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,392
Come on. Just grab my
hand. We can go right now.

603
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,327
Come on. Here, take my hand.

604
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,542
I've mobilized her spleen.

605
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:50,244
I considered splenic salvage,
but I can't control the bleeding.

606
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,518
I did everything she said.

607
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,286
Everything she said, Dr. Bailey.

608
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,006
Another set.

609
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,730
Move over.

610
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,588
Where is Meredith Grey?

611
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,885
I delivered her baby hours
ago. She should be in recovery.

612
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,893
She's not. Where is she?

613
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,360
Hey, I have an idea. Why don't
we go find your mommy, huh?

614
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,851
Yeah, come on.

615
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,286
I know where she is.
We'll go find her right now.

616
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:27,532
Come on, Evie.

617
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,267
We're not gonna be
able to salvage any of this.

618
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,203
I need to do a complete splenectomy
to get control of the hemorrhage.

619
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,494
What happened?

620
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:35,896
Can you see him?

621
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,759
Wait, is that him
behind the bus?

622
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:38,827
Avery! Jackson!

623
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:39,950
Avery, come back here!

624
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,079
Evie! Why is he...

625
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,197
No! No! OWEN:
Avery, get back here!

626
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,582
April! What is he doing?

627
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,526
No, no, no! It's too
dangerous. What's going...

628
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,125
Get back!

629
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:32,118
Jackson!

630
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,204
Jackson!

631
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,775
No!

632
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,193
No!

633
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:57,977
Evie?

634
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,414
Evie! Oh, God, baby.

635
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,456
Thank you so much.

636
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:10,791
Thank you.

637
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,498
Frank!

638
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,640
Frank!

639
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,011
Frank.

640
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:36,483
Frank. Frank?

641
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,719
I got you. I got you, Frank.

642
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:42,272
Stay with me. Stay
with me, Frank.

643
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,629
Hold it right there.
Hold it right there for me.

644
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,083
You idiot!

645
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,218
Don't...

646
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,397
You could have... April!

647
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,099
Hey, Kepner. Died! You...

648
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,101
Stop. Kepner, what
is your problem?

649
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,725
Kepner, take a walk.

650
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,134
Take a walk!

651
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,969
Okay.

652
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,408
He looks like her.

653
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,179
Did you see him?

654
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,498
Um, no. I didn't.

655
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,133
Yeah, he looks like her.

656
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,539
His APGARs are good.

657
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:38,111
Six and a nine.
He's gonna be fine.

658
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,547
He's gonna be great.

659
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,252
Cristina?

660
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,493
Meredith Grey has survived a
bomb, a drowning, a gunman

661
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,029
and a plane crash,
and she's still here.

662
00:31:56,098 --> 00:32:00,500
She's gonna die when she's
90, old and warm in her bed.

663
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,068
She is not gonna die today.

664
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,605
Today's she gonna be fine.

665
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,209
I hope so.

666
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,644
She has to be.

667
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,114
She's our person.

668
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:30,130
Meredith had a
massive splenic bleed.

669
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,999
I removed it, but...

670
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,242
She...

671
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,905
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.

672
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:43,142
She's fine. Bailey did it.

673
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,094
With an assist from Dr. Ross.

674
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,591
Bailey decided,
with the power out,

675
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,526
it's safest just to keep
her here till she wakes up.

676
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,166
She's alive? She's alive.

677
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,806
I'm sorry, guys. I
didn't mean to cry and...

678
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,242
And scare you. I just...

679
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,110
I just...

680
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,920
Let's get him upstairs, have
him worked up for an MI.

681
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,706
All right. You were right.

682
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:15,175
Air in the fuel system.

683
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,678
Solenoid stopped the injector
from firing. I'm sorry, man.

684
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,765
Don't, Frank, forget it.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

685
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,344
I feel like I gave
you this heart attack.

686
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,985
You were right, though.

687
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,154
But I fixed it. I just gotta
flip the transfer switch.

688
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,489
Okay.

689
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,041
Good job, Frank.

690
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,870
Okay. MAN: Let's go.

691
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,591
She did great tonight.

692
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,994
I have to believe it's 'cause
she had a great teacher.

693
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,047
If you're gonna feel responsible

694
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,817
for making your ladies
crazy or giving 'em cancer,

695
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,019
then you should at least take
credit for helping make 'em great.

696
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,256
My baby's doing great.

697
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:05,741
I extubated her. She's
on a nasal cannula.

698
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,544
We gonna talk?

699
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,165
I made a mistake.

700
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,285
I can't...

701
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,120
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

702
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,102
I'm not gonna leave
things like this, though.

703
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,342
I like you a lot.

704
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,174
So if you change
your mind, then...

705
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:31,601
You will not believe the
night I have had so far.

706
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,519
Hey, Callie. Hey.

707
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,472
Lights.

708
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,946
Is that...

709
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,599
Is that Arizona's ring
pinned to your scrub top?

710
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,336
Yeah. It must be.

711
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:53,089
We had a pyloric stenosis baby.

712
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,753
Projectile-vomited all
over the place. I got soaked.

713
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:59,896
Arizona was nice enough
to lend me some scrubs.

714
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,325
Thank you, by the
way. You're a lifesaver.

715
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,267
This place looks so
different in the dark.

716
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,569
Yeah.

717
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,772
You think the tree
ruined my couch?

718
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,694
I think it ruined your
entire living room.

719
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,410
Listen, I have to tell you
something. No, you don't.

720
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,877
You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

721
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,468
I think I do, and you shouldn't.

722
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:41,137
Jo... I'll mess it up, Alex.

723
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,641
I mess everything
good in my life up,

724
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,277
and we work as friends really
well, and I don't wanna mess that up.

725
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,447
You won't mess anything up.

726
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:55,184
Last night, before the tree,
you asked me a question.

727
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,031
You wanted to hear
me say the words.

728
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,788
So I'm...

729
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,757
Saying them right now.

730
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,209
I don't hear anything. Shut up.

731
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,610
Okay, but I'm... I'm serious.

732
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,601
Fine. I love you.

733
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,240
Don't.

734
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:37,260
Whatever it is that's bugging you,
just keep it to yourself, all right?

735
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,702
I want you...

736
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,112
Jackson.

737
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,109
I want you.

738
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,327
April...

739
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,630
I haven't been fair to
you, I know, and I've...

740
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,282
I've really hurt you.

741
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,800
And you're getting married.

742
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,769
When that bus exploded,

743
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,078
and I thought
you were gone, I...

744
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,857
You're getting married.

745
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:15,915
Unless you can give
me a reason not to?

746
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,096
There you are.

747
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,135
How's Meredith? How's the baby?

748
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,526
Good.

749
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:29,074
Think she's ready
for visitors yet?

750
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,397
Yeah, sure. Go for it.

751
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,766
Well, we could go together.

752
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,771
Do you know how much I love you?

753
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,775
I do.

754
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:48,781
I felt such joy today

755
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,483
in that dark OR.

756
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:53,731
I could hear the blood moving.

757
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:57,456
I knew exactly what the
heart muscle was thinking.

758
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,058
And I realized after...

759
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,995
I feel that way all the time.

760
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:08,134
I'm made for the OR.

761
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,537
Even the boring
procedures, I can feel

762
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:14,306
pure joy, content.

763
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:19,645
You feel that

764
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:21,948
with just me?

765
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,163
What kind of a question is that?

766
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,688
Derek watches Zola put
applesauce in her ear,

767
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:32,058
and he's enchanted.

768
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:35,461
You felt that way with Ethan.

769
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:37,108
You're reading way
too much into this.

770
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,177
Okay, if you could stop for a
second and listen to your heart...

771
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,368
Cristina, you don't know
what I want in my life.

772
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:44,754
Am I enough, Owen?

773
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,825
Do you really
believe I'll be enough?

774
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:02,984
I wish it were different.

775
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,073
No, no...

776
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,319
I'm sorry.

777
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,423
Cristina... Owen.

778
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,647
It already happened.

779
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,507
Cristina, I said no.

780
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:28,831
I thought we were past the hard
stuff. I thought we were finally good.

781
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,066
We were. We are.

782
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,478
We're married! I know.

783
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,937
We... God, we have a child!

784
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,599
I know! How could you do this?

785
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,386
I don't know, except I did. After
all that's happened this year,

786
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,087
everything we've been through,
everything we've survived,

787
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,939
the bankruptcy,
Mark, the plane...

788
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,315
You weren't on
the plane, Callie!

789
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,552
You weren't in the woods,
and you did not hear Meredith

790
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,254
crying for Lexie and
Mark moaning in pain

791
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,757
or hearing me scream in pain.

792
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,505
You weren't there, and you
keep acting like you were,

793
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,512
but you weren't, and it
wasn't your experience!

794
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,265
I lost Mark. You
almost died. You...

795
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,467
"I lost Mark. You almost died."

796
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,636
You weren't on
the freaking plane!

797
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,771
You want it? The street cred?

798
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,940
The badge of honor?
The warrior wounds?

799
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,143
Then great. Stick out your leg,
and I will go grab a bone saw,

800
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,695
and let's even the score!

801
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,466
It always comes back to the leg.

802
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,107
I trusted you,
more than anything,

803
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:32,244
more than anyone in my life.

804
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,747
And you decided to cut it off.

805
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,149
To save your life!

806
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:38,084
You didn't lose anything!

807
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:39,419
I did!

808
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,037
I did.

809
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,408
<i>There's an end to every storm.</i>

810
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,415
Apparently, I lost you.

811
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,269
<i>Once all the trees
have been uprooted.</i>

812
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,755
<i>Once all the houses
have been ripped apart.</i>

813
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,811
What do you think about Bailey?

814
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,909
Bailey? You like it?

815
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,560
I love it.

816
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,745
What do you think?

817
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,268
<i>The wind will hush.</i>

818
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,321
<i>The clouds will part.</i>

819
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,690
<i>The rain...</i>

820
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,904
Yeah, that's
your little brother.

821
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,578
<i>Will stop.</i>

822
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,618
Hey. I heard what you did.

823
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,887
I couldn't be more impressed.

824
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,207
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you all right?

825
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,926
I need to talk to Richard.

826
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,778
Look, he came to me.

827
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:41,313
He tried to help me,

828
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:43,015
and I called him a drunk.

829
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,350
I blamed him.

830
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,403
I turned on him. Of
all people, that man...

831
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,638
Hey, hey, hey. Okay. It's okay.

832
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,741
He knows you,
better than you think.

833
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,042
Maybe you owe him an apology.

834
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,077
No, I owe him everything.

835
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,162
Now do you know where he is?

836
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,465
<i>The sky will
clear in an instant.</i>

837
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,967
<i>And only then...</i>

838
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,723
<i>In those quiet moments
after the storm...</i>

839
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,160
<i>Do we learn...</i>

840
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,363
<i>Who was strong enough</i>

841
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>to survive it.</i>
