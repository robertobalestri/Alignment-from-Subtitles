1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,482
<i>I had this memory
game when I was a kid...</i>

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,673
<i>A bunch of cards
facedown in rows.</i>

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,587
<i>Each card has a picture.</i>

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,744
<i>You turn one over, look at it...</i>

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,553
<i>Then you turn it back over.</i>

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,869
<i>Then you have to try and remember
where its matching card was.</i>

7
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,260
I have to get on a plane.
I have to get on a plane.

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,946
Dr. Grey, Dr. Grey,
you were on a plane.

9
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:33,454
You were in a plane crash.
Can you tell me what you...

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,400
Derek!

11
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,038
Meredith, get up!

12
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,690
<i>Sometimes you have no idea.</i>

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,837
Where... Where's my sister?
My sister... Where is Lexie?

14
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,393
No, no, no, no.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,873
Where... where... where's my
husband and... and... and Cristina?

16
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:47,974
Lay back and
relax. I have to get...

17
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:49,375
All right. I have
to get to my sister

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,543
and my husband. All
right. Hold on. Hold on.

19
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,978
I... my sister. Hey,
you can't go in there.

20
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,269
Don't tell me where I can go.

21
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,316
There's an infection and
I need to see him. Move.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,169
<i>And other times, it shows us
exactly what we need to see.</i>

23
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,553
Doctor, we've got them.
We're taking care of them.

24
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,011
Hey.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,479
That's your mama.

26
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,031
Hey, honey.

27
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,266
Okay, okay.

28
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,696
Okay, okay. You sit here.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,886
Mama's here, baby.

30
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,087
There we go.

31
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,156
Mama's here. No.

32
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:17,893
<i>The cards seem completely
out of order and random,</i>

33
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,978
<i>but you keep turning them over.</i>

34
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,579
<i>And the more cards you see...</i>

35
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,973
<i>You get a sense of how
everything fits together.</i>

36
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,307
Hey.

37
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,214
They're taking us home
tomorrow on a plane.

38
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,850
And I said no planes,
but we don't have a choice,

39
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:44,569
because of Mark
and Arizona, so...

40
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,938
So I told Bailey
to just sedate us...

41
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,274
Sedate all of us.

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,179
And we'll never
know it happened.

43
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,352
Right?

44
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,355
Cristina?

45
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,442
Cristina?

46
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,356
Oh!

47
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,792
I wish they had put me out, too.

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,360
Yeah, I know what you mean.

49
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,061
All I keep thinking is,

50
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,364
we're gonna crash
on some tropical island

51
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,634
and get attacked
by a polar bear.

52
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:35,637
Now... I don't know
what you mean.

53
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,557
You should watch more TV.

54
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,806
I don't even know how
you can think of leaving.

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,345
Because it's Harvard.

56
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,142
Meredith, because you don't
turn down an offer from Harvard.

57
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,001
You have two, maybe three
surgeries left on your hand before...

58
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,496
You know what? Maybe
they have doctors there.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,904
Maybe one can help me.

60
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,549
With Mark in the condition
he's in, and Cristina?

61
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,318
I'm not saying we
leave tomorrow.

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,003
They're just looking for a time
frame. Well, I'm sorry, Derek.

63
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,661
I know you really want to go.
But I can't even think about it.

64
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,923
This is not about
me. This is about you.

65
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,091
You're at the
beginning of your career.

66
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,882
It's you they want.

67
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,883
I don't know. I'm not the
same man that they hired.

68
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,791
Don't say that. 80%, Meredith.

69
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,019
Don't say that!

70
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,968
Shh.

71
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,176
We stay here, we work here,

72
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,295
we move into that beautiful
house that you built us.

73
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,680
That was our plan.

74
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:19,892
That was before you
got a job in Boston.

75
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,383
And that was before
our plane crashed.

76
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,286
Mmm. Blowing off Harvard. Wow.

77
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,305
You're blowing off Hopkins. Wow.

78
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,675
No, I'm postponing
Hopkins till Robbins is better.

79
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,904
Avery did the same
thing for Sloan.

80
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,294
And I stayed.

81
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,483
And you stayed because
you have no place else to go.

82
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,100
Oh. Wake me up in
ten for Chunky Stu.

83
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,997
You just ate. Stuart.

84
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,888
Short-bowel syndrome kid.
I'm doing an intestinal transplant.

85
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,536
He puked on me the first time
we met, so I call him "Chunky Stu."

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,959
Ugh.

87
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,807
Arizona hated it, but
Stuart thinks it's hilarious.

88
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,532
How is Arizona's infection?
Is it getting any better?

89
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,679
Don't know. I haven't seen her.

90
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,543
What do you mean?
You're running her service.

91
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,899
You really think she
wants to talk to me?

92
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,567
I mean, what am I
supposed to say to her?

93
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:04,226
"Hey, remember the time
that I quit and you got pissed

94
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,905
"and took my seat on
a plane that crashed,

95
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,889
"and now you're trading in your
wheelie sneaks for a peg leg?

96
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,203
"Sorry. My bad."

97
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:13,634
How are we doing here?

98
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,544
Hey, Jackson, you're
talking to Sloan, right?

99
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,271
Keeping him updated. Yeah.

100
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,541
Not about work stuff, though.

101
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,952
He doesn't need that
kind of pressure right now.

102
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,209
What is wrong with you two?

103
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:22,744
I just said that...

104
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,991
No, I'm just saying, they're
fine. They're gonna be fine.

105
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,665
Arizona's not gonna lose her
leg, and Sloan is coming back.

106
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,817
They're coming
back. So let's act like it.

107
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,872
They're gonna be fine.

108
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,426
We're all going to be fine.

109
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,017
How long are we
saying that this is okay?

110
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,120
As long as she needs.

111
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,108
I, for one, find it refreshing.

112
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,470
They say, if you don't
have something nice to say...

113
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,654
She never has
anything nice to say.

114
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,932
Come on, Yang. I'm
wide open. Just hit me.

115
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,343
I said no more damn restraints!

116
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,055
Look, she is clearly a danger.

117
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,691
She doesn't even
belong on this floor.

118
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,258
She is violent, uncommunicative,
and I'm worried...

119
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,450
She communicated.
She just hasn't talked yet.

120
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,019
Look, there is nothing
physically wrong with her.

121
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,315
She belongs up in psych.

122
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,899
I am the chief of
surgery and her husband.

123
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,323
Don't tell me where she belongs.

124
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,136
Well, with all due respect,
sir, that is exactly why

125
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,360
you shouldn't be
making this decision.

126
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:35,367
Okay. Okay. It's
time. It's time to get up.

127
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,846
They are gonna take you upstairs

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,337
and they're gonna pump
you full of antipsychotics.

129
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,984
And you're gonna go
slack-jawed and cuckoo's nest

130
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,720
and you'll never be you again.

131
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,444
Cristina, please, I am
begging you. Please.

132
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,546
You have to say something.

133
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,499
Cristina, please.

134
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,102
Do you hear me?

135
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,404
Say something, please.

136
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:26,468
Derek.

137
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,064
Derek, you're
gonna be just fine.

138
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,528
Nurse, could you move
that in here, please?

139
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,792
How salvageable is
that hand do you think?

140
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,478
I'm a surgeon.

141
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,624
What was that? Did you get that?

142
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,348
No. It's all right.

143
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,961
We're gonna take
good care of you.

144
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,881
There was damage to
the second metacarpal,

145
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,183
but the first M.C.P. joint
was completely crushed,

146
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,959
so Boise did an X-fix. I
revised it to an internal fixator.

147
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,571
And then I removed
a lot of scar tissue

148
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,407
so there wouldn't
be contractures.

149
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,580
Smart.

150
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,889
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

151
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,010
Did you see how I, uh...

152
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,152
No, no, your work is great.

153
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,222
Um, Derek, it's the nerve
damage that I'll concern myself with.

154
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,323
Mmm-hmm.

155
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,086
And it looks like
a pretty easy fix.

156
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,222
You know, that'll get you
your prehensile strength back.

157
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,511
That'll get you this back.

158
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,558
Which will get me
back into the OR.

159
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,532
That's the hope.

160
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,402
Well, that's the
point. Isn't it?

161
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,922
Of course. But your
hand was badly damaged.

162
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,692
And I think conservatively, I
can get you back to 80% function.

163
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:36,421
Meredith, I can teach, consult.

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,673
I just may never
do another surgery.

165
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,981
Oh, don't talk like that.

166
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,998
Meredith...

167
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,434
I'm alive.

168
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,269
We survived.

169
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,639
Zola has both her parents.

170
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,825
I know.

171
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,946
That's enough.

172
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,967
Meningioma. Patient
is female, 44 years old.

173
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,014
It's a tricky spot. It's right
up against the sagittal sinus.

174
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,408
Which is why I suggested
Dr. Ramsey see what you might do.

175
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,170
No radiosurgery. I'd cut it out.

176
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,322
Right, but with two
draining veins in the way,

177
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,246
it might be safer to
see how she responds...

178
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,260
This woman's gonna
live for another 40 years.

179
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:23,568
The tumor can recur too easily.

180
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,270
You need to dissect the
two draining veins clear

181
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,172
and approach it
from this direction.

182
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,802
You get it all, she's cured.

183
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,266
Well, that's much
sexier, isn't it?

184
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,638
That's why we keep him around.

185
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:36,142
Thanks, Shepherd. I'd be
happy to have you join me...

186
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,268
Or if you'd like to observe.

187
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,737
I... Probably have a
class to teach. Good luck.

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,093
She's right. You're invaluable.

189
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,862
Mmm.

190
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,831
<i>Great.</i>

191
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,967
Hey, Dr. Shepherd.
This is pretty cool.

192
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,136
Dr. Ramsey's got a meningioma
invading the sagittal sinus.

193
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,432
She was gonna
do it radiosurgically,

194
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,700
but decided to go
after the whole thing.

195
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:02,969
Oh, is that so? Yeah.

196
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,503
She just freed the
first draining vein.

197
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,761
Yeah, I got it, Ross. Thanks.

198
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,747
<i>There's bleeding
on the sinus. Suction.</i>

199
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,949
<i>Cottonoids.</i>

200
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:13,979
<i>Okay, let's put the
head of the table up.</i>

201
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,982
No, no, no, no.
Get the head down.

202
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,756
B.P. is 90 over 50.
Co2 is down to 22.

203
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,369
All right, get the head
down. Move it down.

204
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,121
She's sucking in air.
You have an air embolus.

205
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,322
Boki, bulb irrigate the field.

206
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,641
Make sure no more air
gets in there. Seal it off.

207
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,665
Thank you,
Dr. Shepherd. That was...

208
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,612
All right, you have a hole in the
sinus you need to take care of.

209
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,452
Yes, yes.

210
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,798
You have to carefully reapproximate
the edges of the patch graft.

211
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,389
I'll just seal it with a clip.

212
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,601
No, don't. That could
occlude the sinus.

213
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,720
There. See? Bleeding stopped.

214
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,328
B.P.'s 210 over 130.

215
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,597
Venous infarction.
Ventriculostomy tube now.

216
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,649
She's coding.

217
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,396
It's not your fault. You didn't
force her to try your approach.

218
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,864
If she couldn't pull
it off, well, then...

219
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,332
I could've pulled it
off had I been in there.

220
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,167
Well, you'll be back
in there. No, I won't.

221
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,502
I will be the former
neurosurgeon,

222
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,142
Derek Shepherd,
research librarian.

223
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,206
Shut up. Mark, the
guy gave me 80%.

224
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,470
Well, get back to 100%.

225
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,897
It's not gonna happen.

226
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,151
Don't give me that crap.
You love a hopeless case.

227
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,819
It's true. It's the only
reason we're still friends.

228
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:06,983
I'm glad you're doing better.

229
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,073
Me, too.

230
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,407
You will be, too.

231
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,636
100%, you'll see.

232
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,178
Yeah, coming along.

233
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,424
X-ray shows excellent alignment.

234
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,248
I heard Schachter
moved your surgery up.

235
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,393
Yeah, couple days.

236
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,817
Well, fingers crossed.

237
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,019
Oh, sorry.

238
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,021
That was...

239
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,234
No, it's okay.
It's fine. I get it.

240
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,758
So I had a look at
Schachter's plan.

241
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,544
He's opted for an
end-to-end repair.

242
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,699
What'd you think? It's good.

243
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,812
Oh, it's great. He's
amazing. He's the best, right?

244
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,469
But? But nothing.

245
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,350
It's just that I've...
I've been in there.

246
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,552
I've seen the amount of gap in
the nerve, and I know it's messier,

247
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,026
but I thought a nerve
graft might be better.

248
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:49,280
That's all. I'm sure he's
thought of it already.

249
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,599
He's the best.

250
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,663
Well, that would
be... Be much riskier.

251
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,519
You're right, it is.

252
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,422
But it could mean
a full recovery.

253
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,569
You could use your own A.I.N.
for the graft. I've used it before.

254
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,187
It's practically gift-wrapped
for a median nerve graft.

255
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,823
Yeah, but if the graft doesn't
take, we shorten the nerve more.

256
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,482
I could lose more
function than I have now.

257
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:10,029
You're right. It's stupid. That's
why Schachter's not doing it.

258
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,369
He's smart not to...

259
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,088
Which is why you should.

260
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:15,206
What?

261
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,837
I want you to do the surgery.

262
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,426
No.

263
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:20,861
No.

264
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,311
Okay, graft, please.

265
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,662
Here you go, Doctor.

266
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:45,119
Perfect. This looks...

267
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,322
Perfect.

268
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,091
It's Arizona. There's a problem.

269
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,213
Watch that line. Hold
her. Get some restraints.

270
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,998
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Send... Damn it!

271
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,466
- All right, I got it.
- I've got it.

272
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,956
Two of lorazepam now! Now!

273
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,607
There's the restraints.

274
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,109
Calm down. Easy.

275
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,260
Calm down.

276
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,123
Okay. Okay.

277
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,816
The combination of extreme
exhaustion, dehydration, and exposure

278
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,052
seems to have
put her in a state.

279
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,163
What do you mean?

280
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,699
We think it's
reactive psychosis.

281
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,290
She's unresponsive, and then
when we go to examine her,

282
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,242
she becomes... Violent.

283
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,239
I'm here, okay?

284
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,423
I wouldn't do that.

285
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,447
It's all right.

286
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,911
All right. All right. All right.

287
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,784
Cristina. I'm gonna help you.

288
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,166
Cristina, I am gonna help
you. I'm gonna help you.

289
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,390
I'm here. Cristina,
I'm here. I'm here.

290
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,059
Cristina, I'm here now.

291
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,562
It's okay. I'm gonna help you.

292
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,696
Shh.

293
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,288
We're all going to be fine.

294
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:30,035
How long are we
saying that this is okay?

295
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,793
As long as she needs.

296
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:36,182
I, for one, find it refreshing.

297
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,800
So she doesn't speak at all?

298
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,334
She hasn't yet.

299
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,169
She just stares...

300
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,272
And breathes.

301
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,993
It's kind of weird, but the way
that they talk about her around here,

302
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,062
it's like she's a
legend, you know?

303
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,610
Mmm. And now
she's like an end table.

304
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,180
Shane, that's horrible. Stop it.

305
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,537
Sorry.

306
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,634
I'm gonna take a
leave of absence.

307
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:14,680
I think three years ago, I
said I was gonna figure out

308
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,482
how to make a
great roast chicken.

309
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:19,173
Still haven't done it.

310
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:23,477
I just like how a house smells
when there's a chicken in the oven.

311
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,523
You're gonna feel stronger
in a couple of days or weeks.

312
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,325
It takes as long as it takes.

313
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:41,340
And we have all
the time in the world.

314
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,343
When you're back on your
feet, you'll go back to work

315
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,168
at whatever pace you want.

316
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:50,071
You'll go back into the OR,
and you can do your magic.

317
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,108
You won't have to deal
with patients or families.

318
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,651
I'll take care of all of that.

319
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,053
You ready to get out now?

320
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,556
I can't.

321
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,425
What?

322
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,268
I can't get out.

323
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,371
Are you... You
can. I'll help you.

324
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:31,512
I stayed awake for four days.

325
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,984
I remember...

326
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,188
Every single minute
of those four days.

327
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:48,429
The fire went out. It
was really, really dark.

328
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:51,916
There were so many stars.

329
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,122
I remember getting the
bugs out of Arizona's leg.

330
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,692
I put leaves on it,
trying to keep them out.

331
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,047
And Mark...

332
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:11,853
Mark just kept dying.
It was so annoying.

333
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:16,156
I kept trying to help him, but
he just kept trying to die on me.

334
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,227
I just wanted to lie down...

335
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,397
And sleep on him
because he was warm.

336
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,667
And I wanted to sleep.

337
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,572
Meredith was asleep.

338
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,742
Everyone was asleep.

339
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,279
Arizona got the
last of the water,

340
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:43,016
and I remember
drinking something bad.

341
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,454
It might have been
the fuel from the plane?

342
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,390
I drank...

343
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,725
My pee.

344
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,564
The noises...

345
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,185
The animal noises...

346
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,322
Fighting and growling right...

347
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,426
Next to us, right there.

348
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,095
I kept waiting for them
to come and kill me,

349
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,231
but they didn't.

350
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,568
And then I realized...

351
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,920
They were fighting over Lexie.

352
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:30,263
I tried to keep them
off of her. I tried.

353
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,286
But I couldn't get out.

354
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,488
I can't get out.

355
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,192
You're out now.

356
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,330
I've got you. You hear me?

357
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,968
I can't get out.

358
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,172
Don't you see?

359
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,093
I'll never get out.

360
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,702
You okay? Yep.

361
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,665
You sure you know
what you're doing? Yes.

362
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,190
It's one highway all
the way to Minnesota,

363
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,593
through Montana,
cross one of the Dakotas,

364
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,855
I can't remember which.

365
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,011
No, I meant by leaving.

366
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,613
Are you sure
you're okay with it?

367
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,226
Are you sure it's
the right thing to do?

368
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,094
Meredith, not you,
too. Owen just tried to...

369
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,564
Well, yeah, because I'm worried
that you're just running away.

370
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:28,700
Well, yeah, I am. I'm fleeing,
like Bambi from a forest fire,

371
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,969
and so should you, 'cause
horrible things happen here.

372
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,760
No, something horrible happened,
and we should stick together.

373
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,341
You know what? We
have stuck together.

374
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,198
And we've grown together,
like two gnarled trees

375
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,107
twining around each
other, trying to survive.

376
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,553
Survive what?
Cristina, this is life.

377
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,449
Bad things happen. It's hard.

378
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:46,318
You find your people,
you find your person,

379
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,303
and you lean on them.
God love you, Mer.

380
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,627
You know, so many horrible
things have happened to you,

381
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,164
and maybe you're okay
with it, but you shouldn't be.

382
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,117
Go to Harvard,
anywhere except here,

383
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,352
seeing your dead sister
around every corner.

384
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,721
Hey, your mother died here.

385
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,174
Your husband was shot
here. George died here.

386
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,621
It's my life, and you
were here for it, too.

387
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,623
I mean, now you sound like
the same scary loner bitch

388
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,925
who rode in here on a
motorcycle five years ago.

389
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,794
Like the past five years
has never happened?

390
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,178
Well, you know, a part
of me wishes it hadn't.

391
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,980
Oh, okay. Well, then
you should just go then.

392
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:16,865
And you should
not look back. Go.

393
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,955
Meredith...

394
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,134
No, you know,
Cristina, you're right.

395
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,358
I'm not your person. And
Owen isn't your person.

396
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,714
Your person is you,
and it always has been.

397
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,087
<i>What the hell did they
do to this guy out there?</i>

398
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,877
Hold my hand.

399
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,062
<i>He's bradying down.</i>

400
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,532
Charge. Clear.

401
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,242
Yeah, I got a pulse.

402
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,363
Clear.

403
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,848
I flew to Boise.

404
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,329
I was there, but they
wouldn't let me in.

405
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,593
They said I wasn't family.

406
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,438
It's not fair.

407
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,974
You don't deserve...

408
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,529
You deserve better.

409
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,758
Shh.

410
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,549
Stop it.

411
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,585
I'm here.

412
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,988
I'm not going anywhere, Mark.

413
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,391
I love you.

414
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,999
I love Lexie.

415
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,436
Loved.

416
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,424
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:15,205
Callie? Callie.

418
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,240
Go home.

419
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,894
No, I'm all right.

420
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,629
No, you're not.

421
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,074
You've been up for
the past two nights

422
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,876
bouncing between
Arizona's room and here.

423
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,201
I just need some
coffee. Can you, um...

424
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,714
Can you stay with him
while I run to the cafeteria?

425
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:30,498
I'll stay with him all night.

426
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,495
I just feel like we're
losing him, Derek.

427
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,424
Usually when I talk to
him, I sense that he's there,

428
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:43,417
that he's listening, but
I think he's giving up.

429
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,725
I'm so scared the second
I leave this hospital,

430
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,621
I'm gonna get a phone
call that he's dead.

431
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,650
That's not gonna happen tonight.

432
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,294
Promise? Mmm-hmm.

433
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,483
If he starts going south,
I'll tell him to cut it out.

434
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,083
He idolizes me. Mmm.

435
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,568
He'll do whatever I say.

436
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,155
Thank you.

437
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,334
You heard what I told her.

438
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,122
Don't make me look like an ass.

439
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,291
Pull it together.

440
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,310
A lot of people counting on you.

441
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,958
Damn it. I knew I
shouldn't have gone home.

442
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,815
Is he okay? Did he code?

443
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,217
Just come see.

444
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,613
Oh, God. Where
the hell is Shepherd?

445
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,336
Avery, tell me what's going on.

446
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,172
Torres.

447
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:39,673
Where you been?

448
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,189
Pretty amazing recovery, right?

449
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:46,364
Yeah. His stats are good?

450
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,592
He's being weaned off pressors?

451
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,099
Yeah, B.P. is 110 over 60.

452
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,213
And he's making inappropriate
sexual comments to Brooks.

453
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,320
It's fine.

454
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,256
No, it's not.

455
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,591
But right now I'm really,
really enjoying it, so...

456
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,668
You think it's the surge.

457
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,336
Mmm. It might be.

458
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,815
I don't. I don't think it is.

459
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,506
What's the surge?

460
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,141
In many terminally ill patients,

461
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,910
they have a final
surge of energy.

462
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,045
They get better
before they get worse.

463
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:20,080
But this is not that.

464
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,150
But in a little while, he'll
do what all patients do.

465
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,863
He'll have epiphanies,

466
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,298
he'll tell you what really
matters in life, ask for his family.

467
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,590
The man is telling dirty
jokes. It's not a surge.

468
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,509
No, I don't think so either.

469
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,065
Uh, I have a facial lac. Oh, I
had a consult this morning...

470
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,767
Breast augmentation, "B" to "D."

471
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,871
Did you tell her her breasts
were beautiful the way they are?

472
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,639
No, I still think that's weird.

473
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,536
Well, I know you
do, but you're wrong.

474
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,571
You tell her she's
beautiful just the way she is,

475
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,140
and if she believes you,
you've saved someone

476
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,697
an unnecessary
surgical procedure.

477
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,644
And that is definitely
not how I talk to a patient.

478
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,535
No, but it's how you
talk to a woman, Avery.

479
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,639
We're in the business of making
people feel better about themselves.

480
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:04,074
Again, sometimes when you talk,

481
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,776
I feel like a male prostitute.

482
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,624
She's a person on the
precipice of change, Avery.

483
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,888
She's scared and she's worried.

484
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,418
God, the things we
worry about. So pointless.

485
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:18,667
And we get to help take that
worry away. It's why we're doctors.

486
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,068
It's actually why we're people,

487
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,844
but somehow we forget
that all that matters is people.

488
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:27,280
And whether we walk away
leaving them better or worse

489
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,315
for having met us.

490
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,717
We control that, Avery.

491
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,622
I want you to promise
me something.

492
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:40,094
If you love someone,
you tell 'em.

493
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,930
Even if you're scared
that it's not the right thing,

494
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,465
even if you're scared
that it'll cause problems,

495
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:49,586
even if you're scared that it
will burn your life to the ground,

496
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,139
you say it, and you say it loud.

497
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,108
And then you go from there.

498
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:59,362
Hey, where's my kid?
I want to see Sofia.

499
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,710
Avery, why don't you run up to
day care and bring her down here?

500
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,612
I can't bring a
baby in the I.C.U.

501
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,881
No, but you can sneak one in.

502
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,949
Come on, Avery. Grow a pair.

503
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,218
You know what?
Forget it. I'll do it.

504
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:10,819
Whoa, no, no, no.
All right. I'll get her.

505
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,337
I'll get her. Yes!

506
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:13,860
My man!

507
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,031
Is this what I think it is?

508
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:29,059
There's no way to know.

509
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,952
We'll just take it
as it comes. Okay?

510
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,741
Um, can we talk? I'm leaving.

511
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,543
No. Actually, I've gotta
grab Sofia for Sloan.

512
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,178
He needs to see her.

513
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,713
But I can call you later.

514
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,798
Uh, no, Jackson. I'm leaving...

515
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,668
For home... Moline.
My flight's in a few hours.

516
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,788
What do you...

517
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,341
I... I don't have a
job here anymore.

518
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,129
My contract actually
ended a few days ago,

519
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,095
but I stuck around, waiting
for Sloan to get better,

520
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,015
and he's better, so...

521
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,585
All right, I've gotta get Sofia right
now. Okay? But can you just wait?

522
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:15,188
Just wait for me at Joe's. We
can have a drink. We can talk.

523
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,774
Just... Okay? Just
wait for me at Joe's.

524
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,009
Okay.

525
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,210
All right.

526
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,983
Don't tell Callie. She's
about to operate on Derek.

527
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,518
Okay.

528
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,665
Derek doesn't need to
go in this surgery worried,

529
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,689
so don't say anything to him.

530
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,575
They can reschedule
the surgery, Mark.

531
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,910
I'm sure they'd want to. No.

532
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:40,997
That surgery's gonna get Derek
back into the OR where he belongs.

533
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,206
Nobody's got better hands
than him, except maybe Callie.

534
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,526
Have you looked at her
hands? They're beautiful.

535
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,861
Sofia has her hands.

536
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,949
Callie...

537
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,719
Really doesn't even
know how good she is.

538
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,655
Sometimes you wish people...

539
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,241
Would just see
themselves the way you do.

540
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:13,580
Listen to me.

541
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,116
This the surge talking?

542
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,550
No, this is you.

543
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,754
This is all you.

544
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:25,158
So keep going... 'Cause
I'm not going anywhere.

545
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,296
The extensive bone injury

546
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,933
along with the degree of
soft-tissue infection is troubling.

547
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,546
No matter what we do, it's...

548
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,815
If the infection goes to the
bone, it'll be hard to treat.

549
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,439
And eventually, you're
looking at bone loss.

550
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,543
I'm gonna have to say...

551
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,411
Officially, I'm
recommending amputation.

552
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,433
Show me those.

553
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,586
Show them to me.

554
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,783
I withhold consent.
I withhold consent.

555
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,651
Before you drug me or sedate me,

556
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,355
I give nobody permission
to cut off my leg.

557
00:28:28,424 --> 00:28:32,492
And certainly not some
yahoo in dump truck, Idaho.

558
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:37,163
I want to go home to Callie.

559
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,666
She'll know what to do.

560
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,521
Just take me home.

561
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,887
How's that? Yeah.

562
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,645
Does that feel all
right? Does that hurt?

563
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,713
It doesn't hurt.

564
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:57,217
And anything that doesn't
hurt feels good. Thanks.

565
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,231
Is the infection
better or worse?

566
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:01,599
Don't worry about
that right now, okay?

567
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,134
Just...

568
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,808
Try to feel good.

569
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,627
Hey.

570
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,264
Hey.

571
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,416
Sorry I haven't been around.

572
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,254
I just wanted to let you know that
I gave Chunky Stu, sorry, Stuart,

573
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,389
his intestinal transplant today.

574
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,559
It went great. He's...
He's responding well. Oh.

575
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,106
And I know that you
like to do that thing

576
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,573
where you bring
him his favorite food

577
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,109
in a couple of months
when he can handle solids,

578
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,733
so it's Hawaiian pizza.

579
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,238
I just thought I
should tell you.

580
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:37,206
Thank you.

581
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,147
I feel like crap.

582
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,394
It should've been
me on that plane.

583
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,196
If I could trade places
with you, I would...

584
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,460
I would let you.

585
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,992
I had that thought a lot, too.

586
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,561
And I didn't like
myself for it, but I did.

587
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,098
I kept thinking about
my wife and baby

588
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,566
and how you had
no wife and no baby.

589
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,002
You had no one.

590
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,956
I only went on that plane
because I was pissed at you.

591
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,794
So I kept wondering...

592
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:18,648
I'm only here because he's
so selfish and thoughtless.

593
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:23,386
And no matter how hard
I tried to make him better,

594
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,622
he's still a horrible person.

595
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,190
So now...

596
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,827
I keep wondering...

597
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,997
Why this would happen
to someone like me

598
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,266
instead of someone like you.

599
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:40,170
So I guess I'm still
pretty pissed off.

600
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:48,194
Would you get out
of my room? Please.

601
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,140
Hey. Look who's here.

602
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,009
Hey. We just had lunch.

603
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,762
And now it's back to
the crayon mines for her.

604
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,898
Goodbye, sweetie. Bye.

605
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,845
Bye, baby. I'll see you tonight.

606
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,570
Okay. Crayons. Crayons.

607
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,755
You need to take
her to the park more.

608
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,123
She goes from that
apartment to the day care.

609
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,147
She's indoors all day.

610
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,393
Okay. Yeah.

611
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,350
We should... We
should get a house.

612
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,752
Whoa. Slow down.

613
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,854
Then she could have a
yard and she doesn't...

614
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,908
Have to be inside all the time.

615
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,178
Hey.

616
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:41,264
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. What's wrong?

617
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,018
Do we have a plan yet? Do we?

618
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,098
We are waiting for
the infection to improve,

619
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,655
and then we will know
what options we have.

620
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,284
Well, if the vancomycin
isn't working,

621
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,837
then put me on
colistin. It'll be stronger.

622
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,005
I understand that
it's hard to just...

623
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:55,528
No, you don't.

624
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:58,865
You don't, because you know
what your life is going to be.

625
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,600
You know if you're going to...

626
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,452
Take her to the park.

627
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,554
Or if you're gonna stand
at an OR table again.

628
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,901
You will. Of course you will.

629
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,608
I know. I know
what my options are!

630
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:12,528
And the longer we wait, the more
that my vascularity diminishes,

631
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,809
the more the nerves die, the
more the muscle atrophies,

632
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,933
and then there's
only one option left!

633
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,229
Okay, we are so far
from that happening.

634
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:21,805
Do something, Callie!
You need to do something.

635
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,606
Please. Please
don't give up on me.

636
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,091
Arizona, I'm not.

637
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,927
Promise... promise me...
You won't let them take my leg.

638
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,314
I promise.

639
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,163
I do. I promise,
okay? I promise you.

640
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,911
It's all right,
sweetheart. It's okay.

641
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,737
This is a good plan.

642
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,627
You're not her doctor.

643
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,041
Oh, I'm not saying I'll do
the surgery. Carlson can do it.

644
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,065
There is a real possibility
she may lose her leg.

645
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,145
You need to help her
prepare for that. No, no! No.

646
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,930
An intramedullary
nailing can save the leg.

647
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,103
Define "save"?

648
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,372
Her leg will never be the same.

649
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:57,624
A prosthetic can give
Arizona a better quality of life

650
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,110
than years of rehab
and chronic pain.

651
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,256
I don't need to tell you this.

652
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,607
No, in fact, it's
pretty condescending.

653
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:05,315
Or the surgery will
make her infection worse

654
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:06,664
and increase her risk of D.V.T.

655
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:07,978
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. It's her leg.

656
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:09,347
I'm risking it. I am doing it.

657
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,449
You are not doing anything.

658
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,050
She is your wife,
not your patient.

659
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,986
She's not, though.
She's not my wife!

660
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,577
I...

661
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,016
I don't know who she is.

662
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,670
Did this happen with Cristina?

663
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,690
It's like you're looking at
her, but there's nothing inside?

664
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,136
I feel like she's
just this shell.

665
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,904
All the Arizona's
been scooped out...

666
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,827
And she's just this shell now,

667
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,136
and I want her back.

668
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,077
And I don't think I'll ever get
her back if we cut off that leg,

669
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,901
so I'm going to save it.

670
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,381
I've made a plan to save it,

671
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,049
and you're gonna get on board.

672
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:46,917
And then we'll work out a
plan to get Cristina back,

673
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,301
but you need to help me now.

674
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,714
I don't think I'm ever
gonna get Cristina back.

675
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:05,959
You gonna use a free flap to
cover the open fracture site?

676
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,512
Yeah.

677
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,631
Where are you thinking
about pulling it from?

678
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,334
There we go.

679
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:21,118
That's from Mark.
He's still doing great.

680
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,687
He said to tell you,
"Good luck tomorrow."

681
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,894
Hey, it's still way
down. Looks good.

682
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,341
And I haven't eaten
since breakfast.

683
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,231
Okay, your surgery's
not till noon tomorrow.

684
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,233
Carlson doesn't
care if you eat now.

685
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,762
Well, I'm just... I'm gonna be
an unbelievably good patient.

686
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,252
Mmm.

687
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,421
Oh.

688
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,990
Oh, okay. I have to go.

689
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,804
'Cause you're an
unbelievably good doctor.

690
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,546
Say more. Come here.

691
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,148
My wife is the doctor
that's going to fix

692
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,761
Derek Shepherd's
million-dollar hand.

693
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:47,917
She's that good.

694
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,819
Okay, stop. You're
freaking me out now.

695
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,854
You...

696
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,090
Are outstanding.

697
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,075
And I love you.

698
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,329
I love you, too.

699
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,839
I brought you a piece
of Chunky Stu's pizza.

700
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,992
He's eating tonight,
thanks to you...

701
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,927
Us.

702
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:20,567
He's out of the woods, so...

703
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,134
I'm out of here.

704
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,520
Uh, I'm going to Hopkins.

705
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,167
I've really been busting my ass

706
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,701
to make sure
everything's run smoothly,

707
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,142
and now I'm done.

708
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,013
So just...

709
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,049
Goodbye.

710
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,394
I'm sorry this happened to you

711
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,597
and I'm sorry that it
made you hate me.

712
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,003
It's Arizona. There's a problem.

713
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,405
What? She's crashing.

714
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,223
Crashing? She's... Temp's 104,

715
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,815
serum lactate is six.
She's in septic shock.

716
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:10,411
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

717
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,646
Do you have her on pressors?

718
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,347
I've got her on pressors,
triple antibiotics.

719
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,988
I've got her on
aggressive I.V. fluids.

720
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,384
Did you give her
supplemental oxygen?

721
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,090
I intubated her. She's crashing.

722
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,426
Do you...

723
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:22,039
Did you start her
on hydrocortisone?

724
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,963
Yeah.

725
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,176
Do you have her on pressors?

726
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,249
Yes, I told you. Yes.

727
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,751
Look, she's still deteriorating.

728
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,370
She's dying.

729
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,590
It's the leg.

730
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,091
It's the leg.

731
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:45,919
Cut it off.

732
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:52,058
Go. Just do a good job,
please. Do your best.

733
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,160
Callie, what do you
need? What can I do?

734
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:04,604
Nothing. I'm fine. I'm...

735
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,342
I'm fine, really.

736
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,829
I know.

737
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,903
Okay.

738
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,122
"In the event that my
heart stops beating

739
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:31,381
"and I stop breathing, I
want to be resuscitated."

740
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:34,951
Well, don't go crazy, but...

741
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,300
If you can get me
back, yeah, get me back.

742
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,290
Initial here.

743
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,911
"In the event that I
am close to death

744
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,631
"and life support would only
postpone that moment of my death,

745
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:56,989
"I, A, want to
receive tube feeding,

746
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,394
"B, I want tube feeding only
as my physician recommends,

747
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:04,730
"and C...

748
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,816
"I do not want tube feeding."

749
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,451
Initial one.

750
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,997
This section specifies a
time of withdrawal of care.

751
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,735
"Life-sustaining care
shall be withdrawn

752
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,238
"if signs of recovery are
not seen after a period of..."

753
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,541
Thirty days.

754
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,947
<i>You've reached Cristina
Yang. Leave a message.</i>

755
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,967
Hey, so I haven't
called because...

756
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,569
Well...

757
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:18,021
Neither have you, so...

758
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,706
You were right...

759
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,610
About all of it.

760
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,511
You were right.

761
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,372
Crash cart!

762
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:56,121
<i>This is a place where
horrible things happen.</i>

763
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,244
<i>You were right to go.</i>

764
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,242
<i>You're probably
escaping disaster.</i>

765
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,582
Clear!

766
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,362
Will you take her, please?

767
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,369
Take her.

768
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,139
<i>Look at me. I
practically grew up here.</i>

769
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,288
Ten blade. Here you go, Doctor.

770
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,716
<i>And you're right.
It's hurt me...</i>

771
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,553
<i>In ways I'll probably
never get over.</i>

772
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:30,459
<i>I have a lot of
memories of people...</i>

773
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,302
<i>People I've lost forever.</i>

774
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,911
<i>But I have a lot of
other memories, too.</i>

775
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,055
<i>This is the place
where I fell in love...</i>

776
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,938
<i>The place where
I found my family.</i>

777
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,259
<i>This is where I
learned to be a doctor...</i>

778
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,965
<i>Where I learned how
to take responsibility</i>

779
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,422
<i>for someone else's life.</i>

780
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,792
<i>And it's the place I met you.</i>

781
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:42,598
<i>So I figure this place has given
me as much as it's taken from me.</i>

782
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,768
<i>I've lived here as much
as I've survived here.</i>

783
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,571
<i>It just depends
on how I look at it.</i>

784
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,543
<i>I'm gonna choose to look at it that
way and remember you that way.</i>

785
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,611
<i>Hope you're good.</i>

786
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,146
<i>Bye.</i>

787
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,727
<i>Hello?</i>

788
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:16,265
You are my person. You
will always be my person.
