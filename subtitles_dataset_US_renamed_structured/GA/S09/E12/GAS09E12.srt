00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:09,269
<i>Patients who
undergo an amputation</i>

2
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,143
<i>often feel sensation
where the missing limb was</i>

3
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,397
<i>as if it's still there.</i>

4
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,042
<i>The syndrome is
called "phantom limb."</i>

5
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,858
Hey, what do we got?

6
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,027
Plane crash. Open
fracture of the left femur.

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,996
Signs of massive infection.

8
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,331
Ow.

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,563
<i>It's as if the body can't accept</i>

10
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:38,364
<i>that a terrible
trauma has occurred.</i>

11
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,783
<i>The mind is trying to make
the body complete again.</i>

12
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,269
<i>Patients who experience
phantom limb...</i>

13
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,105
What? What's wrong?

14
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,339
Nothing.

15
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,625
Is it hurting again?

16
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,811
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Go back to sleep.

17
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,029
Okay.

18
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,348
<i>Report many
different sensations.</i>

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,303
<i>But by far, the most common</i>

20
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,311
<i>is pain.</i>

21
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,395
Uh, an acoustic neuroma?

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,451
Oh, boy.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
A long, difficult surgery

24
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,800
with a stupid-high
post-excision mortality/morbidity?

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,402
That's what you want
to start my hand with?

26
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,037
It's my hand.

27
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,605
And thanks for
making it sound so fun.

28
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,740
You can't try something
with a little margin for error?

29
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,442
I was so supposed to
operate on Jimmy months ago,

30
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,533
but then the plane
crashed. It has to be today.

31
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,913
Well, if you can do this,

32
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,180
I guess my hand can do anything.

33
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,904
Still my hand. Mmm-hmm.

34
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,940
Uh...

35
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,048
Okay, folks. Let's just start.

36
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,892
As many of you know,

37
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,965
Seattle Grace-Mercy West
has suffered a financial setback.

38
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,717
The administration
is working hard

39
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,964
to keep the impact of that
setback as small as possible.

40
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,321
To that end,

41
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,739
we're gonna have to initiate
some cost-cutting measures.

42
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:08,276
The board has hired a
physician advisor to help.

43
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,611
What's a physician advisor?

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Well, she consults on
maximizing efficiency,

45
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:15,383
streamlining processes, assessing
where we can trim our budgets.

46
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,769
Who to fire and
when to fire them?

47
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,255
She's here to
advise and to help.

48
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:23,208
I was hoping to introduce her in
person, but she seems to be late.

49
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,154
Oh, on her first day?

50
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,978
Not very efficient.

51
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,881
You can expect to see her in
the halls, in your labs, in the OR.

52
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,260
So we're gonna
have an accountant

53
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,546
following us around in the ORs?

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,803
She's not an accountant.
She is a trained surgeon.

55
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,505
Frankly, she is
here to try to help us.

56
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,123
Oh, okay.

57
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,641
Thank you for your cooperation.

58
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,479
Hey. Can I get a
minute? It's urgent.

59
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,981
Yeah.

60
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,682
This was urgent?

61
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,851
Yes. It's the stupid
pregnancy hormones.

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,421
It makes me want to have
sex all the time, urgently.

63
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:53,569
I like the stupid hormones.

64
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,153
Oh, no. What?

65
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,044
Oh, I have a consult. What?

66
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,412
I have a consult.

67
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,282
Are you crying?

68
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,234
No.

69
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:07,468
Yes.

70
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,204
I cry every time I get mad.

71
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,417
You're not... You're mad?

72
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,901
Yes, I'm mad,
because I can't have sex

73
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,736
because I have
this stupid consult.

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,488
Dr. Shepherd? Ross?

75
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,397
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I was
hoping to scrub in with you today,

76
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,331
and I'm supposed to
be on Dr. Grey's service.

77
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,945
So I was wondering if maybe
you could talk to your wife for me.

78
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,737
I'm gonna kill him.

79
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,934
No, Ross, he cannot
talk to his wife for you,

80
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,442
because you are with
me, and we have a consult

81
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,439
with a pregnant lady
with abdominal pain.

82
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,614
So go do the workup,
and I will see you there.

83
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,289
I am liking the stupid hormones.

84
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,059
Here you go, Doctor.

85
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,041
Dr. Kepner, um, we're swamped,

86
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,983
and I have a shortness-of-breath
lady who needs a consult,

87
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,779
and you probably
have better things to do,

88
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,043
but I need help, please.
I'm drowning here.

89
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,639
What bed?

90
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,468
One, two, three...
What are you... Stop it.

91
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,975
Edwards, if you're
covering the pit,

92
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,811
it is your job to know
every bed in the pit.

93
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,747
Okay. Put on
your big-girl pants.

94
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,895
You're about to learn
how to run the pit. Let's go.

95
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,982
I apologize for the wait, ma'am.

96
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,534
You're experiencing
shortness of breath?

97
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:20,225
Luckily, no. Forty-five
minutes in an ER bed

98
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,327
before a doctor pulls
out a stethoscope?

99
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,713
I'd likely be experiencing
shortness of life.

100
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,030
I don't understand.

101
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,700
Alana Cahill. I'm a
physician advisor.

102
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,530
Could you point me
towards Chief Hunt?

103
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:33,594
I'm afraid you've made
me late for a meeting.

104
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,690
My bad.

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,843
It's like a knife
is stabbing me.

106
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,505
You're sure it
isn't early labor?

107
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,790
Because if it is, I'm gonna
need to call my sister

108
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,541
and have her bring
me my makeup bag.

109
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,410
I'm determined to look cuter
than the baby in the pictures.

110
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,434
Heidi.

111
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,034
Sorry, honey.

112
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,248
I babble when I'm nervous.
Brie hates it. She's the quiet one.

113
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,017
Usually.

114
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,601
Okay, well, it's
definitely not labor,

115
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,137
because I'm not
seeing any contractions.

116
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,421
And the baby's
heart rate is good.

117
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,107
Did you hear that,
honey? The baby's fine.

118
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,674
Then what is going on?

119
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,126
There's a few possibilities.
The labs should help clarify.

120
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,196
Ross, did you get that
chem-18 I ordered?

121
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,103
Um, I thought I
checked off that box,

122
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,004
but apparently I checked chem-7.

123
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,590
My mistake,
which I'll quickly fix.

124
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,793
In the meantime, I'll leave
you the lab work I didn't forget.

125
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,740
I guess he babbles
when he's nervous, too.

126
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,814
Ah! Okay, okay.

127
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,298
Ah!

128
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,367
Everyone at Namboze

129
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,646
was so worried when we heard

130
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,271
the program might move
to UCLA, myself included.

131
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,306
You make the kids
feel so at home here.

132
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,886
Well, we were never
gonna let that happen.

133
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,039
No, I was away,
but now I'm back.

134
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,474
And as long as Dr. Karev and I are
here, then the program stays here.

135
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,016
Okay, um, Nyah's
pericarditis is quite severe.

136
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,052
The pericardial sac
around her heart is inflamed

137
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,254
and starting to adhere
to the heart itself.

138
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,460
So I'll perform what's
called pericardial stripping.

139
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,757
So I'll remove the sac,

140
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,866
and her heart will start
beating on its own again.

141
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,238
What shall I tell her?

142
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,590
Oh, tell her we're
gonna fix her heart,

143
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,592
and she'll breathe much better.

144
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,004
Nice program.
Shame to see it go.

145
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,806
Thanks. Wait. What?

146
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,174
We're getting a visit
from the efficiency fairy.

147
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,888
You think she's not gonna
make this disappear?

148
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,122
Look, shut up.
We just got it back.

149
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,679
She's trimming fat.

150
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:07,382
You're flying kids across the
world for a pro bono surgery.

151
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,617
That's pretty fatty.

152
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,718
Yeah, they're orphans.

153
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,920
Well, now you're
just making my point.

154
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,808
Oh, my God.

155
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,210
Mac 3 and cricoid pressure.

156
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,295
Is she okay? ET tube.

157
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,075
Yeah, start her on 10 mics of
dopamine, and where are the damn labs?

158
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,532
Here. She's in liver failure.

159
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,529
Talk to me, Bailey.
What's going on?

160
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,215
Yeah, Ross is right. Brie's
liver won't last another week.

161
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,155
I just went to the gift shop.

162
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,407
What happened?

163
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,007
Is this because of the baby?

164
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,793
No, no, no. It appears to be
unrelated to the pregnancy.

165
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,664
Brie's liver stopped
filtering out toxins,

166
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,365
so her body's shutting down.

167
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,445
Without a transplant, her
liver may not last 72 hours.

168
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:00,952
Don't people wait
years for a liver?

169
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,187
Not always. In
emergency cases like this,

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,156
patients get moved
to the top of the list.

171
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,586
So we've notified UNOS, and
as soon as they have a liver...

172
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,921
What about the baby?

173
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,462
The baby is
perfectly fine for now.

174
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,641
So now we just wait, okay?

175
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,665
Okay.

176
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,670
Do not...

177
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,888
Say anything.

178
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,690
I am so... So sorry.

179
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:22,974
Wow!

180
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,575
Is this you not saying anything?

181
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,879
Go away

182
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,816
and do not come
back without a liver.

183
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,834
Um, can I get you a tissue? Go!

184
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,916
Hey, there's my guy. Jimmy.

185
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,540
Hey, Carla. How are you?

186
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,085
Please say you're
not still married.

187
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,259
Ah, afraid so.

188
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,972
Ignore my sister.
No boundaries. Ah.

189
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,191
You think she cares?
Unless she's the wife.

190
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,842
You the wife? Oh,
no. You're in the clear.

191
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,482
Headaches still bad?

192
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,362
He can barely get off
the couch, he's so dizzy.

193
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,031
Meanwhile, I have to wait
on him like he's the boy prince.

194
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,416
Warms your heart, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

195
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,650
Wilson, what are some
of the other symptoms

196
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,974
of an acoustic neuroma?

197
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,059
Hearing loss, increased
intracranial pressure,

198
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,193
tingling in the face...

199
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,739
And being a giant
pain in my ass.

200
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:03,159
I tried to find another surgeon
when your hand healed.

201
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,910
Turns out, no one will go
anywhere near this thing.

202
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,934
Well, we're gonna run
some scans and some labs

203
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,464
and see if the tumor
has progressed.

204
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,166
You mean, it could be worse?

205
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,990
Well, we'll have a clearer
idea once we see the scans.

206
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,759
See if you can switch with Ross.

207
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,594
Oh.

208
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,474
Did I... No, it's
nothing you did wrong.

209
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,876
It's that Ross knows what I
want before I even ask for it.

210
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,060
I won't have time to
teach you on this one.

211
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,203
Shepherd, this is Alana Cahill.

212
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,005
She is our physician advisor.

213
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,417
Derek Shepherd. Neuro.

214
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,036
I saw you're doing
an acoustic neuroma.

215
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,854
Very exciting. First
thing tomorrow.

216
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,261
Patient's here today.

217
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,663
Are pre-op overnight stays
typical in all departments?

218
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,243
That is a question
for Chief Hunt.

219
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,445
If you'll excuse
me, I have to prep.

220
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,469
Hmm. Well, I'll see
you in the OR tomorrow.

221
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:44,834
Typically, you
need to be invited.

222
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,218
If things were
running typically,

223
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,579
I wouldn't be here, now would I?

224
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,532
Okay.

225
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,184
Brian Turner, age 55.

226
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,031
Minor head injury.
Vital signs stable.

227
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,899
Fell off the damn ladder
cleaning the damn gutter.

228
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:02,039
I was gonna say all
that. Fewer damns.

229
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,853
You'll need to know if he
lost consciousness in the field.

230
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,354
Sir, did you lose
consciousness in the field?

231
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,573
I didn't fall in a damn
field. I fell in my damn yard.

232
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,597
Ask the paramedic,
not the patient.

233
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,060
Oh, he was conscious
the whole damn time.

234
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,194
Um, could we just start over?

235
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,585
Uh, no time. Get
him triaged. Go.

236
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,522
Forty-five minutes in an
ER bed before I saw a doctor.

237
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,224
Well, that's not good.

238
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,026
No, it's not.

239
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,277
Alana Cahill?

240
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,345
Uh, Dr. Webber.

241
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,665
Wow.

242
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,879
Alana was a student of mine,
uh, how many years ago now?

243
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,114
Oh, do we really have to say?

244
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,138
She was a great student
and a gifted surgeon.

245
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,858
So what brings you back?
You looking at joining the staff?

246
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,377
She is the physician
advisor that I told you about.

247
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,797
Ah. Um...

248
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,183
Well, we should get a
cup of coffee, catch up.

249
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,434
I'd love to, but
I'm pretty booked.

250
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,148
In fact, we should
get going. Mmm-hmm.

251
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,839
Uh, of course. It was,
uh, great to see you.

252
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,427
Your hero sent me to
trade services with you.

253
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,991
You're welcome. Can't.

254
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,642
I'm waiting for UNOS
to call with a liver.

255
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,244
So go wait in the OR while you
play teacher's pet with Shepherd.

256
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,646
I'm not moving from this spot.

257
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,448
Great cell reception.
See? Five bars.

258
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,383
You know it's not like
ordering a pizza, right?

259
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,455
It could take days.

260
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,568
My patient doesn't have days.

261
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,958
Okay, fine. I'll wait.

262
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,728
And when UNOS calls, I'll
run to Medusa. I promise.

263
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,329
Give me my phone.

264
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,176
If I miss the call,
Grey is gonna kill me.

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,411
If I go back to Shepherd and
I'm not you, he's gonna kill me.

266
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,435
Give me my phone.

267
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,570
Oh, my God.

268
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,039
Give me the phone.

269
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,751
Hello?

270
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,576
The pericardium is free.

271
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,673
You should see an increase
in, uh, cardiac function.

272
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,962
It's weird. Heart's floppy.

273
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,593
Still not the way a
kid's heart should look.

274
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,967
Mmm. Could be endocarditis.

275
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,156
I'll do a biopsy.
Biopsy needle, please.

276
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,538
Unless it's...

277
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,440
Oh, my God. It
couldn't, could it?

278
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,742
Could this be
endomyocardial fibrosis?

279
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,612
I've only read about
it. It's rare, subtropical.

280
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,264
Could this be that? Maybe.

281
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,277
Remember we had that kid
with Pentalogy of Cantrell?

282
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,200
This program...

283
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,550
Is a medical freak
show goldmine.

284
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,500
They can't cut it.

285
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,202
Nobody's cutting it. Robbins,
tell her to stop saying that.

286
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,874
I'm sorry. What?

287
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,355
You all right? Uh.

288
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,259
Okay, um, take that
to path. Stat, please.

289
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,225
Oh, you know what? I'll take
it. Alex, you take my place.

290
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,265
The nurse can take it.

291
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,577
No, I'd rather take it myself.

292
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,850
Oh.

293
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:36,377
Are there pastries and bagels
in every one of your lounges?

294
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,479
No. Well, maybe. I don't know.

295
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,848
Is that the kind of thing
you're gonna be looking at?

296
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,334
I will be looking at
everything, Doctor.

297
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,635
Huh. Um...

298
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,587
Dr. Robbins. This
is Alana Cahill.

299
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,001
Oh.

300
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,169
Uh, are you all right?

301
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,744
Mmm-hmm. I'm
fine. I'm sorry. I...

302
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,312
Could you just give us a minute?

303
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,582
Of course.

304
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,523
That was the
efficiency lady, right?

305
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,959
Yeah, so I probably look
as crazy as a bag of cats.

306
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,228
So it was nice working with you.

307
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,051
It's your phantom limb pain?

308
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,847
Callie said it only
happens at night.

309
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,871
Until now.

310
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,256
I'm going crazy. I...

311
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,758
You're not. You're not crazy.

312
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,344
Phantom limb is
a very real thing.

313
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,946
I just left a surgery

314
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,166
because there was pain in a
part of me that no longer exists.

315
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,934
So I... What are you doing?

316
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,871
We're helping you visualize
a leg that doesn't hurt.

317
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,173
Here we go. Now...

318
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,075
Just look at that.

319
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,221
I... Are you kidding me?

320
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:44,512
We are rerouting your brain,

321
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,180
reminding it of what happened.

322
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,860
There are many
treatments for phantom limb.

323
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,084
There's heat, there's massage,

324
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,603
there's virtual reality therapy.

325
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,338
I knew a guy in the army
who had to stab his prosthetic

326
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,473
with a screwdriver
as hard as he could.

327
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,154
Oh, great. Well,
that's not crazy.

328
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,878
Well, for him, it was the
only thing that worked.

329
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,962
Now...

330
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,214
Is your pain any better?

331
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,556
It is, a little.

332
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,359
You see? You just need to
figure out what works for you.

333
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,107
Callie knows all this.
What does she say?

334
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,124
I haven't told her.

335
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:20,782
She's an orthopedic surgeon.

336
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,885
And I have been her
patient for so long.

337
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,865
And I am just starting
to feel like a wife again,

338
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,573
and she needs me
to. I cannot have this.

339
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,520
I am finally getting
my life back together,

340
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,824
and I will not be screwed over
by something that's not even there!

341
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,484
All right.

342
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,103
We're gonna work together.

343
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,916
We're gonna work together,
and I'm gonna help you,

344
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,573
and we are gonna
figure this out.

345
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,043
Okay?

346
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,799
African babies are a godsend.

347
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,200
You don't have to tell me.

348
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,313
Oh, not Zola. Not the cute ones.

349
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,038
The sick ones.

350
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,367
They're exotically diseased
beautiful little train wrecks.

351
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,358
I just found a case of EMF,

352
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,522
and I get to do an endocardial
stripping of the left ventricle.

353
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,107
Do you know how many
other people have done that?

354
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:10,242
No. Me neither. It's unheard of.

355
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,746
Where are you going? I have
to see a man about a liver.

356
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,468
Dr. Bailey.

357
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,108
Can I please get another intern?

358
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,609
What's wrong with Ross?

359
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,244
A lot.

360
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:24,824
The kid made a tiny mistake.

361
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:26,063
Because he's an idiot.

362
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,743
If I have to work with
him one more second,

363
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,860
I'm probably gonna kill him.

364
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,546
Uh, you think I
didn't want to kill you?

365
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,020
You cut LVAD wires,
and yet there you stand.

366
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,073
So... Be merciful
and suck it up.

367
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,678
Cousin Dora sent him
a stupid giant cookie,

368
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,158
but he can't eat before surgery.

369
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,759
So now I'm starving
and I gotta look at this

370
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,716
giant freakin' cookie
that I can't have!

371
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,685
I keep just telling her
to eat the damn thing.

372
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,114
Oh, so you can make fat jokes?

373
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,599
Then throw it away. Jimmy...

374
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,274
Oh, no. What's that
look? What's wrong?

375
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,583
The tumor's progressed.

376
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,097
But you could
still operate, right?

377
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,464
Yes, we can,

378
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,911
but all those risks we
talked about before...

379
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,184
Like me going deaf...

380
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,247
Or half my face being
melted like it was blowtorched,

381
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,004
or me not surviving at all?

382
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,718
Yeah, the chances of those
things happening are much higher.

383
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,920
So... You should take some time

384
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,457
and think about if you
still want to do the surgery.

385
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,748
I've taken time.

386
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,801
I waited for months
for you to get better.

387
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,332
Doc, I can't just sit here and
wait for this thing to kill me.

388
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,394
I'm dying, she
makes it about her.

389
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,467
Hey.

390
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,302
I'm sorry. I can't
let him see me cry.

391
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,282
I'll never hear the
end of it. No, it's okay.

392
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,839
It's a horrible
thing to say, I know,

393
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,774
but when I heard you
were in a plane crash,

394
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,376
part of me was relieved.

395
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,045
It's an awful thing that
happened to you, and I'm so sorry.

396
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,714
But it gave me more
time with my brother.

397
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,484
These past months have
been the best we've had.

398
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,555
I'm ready.

399
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,623
We both are.

400
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,481
Here's the recheck on the
calcium level you asked for.

401
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,351
Ross is gone, sir. I'm sorry.

402
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,354
He and Dr. Grey
went to go get a liver.

403
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,367
I don't want anybody
in the gallery.

404
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,342
I don't need an audience.

405
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,143
You up for this? Mmm-hmm.

406
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,613
I want you to know,
the thing with the labs,

407
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:39,759
it won't ever happen again.

408
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:42,049
Okay. Just let it go, okay?

409
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,003
Congrats on the baby.

410
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,688
Thank you.

411
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,907
You must be, what,
three months in?

412
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,678
Baby's the size of a lemon.

413
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,181
So... Second trimester, huh?

414
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,952
The fetus is growing feet...

415
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,621
Discharging urine
into the amniotic fluid.

416
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,008
And you must be feeling
better, less nausea.

417
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,546
But the second trimester's
also known to bring with it

418
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,717
swollen gums, heartburn, gas...

419
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,185
Do you want me to start crying?

420
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,354
And on three. One, two, three.

421
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,208
Last BP was 110 over 70, but there
was significant dashboard damage.

422
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,577
Stop. Dr. Edwards, what injuries

423
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,644
are we most concerned
with in this patient?

424
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,101
We always start with the ABCs...

425
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,998
If you'd been listening to the
paramedic, you'd have your answer.

426
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,471
Can you start over?

427
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,984
There was significant
damage to the dashboard...

428
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,569
What's the basic law
of motion, Edwards?

429
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,758
The basic...

430
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,088
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed,

431
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,489
but can change in
form or be absorbed.

432
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:45,791
Uh, which means the
impact to the dashboard

433
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,532
was absorbed by the patient.

434
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,844
So the injuries we're
most concerned with are?

435
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,301
Are knee injury,
possible pelvis, c-spine.

436
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,916
Correct. Matthew here
stabilized the pelvis in the field.

437
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,050
It really wasn't
that big of a...

438
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,501
So now you can start your exam.

439
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,343
Mmm-hmm.

440
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,314
So I'll just... See
myself out then.

441
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,884
Okay.

442
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,360
Okay, Ross. There's the knot.

443
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,262
It's a nice one.

444
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,441
Uh, okay.

445
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,182
Yes, thank you. Scissors.

446
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,234
Careful now.

447
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,668
We're just gonna cut the suture

448
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,587
as close to the knot
as possible without...

449
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,927
Oh, no.

450
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,524
Are you serious?

451
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,176
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

452
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,546
Oh!

453
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,798
You cut the hepatic
artery in the hilum.

454
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,251
You cut the hilum before
I had a chance to say,

455
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,685
"Don't cut the hilum!"

456
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,470
You see what he did?

457
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,779
Don't ever do that.

458
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,307
Clamp.

459
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,910
I don't know. Um, Dr. Robbins.

460
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,962
Hey. Everything,
uh, work out all right?

461
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,553
Yeah, I'm sorry that you had
to see that. It was a personal...

462
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,221
You were having a moment. Yeah.

463
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,522
We all have 'em.

464
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,302
Just sucks when they
happen at work, right?

465
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:07,945
I was, uh, just telling Dr. Cahill
how well Nyah's surgery went.

466
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,447
Yeah.

467
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,760
And that you let me finish
the surgery on my own.

468
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,061
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks again.

469
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,796
That's impressive for a fellow.

470
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Oh, well, he's
more than qualified.

471
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,417
Well, I will be observing
Nyah's second surgery tomorrow.

472
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,809
So will that be
you or Dr. Karev?

473
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:23,210
Oh, no, me, of course.

474
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,646
Yeah. With our
cardio fellow Dr. Yang.

475
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,955
All right. I will see you there.
- Okay.

476
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,184
What's going on?

477
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,387
Nothing. I'm fine.

478
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,484
I'm sorry about this morning.
Are we all set for tomorrow?

479
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,508
Uh... 8:30, OR two.

480
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,076
Great.

481
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,984
Look, if you want to sit it
out, Yang and I can handle it.

482
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,749
Maybe, you know, you
should just take it easy.

483
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,630
It's just that Yang
keeps squawking about

484
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,364
how they're gonna
cut the program,

485
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,333
and I just don't
want anything to...

486
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,956
Yeah. Um, are you finished?

487
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,125
I just want
everything to go well.

488
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,634
Then I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

489
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,010
10-Blade, please.

490
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,697
Did...

491
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,817
Did you see that?

492
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,148
God! Ah!

493
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:38,269
Ah!

494
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,443
Oh.

495
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,078
Ah! Oh.

496
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,319
Morning.

497
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,982
Oh. You all right in there?

498
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,119
Um, yeah. No, I'm
fine. I'm fine. I was just...

499
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,470
I'm about to take a shower.

500
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,872
Oh, want some company?

501
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,540
Um, yeah, of course I do.

502
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,843
It's just, I'm,
um, running late.

503
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,911
So, uh, how about tonight?

504
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,825
Yeah. How about a movie night?

505
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,115
Yeah. You read my mind.

506
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,116
Okay. All right.

507
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,410
Unfortunately there was
a surgical complication

508
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,013
with the donor liver,
and it is no longer viable.

509
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,163
Oh, God.

510
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,799
Okay. So what happens now?

511
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,468
Well, Brie is back
on the transplant list.

512
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:05,005
We'll continue supportive
care so her body's ready

513
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,286
if another liver
becomes available

514
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,759
or if we have to
deliver the baby.

515
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,829
A c-section? Can
she handle that?

516
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,408
Any surgery is risky,

517
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,450
and her condition is causing
her blood to stop clotting.

518
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,986
So we need to continue
with the blood transfusions

519
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,850
and buy her some time until
a liver becomes available.

520
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,541
If a new liver
becomes available.

521
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,310
Yes. HEIDI: Oh, God.

522
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,747
The last thing I said to her
is, "You're gonna be fine."

523
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,282
You have to fix her, please.

524
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,053
Yeah. Here.

525
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,484
You can see that she's
still on the respirator.

526
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:40,057
Her vitals actually...

527
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,661
Uh...

528
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:48,532
I hope you won't mention my
colossal incompetence to your husband.

529
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,013
He... Still thinks
I'm the golden boy.

530
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,604
No, stop that. You
don't get to do that.

531
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,639
You don't get to
feel sorry for yourself

532
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,636
or make little
self-deprecating remarks.

533
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,577
You destroyed a
perfectly good liver today.

534
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,086
When I look at
you, that is all I see.

535
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,409
A perfectly...

536
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,283
good liver. Hold on a sec.

537
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,896
I'm not done. Put
your phone away.

538
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,936
I'm sorry.

539
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,521
Don't be sorry. Be better.

540
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,989
I think it's UNOS.

541
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,278
Hello.

542
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:23,979
Can I help you find something?

543
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,670
No. I'm just observing
surgeries today,

544
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,339
and I'm trying to
maximize my time.

545
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,109
Shepherd's acoustic
neuroma is at 8:00,

546
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,610
and that's gonna be a long one.

547
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,712
Just trying to be
everywhere at once.

548
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:38,742
Actually, Shepherd's
surgery got pushed till later.

549
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,837
Oh, I totally misread that.

550
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,390
That is going to work
so much better for me.

551
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,774
Thank you, Doctor.

552
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,610
Maybe that, uh, gives
us time for coffee.

553
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,479
I'm afraid not.

554
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,425
Just time for me to
see more surgeries.

555
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:58,368
Well, I always did expect
to see you in the OR.

556
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,238
One way or another, right?

557
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,125
Right.

558
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,730
Okay, now breathe.

559
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,669
Try to calm the waves.

560
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,271
Try to slow them down.

561
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,605
What's the point here?

562
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,041
Well, the idea is,

563
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,276
if you can teach your
mind to calm the waves,

564
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,812
you can teach it
to calm the pain.

565
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,848
But I...

566
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,718
I can't do it. I can't do
it. It's... This is dumb.

567
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,269
This is not dumb.
It is biofeedback.

568
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,273
Look, I can't stop the
stupid make-believe waves.

569
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,675
So... What else you got?

570
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,605
Well, I have a minimally
invasive spinal surgery

571
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,174
that can deaden your nerves.

572
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,530
No, no, I have to operate today.

573
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,093
Then I got make-believe waves,

574
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,878
or I got a
make-believe waterfall,

575
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,635
or a make-believe campfire.

576
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,516
Or I could just find a
screwdriver and stab it in your foot.

577
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,223
Just stab me in the head.

578
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,582
CT results on pelvic fracture.

579
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,969
Thoracentesis if
positive effusion.

580
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,855
Um, musculoaponeurotic grafts?

581
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,068
What are you doing?

582
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,336
What am I... What are you doing?

583
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,038
I thought you were
trying to talk dirty.

584
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:13,794
I didn't want you to feel
like the only giant nerd.

585
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:14,961
I was talking out loud?

586
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,497
Yeah.

587
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:18,632
Though I was
weirdly kind of into it.

588
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,916
Mmm.

589
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:24,954
Um, I have 60 million
things to do today,

590
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,074
and I'm sure I'm
gonna forget something.

591
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:28,308
Kepner's running me ragged.

592
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:30,911
And that's not working
for me anymore.

593
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:33,330
Um...

594
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,049
You know, if you're too
busy for this, we can, um...

595
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,350
I am not too busy for this.

596
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,190
Mmm.

597
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:44,057
I am too busy for this.

598
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,725
All right.

599
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,110
Thank you for understanding.

600
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,228
Okay.

601
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,335
Her last AST was 23-42.

602
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,803
INR was 6.

603
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:57,937
Is it viable?

604
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,006
I think it's a match.

605
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,640
She'd be crying if it wasn't.

606
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,226
She cries when she's angry,
which is whenever she sees me.

607
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,496
Look.

608
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,459
She's looking at me and not
crying. It's gotta be a match.

609
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,643
Thank you so much. Thank you.

610
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,285
We have a match.

611
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:12,997
You're gonna fly
to Portland, Oregon.

612
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,821
I will fly to Portland, Oregon,

613
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,323
to retrieve a liver for a woman

614
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:17,835
who I've already
destroyed one liver?

615
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,437
Is that the wisest
use of our resources?

616
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,739
I can't. I can't get on a
plane. You know that.

617
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,763
I know you haven't
been on a plane.

618
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,415
Maybe it's time you try again.

619
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,068
Their procurement team is
going to do all of the work.

620
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,116
You know good and well we
prefer to do the recovery ourselves.

621
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,602
All he has to do is
carry a cooler. Meredith.

622
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:36,176
If he's been to a picnic,
he can handle this.

623
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:37,806
Shane, have you
ever been to a picnic?

624
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,896
I've been to a picnic.

625
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,358
Oh, look at that.
He's been to a picnic.

626
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:41,810
These women deserve
more experience

627
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,234
than a fool who's eaten
a potato salad in a park.

628
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,881
She's right. Maybe I'm
not the best person...

629
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,016
You're an intern. Of course
you're gonna make mistakes.

630
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,041
Bad things happen, but
you have to move past it.

631
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,620
Leave it behind you,
the sooner the better,

632
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,555
or it'll eat away at you and
stop you from moving forward.

633
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,280
So just get over yourself.

634
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,428
Move past it, and get
your butt on that plane.

635
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,086
So... Now I'm confused.

636
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,371
Who's going to Portland?

637
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,591
I can't.

638
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,188
You and I are going to Portland.

639
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,866
Mmm. Okay.

640
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,851
So, Wilson, what do you see?

641
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:21,371
Cerebellum and
occipital brain tissue.

642
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,373
Mmm-hmm. Healthy,
perfect tissue...

643
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,808
Tissue that needs to be wet.

644
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,205
So every 10 minutes when
you hear that timer ding,

645
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,013
you need to drench the tissue.

646
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,280
Okay.

647
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,843
Okay, good. Now when
I get close to the tumor,

648
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,728
what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna ask you to...

649
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,052
Drench the tissue. Got it.

650
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,572
No. I'm going to stimulate
the facial nerve with a probe.

651
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:42,609
And then I'm gonna ask you to
tell me when Jimmy's face twitches.

652
00:27:42,678 --> 00:27:46,630
As long as we see a twitch,
his facial function is still intact.

653
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,933
Okay. Drench the tissue.

654
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,727
Well, let's go. What
are we waiting for?

655
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,679
I got word to hold a minute.

656
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,175
Okay, you're
right. I can do this.

657
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,404
Get off.

658
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,882
All right. Well, call me when
you get eyes on the liver.

659
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,022
Yeah.

660
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,317
It looks good so far, Bailey.

661
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,520
Now remember, once we get it
out, we're only 50 minutes out.

662
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,171
So you can start prepping her.

663
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,836
Dr. Ross. I, no.

664
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,128
I can't make the cut this time.

665
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,574
Let's stop while we're ahead.

666
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,181
No, I don't want
you to make the cut.

667
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,761
I want you to get the basin so
I can put the liver in the basin.

668
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:30,984
Can you do that?

669
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,469
Yes. That I can do.

670
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,013
Uh, Dr. Grey...

671
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,816
Is that a mass?

672
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,147
No. It isn't?

673
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,788
No, I mean, it is.

674
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,423
We have to have that biopsied.

675
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:01,597
And how much does
the Africa program cost?

676
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,907
Less than you'd think.

677
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,579
Admin costs comes
out of an endowment,

678
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,587
and all the surgical
time is donated.

679
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:08,805
But endowments
don't tend to grow

680
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,924
with the popularity
of these programs,

681
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,393
where, very soon,
you have every sick kid

682
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:15,161
in Africa banging
down your door.

683
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,982
<i>What happened?</i>

684
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,290
<i>You need me to step in?</i>

685
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,520
No. No.

686
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,891
Robbins?

687
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,393
Try to picture the waves.

688
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,627
I'm trying.

689
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,697
Okay, really, what is happening?

690
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,015
Just calm the waves.

691
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,617
These are tsunami-force
waves, Owen.

692
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,147
What is wrong with this woman?

693
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,937
I mean, is she
having a panic attack?

694
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,372
Should she even be in the OR?

695
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,735
Don't you have another
operation you need to go see?

696
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,937
I mean, Shepherd's doing...

697
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,222
Yeah, an acoustic
neuroma, but that's later.

698
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,929
No, it's now. He
started hours ago.

699
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,209
<i>Look, you should
go. I'll take over.</i>

700
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,693
<i>All right. No one is moving.</i>

701
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,812
I'm stripping the endocardium
from the papillary muscle.

702
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,864
I screw this up, I'll have
to replace the mitral valve,

703
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,488
so don't move.

704
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,590
I can switch
out... Just shut up.

705
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,858
I'm at the beach.

706
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,250
Something's wrong.

707
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,263
They should be back by now.
Something's wrong, isn't it?

708
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,287
Uh, um...

709
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:17,457
There was a mass on the liver.

710
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,125
We're waiting
for pathology to...

711
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,839
Oh, God. A mass
means cancer. It's cancer.

712
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:22,173
You got two donor
livers in two days.

713
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,475
There's no chance
we're getting another one.

714
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:24,809
If this one has cancer, then...

715
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,032
Okay, okay, Heidi, just...

716
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,186
It's not bad news yet.
Okay? So just come on.

717
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,637
Take deep breaths.

718
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,767
Okay?

719
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:33,906
Oh.

720
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,192
Grey.

721
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,478
Okay. Yeah.

722
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,146
I'll see you in 50 minutes.

723
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:41,748
Liver's fine.

724
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,911
Oh, thank God.

725
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,212
Okay. Thank you.

726
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,302
All right.

727
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:47,865
Okay, now we have
to remove the tumor

728
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,022
from the nerve
sheath. Stimulator.

729
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:53,043
Uh, I don't see any nerve
fibers. It encased the entire nerve?

730
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,695
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Okay, facial function.

731
00:31:58,701 --> 00:31:59,766
Still twitching.

732
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,168
Syringe.

733
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:04,549
I was worried I missed the
whole thing. Where are we at?

734
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:05,800
Where we're at is,
I'm trying to focus.

735
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,086
I mean, how long has
the patient been open?

736
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,288
Counting the minutes I'm
wasting answering your questions?

737
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,490
I'd have fewer questions,
but your intern told me

738
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,225
that the surgery had
been moved to 3:00.

739
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:15,449
Clearly, it wasn't.

740
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,262
So forgive me if I'm
trying to play catch up.

741
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,902
Intern mistake. I apologize.

742
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,316
Dr. Wilson was under orders
not to allow any visitors...

743
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,950
I'm not a visitor, Dr. Shepherd.

744
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,941
Anyone who is not
surgically necessary

745
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,576
is not welcome in my OR.

746
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:36,247
All right, cottonoid,
Boki, please.

747
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,238
I have to switch, Alex.

748
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,007
No one is switching.

749
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,442
You're holding the mitral
valve, so don't move.

750
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,043
What's wrong? Are you sick?

751
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,517
Alex, take that scalpel...

752
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:51,729
What? What are you doing?

753
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:52,830
And stab me in the foot.

754
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,064
What? What?

755
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,933
My prosthetic. Stab me.
What is wrong with you?

756
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:58,085
<i>Dr. Karev, I am
the chief of surgery.</i>

757
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,275
This is an order.

758
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,628
Stab Dr. Robbins
in the foot right now.

759
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,112
What?

760
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,298
<i>Alex.</i>

761
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,494
Of course.

762
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,653
Arizona? Alex!

763
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,843
That's better.

764
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,427
Suction.

765
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,917
What happened? Did I...

766
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,425
You didn't do anything.
It's a bleeder. Cautery.

767
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,707
Cottonoid.

768
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,975
Okay.

769
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,284
Got it. How's the
facial function?

770
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:57,684
I'm sorry. I don't see a twitch.

771
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,644
Come on, Jimmy. Twitch.

772
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,395
Damn it.

773
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,231
What does that mean?

774
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,718
It means we may have cost Jimmy

775
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,067
the ability to
move half his face.

776
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,227
We won't know until he wakes up.

777
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,933
Oh, perfect timing, Grey.

778
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,045
Oh, no. Did I step on your foot?

779
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,824
No. I'm not mad this time.

780
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,815
Oh. So you cry when
you're happy, too?

781
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,037
Apparently.

782
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,457
Eyes on the liver.
Learn something.

783
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,982
Edwards, status report.

784
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,617
Uh, uh...

785
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,086
Your MVC is in bed
one waiting on an angio.

786
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:10,640
I paged an ortho consult for
bed 2, and drunk guy in bed 3.

787
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,537
And what's in bed 4? New
patient. Patellar dislocation.

788
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,977
And bed 13?

789
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,812
There is no bed 13.

790
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,548
Good job, Edwards. You passed.

791
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,233
And your waiting room
is clear. Nicely done.

792
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,835
Ah, sorry to interrupt.

793
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,720
Do you need something?

794
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,789
Kinda.

795
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,220
I've been watching you for two
days. You don't seem to slow down.

796
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:32,084
I thought you might need a
break. Maybe grab a cup of coffee?

797
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,726
Probably shouldn't
have started with

798
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,850
the whole "watching
you" thing, huh?

799
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,636
Now you think I'm some
sort of creeper. I'm not.

800
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,350
Unless you're inclined to
have coffee with creepers,

801
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,774
in which case, I totally
creep, like, all the time.

802
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,708
<i>Her heart is, uh,
pumping like a champ.</i>

803
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,332
Thank you, both of you.

804
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,602
What else do you
have over there?

805
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,170
I'm sorry?

806
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,156
Uh... Sick...

807
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,991
Orphan... Children?

808
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,226
Kids with heart problems?

809
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,744
Ah.

810
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:07,830
She means, she's glad the
program is up and running again.

811
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,098
Both of us are.

812
00:36:10,052 --> 00:36:11,634
Yes.

813
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,388
Look at me. I'm a mess.

814
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:17,323
I ate a stupid big cookie.

815
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:21,711
That's what you get when you
keep me worried sick for 22 hours.

816
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,899
Hey, Jimmy, can you
wince like that again?

817
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,399
Answer the man.

818
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,053
Facial expression
looks symmetrical.

819
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,105
Mmm-hmm. Did he...

820
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:34,335
Can you hear me?

821
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,209
Who could ignore that voice?

822
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,105
All right, welcome.
Welcome, everyone.

823
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,608
Thank you so much for coming.

824
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,397
It has been a privilege
to watch you work,

825
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,928
and I am so impressed
with what I've seen.

826
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:58,682
Dr. Karev's pediatric
African exchange program...

827
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,199
You cannot cut that program.

828
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,931
I'm sorry, but these children,

829
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,522
these... Little orphans...

830
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,342
We are the only hope they have.

831
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:11,538
Many of them have rare disorders

832
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,181
that most western doctors
rarely have the opportunity to treat.

833
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:18,089
And if you stop the program, I
will never get that chance again.

834
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,925
They.

835
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:31,364
They will never get that
chance, the precious children.

836
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,667
I have no intention
of cutting it.

837
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:34,834
Super.

838
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:37,954
It's a no-brainer
from a PR standpoint.

839
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,340
That kind of positive
visibility is gold.

840
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,361
However, there will
have to be some cuts.

841
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,131
And I'm going to suggest one

842
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,733
that is going to seem
surprising at first,

843
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,769
but that addresses
fiduciary concerns

844
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,888
with nominal impact
on the core facility

845
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:56,990
and the human and
physical resources.

846
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,218
Oh. I'm sorry. What?

847
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,259
Uh, yeah. I'm out.

848
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,530
I am proposing that
we close your ER.

849
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,833
What?

850
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:09,352
We're a level one trauma center.

851
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,587
We're a hospital.

852
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,505
In the last three days,

853
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:15,086
your ER went from being in
shambles to peak efficiency.

854
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,571
Well, then why would
you propose cutting it?

855
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:19,796
This allowed me to
see that in either case,

856
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,342
it's not bringing in the money.

857
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,232
It's bringing in the patients.

858
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:27,003
Over half of whom are
non-emergent, underinsured,

859
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,839
and belong in a primary
care physician's office.

860
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,142
You have surgical interns
in there doing chest exams.

861
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:36,011
It's hemorrhaging resources.

862
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,442
Look, I know these cuts
are going to be painful.

863
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:39,911
But understand that I am trying

864
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,378
to keep your
hospital doors open.

865
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,688
This is ridiculous.
You can't close the ER.

866
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,007
You went to med school.
You have to ask yourself...

867
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,876
Do you have a better idea?

868
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:51,978
Because the way I see it,

869
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:55,714
this woman is trying to keep
the hospital from closing,

870
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:58,584
in which case
there'd be no patients,

871
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,553
we'd have no jobs,

872
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,122
and some of us don't have
a few million to fall back on.

873
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,774
So unless you
have a better idea,

874
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,403
why don't you just sit there and
listen to what she has to say?

875
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,767
All right.

876
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:17,319
So... The other proposals

877
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,673
include a review of
ICU, step-down closures

878
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,442
with a reorganization
of post-op care...

879
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,336
Alana.

880
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,955
Wow. You've been
here three days.

881
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,423
I've been here for years.

882
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:39,270
Maybe you judged
us a little harshly.

883
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,821
Maybe we can work together...

884
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,813
Being a harsh judge is a
necessary part of my job, sir.

885
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,362
I can see you're
disappointed in me,

886
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,452
but it was your job to judge
me when you were my teacher.

887
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,214
You're not anymore. No,
that's not the case. I'm...

888
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,606
You said something to
us during my intern year

889
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:55,708
that I have never forgotten.

890
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:59,512
You said, "Medicine
is constantly changing.

891
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,399
"You need to be part of
that change or get out."

892
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,868
I'll be making some changes.

893
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,257
You should be proud of me.

894
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,540
By the way,

895
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,142
you logged fewer OR hours

896
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,095
than any other general
surgeon on staff last month.

897
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,766
Good night.

898
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,448
<i>The body can be stubborn</i>

899
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:26,116
<i>when it comes to
accepting change.</i>

900
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,623
Ugh. This...

901
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,910
This is so stupid.

902
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:33,396
We're a level 1 trauma
center. This woman's an idiot.

903
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,764
Well, and a little bitchy.

904
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,917
This was supposed
to be a good day.

905
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:40,152
Shepherd did a 23-hour surgery.

906
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,171
We're supposed to be
popping champagne.

907
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,479
Let's try and go to sleep.

908
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,509
I don't think I
can. I'm so pissed.

909
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,222
<i>The mind holds out hope</i>

910
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,166
<i>that the body can
be whole again.</i>

911
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,493
Do you want to go
to the beach with me?

912
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,285
What?

913
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,520
<i>And the mind will
always fight for hope,</i>

914
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,673
<i>tooth and nail...</i>

915
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:03,142
Bailey had no business
calling you out like that.

916
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,661
She's nervous.

917
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,028
Everybody's nervous.

918
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,965
Everybody should be nervous.

919
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,268
It's not our fault.

920
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,370
Is it?

921
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,506
It feels like it is.

922
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,976
Hey, congratulations.

923
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,228
For what?

924
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:23,407
Your acoustic neuroma.

925
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:24,431
Mmm.

926
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:27,633
You got your hand
back. You're you again.

927
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,235
We can be happy about that.

928
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,032
<i>Until it finds a way</i>

929
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,801
<i>of understanding
this new reality...</i>

930
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,607
I flew on a plane today.

931
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,110
You did?

932
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:38,711
I did.

933
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:41,998
Congratulations.

934
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,204
<i>And accepts that what is gone</i>

935
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,279
<i>is gone forever.</i>

936
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,791
This really kind of works.
