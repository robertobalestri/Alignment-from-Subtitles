1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:09,324
<i>Let's say you're
standing in an OR,</i>

2
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:10,792
<i>staring at an aneurysm</i>

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,863
<i>that's embedded deep
into a patient's frontal lobe.</i>

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,999
<i>There are three things
you'll need to remove it.</i>

5
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,986
Mmm. Zola's up.

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,788
No, she's still
asleep. We're good.

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,256
No, no. She's up.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,558
Did you hear something? No.

9
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,794
But you know she's up? Yes.

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,582
<i>You'll need confidence...</i>

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,483
<i>You'll need an 11-blade...</i>

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,288
<i>And some really good instincts.</i>

13
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:41,573
Come here, you.

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,274
No, no.

15
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,045
Okay, so then we coax those
initial cartilage cells to multiply...

16
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,164
Don't look at your cards.

17
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:54,336
So... Then we coax those
initial cartilage cells to multiply.

18
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:58,707
After two months, the,
uh, original 200,000 have...

19
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,322
Now I've lost my place.

20
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:03,346
Relax.

21
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,496
No, I can't relax, okay?

22
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,843
I have to do this speech at the TED
Conference in less than 48 hours.

23
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,960
The TED Conference.

24
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,162
Um, do that thing
where you picture

25
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,297
everyone in the audience naked.

26
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,514
That helps.

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,999
I'm just... I'm gonna
start from the top, okay?

28
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,890
Articular cartilage.

29
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,753
Articular cartilage regeneration

30
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,577
offers new hope for patients...

31
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,559
What are you doing?

32
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,532
I'm, um, helping.

33
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,419
Mmm.

34
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,011
Good morning.

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,123
Oh, I'd say so.

36
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,332
Gas tanker slammed into an SUV
on the I-5. Caused a huge pileup.

37
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,289
No telling how many traumas
are coming in. We should...

38
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,379
Get going.

39
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,306
I have it right here. - Okay...

40
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,141
Hey. Did a giant
tanker really flip over?

41
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,331
Where's Wilson?

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,644
With Grey. You've got me today.

43
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:59,145
So how big was the accident?

44
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,070
Do you think anyone
got impaled? I...

45
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,396
Wilson!

46
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,890
Stop sucking face
and check your pager.

47
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,307
I can't believe I
didn't hear my pager.

48
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,198
Yeah. It's hard to hear when
you have a tongue in your ear.

49
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,267
Dr. Wilson, right?

50
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,034
Um, you saw us the other night.

51
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:18,170
I'm Casey Hedges.
That's my son Parker.

52
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,705
Right. Is he still sick?

53
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,808
Well, his fever was down
when I left for my shift.

54
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,175
I'm a waitress.

55
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,922
But then my neighbor called.
She said it spiked again,

56
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,196
and then when I got
home, he had this rash.

57
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,210
You've been giving him
the meds, lots of fluids?

58
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,934
Yeah, but his fever's
still above 103,

59
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,836
and it's been like that
for over a week now.

60
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,655
And I mean, I know that
you told me it's a virus...

61
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,073
Probably adenovirus.

62
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:40,620
The fever can last at
least five days with it.

63
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,927
It's not that unusual.

64
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,413
I've been tracking the
spikes in his fever, and I...

65
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,582
I looked up his symptoms online

66
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,734
and wrote down a bunch of stuff.

67
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,470
Roseola, shingles, lupus.

68
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,472
I just...

69
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,908
I can't explain it,
but I know my kid.

70
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,795
This is not a
virus. I just feel it.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,582
Come on.

72
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,151
Okay. I'll go get your chart.

73
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,288
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call recovery.</i>

74
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,724
Shepherd, what are you doing?

75
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,803
I got your page. A tanker blew?

76
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,926
A tanker didn't blow.

77
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,105
I meant, what are
you doing with Ross?

78
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,229
Didn't you get the memo?

79
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,507
Oh, we're supposed
to read those?

80
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,310
Yeah, I need you to
start using other interns.

81
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,267
I can't have attendings
playing favorites.

82
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,302
These kids need a
well-rounded education.

83
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,481
Ross, are you feeling
poorly rounded?

84
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,604
No, sir. I'm very rounded.

85
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,973
See? He's very rounded.

86
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,719
Hey. I heard about the
accident. A tanker blew?

87
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,309
A tanker didn't blow.

88
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,490
Bailey, I haven't seen you
outside your genome lab for a week.

89
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,425
Oh, speaking of which, when
can I have my genome mapped?

90
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,049
I have an aunt who
died of breast cancer.

91
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,167
It can happen in males.

92
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,502
Uh, no. Yeah, it can.

93
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,704
It's just now I'm thinking
about your breasts.

94
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,117
When did you say
that tanker blew?

95
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,690
The tanker did not blow.

96
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,025
Oh. What...

97
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,026
Don't look so disappointed.

98
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,782
Cam Miller, restrained passenger

99
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,017
in a vehicle
T-boned on its side.

100
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,420
Vital signs stable. GCS is 14.

101
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,837
He's been disoriented.

102
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,206
Whoa!

103
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,386
Yeah, the tanker's been
leaking gas all over the road.

104
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,988
We did a primary
decontamination on scene,

105
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,305
but we had to get
him outta there.

106
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,795
Okay, no open flames,

107
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,781
no smokers, no use of cauteries.

108
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,533
Be safe, people.

109
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,836
Rachel Dawson, 42. Restrained
passenger in a car with front-end damage.

110
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:15,920
Closed head injury.

111
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,156
BP 110 over 70. Pulse 95.

112
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,774
Where's my son? Who has Ethan?

113
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,009
Does my husband have Ethan?

114
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,338
I told her they're
right behind us.

115
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,589
Let's get her evaluated.

116
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:24,824
Give us about five minutes.

117
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,181
Rachel!

118
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,366
Rachel, I'm here.

119
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,646
Paul Dawson, 45.
Restrained driver

120
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,714
with major intrusion into
his area of the vehicle.

121
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,906
Bruises to the chest.
BP 90 over 60. Pulse 120.

122
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,519
Where's... Where's my
son? Where's Ethan?

123
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,293
He's on his way. Don't worry.

124
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,481
Ethan Dawson, 10 years
old. Restrained in the backseat.

125
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,716
No obvious injuries
except for a minor wrist lac.

126
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,213
He was walking
around at the scene.

127
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,853
Ethan, my name is Dr. Hunt.

128
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,516
Are my mom and dad dead?

129
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,073
No, no. They're right inside.

130
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,442
You'll see them
soon. I got you. Okay?

131
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,271
Okay. Okay, let's go.

132
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,643
They said it could
be cat scratch fever

133
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,877
or Stevens-Johnson syndrome...

134
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Who said this?

135
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:03,980
One of those
medical sites online.

136
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,570
It's strep.

137
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,533
Casey, Parker's rapid test came
back positive for strep throat.

138
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,857
I have a prescription
for amoxicillin.

139
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,210
Oh, God. Thank God. I
just knew it wasn't a virus.

140
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,372
As soon as we
get you signed out,

141
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,908
you can take Parker
home. Thank you.

142
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,326
Well, I hope your
son feels better.

143
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,198
<i>Dr. Zimmer to radiology.</i>

144
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,410
<i>Dr. Zimmer to radiology.</i>

145
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,336
Hey, hey.

146
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,515
Hey! Hey.

147
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,638
Where's my sweatshirt?

148
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:24,868
I want to step
outside for a smoke.

149
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,052
Yeah, sure, if you want to die.

150
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,504
Sweetie, I don't need
a lecture from you...

151
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,961
She means you're
covered in gasoline, sweetie.

152
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,779
Now sit your butt back down.

153
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,509
Well, if he checks out,
let's make room, okay?

154
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,183
We need the space.

155
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,185
Mm.

156
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,798
This little guy checks out okay.

157
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,455
Okay. Finish
bandaging his wrist,

158
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,124
and then have
somebody wait with him...

159
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,743
But... I thought you said
I could see my parents.

160
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,476
So, Mr. Dawson, there's a
little fluid around your lungs.

161
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,745
I'm a little concerned, so
we're gonna take you up to CT.

162
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:54,970
Widened mediastinum.

163
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,654
I'm betting his aorta
is shredded beef.

164
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,289
This is the patient's son.

165
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,891
Oh, sorry.

166
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,093
Uh, we gotta take him up to CT.

167
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:04,796
Dad.

168
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,898
Ethan. Hey, I'm okay.

169
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,249
I'm gonna be fine.

170
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,103
Stay with Mom. Stay
with Mom, all right?

171
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,889
Where is my mom?

172
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,558
Let's go find out, okay?

173
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,473
Nurses station.

174
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:23,181
Now look right there. "RD."

175
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,928
See? That's your mom.

176
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,902
Now it says that they are taking
her up to get some pictures taken.

177
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,005
And Dr. Murphy
here will let you know

178
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,256
when you can see her, okay?

179
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,309
Call social services.

180
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,285
Kepner, how are we doing?

181
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,554
Take a look.

182
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,847
From ambulance arrival,

183
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,850
the entire intake took
22 minutes 11 seconds.

184
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,159
Your new ER works.

185
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,915
Mm-hmm. Just like it's
supposed to. Mm-hmm.

186
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,133
Ohh!

187
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,502
What the hell was that?

188
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,275
The tanker must have blown. Hey.

189
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,028
Hey, listen, it was
just a big explosion.

190
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,198
And it was really far away,
and everybody's fine, okay?

191
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,765
Everybody is safe, all right?

192
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,383
All right.

193
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,185
Fire!

194
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,099
Get him on the ground!

195
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,834
Over here! Put it out! I guess
he went out for that smoke.

196
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,259
Call the burn unit. We're
gonna need a gurney.

197
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,257
Coming through. We
need another large-bore IV.

198
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,359
Right away.

199
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,727
I got your page. Is this...

200
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,428
The human fireball.

201
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,974
Yeah, let's get him to the burn
unit right away. Okay, let's roll.

202
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,343
Clear the way.
Everybody, listen up.

203
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,844
We're gonna be
receiving more patients.

204
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,801
So buckle up. This is
gonna be a long day.

205
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,722
Elyse Cruse, 37 weeks pregnant,

206
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,535
hypotensive in the field,
with abdominal bruising

207
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,020
and second-degree
burns on her right arm.

208
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,188
Page OB. WOMAN: Right away.

209
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,157
I'm Dr. Kepner. Can
you tell me your name?

210
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,147
My name's Elyse. Elyse Cruse.

211
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,860
Okay, Elyse... But I
don't care about me.

212
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,662
Please just do whatever
you can to save my baby.

213
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,987
Just save my little girl.

214
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,305
How about I save you both?

215
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,718
Yeah, that would be great.

216
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:56,841
Okay.

217
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,043
Could you call my
husband? Mm-hmm.

218
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,057
Okay, I don't want you to
worry. It's gonna be okay.

219
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,447
Hey.

220
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,516
Are you okay?

221
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,665
Yeah.

222
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,938
<i>And what about my son?</i>

223
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,557
<i>We'll get an update on
your family soon, Rachel.</i>

224
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,756
What's the word?

225
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,446
Good news is the kid's fine.

226
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,309
It's just a little cut that
Murphy cleaned up.

227
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,466
Mm-hmm.

228
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,245
Bad news is Yang has
the husband in surgery.

229
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,236
Possibly an aortic transection.

230
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,539
Oh.

231
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,908
Speaking of bad news.

232
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,243
Ugh. Right frontal
lobe hemorrhage.

233
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,078
That could be why
she's perseverating.

234
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,464
Oh, cool. Is that an
epidural hemorrhage?

235
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,132
Sorry.

236
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,567
I'm interrupting.

237
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,247
You guys were having
a moment or something.

238
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,581
What do you want, Brooks?

239
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,584
Well, Chief Hunt says I
need to learn brainy things.

240
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,591
So I'm with you guys today.

241
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,411
Abdominal
tenderness to palpation.

242
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:52,791
Damn it. She's having decels.

243
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:53,982
Her BP is dropping.

244
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,260
Okay, Elyse, stay with me. Okay?

245
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,383
Just try to stay with me.

246
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,836
Is my baby okay?

247
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,181
We're gonna roll you on
your side right now, okay?

248
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,499
You can't hear my baby's heart?

249
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:01,684
Try not to worry. Page OB again.

250
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,708
Right now.

251
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,209
Come on. Come on.

252
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,477
Where's OB? What is happening?

253
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,062
Kepner, she's bleeding.

254
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,397
What?

255
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,315
Cord's prolapsed.
We need to secure it.

256
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,482
What is happening?

257
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:17,983
Your baby's umbilical
cord has dropped,

258
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,858
and it's now trapped
against her body,

259
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,170
and that's why
she's in distress.

260
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,655
Ma'am, we need to
keep the cord inside

261
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,290
so your baby doesn't
lose any more oxygen.

262
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,326
To do that, I'm gonna have
to place my hand inside.

263
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,544
I'm really sorry, but it's
gonna hurt a lot, okay?

264
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,446
Did you call my husband?
Where is my husband?

265
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,870
I did. I called him.
Hold my hand.

266
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,071
Okay.

267
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,660
Okay? Okay.

268
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,287
We need to get this baby
out. All right, where's OB?

269
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,423
Tell them to meet us in the OR now!
- Right away.

270
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,096
Elyse, we're going
to surgery right now

271
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,764
to take care of
you and your baby.

272
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,933
Okay?

273
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,485
Matthew?

274
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,186
Matthew?

275
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,299
Oh, hi.

276
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,018
Yeah, Superman
here broke protocol

277
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,769
and ran into the crash to
shield a kid from the blast

278
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,743
with his own body.

279
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,955
Well, it seemed like the
right thing to do at the time.

280
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,195
He could've died.

281
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,642
Yeah, but I didn't. I'm... Ow.

282
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,666
I'm fine.

283
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,975
Just go ahead and go.

284
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,647
You got more important
patients than me.

285
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,422
Go save a life or something.

286
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,057
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll check him out.

287
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,110
Um, okay. I will be
back as soon as I can.

288
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,778
Just don't go crazy

289
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,727
and go into shock or
bleed out or something...

290
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,316
April, I'm fine.

291
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,625
I'll see you soon.

292
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,427
Please don't be surgical.
Please don't be surgical.

293
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,013
Okay, I'm on it.

294
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,966
Oh, it's surgical.

295
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,596
Hey, there you
are. Oh, no. Me first.

296
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,063
Okay, okay. What have
we got? What have we got?

297
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,649
Yeah, a bike messenger
caught in the blast.

298
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,867
My patient's in a lot of pain.

299
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,801
Everybody's patient's
in a lot of pain.

300
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,487
Yeah, these are all
gonna need surgery.

301
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,944
Page Dr. Garrity.

302
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,528
My plane leaves for...

303
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:48,847
For TED in four hours.

304
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,531
You're going to TED? Mm-hmm.

305
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,651
Lucky. My roommate
went last year.

306
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,196
Did tequila shots
with Bill Gates.

307
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,660
It's a fancy people frat party.

308
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,788
Oh, you'll be singing a
different tune next year

309
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,624
when you're there
with your genome stuff.

310
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,587
Ooh, map my genomes.
That sounds like fun.

311
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,545
It's not a spa
treatment. It's science.

312
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:05,980
Just like building
new cartilage.

313
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,044
As I say in my
speech... Okay, Callie.

314
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,435
Callie. The patients.

315
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,702
No, you're right.

316
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,066
I should keep it fresh for
the conference anyway.

317
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,233
Excuse me.

318
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,694
Uh, just looking
for a status report

319
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:25,984
for the patient's kid.

320
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,136
The injury extends
into the aortic arch.

321
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,471
So in order to maintain
head perfusion,

322
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,306
I have to bypass
in two circuits.

323
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,403
I'm just waiting on Russell
for a second opinion.

324
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,938
You had to call
Russell for this?

325
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,011
Not really.

326
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,264
But ever since I
became his boss,

327
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,927
I like to make him
think that he's still mine.

328
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,528
3-0 prolene.

329
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,152
So could I give the
kid a time frame?

330
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,439
Uh, give me an
hour. I'll know better.

331
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,739
Okay.

332
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,450
Dr. Shepherd, where did you get,

333
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,434
"It's a beautiful
day to save lives"?

334
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,469
Is that from a movie?

335
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,155
No, it's not from a movie.

336
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,423
Are you sure?

337
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,575
'Cause sometimes I think
I'm making something up,

338
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,288
and then I'm watching
a detergent commercial,

339
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,056
and I realize, that's
where I got that from.

340
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,194
Brooks, you know how sometimes
people downplay the difficulty of a task

341
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,929
by saying, "It's
not brain surgery"?

342
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:17,953
Sure.

343
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,221
This is brain surgery.

344
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,107
Right.

345
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,958
Sorry.

346
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,638
What are you doing?

347
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,094
He makes me nervous,

348
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,591
and I just want him to like me.

349
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,176
Clearly not the way to do it.

350
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,599
Okay, Ross,

351
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,551
now I have exposed the dura,

352
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,247
so why don't you come
closer and get a better look?

353
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,637
He loves you.

354
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:38,105
I'd been in 20 surgeries

355
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,436
before he ever invited
me to his side of the table.

356
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,820
It could take a while,
but he'll warm up to you.

357
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,330
Oh.

358
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,501
You've got some
fast hands, Brooks.

359
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:58,259
And the baby's out.

360
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:59,739
I noticed you haven't
thanked me yet

361
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,963
for catching your
patient's prolapsed cord.

362
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,331
I was on my way to the ER.

363
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,327
Yeah, taking your
own sweet time.

364
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,379
You want to cool it, man?

365
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:07,880
You're being very
unprofessional.

366
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,016
Okay, let's begin to
explore the abdomen.

367
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,793
Oh, God, Elyse. She's
losing too much blood.

368
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,911
More lap pads. Now!

369
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,420
Burn center is full.

370
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:27,833
I just closed us to new
patients. What else?

371
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,001
Social services came
for the little boy...

372
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,458
Ethan! No!

373
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,176
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Where you going?

374
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,628
I want to see my parents.

375
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,980
Sorry. He's a runner.
Honey, we need to go.

376
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,960
No, I don't want
to. You need sleep.

377
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,283
No, I'm not going anywhere!

378
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,781
Yes, you are. You're
coming with me. Now come.

379
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:43,498
No. Look, he's worried
about his parents.

380
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,189
How about we set
you up in a room,

381
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,674
and you can stay with him there?

382
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,220
That's not a permanent solution.

383
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,577
I know, but it's for one night.

384
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,779
And then we can
figure out the rest later.

385
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,280
How does that sound?

386
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,548
Yeah? Sound good?

387
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:55,900
Okay.

388
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,986
Come on. We need to go now.

389
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,208
The baby's dad just arrived.

390
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,525
Myers is bringing him up.

391
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,238
I still don't know what
she sees in that D-bag.

392
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,895
Right? What does
she see in that guy?

393
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,613
He's so handsome

394
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,682
and friendly,

395
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,634
charming, nice.

396
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,605
Vince, this is Dr. Karev.

397
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:20,407
He's been taking
care of your little girl.

398
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:23,010
Look at her. She...
She's perfect.

399
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:25,324
She's doing really well.
And I spoke to Dr. Kepner.

400
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,809
Your wife is still in surgery.
We should have an update soon.

401
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,684
Thank you. Thank you very much.

402
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,352
Your baby's pretty darn cute.

403
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,453
Want to hold her?

404
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,813
Also sensitive.

405
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,349
Did I mention he's sensitive?

406
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,617
We went home, but
then his fever got higher.

407
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,881
It doesn't make sense.

408
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,253
Ma'am, we'll be with
you as soon as we can.

409
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,976
We're extremely backed up.

410
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,757
Yeah, I understand everyone's
very sick, but so is my son.

411
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,375
Casey, what's wrong? What
are you doing back here?

412
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,475
This isn't strep.

413
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,345
Whatever you
prescribed him did nothing.

414
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,809
It takes at least 24 hours
for antibiotics to start working.

415
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,650
Yeah, but then he should be
getting better, and he's getting worse.

416
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,635
This isn't strep.
Please just calm down.

417
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,526
Calm down? Calm
down? My son is sick.

418
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,435
He's sick, and you
gave him medicine,

419
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,763
and it's not working.

420
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,409
And now you just
keep dismissing us,

421
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,011
just like all the
other doctors did

422
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,379
at Seattle Pres
and Urgent Care...

423
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,685
Wait. Hang on.

424
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,038
You've been to both of
those places, too, this week?

425
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,285
Yeah, and I'm not gonna let
you push me around like they did.

426
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,238
You either don't care about
my son or you don't believe me.

427
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,622
Either way, you suck,
and I want someone else.

428
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,164
Find me another doctor!

429
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,166
Keep an eye on Rachel's ICP.

430
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,355
Update me with any changes.

431
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,851
Will do. Anything else?

432
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,338
Yes, Brooks, think fast.

433
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,788
Anything else medically?

434
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,474
A neuro exam every two hours.

435
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,925
Contact me immediately

436
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,822
if there's any sign of
herniation or a new hemorrhage.

437
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,846
You got it?

438
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,980
Yes, sir.

439
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,049
Good.

440
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,616
Dr. Shepherd, I'm open.

441
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,608
That was my phone.

442
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm sorry you have to
stand there for so long,

443
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,082
dealing with my ass.

444
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,418
Ah, it's fine. I'm
a plastic surgeon.

445
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,769
It's not that big a deal to me.

446
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,282
Actually, can we not
talk while you do that?

447
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,073
Sure. I feel for you, dude.

448
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,192
But I have seen way worse.

449
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,339
Okay. I'm gonna come back later.

450
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,411
April...

451
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,980
It's cool. I'm just gonna...

452
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,849
I'm gonna leave now. Yep. Now.

453
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,834
Like that.

454
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,636
That was worse.

455
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,005
He's cranky, he's
not sleeping well,

456
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,551
and then he's got
these really chapped lips,

457
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,374
and then today it
was this weird rash.

458
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,327
And how are you doing?

459
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,896
Are you getting enough sleep?

460
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,399
No, of course not. I
told you, he's up all night.

461
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,401
And it's just you, no husband,

462
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,014
no boyfriend, or partner?

463
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,186
It's just me.

464
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,556
Well, that's a lot
of pressure on you.

465
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,840
Are you a psychiatrist?

466
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,925
Casey,

467
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,443
just listen...

468
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,212
Oh, my God. You are.

469
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,214
You think I'm crazy.

470
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,217
You think I skip work

471
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,602
and I drag my kid to
the ER, because it's fun,

472
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,304
because I enjoy this?

473
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:06,007
My son is sick,
okay? He is sick.

474
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,686
He used to wake me
up every morning at dawn

475
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,410
by jumping on my bed.

476
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:11,318
Now I can barely get him up.

477
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,213
He does this thing
before school...

478
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,726
I let him run out and
get the newspaper...

479
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,534
It's his big-kid
chore. He loves it.

480
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,981
He hasn't done it
in a week and a half.

481
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,771
I show him cartoons,
and he doesn't care.

482
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,707
I try to get him to eat...

483
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,287
I mean, I even gave him
potato chips for breakfast once,

484
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,777
and... Nothing.

485
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,230
I know

486
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,632
that I am not a doctor,
but you have to believe me.

487
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,534
You have to. You have to.

488
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,068
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,338
I believe you.

490
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,368
We're gonna take
care of your son.

491
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,468
Admit him.

492
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,653
I believe you.

493
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,265
Yes, I alerted security.

494
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,144
Of course. I looked all over.

495
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,284
Where's Ethan?

496
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,270
Hang on. I don't know.

497
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,849
I went to the restroom. When
I came back, he was gone.

498
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,006
When? I told you, he's a runner.

499
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,835
When did you lose him?
About a half-hour ago.

500
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,428
Yeah.

501
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,633
No, Shepherd still hates me.

502
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,679
Now he just makes me do tricks.

503
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,915
It takes more than just
good instincts with Shepherd.

504
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,834
You have to be
prepared, diligent...

505
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,635
Says his star pupil.
I'm his circus act.

506
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:31,820
Wait. Mom.

507
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,055
Hang on, buddy. Mom.

508
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,861
What are you doing?

509
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,358
Who are you? What...
What are you doing?

510
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,098
Why don't we go outside, okay?

511
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,267
It's me, Mom. Ethan.

512
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:41,480
It's okay, ma'am. Ethan.

513
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:42,603
It's your son.

514
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,855
No, it's not. Who
is he? Who is that?

515
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,306
Who are you?

516
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,125
Help me! What's happening?

517
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,561
Who is this? What's
happening to me?

518
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,680
Help me! Help me, please!

519
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,105
So you're in the
semifinals, huh?

520
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,441
What position do you play?

521
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,776
Coach stuck me at left defender.

522
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,346
Hey, left defender is crucial.

523
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,548
I guess.

524
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,183
So...

525
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,986
Why doesn't she know who I am?

526
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,524
Ethan, your mom hurt
her head pretty bad.

527
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:23,144
And sometimes that can
make people act really weird,

528
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,856
even with the
people that they love.

529
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,466
So she's gonna remember me?

530
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,817
I think so.

531
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,055
Ethan, I...

532
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,725
I need you to stay
with the social worker.

533
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,254
The lady? Mm-hmm.

534
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,995
Can I stay with you?

535
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,707
No, no. No, I have
to... I have to work.

536
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,676
I have to help your
mom and dad get better,

537
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,578
and they're gonna
get better quicker

538
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,313
if they know that
you're somewhere safe.

539
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,737
So can you help
me out with that?

540
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,791
You done?

541
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,696
And I'm telling you...

542
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,809
The guys bring the
ball down the wings,

543
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,167
left defender can save the game.

544
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,570
She has a new hematoma
in the temporal lobe.

545
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,917
Now why would that cause
her not to recognize her son?

546
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,484
Uh, the hematoma
could be putting pressure

547
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,342
on the white matter tracts,

548
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,155
causing her to experience
symptoms of Capgras syndrome.

549
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,790
Good. And what would
your plan of action be?

550
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,959
Relieve the pressure with
evacuation of the hematoma.

551
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,484
What about watching her coags
and correcting her ICP with mannitol

552
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,486
and aggressive ICP drainage?

553
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,666
That's a good thought, Brooks,

554
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,917
but, in this case, I
think Ross is right.

555
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,053
Uh, find an OR
that's available. Okay.

556
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:29,317
Oh, Brooks.

557
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:34,048
You never miss, do you?

558
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,187
Star pupil.

559
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,806
Circus act.

560
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,976
His CAT scan is
completely normal.

561
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,045
I know this must be
so annoying for you.

562
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,353
I mean, I know I know nothing,

563
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,081
but I did all this research...

564
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,061
No, not at all.
Let's go through it.

565
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,229
Please.

566
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,493
What's first?

567
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,838
Okay, are you sure
that it's not lupus?

568
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,147
He doesn't fit the criteria,

569
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,886
and the rash is quite different.

570
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,609
What else?

571
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,212
What about, uh, enterovirus

572
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,081
or meningitis?

573
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,211
Well, I can see why
you would think that,

574
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,969
but, again, the rash
associated with enterovirus

575
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,077
is commonly distributed
over the hands and the feet.

576
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,219
And we ruled out meningitis

577
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,020
when his spinal
tap came back clear.

578
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,011
Okay. Um...

579
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,546
I read this one article

580
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,032
about something
called Kawasaki disease.

581
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,367
They said it can
cause a heart attack.

582
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:28,719
That's a good one.

583
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,288
It would explain the
fever and the rash.

584
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,991
But there would be
other symptoms...

585
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,203
The strawberry tongue

586
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,445
and peeling skin and red eyes

587
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,780
and no positive strep.

588
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:42,566
Dr. Grey... What
do you think this is?

589
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,169
I think it's strep.

590
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,722
Yeah, but then he
would be getting better.

591
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,268
I'm sorry. I know
that you're a surgeon.

592
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,276
You don't even normally
handle cases like this.

593
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,844
No, it's, uh...

594
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,045
I own the hospital, and I
can do whatever I want.

595
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,401
I want to do some more tests.

596
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,491
You and me, Elyse, we're a team.

597
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,644
Ever since Professor
Sheldon paired

598
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,463
us up in that
stupid poli-sci class.

599
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,651
I don't work without you.

600
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,853
So you can't leave me or us.

601
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,773
We're supposed to be together.

602
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,520
Elyse likes the name
"Rose" for the baby.

603
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,439
What do you think?

604
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,191
I think it's beautiful.

605
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,644
Okay, honey.

606
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,111
Rosie it is.

607
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,249
I'm gonna go down and see her.

608
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,936
I love you.

609
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,179
I'm just gonna
check on her burns.

610
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:08,869
How's she doing?

611
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,389
Not well.

612
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,975
She's acidotic, and
her creatinine's sky-high.

613
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,173
You know, they dated in college.

614
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,546
But then her dad died,

615
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:21,326
so she had to leave
school, and they lost touch

616
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,133
till about three years ago,

617
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,863
when they both randomly decided

618
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,498
to move from
Wisconsin to Seattle

619
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:29,022
and joined the
same bowling league.

620
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,226
How weird is that?

621
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,311
That people join
bowling leagues?

622
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:40,567
The universe kept
pulling them together,

623
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,547
just waiting for
them to see that

624
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,516
they were meant to be together,

625
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,923
and then...

626
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,093
And then a tanker explodes,

627
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,445
and she ends up in the hospital.

628
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,049
Yeah.

629
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,269
Your paramedic is
gonna be fine, by the way.

630
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,476
Mm. Ooh, Bailey.

631
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,593
You have to map me.

632
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,342
I need to know which
parent I take after.

633
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:11,131
My dad eats three salads a
day and has high cholesterol.

634
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,666
My mother, bunions.

635
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:14,262
If Torres gets
mapped, I get mapped.

636
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,470
Hey, my genome
sequencer is not a toy.

637
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,407
It is an expensive and
complex piece of equipment,

638
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,876
to be used for people
with serious conditions.

639
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:24,394
Oh, like this guy?

640
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,103
'Cause you should
really map his genome,

641
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,714
look for the idiot gene.

642
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,115
He managed to snap his elbow

643
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,035
after lighting himself on fire

644
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,820
when he wanted a smoke
while covered in gasoline.

645
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,327
Oh.

646
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,340
Callie, I asked for an ortho
consult, and they sent me to you.

647
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,859
Weren't you supposed
to leave hours ago?

648
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,550
I was, but then... Baked Alaska.

649
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,854
I'm so sorry.

650
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,967
Well, hey, look at it this way.

651
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,774
Now you have time to spice
up your speech for next year.

652
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:56,621
And I still need an ortho

653
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,390
consult in OR 3
when you're done.

654
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,330
Spice... Spice up?

655
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,815
No, I didn't say that.

656
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,245
Uh... You did, though.

657
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,196
No, no. I'm just
saying that these...

658
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,570
These talks are never about

659
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,773
what they're... About.

660
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,875
I heard one about
floating algae pods,

661
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,312
and it ended up reminding me
to live every day to the fullest.

662
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,525
Uh-huh.

663
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,881
It was very inspiring.

664
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,918
Yeah. Yeah, and yours
is just about, you know...

665
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,386
Cartilage, right now.

666
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,000
But no one sells
cartilage like you.

667
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,558
And it is... It's
a great speech.

668
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,095
You know, this invitation

669
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:35,849
was the one uncomplicated good
thing that's happened in a while,

670
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,729
the one thing I was
really looking forward to.

671
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,065
Yeah, and I'm telling
you that it's great.

672
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,555
No. You're telling me it's not.

673
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:45,258
Finally.

674
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:47,577
And it helps.

675
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,947
I feel better about not going.

676
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,832
I'll see you in OR 3.

677
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:57,621
So any idea when the kid's dad

678
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,623
is gonna get transferred
out of the CCU?

679
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,169
He's pretty freaked
out right now.

680
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,026
No, no idea.

681
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,330
He's stable, but his
hemoglobin is still low.

682
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,842
Mm. That aortic repair took

683
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,366
a lot longer than I thought.

684
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,237
Oh, I have to be back on rounds

685
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,938
in 29 minutes.

686
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,840
Oh.

687
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,210
Should I sleep or
should I shower?

688
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,613
I could sleep in the shower.

689
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,616
Oh, but I'm also
starving. Have you eaten?

690
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,926
Shoot.

691
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,673
Sorry, baby.

692
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,626
His pressure dropped out
and he went into cardiac arrest.

693
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,083
Hold CPR.

694
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,221
Pulse is V-tach.
Paddles. Charge to 200.

695
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,834
What happened? I
was doing my exam,

696
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,302
and she started bleeding
from her incisions

697
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,459
and her IV sites,

698
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,721
and then she dropped into V-fib.

699
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,895
We just shocked her once.

700
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,307
I'll take over. Charge to 150.

701
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:57,809
Push another epi. Clear.

702
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,468
No. No, no, no, no, no.

703
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,065
Come on. Give me 200. Clear!

704
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,361
Got him. Got him.

705
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,896
Clear!

706
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,205
Come on, Elyse!

707
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,578
Push 5 of epi. April.

708
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,080
Epi now! April, we lost her.

709
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay?

710
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:46,591
I don't know why this one

711
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:48,515
is hitting me so hard.

712
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:53,353
It's not supposed
to happen this way.

713
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,022
It's...

714
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,656
It's not right.

715
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,496
I can't tell him. I
can't tell him. I...

716
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:07,283
And, uh, I can't make him
feel worse just 'cause I feel bad.

717
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,497
I'll do it.

718
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,320
No, no.

719
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,554
I'll do it. I can do it.

720
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,889
I just...

721
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,058
I need a minute.

722
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,760
Okay.

723
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:25,752
Hey.

724
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,216
Hey.

725
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:58,451
I was coming to give the
mom an update on her baby...

726
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,654
Elyse Cruse.

727
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,307
Yeah, she didn't...
She didn't make it.

728
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,470
We were gonna go
tell the husband now.

729
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,427
No, I was. I was. I will.

730
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,928
I just... I need...

731
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:12,182
Oh.

732
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,801
I just have to pull
myself together.

733
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:17,799
Chest Peckwell's
name's on the file.

734
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,490
You want me to make him do it?

735
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,118
Yes. Yeah.

736
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,649
More ice.

737
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,828
Could it be Munchausen by proxy?

738
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,585
What? That she's
making her own kid sick?

739
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:33,965
No. She just has
a strong feeling

740
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,705
that it's something
more than strep.

741
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,156
Or she's crazy.

742
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:38,491
What's his core temp?

743
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,826
Still 93.

744
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,980
I mean, it's strep, right?

745
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,426
If it walks like a duck
and quacks like a duck...

746
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,000
Mer, the duck's
strep test positive.

747
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,135
What happened?

748
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,604
He had an MI. He coded.

749
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:51,849
Why didn't you wake me?

750
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,823
Why would I? He's my patient.

751
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,503
So what are you doing?

752
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,428
Uh, therapeutic
hypothermia, just 24 hours.

753
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,914
I'm cooling his body so
he'll avoid another attack.

754
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,549
But he just had a surgery.

755
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:04,863
This could increase his
risk of infection and bleeding.

756
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,170
Or it could save his life.

757
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,554
Did Russell agree to this?

758
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,618
You know, I don't
know. I didn't ask him.

759
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,074
'Cause he's my patient.

760
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,359
<i>Dr. Keller, Extension 2249.</i>

761
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,495
<i>Dr. Keller, Extension 2249.</i>

762
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,231
I think he's gonna
tell your teacher.

763
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:22,819
Okay, Ross.

764
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,320
Open up the bone flap.

765
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,723
Yes, sir. You got it.

766
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,545
Good.

767
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,065
Okay. A little bit more.

768
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:37,884
Good.

769
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,019
Thank you, sir.

770
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,121
Brooks, why don't you step up

771
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,790
and help me excise the dura?

772
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:44,941
Really?

773
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,210
Yeah. Switch with Ross.

774
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,013
Okay.

775
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,332
So when I cut, I want you to

776
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,682
coagulate the bleeders
with the bipolar.

777
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:57,904
Exactly.

778
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:00,540
God, you have
fast hands, Brooks.

779
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:02,993
I'm so sorry, Casey.

780
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,996
But I can't find anything
wrong with Parker

781
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,597
other than the strep.

782
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,779
So you're gonna discharge him?

783
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:12,535
I can't find a reason
to keep him here.

784
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,772
It's not surgical, his labs
keep coming back clean.

785
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:21,361
I know I keep saying
this, and I know it's crazy.

786
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,297
I mean, I can hear
myself sounding crazy...

787
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:28,668
But this feeling won't go away,

788
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:33,106
this feeling that there is
something wrong with him.

789
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:35,704
And I know you're telling me
that there's nothing wrong with him

790
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,077
and that I should believe
you because you're a doctor

791
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,079
and I'm just a waitress.

792
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,284
But how do I ignore this?

793
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,381
How do ignore my gut

794
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,117
telling me that there is something
seriously wrong with my son?

795
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:58,381
Hey, you seen super
douche around?

796
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,118
Peckwell?

797
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,835
Jason?

798
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,015
Ah, conference room.

799
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,510
Myers.

800
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,369
Oh, Grey's paging me.
I'll catch you later. Hey.

801
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,920
Vince Cruse's
wife didn't make it.

802
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,006
I figure the news might
come better from you.

803
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,124
I'm sorry. She's not
my patient anymore.

804
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,093
I passed her off to Kepner.

805
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:29,173
Okay, but his wife was your
patient when she first came in.

806
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,097
The guy knows
you. He trusts you.

807
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:34,901
Dude, I'm sorry, but she
is not my responsibility.

808
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:35,969
You're a douche.

809
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,470
No, you're a douche.

810
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,949
You don't have a problem
with how I do my job.

811
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:40,368
You have a problem
with who I'm dating.

812
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,220
You're really not coming
with me to talk to him?

813
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:44,077
What do you think?

814
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:47,313
Guess I'll be doing
your job, again.

815
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,027
<i>Dr. Leon, call the blood bank.</i>

816
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,884
You paged me?

817
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,370
Oh, we're discharging Parker?

818
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,832
Yes, I have it all ready to go,

819
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:57,201
but I just need you to go through
it with me all one more time.

820
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,225
Okay.

821
00:32:58,293 --> 00:32:59,671
Latest white count? 18.

822
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:00,872
Platelet count?

823
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,295
500,000.

824
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,164
High fever.
Unresponsive to meds.

825
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:08,618
It's gotta just be a weird
presentation of strep, right?

826
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,338
Actually, hang on. The
labs were just updated.

827
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,674
Yesterday's rapid test
was a false positive.

828
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,926
The strep culture's negative.

829
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,029
Who are you calling?

830
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,708
No one. I'm
checking my calendar.

831
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,477
What day did his fever start?

832
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,700
Wednesday, I think.

833
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,101
Damn. We're already at Day 10.

834
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,487
What's Day 10? Did
Parker have red eyes?

835
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:29,283
Uh, he was asleep the
last time I checked on him.

836
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,440
Let's go.

837
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,561
Oh. Is everything okay?

838
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,075
We need to check Parker's eyes.

839
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,399
What... What's going
on? You're scaring me.

840
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,019
Page peds, page cardio,
start an IVIG right away.

841
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,231
We're already on Day 10.

842
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,688
What? What is happening?

843
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,568
Casey, if we're right, this
could be Kawasaki disease.

844
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,437
But we need to get this IV
started on Parker right away.

845
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,123
We're still within the window to
prevent permanent heart damage,

846
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:53,625
but we have to do it right now.

847
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,979
Oh, no.

848
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,567
No.

849
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,915
Casey, hey.

850
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,093
Hey.

851
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,305
You okay? Yeah.

852
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,473
Okay.

853
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,459
So this is Parker's echo.

854
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,985
That right there is the
fluid around his heart.

855
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,132
The IVIG will fix that.

856
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,807
He's gonna need another
echo in six months.

857
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:56,442
And... Do you remember this?

858
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,511
Mm.

859
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,198
Parker has Kawasaki disease.

860
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,582
You fought for your son.

861
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,479
You didn't give up.

862
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,303
You saved his life today.

863
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,099
You were right.

864
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:09,123
I was right?

865
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,335
You were right.

866
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,548
Dr. Shepherd, I've run a
full post-op exam on Rachel.

867
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,745
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna monitor her

868
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:22,668
for the next four
hours, but don't worry.

869
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:24,148
I'll still be here early
tomorrow morning

870
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,549
to prep for
Mr. Yoshida's craniotomy.

871
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,318
Yeah, Ross, about
that. Hunt's right.

872
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,320
Everybody needs a shot at neuro,

873
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,362
and you need a chance
to see other specialties,

874
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,343
so Brooks is gonna be on my
service for the rest of the week.

875
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,367
Oh.

876
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,318
Okay.

877
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:41,137
I'll see you when
it's your turn again.

878
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,391
Arizona, I just want to go home.

879
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,027
I just want to curl
up in a ball, do...

880
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,563
Whoa.

881
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,248
What the hell? What is this?

882
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,894
Your TED speech. RICHARD: Sit.

883
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,819
What? How?

884
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,354
How?

885
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,433
I made a call. We set up a
video stream to the conference.

886
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,386
You're going on live.

887
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,675
Oh! I don't have my notes.

888
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,638
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, you do.

889
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,390
Even though I know
you know it by heart.

890
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,725
I mean, I know it by
heart. Just start talking.

891
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,210
Okay, it's almost time. But I...

892
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,382
It's a terrible speech.

893
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:12,035
It's a great speech.

894
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:13,669
I'm not... Ah. Ah.

895
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,205
Oh, no.

896
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:19,459
Okay.

897
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:21,427
Five, four, three...

898
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:23,107
<i>Coming to you live from
Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital</i>

899
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,642
<i>in Seattle, Dr. Calliope Torres.</i>

900
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,143
Just talk. Just be who you are.

901
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,319
Hi.

902
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,422
I'm Dr. Callie Torres.

903
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,258
And...

904
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,572
I've had a pretty bad year.

905
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,325
I was almost killed
in a car wreck.

906
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:56,396
Then I nearly lost
my wife in an accident

907
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,399
that claimed the
life of my best friend

908
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,433
and the father of my child.

909
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:05,055
And some other stuff.

910
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,163
I'm an orthopedic surgeon by
trade and I work with cartilage,

911
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,799
so I've spent a lot
of time thinking about

912
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:20,470
what holds us together
when things fall apart.

913
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,067
I'm so sorry I haven't been
to visit you more today.

914
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,271
Are you okay?

915
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,228
Do you...

916
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:49,615
Do you believe that God plans
for two people to be together?

917
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:53,019
Yeah, I do.

918
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:55,955
My patient died.

919
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,791
Her husband is left
with their new baby.

920
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,577
Oh, I'm so sorry.

921
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,766
It Just... It doesn't...

922
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,848
It doesn't make any sense.

923
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,554
Why would he bring
these two people together,

924
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,458
make them fall in love,
open up to one another,

925
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,693
make them feel like they
were meant to be together,

926
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,262
and then just pull them apart?

927
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,398
April...

928
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,035
I get it.

929
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,941
I know today scared
you, but I'm here.

930
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,393
I'm... I'm fine.

931
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,463
I promise you, I'm
not going anywhere.

932
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,318
And I love you, too.

933
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,977
Come here.

934
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,834
<i>Dr. Albright to OR 1.</i>

935
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,352
<i>Dr. Albright to OR 1.</i>

936
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,588
I talked to Russell.

937
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:05,191
And he agrees with your
course of hypothermia,

938
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,328
although he may only be
agreeing because he's afraid of you.

939
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,628
Like you said...

940
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,041
You're his boss now.

941
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,932
Yeah, what's going on?

942
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,037
This guy has a
little boy, Cristina,

943
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,924
who is scared to death
that both of his parents...

944
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,743
Oh, my God. A little boy?
Why didn't you say that?

945
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:24,972
I would've rethought everything.

946
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,757
I would've actually
tried to save the man.

947
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,847
Cristina...

948
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,326
Do you think that I
would make a decision

949
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,452
that is not in the best
interest of my patient?

950
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:34,521
I just want this kid
to see his dad again.

951
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:35,955
I do, too.

952
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,191
I know.

953
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,778
I know.

954
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,687
It's been a hell of a day.

955
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,682
Yeah, let's get outta here.

956
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,634
Yeah. Um, I gotta wrap
up a few things first.

957
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:49,847
Okay, sure.

958
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,404
Okay.

959
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,018
<i>There are some feelings
that refuse to go away.</i>

960
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,527
<i>They're little distractions
whispering in your ear.</i>

961
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:01,230
Thank you for not
being a douche.

962
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,832
You're welcome.

963
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,001
Where's Wilson?

964
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,346
Probably with assface.

965
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,470
Beer, please.

966
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,683
You got it.

967
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,557
Hey.

968
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:15,394
I know what you're doing.

969
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:18,375
And apparently
you think I'm too nice

970
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,077
to do anything about it,

971
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:21,334
but you're wrong.

972
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:23,603
So you can try to snake
neuro out from under me,

973
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,555
but just so we're clear,

974
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,657
I'm not going down
without a fight.

975
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,461
I'm not...

976
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,794
Save it.

977
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,250
<i>Some things just
get under your skin.</i>

978
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,141
So she's sleeping?

979
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:49,295
She made it through
the day, just like your dad.

980
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,682
They both have a lot of good
doctors taking care of them.

981
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,718
And I can see them tomorrow?

982
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,787
Yeah.

983
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,271
But right now...

984
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:00,184
Right now we need to
get you back to your room

985
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,368
so you can get some sleep.

986
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,292
All right?

987
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,538
Hey, you know,

988
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,206
I played some left
defender myself.

989
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,429
So you played soccer?

990
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:08,631
Mm. I did.

991
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,866
Did you score any goals?

992
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,835
Mnh-mnh.

993
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,905
Look, Mommy. I
made this for you.

994
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,506
Aw.

995
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,624
Buddy.

996
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:23,279
<i>Try as you might...</i>

997
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:25,664
Thank you.

998
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:30,019
<i>You can't ignore your instincts.</i>

999
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,492
Hi, Dr. Bailey.

1000
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,227
What do you need, Grey?

1001
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,697
Genetically, I don't
know anything about Zola.

1002
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,677
And I want to be
able to fight for my kid.

1003
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,351
I want you to map her.

1004
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,330
And if I'm gonna
have to fight for her,

1005
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:52,291
I am gonna need to know if
I'm gonna be around to do it.

1006
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,761
So I want you to map me, too.

1007
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,496
I want to know if I'm
gonna get Alzheimer's.

1008
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,745
<i>It's like they say...</i>

1009
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,852
Hey.

1010
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,022
<i>Always follow your intuition.</i>
