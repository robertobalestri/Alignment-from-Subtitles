1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:11,843
<i>When I was five, my
mom lost me in a park.</i>

2
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,564
<i>I don't remember much,</i>

3
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,778
<i>except that one minute,
I was riding the carousel</i>

4
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,269
<i>and the next, she was gone.</i>

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,981
<i>I don't remember
how I found her.</i>

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>I don't remember how I got home.</i>

7
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,540
Are you okay?

8
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,725
<i>All I remember is
what happened next.</i>

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,982
<i>She told me not to worry.</i>

10
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,922
<i>She told me everything
would be fine.</i>

11
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:03,845
You might have saved
your mother's life.

12
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,881
Don't put that on me. Stop it!

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,183
Don't touch me!

14
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,006
<i>She told me it was time
to play the quiet game,</i>

15
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,393
<i>so I knew I wasn't supposed
to ask any questions...</i>

16
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,856
Would you like to see her? - No.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,963
No. Absolutely not. No.

18
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,323
<i>Or else, I might have told her</i>

19
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,539
<i>I forgot my doll.</i>

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,754
<i>I loved that doll so much.</i>

21
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>It killed me to leave it behind.</i>

22
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,909
<i>Funny, isn't it, the
way memory works,</i>

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,565
<i>the things you
can't quite remember</i>

24
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,333
<i>and the things you
can never forget?</i>

25
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,999
You really should get...

26
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,263
your locks changed.

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,698
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,594
I need to talk to Alex.

29
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,473
Wilson, get out of the bed. I can't
get in the bed with you in there.

30
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,746
You can't kick me out of bed.

31
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,360
It's my house.
No, it's my house.

32
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,532
Then you kick her out.

33
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,661
I'm not wearing any...

34
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,547
I don't care about your
boobs, Wilson. Out.

35
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,672
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,723
Oh.

37
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,163
I guess I'll go make us
some coffee since I'm up.

38
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,098
Coffee would be great.

39
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,794
This is not our thing now, okay?

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,996
You can't just start
showing up at all hours and...

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,188
I mean, this is not what we do.

42
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,223
I told Derek I am
not moving to DC.

43
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,069
The children and
I are staying here.

44
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,538
All right, the miracle is over.

45
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,562
The miracle is not over.

46
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,330
We're not a miracle. Shut up.

47
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,716
You can't break into my
house and wake me up to talk

48
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,384
and then tell me to shut up!

49
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,852
Okay.

50
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,455
So, here's what happened.

51
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:56,808
Last night, I found
out I have a daughter.

52
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,811
Or at least, I think
she's my daughter.

53
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:07,085
All these years, I had no
idea, and now she's here.

54
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,906
She doesn't know who I am,

55
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,408
and I can't talk
about it to anyone.

56
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:17,012
So, I figure I'd wind
up one of two places,

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,683
either here or in a bar, so I...

58
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,698
Anyway, here I am.

59
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,438
You're here early.

60
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,218
Yeah, an MVC came
in last night after you left.

61
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:47,871
The driver had an open-book
pelvis, so I stuck around.

62
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,873
You've been here all
night? MedEvac just called.

63
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,246
Hypotensive patient en
route, possible multi-trauma.

64
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,265
All right, page Yang.

65
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,019
Pierce. Page Pierce and Grey and
ask them to meet me at the helipad.

66
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,167
Can you finish up here?

67
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,255
Uh, sure, yeah.

68
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,343
He's dying inside.

69
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:08,430
He seems fine.

70
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,764
Well, sure. He's a soldier.

71
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,950
He's stuffing everything
down, but he needs a buddy.

72
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,964
You could be his buddy. Nope.

73
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,287
Oh, come on!

74
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,790
How would you feel if I
were the one who left?

75
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,893
You lying awake at
night in your empty bed...

76
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,629
What kind of buddy
are you asking me to be?

77
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:34,756
Should they be flying in this?

78
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,157
No choice!

79
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,694
Hi!

80
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,796
What?

81
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,964
I said, "Hi!"

82
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm Maggie! Pierce!

83
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:46,718
I know!

84
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,346
We haven't officially met!

85
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,171
Hello!

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,539
What?

87
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,891
I said...

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,609
Whoa!

89
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,381
Are we safe up here?

90
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,701
Oh!

91
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,754
Just answered my own question.

92
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,373
Okay, let's get ready.
We've got to be quick.

93
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,799
Okay, let's go!

94
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,682
Lost camper, extracted
from the desert,

95
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,091
Scablands west of Spokane.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,937
Hikers found him,
thought he was dead.

97
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,564
Let's get him out. Be careful!

98
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,501
Okay.

99
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,619
This wind!

100
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,254
Grab him, bring him back in!

101
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,726
We cannot unload him
until this wind dies down.

102
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,983
Watch out!

103
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,578
What if she runs
off with our baby?

104
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,279
I mean, what if she does drugs?

105
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,415
What if she doesn't eat right?

106
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:09,204
What if she forgets
her prenatals?

107
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,753
Last night, you were all for
a surrogate. What changed?

108
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,354
No, nothing.

109
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,324
I just... I was brushing
my teeth this morning,

110
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,109
I saw my scar in the mirror.

111
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,712
I was pregnant with Sofia when
that accident happened. Me.

112
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,964
Even I couldn't protect
our unborn child.

113
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,194
How can we put that kind of trust
in someone we don't even know?

114
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,852
Sofia's fine. You know,
it was a freak accident.

115
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,565
There's no reason to think
that that's gonna happen...

116
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,200
Excuse me, out of the way,
please. Page downstairs.

117
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,435
We need more hands! Let's move!

118
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,592
Okay.

119
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,377
Get out of my way!

120
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,790
The best cases go
to the fastest resident,

121
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,247
and I'm the fastest resident.

122
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,195
I'm caffeinated, and
I've been up all night.

123
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,717
No more mister nice girl.

124
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,764
It's every woman for
themselves now. Oh.

125
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,354
There!

126
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,857
I need a central line and
an art line set up STAT.

127
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,136
Dibs. Damn it.

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
Somebody needs
to go help Chief Hunt.

129
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,922
The gurney just
flew off of the helipad.

130
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,023
Dibs. Dibs.

131
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,058
You can't double-dibs.
That's my dibs.

132
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,109
I can't tell which is better!

133
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,293
One of you, get over here!

134
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,434
Wait! My dibs!

135
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,503
Bitch!

136
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,405
I can't move! Help! Help!

137
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,674
Help! We're stuck! Over here!

138
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:06,941
Oh, my God!

139
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,159
Help us!

140
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,639
Somebody, please! Oh, my God!

141
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,207
- Somebody, anyone!
- Please! Help us!

142
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,875
Someone, help! WOMAN:
Somebody, please!

143
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,217
On three. One, two, three.

144
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,166
This guy got lost in a desert.

145
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,333
I didn't even realize
Washington State had a desert.

146
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,037
I'm from Boston. Mmm.

147
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,943
I heard you lived there, too.

148
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,705
Yeah, my mom moved
us there when I was a kid.

149
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,649
Ellis Grey, right?
That's your mom?

150
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah.

151
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,247
Oh.

152
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,771
No. Sir, don't do
that. Don't do that.

153
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,879
Find them. Find them.

154
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,474
His pulse is through the roof.

155
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,704
Edwards, monitor his sats,
and let's up his sedation.

156
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,539
Have to find them. Who
do you want us to find?

157
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,164
My family. Please find
them. They're still out there.

158
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,359
My family, please.

159
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,849
His BP plummeted.

160
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,763
Get him a fluid bolus,
and start 10 of dopamine.

161
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:53,154
His rhythm is erratic.
Repeat EKG, STAT.

162
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,900
Help us! Just hang in there.

163
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,401
We're gonna get
you out of there.

164
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,792
This door's jammed!

165
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,472
It really hurts. Is that normal?

166
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,462
Nothing about this is normal!

167
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,075
Dave, is that you? I think
that's Dave Oldroyd in there.

168
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,477
What, you know him? Yeah.

169
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,228
Yeah, yeah. Stage two
osteosarcoma patient.

170
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,281
He's due for his next round
of chemo in, like, an hour.

171
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,116
David, what are you doing
in there? Are you all right?

172
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,284
My head hurts when I move it.

173
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,674
Don't move your head!

174
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,304
All right, just hang in there,
Dave. Let me get a closer look.

175
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,261
No, no, no, no, no!

176
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,981
Everything okay?

177
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,815
Yeah. No.

178
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,029
They're sitting in each
other's laps with no pants.

179
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,547
Why aren't you
wearing any pants?

180
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,171
Well, I'll give you
one little guess.

181
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,834
Okay, we're gonna need
to get them both C-spined.

182
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,886
Who's gonna climb in there?

183
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,550
Not it. Bum leg.

184
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,762
Dibs.

185
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,684
I alerted the authorities

186
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:57,914
that the patient was
traveling with family.

187
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,720
Edwards, can you imagine?

188
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,873
He must have been out
there wandering around, lost,

189
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,627
looking for his family,
day after day, all alone.

190
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,061
Dr. Grey.

191
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,041
Do you want me to page
plastics to look at the foot?

192
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,381
Yeah. That thing's nasty.

193
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:13,734
Oh, God.

194
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,964
Hold on. Foot's
gonna have to wait.

195
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,465
He's got perinephric
fluid buildup.

196
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,317
We got to get him
up to CT right now.

197
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,785
Good news! The
tech is available,

198
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,186
so I'd like to get
that echo done now...

199
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,094
Book an OR. And get a new chem-7

200
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,090
because his potassium's
been all over the place.

201
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,592
I'd really like to
make sure there isn't

202
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,082
any underlying
cardiac pathology.

203
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,328
Should I, uh,
re-check his coags or...

204
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,792
Dr. Grey. What?

205
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,314
The echo. When can I get that?
Oh. That's gonna have to wait.

206
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,338
Excuse me.

207
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,630
Watch out. Coming through.

208
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,342
You guys aren't waiting on
the board meeting, are you?

209
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,664
That's been postponed.

210
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,116
Postponed? For how long?

211
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,130
Because Dr. Webber is
recommending me to the board

212
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,221
as the replacement
for Yang's vacancy.

213
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,274
He is?

214
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,593
Well, we will address
that when we reconvene.

215
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,839
Karev, you need something, too?

216
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,529
Yeah. Um...

217
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,649
These are Yang's shares of the
hospital along with a certified letter.

218
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,000
She gave her seat to me.

219
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,385
So, you can just hand off board
seats to whomever you want?

220
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,120
I mean, what about the
members of this hospital?

221
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,278
Don't we have rights?
Don't we have a voice?

222
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,846
What are the rules here?

223
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,759
I said I'll talk to legal. It's
an unprecedented situation.

224
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,662
It's not a situation. My shares
are legit. I have them in my hand.

225
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,003
And where the
hell have you been?

226
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,599
Well, I was... Tell
them, Richard.

227
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,190
Tell them that I belong
on the board, not Karev.

228
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,770
Karev? Yeah.

229
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,626
Yang's trying to give
Karev her seat. I don't...

230
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,011
No, she did give it.

231
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,312
Um, excuse me.

232
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:33,664
And what are you...

233
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,002
I just need to know

234
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,102
you won't talk to anyone

235
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,988
about what you
heard this morning.

236
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,541
It's anonymous for a reason,
Richard. Of course not.

237
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,912
But if you ever wanted
to talk, you could, to me.

238
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,221
I'm a really good listener,

239
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,793
and it's not like I
don't have things

240
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,083
that I would rather not
have everybody here know.

241
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,747
I mean, I haven't even
told my own brother about...

242
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:55,870
I don't want to talk.

243
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,710
The last name is Peterson.

244
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,845
The wind blew my son's
Frisbee up onto our roof.

245
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,059
My husband climbed up there...

246
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,260
If you could check
in at the desk,

247
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,461
I'm sure someone could help you.

248
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,185
Daddy fell and didn't wake up.

249
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,864
I got a page? All right.

250
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,400
Can you guys wait over there?
And I'll see what I can find out.

251
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,557
Come with me.

252
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,613
Good, you're here.

253
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,002
There's too much blood to
do the ventric. Can you help?

254
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:26,851
Geez.

255
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,403
He belongs to them?

256
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,910
Yep.

257
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,574
Oh, damn it.

258
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,860
BP's 220 over 123.
He's bradying down.

259
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,139
The family's asking
for an update.

260
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,012
Anything I could tell them now?

261
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,497
Well, nothing good.

262
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,541
Just hang tight, okay?
We're working to get you out.

263
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,616
Are you calling my mom?

264
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,722
Of course, we're
calling your mom.

265
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,162
Mrs. Oldroyd? Hi.
This is Dr. Torres.

266
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,815
Are you gonna tell
her that we were...

267
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,046
My parents are gonna kill me.
They don't even know I took the car.

268
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,150
Monica, babe, you're hurt.

269
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm sure it's fine.

270
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,917
A gurney landed on you, the
sunroof shattered on your head.

271
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,308
Dave, can you see
anything, any open wounds?

272
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,844
Oh. Oh, God.

273
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:11,833
Door's coming off!

274
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,310
She's got a head
wound, bleeding profusely.

275
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,134
All right, let's get her out
of there and get her inside!

276
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,522
Be careful.

277
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,289
You want headfirst, okay?

278
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,576
There you go.

279
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:29,714
Good. On three. One, two, three.

280
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,110
Can I get a blanket? Thank
you. Yeah, yeah. Here you go.

281
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,434
Watch out for broken glass.

282
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,548
All right, buddy.

283
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,315
Make sure you're
protecting his C-spine.

284
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,296
One, two, three.

285
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,454
Good news is this day really
can't get any worse, can it?

286
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,875
Don't look! Don't look!

287
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,093
Now's your chance.
What? No, no, no.

288
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,984
Hey, Chief, you got a minute?

289
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,763
Uh, I've got to check on my
John Doe in CT, but what's up?

290
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,421
Well, are you busy tonight?

291
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,134
'Cause a couple of guys are
probably gonna get together,

292
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,143
you know, hit Joe's,
grab some brewskies.

293
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,627
Oh, yeah? Who's going?

294
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,247
So far, there's me, uh, and you.

295
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,169
Okay, well, um...

296
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,983
I don't know what time I'm
gonna get out of here tonight,

297
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,756
so can I let you know?

298
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,305
Yeah. Absolutely.
Yes. Let me know.

299
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,528
See? Was that so hard?

300
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:36,030
Yes. It was.

301
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,250
What I don't
understand is, why a car?

302
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,819
You're in a building full
of beds and supply closets.

303
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,532
We haven't seen
each other in weeks.

304
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,618
My dad was just transferred
to Portland last month.

305
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,376
Yeah, plus, it's kind of hard
to get privacy on a peds floor.

306
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:52,246
Because it's a place for young
children to heal, not to have sex.

307
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:53,781
You told her?

308
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,311
Two teenagers in a
car? I did the math.

309
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,846
Your collarbone is broken, Dave,

310
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,852
and your shoulder is
really badly bruised.

311
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,038
David Lincoln Oldroyd,

312
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,391
you were supposed
to be taking it easy!

313
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,660
You weren't even
supposed to be out of bed.

314
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:08,796
And you definitely weren't
supposed to have visitors.

315
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,083
Yeah, well, it's not like I planned
to have a gurney fall on us.

316
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,584
Don't you smart off to me.

317
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,915
Some of these glass shards
are embedded pretty deeply.

318
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,972
I may have to shave
some of your hair.

319
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,351
Are you kidding? No!

320
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,974
Yes! Awesome! Shave it all!

321
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,776
Rock on! No!

322
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,591
I've been trying to shave
my head in solidarity forever.

323
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,855
It's so dumb.

324
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,011
Why would anyone
volunteer to be bald?

325
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,801
No, you're gonna love it.

326
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,606
It's so smooth and so sweet.

327
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:37,641
You are so getting
separate rooms.

328
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,605
Okay, well, the good
news is everyone's fine,

329
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,462
so let's just focus
on that, okay?

330
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,149
Yikes, that mom was
harsh and judgy and...

331
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,329
I totally agree with her.

332
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,730
You do? You don't?

333
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,521
Robbins, I just stopped
by to check on the UTO

334
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,523
I repaired at 21 weeks,

335
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,193
and the parents could not
stop singing the praises of you.

336
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,773
You should have seen the surgery

337
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,675
that Dr. Herman performed
on this baby in utero.

338
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,299
It was masterful.

339
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,699
Yes, it was.

340
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,937
But the baby hits the air,
you do a few little stitches,

341
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,305
and you get all the credit.

342
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,273
How is that fair?

343
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,320
By the way, I'm still
looking to fill my fellowship,

344
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,993
if you hear of anybody good.

345
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,046
Maybe you should apply.

346
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,732
Yeah, then you could learn to do

347
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
something that's actually hard.

348
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,670
Well, I actually do
really hard things in peds.

349
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,190
Really? Like the teens in
the parking lot. How are they?

350
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,979
Fine. They're morons.

351
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,415
When do you leave
for DC, anyway?

352
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,329
I was gonna ask Meredith
if I could store some things

353
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,518
in your side of the closet.

354
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,153
Did Meredith tell you that?

355
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:42,423
You both did, loudly, until
about 4:00 in the morning.

356
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,891
How does it work exactly?

357
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,488
You're not separated, but
you're not living together.

358
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,079
Meredith's staying behind?

359
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,114
She is.

360
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,423
And you're cool with that?

361
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,951
You're together
but living apart.

362
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,553
Live-a-partners!

363
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,572
See that? I gave it a
name. Now it's a thing.

364
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,591
Yeah, I'm familiar
with that thing.

365
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,870
I did it with Miranda.

366
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,339
How did it work
out for you guys?

367
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,657
Well, seeing as I'm not living
in LA anymore, I'd say it didn't.

368
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,583
It's not crazy, right, to
go after this opportunity?

369
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,885
I'm not a bad person
for wanting this.

370
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,571
No, but Meredith's not either.

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,224
This is her home.
It's your kids' home.

372
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,643
You can't blame her
for wanting to stay.

373
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,556
How are you gonna get laid
when the person you get laid with

374
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,647
is here and you are in DC?

375
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,133
Oh, grow up. It's
a valid question.

376
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,436
Okay. Removing the skull flap.

377
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,067
This won't take long.

378
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,835
Dr. Hunt and I will
be just over there.

379
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,604
I have to go. Oh,
no, no, no, no, no.

380
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,872
I'm gonna need you
to stay still, okay?

381
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,512
They're still out there.

382
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,958
The authorities are
looking for your family,

383
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,899
and they'll notify
us as soon as...

384
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,484
I can't be here. I have to go.

385
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,638
Okay. How about if I
stay with you, right here?

386
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,486
Would you like that, if I just
stay here? I'll stay here with you.

387
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,120
I found footprints,

388
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,246
and they're so tiny that
they have to be hers.

389
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,082
It's my little girl, Lily.
She's only six years old.

390
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,070
We were trying to
find Nine Mile Falls,

391
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,637
and the car died and
I went to go find help.

392
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,084
I told them I would... I told
them I would be right back.

393
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,108
It's Lily and it's my wife,
and if they're separated,

394
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,938
if Lily is by
herself right now...

395
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,411
It's already been three days,

396
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:13,630
and she's not gonna
make it without any water.

397
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,533
So, I have to go right
now, and we have to hurry.

398
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,203
Please!

399
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,512
You've been in the desert
for more than three days.

400
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,874
Uh... I know.

401
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,159
It's maybe four days.

402
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,022
Based on your
state of dehydration

403
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,880
and your level of malnutrition,

404
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,200
I think it's been more
like one or two months.

405
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,838
What?

406
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:38,840
No.

407
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,208
What?

408
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,415
They're gone,
aren't they? My Lily?

409
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,552
My Lily. She's six.

410
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,588
She's six years old.

411
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,490
My Lily.

412
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,451
<i>Grey, we need to move him now.</i>

413
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,363
Tell them we have a
name for his daughter.

414
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,632
- Her name is Lily.
- Dr. Grey!

415
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,355
And they found him
at Saddle Mountain.

416
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,391
That's 100 miles
from Nine Mile Falls.

417
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,754
They've been looking for
his family in the wrong spot.

418
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,545
Dr. Grey!

419
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,275
I stopped by CT to take
the patient for his echo,

420
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,876
but you were gone.
Echo has to wait.

421
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,916
Lily...

422
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,746
His right kidney has
severe EPN and abscesses.

423
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,297
We're taking him up
to OR three right now.

424
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,831
- I have to get off!
- Sir, lay down.

425
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,317
I have to get off!
Lay down, sir, please!

426
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,541
Lay down.

427
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,938
Please, sir. MAN: I can't
stay. I have to get off.

428
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,082
Sir, please.

429
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,048
I still need that echo. Not now.

430
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,324
Head up to OR three.

431
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,073
Tell Grey and Hunt that you've
got two of their patient's toes.

432
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,629
Try not to throw up on them.

433
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,865
Ew. Ew.

434
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,701
Ew. Ew.

435
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,284
You know what's weird?

436
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,652
I keep paging
cardio and expecting

437
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,053
Cristina to just walk
through the door.

438
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,012
Pierce is no Yang.
She's perky and chatty.

439
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,797
I bet she likes cats.

440
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,059
Sorry to interrupt.

441
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,600
Mr. Crossley's
anastomosis may be leaking.

442
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,531
Oh, so, you're gonna take
him back for a wash out?

443
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,082
We're prepping him
in OR one right now.

444
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:18,172
Great.

445
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,077
Is there something else?

446
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:28,015
You have very steady hands.

447
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,852
Thank you.

448
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,066
Uh, have you ever played Jenga,

449
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,040
you know, where you
stack the little bricks

450
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,891
and try not to make them fall?

451
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,460
Uh, yeah.

452
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,562
You should come over sometime.

453
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,047
I'll make snacks.

454
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,431
Okay.

455
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,970
Or if you're not into
Jenga, there's checkers.

456
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,055
Hmm.

457
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,628
The blood supply to the
kidney is all clotted out.

458
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,074
But the kidney
itself is still fine.

459
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,814
Yeah, Edwards. Pop quiz.

460
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,215
We have one bad kidney,

461
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,435
one good kidney with
a bad blood supply.

462
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,872
We want to avoid dialysis
and the transplant list.

463
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:08,941
What do we do?

464
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,859
Uh...

465
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:14,072
She's not gonna get
it. Give her a second.

466
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,096
Mmm...

467
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,531
Oh! Auto-transplant.

468
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,817
You can use his good
kidney to replace his bad one.

469
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,980
You can transplant his own
kidney. Can I please scrub?

470
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,004
Yes, go on.

471
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,524
Oh, my God!

472
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,426
I can't believe we're
actually doing this!

473
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,774
Oh, my parents are gonna freak!

474
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,061
They're gonna freak?

475
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,447
What about me? I'm
fully freaking over here.

476
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,918
All right. That's it.

477
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,106
Ta-da.

478
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,509
Oh, my God.

479
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,712
Adorable, right?
We're like alien lovers.

480
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,699
One of the lacs
needs some stitches.

481
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,116
I'm gonna grab a suture kit.

482
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,180
Okay. Can you get me some
more tape, too, please? Thanks.

483
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,770
Monica?

484
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,772
What's happening? Is she okay?

485
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,441
Dr. Torres! CALLIE: Oh, no.

486
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,042
Why isn't she moving?

487
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,728
Monica!

488
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,074
What's happening? What's wrong?

489
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,130
Monica? Look at me.

490
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,632
Look at me. Monica?

491
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:09,701
Page Dr. Shepherd.

492
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,889
Okay.

493
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,517
They're calling for an emergency
neuro consult downstairs.

494
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,958
17-year-old female,
trauma to the head.

495
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,226
I can handle things here.

496
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:20,428
Okay.

497
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,849
Warren, you coming?

498
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,351
Well, actually, would
you mind if I stayed here?

499
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,740
No offense, but you've
already got one foot out the door,

500
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,717
and this Dr. Shepherd
is the new head of neuro.

501
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:34,241
So, you want to stay here
and not come with me?

502
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,710
Why not? Seems to
be the trend these days.

503
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,099
The site is prepped and ready.

504
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,570
Okay, let's flush this
with Collins and heparin

505
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,079
and put this kidney
in its new place.

506
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,536
BP just dropped out.
Is there a pulse? No.

507
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,722
Okay. Edwards, stay with the
kidney while I bring him back.

508
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,240
Let's get a crash cart in here.

509
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,775
Push one of epi. MEREDITH:
Starting compressions.

510
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,865
CVP is soaring.

511
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,644
Page Pierce, get her in here.

512
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,868
- And let's order an echo.
- Right away.

513
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,933
Stopping compressions
to check rhythm.

514
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,223
Pulseless V-tach.

515
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,058
Charge paddles to 150.

516
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,947
Clear!

517
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,221
How bad is it?

518
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,156
It's an epidural bleed.

519
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:25,126
I cannot believe they
snuck out to that car.

520
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,972
If I were her mother and
this brain bleed didn't kill her,

521
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,646
I would totally kill her.

522
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,648
Oh, God. Oh, God.

523
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,195
I sound like my father
when I was a teenager.

524
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,219
What is... What
is wrong with me?

525
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,967
I love him, but I don't
want our daughter

526
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,703
to have my father for a mother.

527
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,154
I don't know what you just said,

528
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:45,513
but it's nice to see what our kids
have in store for them someday.

529
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,364
Or kid.

530
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,552
You sure you don't want
to consider a surrogate?

531
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,451
<i>Looks like it's deeper. We
need to get in there now.</i>

532
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,307
Okay. I can't watch this.

533
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,542
I'm gonna go check on Dave.

534
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,612
Will you tell me
when it's, um, over?

535
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,581
Yeah. Okay.

536
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:11,404
What happened?

537
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,272
We were about to
autotransplant his kidney

538
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,401
when his BP dropped out.

539
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,825
I'll take over.

540
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,205
I think he's in
cardiogenic shock.

541
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,069
Thank you. I've got this.

542
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,776
He's got a failed mitral
valve from endocarditis.

543
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,033
He'll need a balloon
pump. Gown and glove me.

544
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,480
Let's pack the belly and
get a cardiac team in here.

545
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,731
Edwards, prep the right groin.

546
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:28,099
Edwards is
monitoring the kidney.

547
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,373
Edwards, now.

548
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,992
Let's get this OR changed
out. These need to go.

549
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:33,305
Dr. Pierce, you realize that

550
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,706
I have another surgery to finish

551
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,175
- as soon as you're done here.
- Quickly, people.

552
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,576
Dr. Pierce, I'm talking to you.

553
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,300
And I am ignoring you.

554
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,446
We've got a patient in cardiac
distress, which could have been avoided

555
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,298
if I had gotten
that echo earlier.

556
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,683
I let you overrule me before.
That is not gonna happen again.

557
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,103
No matter how important
you are around here, Dr. Grey.

558
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,637
I have a duty to
help this patient,

559
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,145
not kiss your ass.

560
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,334
Dr. Hunt, I could use an assist.

561
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:56,984
Dr. Edwards, let's make sure

562
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,085
that that kidney is
prepped and ready to go.

563
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:02,489
As soon as she's finished,
we'll get back in there.

564
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,136
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

565
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,309
It's gone.

566
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,793
What's gone?

567
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,902
The basin with the
kidney. The kidney is gone.

568
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,452
Well, look for it!

569
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,146
Look on the floor, look in
the hazardous waste bins,

570
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,260
look everywhere.

571
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,523
I'm sorry, Dr. Grey.

572
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,492
I took my eyes off
it for two minutes.

573
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:29,094
Because Dr. Pierce came in
and started ordering you around.

574
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,979
Yes, I was ordering
the resident around.

575
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,687
With no knowledge of
what she was already doing.

576
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,800
Are you blaming me for
your resident's incompetence?

577
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:37,268
That is ridiculous. You
should have never barged...

578
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,520
Hey. We have a
patient open on the table

579
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,871
who needs our
undivided attention.

580
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,740
- Both of you, settle down.
- She's the one...

581
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:45,084
She's accusing me of losing
a kidney... I said settle down!

582
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,551
Oh, I found it!

583
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,548
They dumped out the basin. It's
been in the sink the whole time.

584
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,989
Let's get it in here and
see if we can save it.

585
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,544
Pupil's blown.

586
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:59,162
He's herniating. Damn it!

587
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,510
Just want to get an update
on Mr. Peterson for his wife.

588
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,734
Push 100 grams of 20% mannitol!

589
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,352
ICP's still elevated.

590
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,248
More mannitol! His
brain injury's too far gone.

591
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,400
We've been trying
to salvage things.

592
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,640
How long has he been down?

593
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,408
Thirty-seven minutes.

594
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,261
I'm gonna call it.

595
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,463
Time of death, 18:32.

596
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,869
Kepner, is everything okay?

597
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,639
Yeah, yeah. No,
I'm fine. It's just...

598
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:30,110
He was just trying to get
his kid's Frisbee, you know?

599
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:46,093
Dr. Shepherd's doing
everything he can for Monica,

600
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:47,306
but it's just...

601
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,764
She seemed so fine,
giving me attitude.

602
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,399
Hmm.

603
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,700
Are her parents...

604
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,849
On a plane now. They
should be here soon.

605
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,921
When they're babies, you
spend every night by their crib,

606
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:06,430
just watching them, make
sure that they're still breathing.

607
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,216
They start walking,

608
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:11,818
so you childproof
every inch of your house.

609
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,904
They start climbing trees,

610
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,941
and you just pray that they don't
fall and crack their head open.

611
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,610
They turn 16,

612
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,350
and they get cancer.

613
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,135
And...

614
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,475
Just when you're
finally about to beat that,

615
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:38,662
they sneak out to a
parking lot to have sex

616
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,714
and a gurney
falls out of the sky!

617
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,335
I mean, how are we
supposed to do it?

618
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,874
How are we ever
supposed to keep them safe?

619
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,459
It's bad news, isn't it?

620
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,394
We'll be right in.

621
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:56,924
You should stay in bed, keep
that shoulder immobilized.

622
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,948
You guys have been
out here a long time.

623
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,950
Is it 'cause she's dead?

624
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,464
You're trying to figure
out how to tell me?

625
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,788
No, sweetie, Monica's not dead.

626
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,874
Yet. You mean
she hasn't died yet.

627
00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:19,987
How am I gonna tell her parents?

628
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,073
How am I gonna explain to them

629
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,643
that I'm the reason she...

630
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,961
Oh, no.

631
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:31,414
No one has died, okay?

632
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,865
We're just gonna sit here,

633
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,605
and we're gonna
think good thoughts.

634
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,749
Don't you worry.

635
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,777
It's like the fight's
gone out of him.

636
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,779
He's been this way since
he woke up from surgery,

637
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,670
listless, confused.

638
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,523
His pupils are responsive.

639
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,869
Can you follow
this light for me?

640
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,810
I just want to sleep.

641
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,490
I know you're tired, but this
is an important examination.

642
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,946
You're a doctor?

643
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,982
I am.

644
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,134
Then help me. Give me something.

645
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:08,852
Put me to sleep.

646
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,688
That's when they come,

647
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:16,192
when I close my
eyes and I go places.

648
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,831
And then they come in
the door and everything's...

649
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,800
Everything's fine.

650
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:26,970
I shouldn't have left them.

651
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,809
I should never have left them.

652
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,565
Leave me alone, please.

653
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,535
I just want to sleep.

654
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,772
Karev?

655
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,058
What are you doing?

656
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,359
Nothing.

657
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,145
But you don't
want to go in there.

658
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,880
Asking personal questions.

659
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,309
You're ignoring
concerns about a patient!

660
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,824
You had no right to accuse me...

661
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,053
I have every right.

662
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,212
I have never experienced

663
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:13,400
this level of disrespect and
this lack of professionalism...

664
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,734
Respect is earned,

665
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,380
and if you want to talk
about being unprofessional,

666
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:19,155
I spoke directly to you and
you ignored me in my OR.

667
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,575
You ignored my request
for an echo this morning.

668
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,055
My patient was circling the
drain, and I was doing my job.

669
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,580
And I was doing mine.

670
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,032
I spent all morning
deferring to you,

671
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,046
trying not to step on
your toes, for what?

672
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,681
Because I wanted you to like me?

673
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,671
Guess what. I'm
kind of over that now.

674
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:38,403
Yeah, you definitely don't have
to worry about me liking you.

675
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,525
It took my last two dollars.

676
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,594
And it won't give
me my granola bar!

677
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,144
Everything okay?

678
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:04,585
Meredith Grey.

679
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,137
She's your sister.

680
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,139
Yeah, you figured that out, too.

681
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,510
I was hoping...

682
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:21,250
I was gonna talk
to her today, tell her.

683
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,204
First, I was gonna win her
over with my talent and charm,

684
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:25,688
and then I...

685
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,910
I found my sister,
and I think I hate her.

686
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:33,179
She's terrible.

687
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,260
She's not. She's...
What am I doing?

688
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:37,083
I have parents,

689
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:40,570
good, funny, kind,
goofy parents.

690
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,740
I don't need any... Screw it.

691
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,175
Screw her.

692
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,911
I am just fine without adding

693
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,249
any random, unwanted
blood relatives into my life.

694
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,767
Oh, gosh.

695
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,832
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

696
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,674
Not necessary.

697
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,071
Think he'll be able to hang on?

698
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,662
It's hard to predict.

699
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,141
Oh, did you catch
the game last night?

700
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,497
What game?

701
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,033
Wasn't there a game?

702
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,579
I don't know. I just asked you.

703
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:48,204
All right, screw this. See,
Kepner is worried about you.

704
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,940
She asked me to take you out.

705
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,119
What, like a date?

706
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,575
No, not a date.

707
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,595
It's like a man-date
thing but not like a date.

708
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,275
Listen, I'm fine. I'm gonna be
fine. You're the one who's not fine.

709
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,577
You're the one who's
splitting up with his wife.

710
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,845
I'm not splitting
up. I got a job.

711
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:02,146
On the other side
of the country.

712
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,465
Cristina's on the
other side of the world.

713
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:04,699
She's not my wife.

714
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,368
She and I split up,
whereas you two, you're...

715
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,791
Which is none of your business.

716
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,339
Just stop asking
me out on dates!

717
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,265
Hey.

718
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,903
How's this for solidarity?

719
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,265
You know what?
Dave's mom's right.

720
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,068
Even if you play it safe,
you aren't safe, not really,

721
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,604
so we might as well
take a few risks, right?

722
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,851
I'm so happy to
hear you say that.

723
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,008
You are?

724
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,186
Yeah, 'cause I...

725
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,254
I have something
to talk to you about.

726
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,310
Me too.

727
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,646
About this morning.

728
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,016
You were right. I
was overreacting.

729
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,828
You know what? We
can't control everything.

730
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,436
So we should do it.

731
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,582
Let's get a surrogate
and have another baby.

732
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:12,751
Absolutely.

733
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:15,441
Oh, no, well, actually,
I was talking about

734
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,111
the, um, fetal surgery fellowship
that Dr. Herman mentioned.

735
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,913
Oh! Oh, okay.

736
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:23,099
So, you're, uh,
recommending somebody?

737
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,519
I thought maybe me.

738
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,256
I could get double-certified.
It's an incredible opportunity.

739
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:32,758
So, you're essentially
going back to school?

740
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,411
It'll be hard, I know,

741
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,379
you know, study
sessions and longer hours.

742
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,014
And a new baby.

743
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,783
Right. So, that's
why I was just...

744
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,684
That's all. I was
just thinking about it.

745
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,322
You guys coming?

746
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:45,872
What's this about, again?

747
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,640
Yang's board seat.

748
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,109
Oh, that's a no-brainer.

749
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,097
It's Bailey. Yeah, it's Alex.

750
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,115
So, here is what we
know. Karev has a letter

751
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:58,151
from Yang's attorney granting
him her shares and her board seat.

752
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,264
So, that's Karev's seat.

753
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,288
Not so fast.

754
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:01,933
According to the
bylaws of the foundation,

755
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,169
new board members are
appointed by a majority vote

756
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:05,625
from other members.

757
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:08,295
That is the closest
thing we have to a rule.

758
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:09,713
So, what do we do?

759
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,042
I propose we let
them fight it out.

760
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,965
Can I talk to you after this?

761
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,534
Dr. Grey?

762
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:16,563
There's news about
the hiker's family.

763
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,425
I did.

764
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,826
Hi. Thank you.

765
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:30,367
Hey, look.

766
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,559
Yang gave me her
shares for a reason.

767
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,552
I know you don't think
I deserve the seat,

768
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,078
but I don't want to screw it
up, I'm not gonna screw it up.

769
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,515
I'm sure you'd make an
excellent board member.

770
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,533
May the best surgeon win.

771
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:57,377
That was nice of you.

772
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,645
Yes, it was.

773
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,279
You think he's got a shot?

774
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,993
Please. It's Alex Karev.

775
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,084
How is Mr. Peterson?

776
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,120
On my way to talk
to his family now.

777
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,122
It's gonna be super fun.

778
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,510
I love telling little kids that
dad is never coming home.

779
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,825
I'll go with you.

780
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,160
Actually, I'd appreciate that.

781
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah, somebody should
be there to make sure

782
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,144
you don't say things
like "super fun."

783
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,331
Ah. Good note.

784
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,669
Hey, Luca. Cool spaceship.

785
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:23,898
Where's your mom?

786
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:24,954
Dr. Shepherd?

787
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,570
Luca, we just need to talk to
your mom over here for a sec.

788
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,674
You cool to hang out,
work on that spaceship?

789
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:37,884
No.

790
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,113
Oh, no.

791
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,004
What happened?

792
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,157
Mom?

793
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,454
I'll stay with him.
Come on with me.

794
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:50,129
Come on. This way, Luca.

795
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:57,854
I want to go with my mom.

796
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,857
I haven't seen a spaceship
with a trap door before.

797
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,692
Want to show me how to use it?

798
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,247
My dad's dead, isn't he?

799
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,617
We should talk about that
when your mom comes back.

800
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,470
Dead means he's
gone away, doesn't it,

801
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,922
and he's never coming back?

802
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,509
It does.

803
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,450
I miss him already.

804
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,779
The nurses say you're
refusing your IV fluids.

805
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:42,215
You need them to
get your strength back.

806
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:53,426
There is a reason you
survived for so long.

807
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:55,940
I don't believe this has to be

808
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,596
the end for you.

809
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,585
Finally...

810
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,071
I'm asleep.

811
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,415
They're always
here when I'm asleep.

812
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,985
Papa?

813
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,243
Papa!

814
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,291
They found us the next
day, but they never found you.

815
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,432
We thought you were
gone. You were gone.

816
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,354
I love you, Papa.

817
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:56,640
<i>There can be
beauty in getting lost.</i>

818
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,453
There you are.

819
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,083
Grab your stuff. We're drinking.

820
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:13,339
Oh. I can't.

821
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:14,451
I have to go home
and deal with...

822
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,375
Fight with Shepherd?

823
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,422
I think you need to whine
about it some more to me first.

824
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:19,745
You definitely need to drink.

825
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,984
What are you afraid
of, that I'm gonna...

826
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,597
I'm afraid you're gonna
keep crawling in my bed

827
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,781
in the middle of the night.

828
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,809
Look, Yang left me her
shares and her board seat

829
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,979
and she left me you, too.

830
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,981
It's just us now.

831
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,068
I don't know, if you need
somebody to bitch to or just be...

832
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,071
My person.

833
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,406
I don't know what you mean.

834
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,875
But you do.

835
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:56,415
<i>Sometimes, we have to
get lost to find each other.</i>

836
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:04,223
I just don't know if my
marriage can survive this.

837
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,025
My mom asked me
to give this to you.

838
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:14,901
Oh, I see.

839
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,370
How did she seem?

840
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,473
Not great.

841
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,152
Though, I guess the idea
of becoming a grandma

842
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,209
is helping distract
her, at least.

843
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:28,931
That's right. Congratulations.

844
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,299
I'm really happy for you.

845
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,634
Thank you.

846
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,971
I'm a little freaked
out, to be honest.

847
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,008
I didn't grow up
with much of a dad,

848
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,516
so kind of working
in the dark here.

849
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,896
Oh, you'll be fine, Avery.

850
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:45,898
More than fine.

851
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,733
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

852
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,005
Uh...

853
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:54,808
Thank you for returning this.

854
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:56,003
Yeah. Sure.

855
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:01,831
For what it's worth, sir,

856
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,833
it would have been really
nice having you in the family.

857
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,246
<i>And sometimes,
we find each other,</i>

858
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,464
<i>only to get lost all over again.</i>

859
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,621
I'm a widow. She widowed me.

860
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,456
I'll never have Alex
to myself again.

861
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,303
Her best friend just
left yesterday, okay?

862
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,594
She needs someone to
talk to. You are overreacting.

863
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,142
She kicked me out of my own
bed in the middle of the night,

864
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,033
while I was naked,
and he let her.

865
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,668
Okay. So, you're screwed.

866
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,804
<i>You can't always control it,</i>

867
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,139
<i>the thing that's
going to set you adrift.</i>

868
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,941
I mean, people do it, right?

869
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,210
It's not conventional, it's
not easy, but people do it.

870
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,914
I mean, if we map brains,
we can figure this out.

871
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,116
Are you trying to
convince me or you?

872
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,562
I mean, I don't want to
split up our family, either,

873
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,131
but I certainly don't want to go

874
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,833
and then resent him
for the rest of my life.

875
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,123
And that's what would happen.

876
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:03,271
And he doesn't want
that, either, so I really just...

877
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,371
I need to go talk
to him about this. I...

878
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,395
Yeah, well...

879
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,667
Hi. What are you doing here?

880
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,380
I just got off the phone
with the White House.

881
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,671
I resigned from the
brain mapping initiative.

882
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,794
What?

883
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,873
I'm not moving to DC.

884
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,019
Why would you do that?

885
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,237
I don't want to
live anywhere else

886
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,405
when my kids are
growing up here.

887
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,663
I don't want to be
apart from them or you.

888
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,064
No job is worth that to me.

889
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,700
I want to be with
you and the kids here.

890
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,832
No. What?

891
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,134
This is not what we discussed.

892
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,468
I mean, you should
call them back

893
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,686
and tell them you were kidding.

894
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,294
I got to pee.

895
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:41,197
I did not ask you to do
this. I never wanted you...

896
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,482
I know you didn't. I chose.

897
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,387
I chose you and the kids.

898
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,835
<i>And as you stand
there on your front porch,</i>

899
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,472
<i>staring at the life you're
about to leave behind...</i>

900
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:55,828
I need a drink.

901
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,897
<i>You have to accept it's gone,</i>

902
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:02,268
<i>it's lost, just like you.</i>

903
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,558
<i>All you can do now
is stand very still,</i>

904
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,881
<i>breathe in the moment,
and try to be open</i>

905
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,485
<i>to wherever the wind's
going to take you next.</i>

906
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:21,393
Tequila. Tequila.
