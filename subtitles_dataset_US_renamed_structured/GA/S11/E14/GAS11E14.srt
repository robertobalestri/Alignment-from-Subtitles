00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,964
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:05,965
Your tumor is smart.
But so am I. I can beat it.

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:07,600
Any one of these approaches
would likely kill the patient?

4
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:09,569
I refuse to spend the
last few months of my life

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,126
feeling like a pile of crap.

6
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,522
I am going to give you
more than a few months.

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,145
Are you nervous?

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,209
Nobody thinks that this can
work. No one understands it.

9
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,044
You get at my tumor,
you get at my knowledge,

10
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,051
<i>I get at my life.</i>

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,332
<i>Each card represents a fetus that
I'm gonna teach Robbins how to fix.</i>

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,016
I'm not ready to
take this over yet.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,369
Where's Dr. Herman? She
stepped out. What do you need?

14
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,791
It's Glenda Castillo.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,221
I need you to scan me.
- Let's go.

16
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,355
<i>I need Herman right now.</i>

17
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,779
<i>Arizona. It's time.</i>

18
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,450
Amelia?

19
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:38,854
I'll get the OR prepped.
You'll inform the patient?

20
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:46,061
<i>In 1888, William Williams Keen</i>

21
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,841
<i>became one of the first surgeons</i>

22
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,198
<i>to successfully
remove a brain tumor.</i>

23
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:54,803
<i>A big win. It's true.
You can look it up.</i>

24
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:56,955
<i>What's harder to find, however,</i>

25
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,102
<i>are stories of all the
times old Double-Billy K</i>

26
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,493
<i>tried to pull a tumor
out of a brain and lost.</i>

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,197
<i>The losses must have happened.</i>

28
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:12,304
<i>A surgeon must always
be prepared to lose.</i>

29
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,924
<i>And in neurosurgery,
with the big tumors,</i>

30
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,245
<i>we lose those battles
as often as we succeed.</i>

31
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,483
<i>The key, though, win
or lose, is to never fail.</i>

32
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>And the only way
to fail is not to fight.</i>

33
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,141
<i>So, you fight until you
can't fight anymore.</i>

34
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,981
Word's getting around.

35
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,394
You're gonna
have a full gallery.

36
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:42,795
Everybody wants to see the show.

37
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,586
You feeling good, confident?

38
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,750
You're not worried, are
you? Are you worried?

39
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,257
This is where you
leave me, Dr. Hunt.

40
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh.

41
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,623
You okay? Do you
need anything? I'm fine.

42
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,946
I'm great. I just...

43
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,255
Prep alone. So...

44
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,556
I will see you
on the other side.

45
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,996
Okay.

46
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,532
Okay. Okay.

47
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,277
We are doing this, okay?

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,930
We're doing this.

49
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,566
If she's awake, she'll
tell you for the 15th time

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,307
to save her child's
life, not hers.

51
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,969
Listen to her, let
her say her piece,

52
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,688
then you do what
needs to be done.

53
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,624
I don't think that I can
do... No, I know I can't.

54
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,126
You can. You will.
ARIZONA: Nicole.

55
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,686
Let's get you inside now, okay?

56
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,535
Okay, I have everything set up.

57
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,143
You will have all of your films,
your favorite scrub nurse...

58
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,547
What is happening?

59
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,915
I'm being a superhero.

60
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,117
Okay.

61
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,003
There's a scientific study

62
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:03,508
that shows that if you stand
like this in superhero pose

63
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,045
for just five minutes
before a job interview,

64
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,476
or a big presentation
or a really hard task,

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,845
you will not only
feel more confident,

66
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,080
you will perform
measurably better.

67
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:15,104
Seriously?

68
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,972
Seriously.

69
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,275
You feel it?

70
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,679
We're superheroes.

71
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,283
We are superheroes.

72
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,807
<i>Hold up your head and enter
the arena and face the enemy.</i>

73
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,364
<i>Fight until you
can't fight anymore.</i>

74
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:19,117
<i>Never let go. Never give up.</i>

75
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,930
Here's the plan. We're
gonna embolize the tumor

76
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,266
to see if we can reverse the
effects on mom's circulation.

77
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,667
And if not, then I'm afraid...

78
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,957
Where's Herman?

79
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,094
<i>Never run.</i>

80
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,950
<i>Never surrender.</i>

81
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,119
Glenda's platelet
count is critically low,

82
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,166
so, we need to give
her six packs of platelets

83
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,601
to avoid liver capsule bleeding.

84
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,387
And then we'll perform the
fetoscopy to reverse the cascade...

85
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,162
You keep saying
"we," but I only see you.

86
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,197
Where the hell is
Herman? She's not coming.

87
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,651
What do you mean,
"She's not coming"?

88
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,918
<i>Fight the good fight.</i>

89
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,370
Start the clock, please.

90
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,807
<i>You fight...</i>

91
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:19,211
Ten blade.

92
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,716
<i>Even when it seems inevitable</i>

93
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,171
<i>that you're about
to go down swinging.</i>

94
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,923
Mmm-mmm.

95
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,726
So, this is a regular thing.

96
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:55,530
You all come up here and
you watch surgeries. Why?

97
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,282
Not just surgeries.

98
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,602
The big surgeries, the whale
surgeries, the rare ones, the crazy ones.

99
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,532
I mean, you're on
the edge of your seat.

100
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,796
The patient could die.

101
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,189
This is life or death.

102
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,669
The adrenaline, the rush...

103
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,337
Okay, so you watch,
like, the worst day

104
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,694
of a person's life like a movie.

105
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,445
No, not like a movie.

106
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,647
That's insulting. This
is not entertainment.

107
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:14,716
Huh.

108
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,350
"Movie."

109
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,819
Oh, okay. This is where
the good part starts.

110
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,642
Excuse me. Ah, thanks
for saving my seat.

111
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,944
Well, I almost got
my arm torn off,

112
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,145
but, uh, your
timing is excellent.

113
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:33,084
Ah, the dye's coming
in. It's kick-off time.

114
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,831
Let's go ahead
and inject the dye.

115
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,037
Lights, please.

116
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,328
What does the dye do?

117
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,813
Oh, the dye makes
the whole tumor glow

118
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,510
so that we can see
where the tumor ends

119
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,751
and where the brain begins.

120
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,560
Nice to see you face-to-face.

121
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,445
Now, you have to go.

122
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,649
Bipolars, please.

123
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,723
This is my favorite part.

124
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,425
Yeah, I thought only the
tumor was supposed to glow.

125
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,428
That is the tumor.

126
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,948
Oh, we are not in
Kansas anymore.

127
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,812
The baby's anemic.
Let's transfuse him.

128
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,752
40 milliliters of
irradiated PRBC.

129
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,249
Robbins, we need
to get in and out.

130
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,217
Glenda's pressure
is through the roof.

131
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,985
If we don't stop this
bleeding, the baby will die.

132
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,988
And the idea is to save both of
them, and I think that I can do it.

133
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,294
Do you think, or you know?

134
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,447
I know I can.

135
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,050
Robbins, I respect you
and consider you a friend,

136
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,470
so, it is with kindness
when I tell you

137
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,456
that you're only half a
fetal surgeon, not even.

138
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,604
You're half a fellow. You
brought this patient to me.

139
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,055
No, I brought this
patient to your boss.

140
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,590
I have spent the past
four and a half months

141
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,091
getting everything
that Dr. Herman knows

142
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,447
pounded into my brain.

143
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,793
Do you hear yourself?
"Four and a half months"?

144
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,668
You want her hands,
you have them right here.

145
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,987
22-gauge needle.

146
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,188
Here you go.

147
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,976
Hey, hey, Chief, any chance
you could lose me tonight?

148
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,644
What? No.

149
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,124
Oh, I just thought that
it's kind of quiet down here,

150
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,026
and now, Dr. Herman's
surgery is happening.

151
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,928
Every other resident is
watching that surgery.

152
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,196
I'm sorry you pulled
the short straw,

153
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,753
but I need someone down here.

154
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,266
Oh, so, wait. I'm gonna be the
only resident who's down here?

155
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,258
Just you. I'm counting on you to
hold down the fort. Can I do that?

156
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,361
Yes. Absolutely. I'm
your girl. Thank you.

157
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,131
Hunt, you pushed
my meniscus tonight.

158
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,166
What, uh... What
gives? I needed the OR.

159
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,836
Shepherd has taken Dr. Herman
up for her brain surgery.

160
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,507
Wait, Dr. Herman's going in now?

161
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,936
I thought she had another month.

162
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,846
Okay. Right here.

163
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,377
It's invaded the
chiasmatic cistern a little.

164
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,402
Dr. Shepherd is examining
the margins of the tumor.

165
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,325
Who's subbing in
for you? I'm sorry?

166
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,921
We're gonna be here
for another 14 hours,

167
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,845
probably more.

168
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,447
Definitely more.

169
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,016
You know the protocol.

170
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:03,529
Over 12 hours, have another
resident sub in to replace you.

171
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:06,170
So, you can recharge,
rest, and return.

172
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,556
Who's subbing in for you?

173
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,236
Hey, I have been
planning this for months.

174
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,038
There's kind of no
substitute for me.

175
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,229
Well, then there's no
substitute for me, either.

176
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:17,898
If you're here, I am
here. We're superheroes.

177
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,980
I mean, I'd do the thing
with the hands on the hips,

178
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,436
but I can't break scrub.

179
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,726
Okay.

180
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,961
Retract here, please, Edwards.

181
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,364
It's not working. I can't
embolize all the vessels.

182
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,690
I handpicked you. And
you are letting me down.

183
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,736
I need to open her
up. Oh, absolutely not.

184
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,990
We'd have to increase
Glenda's anesthesia, and...

185
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,190
He's got persistent decels.

186
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,779
I'm not just questioning your
abilities. Now, I'm questioning mine.

187
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,203
All right, I could open her up,

188
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:58,256
exteriorize the uterus and
then resect the entire tumor.

189
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,454
The prolonged anesthesia could be
catastrophic to both mom and baby.

190
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,922
If you're gonna open her up, then
you should go ahead and deliver.

191
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,429
No. It's not an option.

192
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,759
This is mirror syndrome,
Robbins. You know that.

193
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,385
The sicker the baby gets,
the sicker Glenda gets.

194
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,015
We deliver, Glenda
will get better.

195
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,171
I said it's not an option.

196
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,173
He's not far enough
along. He won't survive.

197
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,443
Page Alex Karev.

198
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,957
Okay. Wait, stop.
What are you doing?

199
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,279
We're delivering this baby.

200
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,781
It's not gonna be easy,

201
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,283
but Karev may be able to
keep him alive once he's out.

202
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,496
No. Put that phone down.

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,969
Bailey, I can do this.

204
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:33,024
Arizona, your mentor is on an OR
table right now with her skull open

205
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,487
and you think you
have something to prove.

206
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,572
I'm not gonna let you
do that with this patient.

207
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,956
You want to open her up? Do
it, but we are delivering this child.

208
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,595
Page Dr. Karev. Okay.

209
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,377
Dr. Shepherd is now cutting the
tumor away from the gyrus rectus.

210
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,045
Gyrus rectus?

211
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,443
The area responsible
for our sense of smell.

212
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,467
Shh.

213
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,473
I thought Arizona would be here.

214
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,404
She's in surgery.

215
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,673
Wait, fetal surgery?
By herself? Shh.

216
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,042
Oh, relax. It's not the
ballet, or whatever.

217
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:09,444
Though...

218
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,752
Though it is a kind of a dance.

219
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,898
There's grace, a rhythm,

220
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,401
an elegance.

221
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,337
Oh, okay. I got shushed,
but the purple prose is fine.

222
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,555
Shh.

223
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:22,864
Okay.

224
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,760
She is gonna pull
it off, though, right?

225
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,412
Yes. Yeah, she will.

226
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,651
Dr. Shepherd is now
clearing the tumor away

227
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,587
from the midbrain structures,

228
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,833
the fornix, the thalamus.

229
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,024
It shouldn't be
taking this long.

230
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,209
We're behind. Already.

231
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,147
Uh, using extreme care not to
violate the anterior commissure.

232
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:49,033
Dr. Shepherd calls
this the dream box.

233
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,397
Dr. Grey, I'm sorry,
but "dream box"?

234
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,537
Where we create
dreams and memories

235
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,340
and discern shapes and colors.

236
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,689
Read a book, for God's sake.

237
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,552
Webber, you okay?

238
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,606
I'm fine.

239
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,108
Her shoulders are tense.

240
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,177
Something's bothering her.

241
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,320
Maybe you'll get lucky

242
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,789
and you'll snip out the part
that makes her kind of bitchy.

243
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:31,937
Why would you say that?

244
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,644
It was... It was a joke.

245
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,208
Well, you're right.
I screw this up,

246
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,775
Nicole Herman will
no longer be bitchy.

247
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,895
She'll no longer be able to
laugh, either, or be a surgeon.

248
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,485
She will no longer
be Nicole Herman.

249
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,899
She won't be anything anymore,
and you want to make jokes about that?

250
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,189
No, I'm... You're right.

251
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,591
Damn it. Damn it. What is it?

252
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,822
I can't get around the fornix
without hitting the hypothalamus.

253
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,740
Can you move
laterally to avoid it?

254
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,497
There's not enough
carotid to mobilize.

255
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,300
I'm trapped.

256
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,186
Her sats are dropping.
She's hypoxic.

257
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,221
Robbins, it's not
going to get better.

258
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,194
Okay, okay. There we go.

259
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,715
Oh, crap. It's stuck.
The tumor's too big.

260
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,462
Hey, sorry. I would have been here
sooner. But I was already at home.

261
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,997
You should have stayed at home.

262
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,632
What? MIRANDA:
Nothing. She's pouting.

263
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,034
I can't get it from this
angle. If I force it, it ruptures.

264
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,974
I need, I need to
widen the incision.

265
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,737
You have to widen it anyway.
Karev's here. We're delivering.

266
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,322
We're not delivering.
He's not viable.

267
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,546
I can do this. It'll
be just like last time.

268
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,808
What do you mean last time?

269
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,266
We did one of these before.
Herman wasn't available.

270
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,730
So, we decided to deliver
and remove the mass after.

271
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:32,994
I knew it. I knew it.

272
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,800
That was entirely different.
Sounds the same to me.

273
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,652
You're trying to prove
that you're Herman.

274
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,071
I thought you had something.
I thought you were special.

275
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,689
Just do the "C," Robbins.
I'll keep him alive.

276
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,631
I thought you would be
better and in less time.

277
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,983
But today? Today,
you embarrassed me.

278
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,537
Excising the tumor.
Gonna need lots of kellies.

279
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,123
Robbins, listen to
me. Do the right thing.

280
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,302
Deliver this child.

281
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,087
I don't have time
for you to catch up...

282
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,521
I've given you
every last second...

283
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't have time
for three strikes.

284
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,942
Something like this
happens again, you're out.

285
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,260
If Herman were here,
she'd tell you the same...

286
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:03,818
Stop it right now!

287
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,554
You're right, Dr. Bailey.
I am not Dr. Herman.

288
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,190
I am Dr. Robbins, and I
am the fetal surgeon here.

289
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:11,842
And I have chosen
to do this procedure,

290
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,206
and there was a point at which
you could no longer be on board,

291
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,930
but that point is long gone.

292
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,678
I am in the middle
of a woman's uterus.

293
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,534
And any slip I might make could
result in catastrophic blood loss.

294
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:23,570
And, and if I slip, it will be because
you were screaming in my ear

295
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,656
and not because I don't
know what I'm doing.

296
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,175
You either need to get
on board and shut up,

297
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,884
or you need to get the hell out.

298
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,547
I mean, she sounds
like Dr. Herman.

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,447
She hasn't moved a
muscle in 15 minutes.

300
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,833
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

301
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,512
But her game face is slipping.

302
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,003
Yeah, maybe I should... April.

303
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:59,172
I'm-I'm not working. I'm-I'm
just... I'm not ready to work yet.

304
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,243
No, no, no, it's fine. I'm
just... I'm glad to see you.

305
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:03,777
I'm just gonna sit.

306
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,813
Dr. Herman was with
me on my worst day.

307
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,199
I just wanted to
be with her for hers.

308
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,152
How's this going?

309
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,057
Uh, she's trying to
dissect around the fornix.

310
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,303
But she still has
a long way to go.

311
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,487
So, why are they not operating?

312
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,560
Dr. Shepherd.

313
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,147
If I go any further posteriorly,

314
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,049
I violate the hypothalamus.

315
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,468
If I take a lateral
approach, I hit the carotids.

316
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,171
If I go inferiorly and I
wreck her optic apparatus...

317
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,607
You could... I am lost here.

318
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,255
I am lost in the forest.
There is no clear path.

319
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,606
Just pick a path,
and you will be fine.

320
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,132
I am trying to find a way to
keep her whole, Edwards.

321
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:01,518
I can't move without
letting a piece of her go.

322
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,538
Dr. Shepherd.

323
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,206
Dr. Webber. What do you need?

324
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,776
I thought I could help,
maybe be a sounding board.

325
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:13,085
We could work through
whatever it is you're stuck on.

326
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,289
Kill the intercom, please.

327
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,226
Dr. Webber, step
over here, please.

328
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,352
Edwards, would you
mind taking a step back?

329
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,294
You can be a big help.

330
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,849
I need you to call my brother.

331
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,952
Tell him he needs
to get on a plane.

332
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,619
He's in D.C.,

333
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,117
so, if he goes now, he could be
here in, what, six hours, seven?

334
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,835
I'm not sure that's
the best idea.

335
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,976
I am in over my head.

336
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,313
I made a mistake.

337
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,215
I took on an impossible task,

338
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,033
and my hubris
is going to kill her.

339
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:11,755
Please. Get him on the phone.

340
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,324
Get him on a plane.

341
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,127
Get him here.

342
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,545
Now.

343
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,530
This is taking way too long.

344
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,748
Uh, Mom needs increased
ventilatory support.

345
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,400
Robbins, come on.
The baby's right there.

346
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:31,369
I've got this. Let me have
him. Ligating the last artery.

347
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,457
We've lost the fetal pulse.
Is the cord compressed?

348
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,961
No. He's in cardiac arrest.

349
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,651
Put your hands
under him just like this.

350
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,204
Good. Now apply
pressure on the wound.

351
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,872
Harder. He won't break, okay?

352
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,274
Just hold him there
and keep his chest up.

353
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,037
Good, good,
good. Just like that.

354
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,557
All right, push five micrograms
of epi while I start compressions.

355
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,981
Oh, dear Lord.

356
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,282
Careful.

357
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,570
You know what you're doing.

358
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,889
Please just call him.

359
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,236
I'm not even halfway through.
If I can't get past this step...

360
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,094
You have it in your head
that he's better than you.

361
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,829
But it isn't true.

362
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,965
I've seen him standing
exactly where you are now,

363
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,252
staring at an impossible
spinal tumor, terrified,

364
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,054
unsure where to go next.

365
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,256
I know that tumor.

366
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,493
He's got it hanging
on their bedroom wall.

367
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,123
A drawing, not the actual tumor.

368
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,129
He found a way. Yes.

369
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,549
Which is why I need him here.

370
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,618
Shepherd,

371
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,904
I can tell you right now what
would happen if I called your brother.

372
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,357
He would hop on a plane, and
seven or eight hours from now,

373
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,660
if she hadn't already herniated,

374
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,212
Derek would come in here

375
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,096
and he would take this surgery,

376
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,616
your surgery, away from you.

377
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,452
Then he would kill her.

378
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,605
Because this is your plan.

379
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:53,385
He wouldn't know where
you've already been

380
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,925
or where you need to go next.

381
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:59,847
You are on your own
here. No one can help you.

382
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,016
And you do not need them to.

383
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,487
He's not here. You are.

384
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,006
Now, what's next?

385
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,631
Robbins, he's not coming back.

386
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,999
Karev, shut your damn mouth.

387
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,423
It's okay. It's okay.

388
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,625
Come on, baby. Oh, come on.

389
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,621
You can let go now, Bailey.

390
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,155
It's time to put him back in.

391
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:43,424
Uh, uh...

392
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,761
He's not even... I
held him in my hands.

393
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,566
He's not even born, and
I held him in my hands.

394
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,218
I know that feeling.

395
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,653
It's privilege,

396
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,906
great privilege.

397
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:15,723
Navigation probe.

398
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,725
Edwards, you're on.

399
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,795
Intercom, please.

400
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,783
Dr. Shepherd is identifying

401
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:30,237
the lamina terminalis so that she
can go around the commissure,

402
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:33,273
laterally dissecting away
from the perforated arteries.

403
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,492
Bipolars.

404
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,904
Can you avoid
splitting the fornix?

405
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,244
I sure as hell hope so.

406
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,645
So far, so good.

407
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,898
Keep going. Find your way out.

408
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,258
How you feeling, Edwards?

409
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,793
Good. I'm good.

410
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,173
You sure? I can try and find
someone if you need a break.

411
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,209
Nope. You're not gonna
find a better assist than me.

412
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,632
I earned this spot.

413
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,334
If Dr. Shepherd
is here, I am here.

414
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,687
This is the point of no return.

415
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,489
Once we start
this, we don't stop

416
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,173
until the last of
this tumor is gone.

417
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,460
Are you ready?

418
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,228
Are you? Smartass.

419
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,131
Here we go.

420
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,440
Glenda's not out of the woods,

421
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,929
but her numbers were
definitely improving.

422
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:19,519
I'm gonna head up to the
ICU and keep an eye on her.

423
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,716
You did good, Robbins.

424
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,368
I wasn't trying to
pick a fight in there.

425
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,258
It's just, from where
I was standing...

426
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,390
Six months ago, I would
have picked the same fight.

427
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,813
For what it's worth,

428
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,083
Herman picked the right
person to pass the torch to.

429
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,052
She's not passing anything.

430
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,754
She hasn't gone anywhere.

431
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:22,916
I think...

432
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:26,353
I cleared the optic nerve.

433
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,727
There. That wasn't so hard.

434
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,997
No comments from
the peanut gallery.

435
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,066
Okay. We are going
radioactive, folks.

436
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,168
Let's get this room turned over.

437
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,804
All non-essential
personnel, hit the street.

438
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,658
Non-essential means
you, Dr. Webber.

439
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,328
I appreciate you coming
down here. You have no idea.

440
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,930
I'm happy to stay.

441
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,300
Edwards and I have it
from here. Right, Edwards?

442
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,070
Edwards?

443
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:02,806
Whoa! Oh.

444
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,553
I'll get the O2. Hold her head.

445
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,643
Or maybe you could scrub in.

446
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,085
All she has to do now is
place her radioactive seeds.

447
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,220
They'll kill whatever
tumor cells are left behind

448
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,467
and keep them from coming back.

449
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,492
I'm happy to help. I'm
just saying, "Why me?"

450
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,944
She needs an assist who she
doesn't have to worry about.

451
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,612
And if I remember correctly,

452
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,509
you were this close
to specializing in neuro.

453
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,611
Well, I haven't been that
resident in a very long time.

454
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,101
Have her back.

455
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,451
She just needs to feel
you're there. She'll do the rest.

456
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,291
Damn it! Damn it!

457
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,710
I just got here.

458
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,390
I haven't had a chance
to screw anything up yet.

459
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,391
I need to be able to place
these seeds precisely

460
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,027
if I'm gonna prevent
the tumor from recurring.

461
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,851
I had a pre-op map to
help identify my landmarks.

462
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,405
But with a tumor this big,
everything will move after you resect,

463
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,418
like a mudslide
or an earthquake.

464
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,675
Yeah.

465
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,877
I didn't count on this
much intracranial shift.

466
00:24:56,946 --> 00:25:00,313
I'm gonna have to use the
ultrasound to map out the shift

467
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:03,266
and then morph it back
into the pre-op plan.

468
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,359
Okay, so you're pretty
much eyeballing it.

469
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,053
Yeah, pretty much.

470
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,322
Sounds like a plan. Let's do it.

471
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,787
How long have they been at it?

472
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,245
Six minutes.

473
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,724
They've only placed three seeds.

474
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,025
Even with the
gloves and the vests,

475
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,860
they can only be exposed
to that level of radiation

476
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,984
for, what, another 20 minutes?

477
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,214
She needs to move faster.

478
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:24,805
I need to move faster.

479
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,902
These gloves are so thick,
I can't feel what I'm doing.

480
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,936
You're doing
fine. It's not a race.

481
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,710
Except that it is.

482
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:38,529
Amelia, what are you doing?

483
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:39,831
Shepherd, what are you doing?

484
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,316
It's so much easier like this.

485
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,834
You're exposing
yourself to direct radiation.

486
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:45,178
You need to put that
glove back on right now.

487
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,645
Amelia. It's fine.

488
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,448
I got it. I got it.

489
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:12,797
Robbins, you're not gonna hear
this from me too often, so savor it.

490
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,888
You did very,
very well in there.

491
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,758
Oh, I'm so touched, I could cry.

492
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,428
Ugh, I am exhausted.

493
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,215
You'd think a tumor would give
you extra energy or something.

494
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,416
Mmm, I wouldn't.

495
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,017
Mmm, maybe not.

496
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,436
Here.

497
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,473
We're getting down to it,
Robbins. The final stretch.

498
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,660
After those dozen
cards, that's it, we're done.

499
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,430
You'll have completed
a yearlong fellowship

500
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,031
in less than six months,

501
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
and I'll have kicked the bucket.

502
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,119
Don't.

503
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,983
I knew I picked the right
horse when I picked you.

504
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,908
Yeah, please don't
call me a horse.

505
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,477
It really is an accomplishment.

506
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,964
Not just to do it, but to become
as good as you have become.

507
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,467
It's a real exercise
in perseverance.

508
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,846
Really something to be proud of.

509
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,486
Thank you.

510
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,274
I'm not talking about
you. I'm talking about me.

511
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:10,878
You were a complete
disaster when we started.

512
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:14,248
But I persevered, and
after all of my hard work,

513
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,583
you are actually
becoming a fetal surgeon.

514
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:18,535
I deserve a medal.

515
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:21,254
Arizona?

516
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:24,658
Hey.

517
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,678
You okay?

518
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:29,747
Yeah.

519
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,382
I heard you flew solo tonight.

520
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:32,766
I did.

521
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,067
How did it go?

522
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:35,302
Great.

523
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,355
That's... Congratulations.

524
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,741
Thank you.

525
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:45,445
I looked for you in
Shepherd's gallery.

526
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:48,332
She's still at it if
you want to head up.

527
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,483
I can't go up there.

528
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:51,818
Okay.

529
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:55,505
I want to, but I can't
watch. I just can't.

530
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,524
Over the past four months,

531
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,205
that woman beat
the hell out of me,

532
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,662
trying to shove every
piece of knowledge

533
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,199
and experience into
my head, and she did.

534
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,118
It's there, all of it.

535
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:13,107
She's in my head.

536
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,379
But I'm...

537
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,515
I'm not ready for my head to be

538
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,550
the only place that she exists.

539
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,522
Grey, stop her.

540
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,390
She needs to put that
glove back on right now.

541
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:53,574
She's almost done.

542
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,343
She has a 20-minute
window. It's only been 15.

543
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,928
Without the glove, she's
cutting her exposure time in half.

544
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,764
She's over her limit. Shepherd!

545
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,816
Hunt, if I don't place these
seeds, the tumor recurs,

546
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,367
and everything I have done
for her counts for nothing.

547
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:04,969
You're gonna make yourself sick.

548
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,838
Amelia, he's right. The
tumor could recur anyway.

549
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:08,128
But it won't be because of me.

550
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,058
Shepherd, put on the glove!

551
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,281
Amelia.

552
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,475
Done. I'm done.

553
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,262
Get this gear out of here,
bring back the troops.

554
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,566
It's time to close.

555
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,555
That was... Really dumb?

556
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,886
No, badass.

557
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,814
Hey.

558
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,328
Um, I've got a post-op abdominal-wall
reconstruction in the ICU.

559
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,681
Do you mind if I run up and check
on him before we head home?

560
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,825
Yeah, sure. I'll
just... I'll hang here.

561
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,458
I'll be fine. Go.

562
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:55,625
Okay.

563
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,623
Hey, you've been out for hours.

564
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:27,757
God.

565
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,794
Wait, what?

566
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:35,365
Congratulations, Dr. Edwards.
You were in surgery 13 straight hours.

567
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,884
Doesn't really happen anymore
with hospital regulations.

568
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:39,230
Your class doesn't get a chance

569
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,448
to build up that
kind of stamina.

570
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,638
I missed it? It's over?

571
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,839
Oh, no, no. It's not over.

572
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,207
They-they're still closing.

573
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,658
No. Uh...

574
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:48,829
Now, you... You lay back.
Let me get you some water.

575
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:00,606
Pickups.

576
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,011
Juice.

577
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,401
Thank you.

578
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,620
How are you doing?

579
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,257
Just need to get the dura
closed with a watertight seal.

580
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,209
This is the easy part.

581
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,688
Which anyone else can do,

582
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,213
so why not let
someone else take this?

583
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:26,282
Dr. Shepherd, I'm
here. I'm-I-I'm back.

584
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,871
I'm good to go. Just please
tell me it's not too late.

585
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:38,311
No, Edwards. You're just in
time. You can finish closing.

586
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,313
Really?

587
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:43,349
You started this with
me. You should finish it.

588
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,654
Don't let Edwards
screw up the stitch, okay?

589
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,600
I don't want Herman
seeing a big ugly scar

590
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,304
every time she
looks in the mirror.

591
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,476
Not a problem.

592
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,016
Hey, Glenda. You
just about ready to go?

593
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,996
Oh, my God. So ready.

594
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,155
And no offense, but I am so
done looking at this boring room.

595
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,356
Well, enjoy the fresh
air while you can.

596
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,426
I will see you in a month
for your post-op checkup.

597
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:37,463
In the meantime, rest.
Take it easy, eat well.

598
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:39,999
Thank you so much.

599
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,601
Well, don't hug me.

600
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,937
Dr. Robbins saved both
your life and your son's.

601
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:55,782
Um, I don't know if you guys
can tell me, but how's Dr. Herman?

602
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:20,239
<i>Dr. Shepherd is identifying
the lamina terminalis</i>

603
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,642
<i>so that she can go
around the commissure.</i>

604
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,379
Stop. Go home.

605
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:28,181
I need to figure this out.

606
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,850
No, you need to take a break.

607
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,958
There's no swelling, no edema.

608
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,616
I don't know why
she's not awake.

609
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,056
It could be any
number of reasons.

610
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,835
Don't tell me what it could be.

611
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,979
Don't you think I know every
possible thing it could be?

612
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,466
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,386
I just need...

614
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,904
I know.

615
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,341
You need it to be over.

616
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:58,377
I need her to wake up.

617
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,221
Is that...

618
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,758
What?

619
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,696
I don't know. It's
probably nothing. It's tiny.

620
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,899
What?

621
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:26,937
Is that a small lacunar
infarct right there?

622
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:30,843
Did she have a stroke?

623
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,654
Good work, Edwards.

624
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,893
She's gonna wake up.

625
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,629
She might.

626
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,633
But if she doesn't,

627
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,969
I'm gonna have to
make some decisions.

628
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,518
And you did this for Mark.

629
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,123
I did.

630
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,961
But you're not
gonna have to, okay?

631
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,467
I can't do this by myself.

632
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:31,938
I can't make that call.

633
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,693
And I know what she wants.

634
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,564
But I don't think that
I can make that call.

635
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,032
Hey.

636
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,802
Hey, you are not
by yourself, okay?

637
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,193
You're not alone,
do you hear me?

638
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,466
It's okay.

639
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:20,720
Oh.

640
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:25,491
Nicole.

641
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,093
Mmm, Mommy?

642
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,280
Is that you, Mommy?

643
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,338
God, I'm fine.

644
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:39,772
I'm fine.

645
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,225
Do you know where you are?

646
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,710
The same place I always am.

647
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,111
What's your name?

648
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,063
Uh, that hasn't changed, either.

649
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,353
Squeeze my finger.
Good. And here.

650
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:59,275
Good. Gross motor
functions intact.

651
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,244
Follow the light, okay?

652
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,472
How are you feeling? Shh...

653
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:11,738
It's all right. It's
okay. I'm okay.

654
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:16,225
You got it all, didn't you?
Edwards, did she get all of it?

655
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,596
Yeah. She got all of it.

656
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:24,016
Hey, no crying in
here. Crybabies out.

657
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,073
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Webber.

658
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,226
Gentlemen, looking good.

659
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,375
So are you.

660
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,662
So far, so good.

661
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,980
Oh, we're glad to hear it.

662
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,883
Dr. Shepherd did an amazing job.

663
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:42,351
Yeah, yeah. I brought the tumor.

664
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,788
That made her look pretty good.

665
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,297
Give us a second, would you?
Robbins and I have some work.

666
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:52,144
Yeah. Why don't we step
outside, give them a moment?

667
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,431
I will be back soon. We
will need a full work-up.

668
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,548
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:57,450
Good to have you back.

670
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,385
Tell me about Glenda Castillo.

671
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,507
Um...

672
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,693
Glenda is recovering well,
and, uh, she's still pregnant.

673
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,580
The baby's doing well, too.

674
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,333
I knew I picked the right horse.

675
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,101
Please stop calling me a horse.

676
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,570
I knew it. I knew you
would not let me down.

677
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,372
I had no doubt.

678
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,461
Can you see anything?

679
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:28,681
Anything at all?

680
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:34,187
No. Nothing.

681
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:35,672
Completely blind.

682
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,707
You better not be crying.

683
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:44,981
I'm not.

684
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,221
Are you all right?

685
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,794
I don't know. It'll
take a while to sink in.

686
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:01,164
I don't think you're gonna want
to be around me when it does.

687
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,966
That will be ugly.

688
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,669
I will be. If you
want me to, I'll...

689
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,806
You're missing the point.
You're so thick, Robbins.

690
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,475
You're always just
to the left of the point.

691
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,062
The point is I'm going
to get to figure it out.

692
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,748
Something is going
to happen next.

693
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,538
The point is I'm alive.

694
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:33,479
And I wouldn't be if you hadn't
been such a pain in my ass.

695
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,195
I picked the right horse.

696
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:04,944
<i>Why do we even try when
the barriers are so high</i>

697
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:07,780
<i>and the odds are so low?</i>

698
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,929
<i>Why don't we just
pack it in and go home?</i>

699
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,369
<i>It'd be so, so much easier.</i>

700
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,474
<i>It's because, in the end,</i>

701
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,276
<i>there's no glory in easy.</i>

702
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,828
We were so close.

703
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,297
We were more
than close, Edwards.

704
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:27,467
Dr. Herman lost her
sight to her tumor.

705
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:30,203
We took revenge on
the tumor by killing it,

706
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:32,805
by tearing it out
and decimating it

707
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:36,575
and decreasing its odds
of killing Nicole by 100%,

708
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:40,013
by sending death
running like a crying bitch,

709
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,792
by telling death
to screw himself.

710
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,299
That is the battle.

711
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,678
And it is the only
battle worth fighting.

712
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,520
You should be on
a high right now.

713
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,667
And you should be chasing
that high for the rest of your life.

714
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,508
You defeated death.

715
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,941
Mere mortals cannot
do that. Only we can.

716
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,799
<i>No one remembers easy.</i>

717
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,968
Only superheroes.

718
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:06,572
<i>They remember the
blood and the bones</i>

719
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,375
<i>and the long,
agonizing fight to the top.</i>

720
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,477
Only freaking superheroes.

721
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,964
<i>And that is how you become...</i>

722
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,902
<i>legendary.</i>
