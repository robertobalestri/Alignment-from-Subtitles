1
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>On an operating table,</i>

2
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:11,860
<i>a person is at his most
vulnerable, naked, exposed.</i>

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,862
I do not need another sister.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,130
Get out.

5
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,532
I mean, she's a lying liar.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,881
I would know if my mother
were pregnant when I was five.

7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,036
My mother was not
pregnant when I was five.

8
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,471
Get out.

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,933
She's, like, psycho,
like a stalker.

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,117
I'm being stalked. Alex,
this is criminal. I mean, you...

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,427
What's your problem?

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,861
Get out! I'm naked here!

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,265
Okay, so what? I've seen it
before. No big deal. I'm in crisis.

14
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,568
Okay, fine.

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:40,038
Your junk is spectacular.
Jo is a very lucky girl.

16
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,074
Can we get back to me now?

17
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,642
Why are you making that face?

18
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,928
Mer, I realize that I said I
would take over as your person.

19
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:48,830
Maybe that means I
have to buy your tampons

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,743
and act like your husband's
hair is special and crap.

21
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:53,535
But I have a very important
presentation to make to the board today

22
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:57,372
to get a job, which I need
because I got fired by Dr. Butthole!

23
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,492
I have been practicing all
night. I am sleep-deprived.

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,794
I need to shower.
Alone. And focus.

25
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,193
You didn't even
hear what I said.

26
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:08,049
No. And I don't care.

27
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,081
The new cardio chief thinks
she's my biological sister.

28
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,037
She what? Wait.

29
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,190
What? That's insane.

30
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,558
Thank you.

31
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,176
He's in the shower,

32
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,290
and she's in the bathroom
with him while he's in the shower.

33
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,596
So, go in there with them.

34
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,116
No! I am not going in there.

35
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,425
You're the girlfriend.

36
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,646
No. Yeah, I am, but I'm not.

37
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,737
They're this little
team together.

38
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,072
They are war
buddies, and I don't fit.

39
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,174
And then they look at
me... Well, she looks at me

40
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,577
like I'm just the stupid,
naked girl in Alex's bed.

41
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,480
So go be the stupid,
naked girl in Alex's shower.

42
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,948
I am a doctor.

43
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,134
I am a surgeon. I
deserve respect.

44
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,747
You're a girl in her pajamas with
her ear to the door of a bathroom.

45
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,650
How much respect can
anyone give you right now?

46
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,423
She stole my Alex.

47
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:50,036
You know what? I
miss Cristina Yang.

48
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,978
When Cristina Yang was
here, nobody stole my Alex.

49
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,886
Oh, my God. You're
scared of Meredith Grey.

50
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,349
No, I'm not. Are you? No.

51
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,254
Hey.

52
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,888
Hi, Dr. Grey.

53
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,739
Tell Alex I'll be downstairs.

54
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:14,983
And if anybody
asks you, I am sick.

55
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,254
<i>Skin is not a very tough
armor. It's soft, easily broken.</i>

56
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,972
Okay, I'm only here
to give a speech

57
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,635
on residual limb
health, and that is it.

58
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,259
That is it.

59
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:25,738
Yeah, I got to pull back, okay?

60
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:28,441
We have a kid. Arizona
is starting a fellowship.

61
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:30,243
We're trying to
have another kid.

62
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,011
I am stretched out far too thin.

63
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:33,301
I completely understand.

64
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,736
I said no already.

65
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,839
I know that. You're just gonna
meet a couple guys. Come on.

66
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,680
Navy SEALs, Green
Berets, Army Rangers.

67
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,117
Wounded warriors from the
most badass specialized ops forces

68
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,551
in the U.S. Military.

69
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,674
But you're too busy to help
our nation's heroes, so...

70
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,512
I do not like you.

71
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,213
Then I directed the RFA needle

72
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,081
to where the blood
supply entered

73
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,916
the abnormal
parabiotic tissue mass.

74
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,719
To interrupt the blood
flow to the abnormal fetus.

75
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:16,177
Yes. Then I removed
excess amniotic fluid.

76
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,546
Nice. And then she
delivered full-term?

77
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,615
She did,

78
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:23,529
months after I completed the
operation that I'm telling you about.

79
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,698
Why are you not taking notes?

80
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,289
Oh. Sorry. I thought we
were just, you know, talking.

81
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,438
And I thought you
were my fellow.

82
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,228
I am. Completely.

83
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,363
No, I'm so excited
to be your fellow.

84
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,666
I just need a little
time to get up to speed,

85
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,918
you know, like four...

86
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,352
Three weeks.

87
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,816
Yeah, 'cause I have
a lot of cases on my...

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,056
Dr. Robbins, for the
purposes of this fellowship,

89
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,492
we are not peers.

90
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,862
And four weeks is 10% of
the average gestational age.

91
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,171
In that amount of time,

92
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,050
a fetus's lungs become
a fully-functioning organ.

93
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,452
Everything in utero
happens at hyper speed.

94
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,721
And the sooner you get
up to that speed, the better.

95
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,691
Get a notepad.

96
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,447
Avery, I've got a
backlog of some cases.

97
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,060
Amy's doing a
great job, but there's

98
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,545
some stuff I got
to get on top of.

99
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,986
So, you need help?

100
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,316
I need you to reschedule
this meeting for tonight.

101
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,173
No.

102
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:19,685
Oh. Are we rescheduling
the meeting? If so, thank God,

103
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,187
because Callie and I have
an appointment tonight,

104
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,455
and apparently, I've
already started my fellowship.

105
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,622
We are not
rescheduling the meeting.

106
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,946
Tomorrow work for you?

107
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,248
No, tomorrow's bad. Thursday?

108
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,599
Listen to me speak, all right?

109
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,468
We are voting on a new
member of the board.

110
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,638
It's happening
tonight. Understood?

111
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,839
Derek!

112
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,320
Derek, why is there
suddenly an order

113
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,122
for carbamazepine in
Eric Schneider's chart?

114
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,706
He needed a good
anti-convulsant.

115
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,842
Mmm-hmm. And I had already
written him one for valproic acid.

116
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,983
You can't go around
writing orders on my patients.

117
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,597
I'm doing my job.

118
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,122
No, you are doing my job.

119
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,606
I am chief of neurosurgery.

120
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,075
If you have a problem with that,

121
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,521
you should take it
up with the board.

122
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,828
Until then, I will call
you when I need you.

123
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:02,117
What happened to the two
diverting loop ileostomies I had today?

124
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,718
You're welcome.

125
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:07,155
I rearranged your cases so
you had the easiest day possible.

126
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,724
You are going up against
Karev, so I figured you'd want

127
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,637
plenty of time to practice
your board presentation.

128
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,074
I don't need to practice. I need
my schedule back the way it was.

129
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:15,630
You sure, though?

130
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,043
Karev's pretty tight with
some board members.

131
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,666
So am I.

132
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,613
Well, Meredith Grey was in the
bathroom with Karev this morning.

133
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,282
Well, not that tight.
That's what I'm saying.

134
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,771
Look, Edwards...

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,391
I am going to walk in
there and tell the truth.

136
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:27,943
I deserve this.

137
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,762
And if any one of them has
the misguided impression

138
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,776
that there is any choice
at all in this matter,

139
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,668
I will set that person
on the righteous path

140
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,605
before he or she can
reveal him or herself

141
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,556
as a moron.

142
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,428
Oh. Pileup on I-5.
Trauma coming in.

143
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,982
Hey, why are they paging
me? Isn't Grey on the pit today?

144
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,901
She's sick.

145
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,805
If my mother were
pregnant, I would have known.

146
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,840
Adoption agency made a mistake?

147
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,221
And randomly put the name
"Ellis Grey" on a birth certificate?

148
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:04,278
I don't think so. Pierce
has got to want something.

149
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,467
Maybe she thinks
there's money to inherit.

150
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:09,300
Oh. The only thing you inherit
in this family is Alzheimer's.

151
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,102
Whoa. Dark.

152
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,671
Good one, though, huh? Yeah.

153
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,423
She's not my sister.

154
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,103
You know who you
should ask about this?

155
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,454
The guy who was banging
your mom back then.

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,718
I'm not asking Richard Webber.

157
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,457
All I'm saying is, he's
got skin in the game.

158
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,081
Disgusting.

159
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,444
He's the only living person
who would know if it's true.

160
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,534
Richard Webber is like
a second father to me,

161
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,121
and if he knew that I had
a sister, he would tell me.

162
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,070
Paged to the ER?

163
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,904
Yes. You?

164
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,339
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,044
Sounds big.

166
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,127
Mmm-hmm.

167
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,125
I told her last night.

168
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,822
Oh.

169
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,558
How'd it go?

170
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,822
Could have gone better.

171
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,610
Give me some room,
please. Everyone...

172
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,861
What the hell is this?

173
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,717
What's going on?

174
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,137
37-year-old male
rear-ended a lumber truck.

175
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,167
Anyone who is not
treating this patient,

176
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,091
please move out of the way.

177
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,636
Hey! You heard the woman.

178
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,079
This is not a spectacle
for your amusement.

179
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,830
Holy...

180
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,060
Cool! Edwards!

181
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,084
I'm sorry.

182
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,032
Get a close-up! What?

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,992
No way!

184
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,846
<i>Is that really a branch?</i>

185
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,739
We need to get this man on
his back in less than 60 seconds.

186
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,040
Got to work faster.

187
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,737
One more inch to the
right, he'd be D.O.A.

188
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:58,881
How you want to proceed?

189
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,372
Ultrasound's negative
for fluid around the heart,

190
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,507
so I would do a laparotomy.

191
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,580
Yeah?

192
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,666
His airway is compromised.

193
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,852
He needs a chest
tube and intubation now.

194
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,398
Yeah, we're almost
done here, okay?

195
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,166
It'll be safer on his
back. No, there's no time.

196
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,468
I'll have to go in
nasally. 7-0 ET Tube?

197
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,608
Here you go.

198
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,121
Charlie, I hate
to tell you this,

199
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,989
but your day is actually
about to get a little worse.

200
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,013
Hold the work!

201
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,383
Hold on, Charlie.

202
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,162
Hold on. Almost
there. All right.

203
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,269
Okay. Go ahead.

204
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,764
Okay, push 100
of propofol, please.

205
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,225
Pushing.

206
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,545
22 to go.

207
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,951
Well done, Doctor. Sorry?

208
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,047
I said, "Very good!"

209
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,372
Uh, okay. He's clear.

210
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,207
On his back on my count.

211
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,094
One, two, and three.

212
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,032
You want to give me a
robot leg, like the Terminator?

213
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,551
Robotic, more like the
Six Million Dollar Man.

214
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,531
Uh, actually, it costs
a little more than that.

215
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,322
But the project is fully funded,

216
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,274
all expenses paid.
The leg will be free.

217
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,694
A free $6 million robot leg?

218
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,599
Listen. I've been through
three prosthetic legs.

219
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,567
Each one hurt
more than the last.

220
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,652
Why is this so...

221
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,956
Well, the leg is
entirely painless.

222
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,609
Free, pain-free robot leg?

223
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,296
Sounds made up.

224
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,963
It was made up, by Dr. Torres.

225
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,650
It is cutting-edge technology.
Dr. Torres is a genius.

226
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,796
You'll be amazed at this...

227
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,898
Okay, let's just slow
down for a minute.

228
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,200
We still have to run
a number of tests

229
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,624
to make sure you're even
a candidate for the study.

230
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,661
But, again, the
program is fully funded.

231
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,029
Unbelievable.

232
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,596
Major Hunt was right.

233
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,305
He's been going
on and on about you.

234
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,068
Yeah, I bet.

235
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,989
I told him how busy
I am. He knows.

236
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,935
He knows my plate is
full. He just doesn't care.

237
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,192
I am an attending with an
entire service of my own.

238
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,595
Herman and I have shared
dozens of patients before.

239
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,064
Oh, and now he's just bringing
this guy to my lab, right?

240
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,745
Like I'm gonna say no to a guy
who gave up his leg for our country.

241
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,837
She has me reviewing
journals and doing skills labs.

242
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,672
I have a case report
that's due by 4:00.

243
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,442
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I have a
neuroblastoma to remove at 4:00.

244
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,212
Wait.

245
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,658
Is this your way of telling
me that you're canceling

246
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,026
our meeting with the
surrogacy agency tonight?

247
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,101
What? No! No. I
will figure that out.

248
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,610
Okay. I just...

249
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,538
Say something to help me.

250
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:28,159
You own a hospital. You
are raising a beautiful girl.

251
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,844
You save babies. You're
gonna save more, right?

252
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,125
You can do this, too.
If anyone can, you can.

253
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,866
Oh.

254
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,452
Oh, okay.

255
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,321
Um, listen, I will meet you at the
agency with a smile on my face.

256
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,630
And we will get
ourselves a new baby.

257
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:45,705
A.B.C.'s intact.

258
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,896
I need to assess his GCS.

259
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,204
If you'd be quiet,
he's trying to talk now.

260
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,311
Sir, can you tell me your
name? What's your name?

261
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,502
Steve. Forget your
helmet today, Steve?

262
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,648
Ahh, it hurts.

263
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:56,982
I'm giving you
something for the pain.

264
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,251
You might start
to feel sleepy now.

265
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,652
It's a depressed skull fracture.

266
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,043
It is pretty deep.
We're gonna need a CT.

267
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,679
And because of the
position, probably an angio.

268
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,093
I can make that decision if
you'll give me room to look.

269
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,594
Amy, I don't think
he's gonna make it,

270
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,585
and it's gonna get
ugly, so let me do it.

271
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,331
Ah. Because only
you can save him now.

272
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,921
Screw you. I've got him.

273
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,640
Maybe you can both take
him, like a team, or a family.

274
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,830
I have him. Kepner, you'll
assist. Let's take him up to CT.

275
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,749
The African outreach
program has given 34 kids

276
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,146
excellent outcomes and a
chance they never would have had.

277
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,902
And it gave me something, too.

278
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,205
Starting that program gave
me a sense of ownership

279
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,719
and a level of passion that
I didn't know I could have.

280
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,621
I have this passion
for this hospital.

281
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,045
I look forward to... Mer. Huh?

282
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,380
Yeah, it's great.

283
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,544
You're gonna vote on this.
I don't want to blow this.

284
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,700
And it's Bailey.

285
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,670
Bailey did deliver my
baby and save my life.

286
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,799
What have you ever done?

287
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,183
Why aren't you
at your own house,

288
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,568
drinking and having
bitch baby tears

289
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,392
about your fake sister
with your husband?

290
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,635
Derek doesn't know.

291
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,613
He doesn't know?

292
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,415
I can't talk to him right now.

293
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,117
Come on. He gave
up the job in DC.

294
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,785
He's staying, and
you're still mad?

295
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,670
You won. No.

296
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:06,491
I never asked him to stay.
This wasn't a compromise.

297
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,576
I didn't win. He
forfeited, so we both lost.

298
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,146
So you're not talking to him?

299
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:14,577
He's walking around
like he's a martyr,

300
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,951
waiting for me to be
grateful. I am not grateful.

301
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,621
My career is just
as important as his.

302
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,525
I'm the sun. I'm the sun.

303
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,927
And he can go suck it!

304
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,116
I'm the sun.

305
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,015
All right. We're done.

306
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,650
Hey!

307
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,596
You can sit here and get
drunk and then vomit and cry,

308
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,398
and I can never get any
prep for my presentation done,

309
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,856
or we can do
something about this.

310
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,485
You want to do
something about this?

311
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,710
It's so light.

312
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,213
It's a 100% titanium
body and 13 sensors.

313
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,060
But before we can get
you in a leg like this,

314
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:51,786
we need your muscles and
nerves to interface with the sensors.

315
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,566
So, this
electromyogram will show

316
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,234
spikes when your
muscles contract

317
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,269
and then go flat
when they rest, okay?

318
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,653
All right. Go ahead
and flex for me, Jeff.

319
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,796
When this is done,
I get to keep it?

320
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,637
Well, it's all funded,
including follow-up, so...

321
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,106
Yes.

322
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,108
Sorry. I know how that sounds.

323
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,994
It's just, all I wanted was
to be a Ranger, you know?

324
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,180
I still dream about
it all the time.

325
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:22,049
Pack on my back,
running, my team.

326
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,846
Then I wake up
and get out of bed.

327
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,254
I try to stand, and
I forget about it.

328
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:30,124
So, you know, when
you say "free robot leg,"

329
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:33,827
I think I'm still dreaming
of running with the guys.

330
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,325
Jeff, are you still flexing?

331
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,999
Yeah.

332
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,561
Can I take a
picture of it? Yeah.

333
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,868
My mom is gonna freak.

334
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,787
Jeff, flex harder for me.

335
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,061
What?

336
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,239
I should be seeing readings.

337
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,158
What's going on?

338
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,482
Uh, we're just having
trouble with the EMG.

339
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,236
No, no. It's not the EMG.

340
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,971
Jeff, I'm...

341
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,519
Dr. Torres, can I talk
to you for a moment?

342
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,141
Excuse us, Jeff.

343
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:06,939
That was inappropriate.
Inappropriate?

344
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,075
You were about to
reject him from the study.

345
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,565
Yes. You saw those readings.

346
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,417
Look, the way his
amputation was performed,

347
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,580
there's no way this will work.

348
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,204
Okay, it's a crappy
amputation, Owen.

349
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,872
Probably because it was done
in less-than-ideal circumstances.

350
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,181
He is a soldier, Callie.

351
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:21,442
I know that, okay?

352
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,110
I feel bad about
that, all right?

353
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,713
I care about that. I really do.
You know who doesn't care?

354
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,493
You know who doesn't give
a damn about his service?

355
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:28,933
The robot leg.

356
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,679
All the robot leg cares about
is that the nerves in his leg

357
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,181
aren't communicating
with his muscles,

358
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,482
which means they
can't communicate

359
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,650
with the sensors
in the prosthesis,

360
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,051
which means the
robot leg won't work.

361
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,471
Then you can find a way
to help him. Just figure it out.

362
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,335
I'm sorry. Are you not
listening to me, Owen?

363
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,742
Are you deliberately being
obtuse? I just told you his nerves...

364
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:43,825
Just fix it.

365
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:44,883
I just told you I can't!

366
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,834
Fix it! That is an order!

367
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,770
An order? Who are
you? General Patton?

368
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,949
I'm your chief of surgery.

369
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,968
On the surgical floor,
you are my chief.

370
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,493
In my lab, funded by the money
that I procured, I am in charge!

371
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,823
Are we clear? No,

372
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,158
you don't get these
guys' hopes up

373
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,926
and then leave
them with nothing.

374
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,644
No, no, no. No, I didn't
do that, Owen. You did that.

375
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,547
You're the one out there running
your mouth at the rehab center

376
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,005
about, "Free, pain-free Six
Million Dollar Man robot legs!"

377
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,275
I'm about to go in there and
crush his dreams because of you.

378
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,958
We're gonna pull on
my count. We ready?

379
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,927
One,

380
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,295
two,

381
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,363
three.

382
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,464
Easy.

383
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,134
Easy.

384
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,153
Okay, Kelly clamp.

385
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,042
Apply pressure. Got it.

386
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,129
More suction. I
need to see or feel.

387
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,246
Okay. MAGGIE: Whoa.

388
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,515
That's got to be the fastest
splenectomy I've ever seen.

389
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,967
Yeah, this isn't my first rodeo.

390
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,751
I'm hope I'm that fast someday.

391
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,525
You will be.

392
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,778
In about 4,000 rodeos.

393
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:14,389
So, I hear you and Hunt had
a little episode in the hallway.

394
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,592
He told on me.

395
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,239
You can write me up all
you want for insubordination,

396
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:21,874
but I stand by the
fact that I do not

397
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,476
take orders
regarding my own lab.

398
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,032
And Hunt can kiss my...

399
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,769
I'm not asking you to
take orders in your own lab.

400
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:30,438
What I'm asking is maybe that
you not have a screaming match

401
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:31,884
in the middle of the
hallways of the hospital,

402
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,675
because when members
of the board cause a scene,

403
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,345
I have to stop practicing
medicine, which I love doing,

404
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,793
and become a hall monitor,
which I don't really love doing.

405
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,650
I got to come down
here and lecture

406
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,451
you about
responsibility and honor

407
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,531
and crap I really don't want
to be lecturing you about.

408
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,151
You know, I'm down to three
procedures a day, okay, if I'm lucky?

409
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,142
Not even long procedures.

410
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,678
I'm sucking fat, lifting boobs,
butts. Butt implants are huge.

411
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,514
I just want a good,
intense, smart surgery.

412
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,950
You know, like the ones
where your feet hurt,

413
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,164
where your feet hurt because
you've been on them for hours.

414
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,689
Or your mind hurts because
you've had to improvise and paint.

415
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,957
Surgeries of joy.

416
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,244
But no, I can't have those,
'cause I run the board.

417
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:13,630
Grey calls in sick. Your wife tries
to give up peds surgery on me.

418
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,377
And boy Shepherd's
in a pissing match

419
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,785
with girl Shepherd,
which they won't admit.

420
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,537
And Yang screws us
with Bailey versus Karev.

421
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,651
And I think Richard has the
hots for the new cardio god,

422
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,408
Maggie or whatever?

423
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,921
Which is gross,
'cause she is 12.

424
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,156
So, now you and Hunt are running

425
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,490
around screaming at each other?

426
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,748
I don't get to be a
surgeon. I'm a hall monitor.

427
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,351
I will stop screaming
in the hallways.

428
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,257
All right, what's wrong?

429
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,702
Hunt's got this bug up his butt

430
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,862
about a candidate for
my robotic limb project,

431
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,608
and as much as he
wants it to happen,

432
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,477
those nerves are not
communicating with those muscles,

433
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,467
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

434
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,988
I can.

435
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,722
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

436
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,392
I create an alternate traffic
route for the nerve signals.

437
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,589
It's like, if there's
construction on the highway,

438
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,179
you pick a side street, right?

439
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,481
I can dissect a nerve
at its current location

440
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,984
and rewire it
wherever you need it.

441
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,135
Connection established.

442
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,000
You are wasted
as a hall monitor.

443
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,224
I know!

444
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,678
Well, I am done here.

445
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:19,413
Lung crisis averted.

446
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,594
Okay. Partial gastrectomy
and splenectomy done.

447
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,819
We can start the
diaphragm repair.

448
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,756
This was, I have to say, the most
fun I have had since I got here.

449
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:31,937
Well, you've done
some very good work.

450
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,761
Me? You. That was amazing.

451
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,831
What was that? A
15-second splenectomy?

452
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,699
Well, 20.

453
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:41,802
Eighteen. I might have
stolen a peek at the clock.

454
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,305
Well, it was inspiring.
I'm glad I was here.

455
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,174
Thank you all. I will
check on him in post-op.

456
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,802
The bowels seem to be intact,

457
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,978
but we're gonna run
it again just to be sure.

458
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,563
Bailey, you have this?

459
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,064
Indeed, we do.

460
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,200
I need your username
and password.

461
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,418
This is illegal.

462
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,154
We're just logging
into the hospital system.

463
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,303
To get Maggie
Pierce's personnel file

464
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,437
to get her date of
birth, which is illegal.

465
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,205
Yeah, so is pretending
to be someone you're not.

466
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,213
Now, put in your password.

467
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,509
Once we figure out
when she was born,

468
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,011
there's got to be
something we can use

469
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,612
to prove that your mom
wasn't pregnant at the time.

470
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,436
You know, photos or
a video or something.

471
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,339
You can call Pierce's bluff.

472
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,268
You're a very different
person than Cristina.

473
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,270
Cristina and I would
just be dancing by now.

474
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,395
Yeah. I know.

475
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,775
Here we go. Look at that.

476
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,284
Pierce's birthday,
November 22, 1983.

477
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,198
So, basically, your mom
would have been knocked up

478
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,521
around spring of '83.

479
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,741
What was going on
in the spring of '83?

480
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,544
What?

481
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,713
That's when she
tried to kill herself.

482
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,836
So, that's done.

483
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,072
Maybe you want to
practice your speech on me.

484
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,642
Or maybe I want to focus on making
sure Mr. Hays is stable post-op.

485
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,743
But Karev...

486
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,046
Okay, Edwards, I
am afraid of snakes.

487
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,216
I'm afraid of large spiders.

488
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,364
And while it might
not be rational,

489
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,152
I am occasionally afraid

490
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,989
there might be a shark waiting
for me in a public swimming pool.

491
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,670
Why would there be a
shark waiting for you...

492
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,343
I said it wasn't rational. I
am afraid of those things.

493
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:33,730
What I am not afraid
of is Alex Karev.

494
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,700
You shouldn't be. You should
be afraid of everyone else.

495
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,971
Say more.

496
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,372
Alex Karev is the closest thing

497
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,718
Meredith Grey has to a brother.

498
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,224
He lives in her old house.

499
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,355
He started a program that
brought a daughter into her life.

500
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,647
Robbins is Karev's mentor.
Torres is married to Robbins.

501
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,248
So, whoo! Team Karev.

502
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,551
Jackson Avery,
friend of Alex Karev.

503
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,185
We used to double-date.

504
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,138
Speaking of which, Avery has a
history of making wrong choices.

505
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,831
Oh. Hey, Dr. Herman.

506
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,610
Sorry I don't have that
case report in to you yet.

507
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,651
I've got this
neuroblastoma on this baby,

508
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,021
and the mom got really overreactive,
and so I had to reassure her.

509
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,208
Dr. Robbins, in fetal
surgery, every patient you treat

510
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,538
will come encased in a mother,

511
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:21,406
a mother whose
heightened state of concern

512
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,782
is a biological and
evolutionary necessity.

513
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,127
If you lack the
basic skills to...

514
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,969
No, I don't. I don't. No. No.

515
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,758
Moms are kind of like my
thing. I'm great with moms.

516
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,886
I actually teach other people
how to be great with moms.

517
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,392
Yeah. No. You can ask anyone.

518
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,927
I need your start paperwork.

519
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,363
Right. I just need to
get caught up on that.

520
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,933
I am great with moms!

521
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,852
I know!

522
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,021
It was right after that
she moved us to Boston.

523
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,958
I mean, I was five. All my
memories of Boston are so hazy.

524
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:54,027
Do you remember your
mom getting suddenly fat,

525
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,279
then suddenly not fat?

526
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,559
Alex, that whole
time was just a blur.

527
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,644
Everything that happened
after she tried to kill herself

528
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,001
was just a blur for me.

529
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,214
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

530
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,548
Let's just keep
working on your speech.

531
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,838
I'm not working on my speech.

532
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,517
I'm going through the
emergency room admits

533
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,337
for Seattle Grace
in June of 1983.

534
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,660
What? How?

535
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,196
We computerized
this, like, two years ago.

536
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,231
How are you on the
board and I'm not?

537
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,460
Wait. Right there.

538
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,501
There it is.

539
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,180
Well, don't click on
it, because I'm not...

540
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,371
I'm not sure I'm
ready to see this.

541
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
Are you ever
ready for this stuff?

542
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:30,214
"Patient admitted with wrist
lacerations and loss of blood."

543
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:31,523
Scroll down. Scroll down.

544
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:34,568
Beta-HCG came back positive.

545
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,086
She was pregnant.

546
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,306
Look in the notes.

547
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,275
"Advised patient of pregnancy.

548
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:45,612
"Patient was unaware of
pregnancy when admitted."

549
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,665
She's my sister.

550
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,472
I owe you an apology.

551
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,296
Were you going to give me
one, or is this just a heads-up?

552
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,368
I'm sorry, okay? We're okay?

553
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,703
No! Come back here!

554
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,049
Come back and
say a bunch of crap

555
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,684
to make me understand
why you were yelling at me

556
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,626
and giving me orders and
generally being a big old ass.

557
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,012
No, we're not okay.

558
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,207
I need something to be...

559
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,944
Good. To...

560
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,897
I need something to feel right.

561
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,366
Okay, I'm not depressed.

562
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,769
I'm not... My
heart is not broken.

563
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,270
I'm not grieving.

564
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,574
She's not dead. She's out there.

565
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,310
She's living out her dreams,
and I know she's happy,

566
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,913
and that makes me
feel proud for her.

567
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,568
But there is this other feeling

568
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:02,139
that doesn't completely
feel fair or right or good.

569
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:09,246
She goes on, day in and
day out, happy, without me.

570
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,851
But every morning, I
wake up, and there's this pit,

571
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,721
this feeling here that...

572
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,757
Maybe my dreams are over.

573
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,694
Maybe I had my dreams
and they're over now.

574
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,699
And I'm gonna
be this single guy.

575
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,068
No wife, no kids, no family.

576
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,674
She was my family.

577
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:44,814
And now she's someplace
else, and I let her go,

578
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:49,186
and it's good that I did. I
mean, it's better for her.

579
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,920
But for me...

580
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,361
So I need something to be good.

581
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,407
I need a reason to
get up every morning,

582
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,698
to not crawl back into that cave

583
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,933
that I was in before I met her.

584
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,171
I mean, you know she saved me?

585
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,716
You were there. You
remember how I was.

586
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,774
I was...

587
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,776
Dark.

588
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,611
That war made me dark.

589
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,082
And that darkness,
it is still in me.

590
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,051
She just lit it up.

591
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,225
So, I just thought,

592
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,127
maybe to beat back that
darkness, I would do some good.

593
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,398
I'd just do something good.

594
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,534
I'd go be with those
guys who'd remind me...

595
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,005
I just need
something to be good.

596
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,178
That's why I dragged
you to that rehab center.

597
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,248
That's why I, um...

598
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,583
Wanted you to help.

599
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,452
That's why I pushed
too hard, and that's it.

600
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,532
I'm not gonna talk
about it anymore, okay?

601
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,423
So, just say that we're okay.

602
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,518
Okay? Okay.

603
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:01,619
Great. Owen?

604
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,909
For God's sakes, Callie.

605
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,613
No, I was just gonna
ask if you wanted to...

606
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:09,082
I was just gonna ask if you
wanted to watch Jeff's surgery.

607
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,054
Jackson's doing a little
targeted muscle reinnervation.

608
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,172
He's moving the nerves to where

609
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,208
they can talk to
the robot sensors.

610
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,945
Want to watch?

611
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,616
How's our motorcycle guy?

612
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,619
My motorcycle guy? I
fixed him, like a boss.

613
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,221
Like your boss, actually.

614
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,024
Amy, you're an excellent
surgeon. You have nothing to prove.

615
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,759
Oh, I know I don't.

616
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,423
But if you try and fight me over
the leadership of this department,

617
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:41,081
you will lose. My resume
will kick your resume's ass.

618
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,649
I am better than you.

619
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,646
Oh, my God, Derek. There
is no limit to your narcissist...

620
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,988
I have been playing this game
longer than you at a much higher level.

621
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,289
That is all there is to it.

622
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,541
Bite me.

623
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,773
Where did she go? Dr. Shepherd?

624
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,031
I'm Dr. Shepherd.

625
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,576
Yeah, I know. Ms. Dr. Shepherd.

626
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,677
Her post-op CTs are back.

627
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,513
Let me see them. I shouldn't.

628
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,370
Kepner, I am Dr. Shepherd.

629
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,774
Uh, so, we repaired
the subdural bleed, but...

630
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:09,076
That is a big aneurysm.

631
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,857
Yeah. It's grown. It's way
bigger than it was before.

632
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,814
Okay, book an OR. And scrub in.

633
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,123
Okay. I'll let her know.

634
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:17,263
No, with me, Kepner. You're
gonna scrub in with me.

635
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,535
It's her patient.

636
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:20,120
Well, it just got
too big for her.

637
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:24,991
Tell her or don't tell her.
Just prep an OR. And scrub in.

638
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,010
Okay. So, now what
are you gonna do?

639
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,712
Go talk to her?

640
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,381
Well, I called Richard,
and he's coming over.

641
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,783
Is that okay?

642
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,084
Yeah, sure.

643
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,319
It's just, you know...

644
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,988
We've got this
board meeting thing,

645
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,338
and I don't want to rush
you, but I got to go get ready,

646
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,619
and you got to be
at this meeting, too.

647
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,678
Alex, you're prepared.
Your speech is great.

648
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,746
Why are you so...

649
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,580
Because I want this, Mer.

650
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,966
You know? I don't
just need a job.

651
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,279
Yang thought I could
do something bigger,

652
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,704
and for the first time,
I feel like I can, too.

653
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,240
You know, I feel
like I should really...

654
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,209
Like I have something to offer.

655
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,811
And I'm scared to death,

656
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,080
and I don't want it to
go like crap, all right?

657
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:07,984
Take all the time you need.

658
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:20,981
Thank you.

659
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,112
When did you know?

660
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,075
I found out the night
I met Maggie Pierce.

661
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,889
You didn't know?
Ellis didn't tell you?

662
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,963
Believe me, don't you think...

663
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,232
When Pierce asked
about your mother,

664
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,968
I felt like I was
being hit by a car.

665
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,270
And when she asked about you...

666
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,905
I...

667
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,474
When was that?

668
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,277
The night of the mass casualty,

669
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:52,479
the mall explosion.

670
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,931
That was a week ago.

671
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,901
So, you knew I had a sister
and you had a daughter,

672
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,352
and you didn't tell me?

673
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,690
You didn't tell her. I tried.

674
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,270
What the hell is wrong with you?

675
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,876
Don't you think I want to?

676
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,595
I tried. I tried again today.

677
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,091
Well, when are you
planning on doing it?

678
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,649
I would have liked
to do it 30 years ago!

679
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,152
I would like to
have been a father!

680
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,905
To know my child!

681
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,940
To have a say!

682
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,683
But your mother stole
that chance from me.

683
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:38,057
Gown and glove me.

684
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,193
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!

685
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,273
Suction. Amy, you
don't have to scrub in.

686
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:43,774
I want to be sterile
when I come over there

687
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,042
and stick that
bovie in your eye.

688
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,761
Kepner, move! You're on my list.

689
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,052
You have put me
in an awful position.

690
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,373
Amy, he never had
a good prognosis.

691
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:56,927
I went endovascularly
to fix the aneurysm,

692
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,129
but he starting
re-bleeding. I can see that.

693
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,830
Fibrin glue.

694
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,643
Now, why is that
suction not working?

695
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,245
Okay, can somebody
change the canister?

696
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,452
Got it.

697
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,899
Amy... I see it.

698
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:10,407
One hundred of mannitol,
125 of Solu-Medrol.

699
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,394
He's gonna herniate. He
may not have time to herniate.

700
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,730
He's in florid DIC. He's
not clotting anymore.

701
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,965
Knox, check his pupils.

702
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:23,119
Fixed and dilated.
There's no gag reflex.

703
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,628
He's probably
already brain-dead.

704
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,526
The next thing I heard, she
had moved you to Boston.

705
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,730
She never said a thing to
me about being pregnant.

706
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,798
I had no choice in the matter.

707
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,735
She knew, and she left.

708
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,504
I'm sorry.

709
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,622
It's just...

710
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,925
We had an amazing day today.

711
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,631
And she's someone I'd
very much like to know.

712
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,594
So, she came here
looking for answers

713
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,685
about her biological mother.

714
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,788
You are her answer.
You have to tell her.

715
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,857
Don't make her wait.

716
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,286
I mean, Ellis made the decision
for you. Don't do that to Pierce.

717
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,134
So, you're re-routing the deep
peroneal with the biceps femoris?

718
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,203
Exactly.

719
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,671
You know, if you
made this process

720
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,005
part of the initial amputation,

721
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,090
you could cut out the
second surgery altogether.

722
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,958
Ha! Yeah. Add what?

723
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:21,172
Two, three minutes
to the initial surgery?

724
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:24,114
That could make a world of
difference. That's a great idea, actually.

725
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:25,882
Thanks.

726
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,619
Avery, did I mention
that Hunt and I

727
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,527
are starting a special
project with veterans?

728
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,835
We are? We are.

729
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,159
We are taking a chunk
of my research money

730
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,112
and focusing it on
prosthetics for vets.

731
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,764
Free, pain-free, right?

732
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,082
Right. Right.

733
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,851
That sounds great.

734
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:47,053
That is good for the
hospital. Good work, guys.

735
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,955
You want in?

736
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:52,359
I mean, unless you're too busy
with butt implants, hall monitoring.

737
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,461
Yeah, well, I guess
you would benefit

738
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:57,597
from having a good plastics
guy who knows nerves.

739
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,032
Ew.

740
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,350
Ew. That was so weak.

741
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,529
Did you see him
trying to pretend

742
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,831
he already had friends
on the playground?

743
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:04,032
Yeah, don't pretend that you

744
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,299
have friends on the playground.

745
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,568
Aw. He tried to be cool.

746
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,252
Don't try to be cool. It's sad.

747
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,354
Don't try to be cool.

748
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:10,794
Shut up.

749
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,769
Adding on this reinnervation, it
revolutionizes the whole thing.

750
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,840
I mean, the potential for control
these patients can have is...

751
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,274
It's incredible.

752
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,372
I mean, I could change the
way the world does amputations.

753
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,907
Sounds like you
really want to do this.

754
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:31,514
I do. I do!

755
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,217
And I know it'll
take so much time,

756
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,302
and we'll be
stretched so, so thin.

757
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,611
But I really think that...

758
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,005
So, wait.

759
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:41,434
So, are you saying that maybe
we should wait on this baby?

760
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,211
What? No. No, no.
Why would you say that?

761
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,964
No. Because you just said it
was gonna be too much to juggle.

762
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,477
And you're supposed to
say, "It's not a problem.

763
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,103
"You can do it, Callie.
We can do it all."

764
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:55,516
You're supposed to support me
the way that I've been supporting you

765
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,068
ever since you decided you
needed to start this fellowship.

766
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,793
But what if we can't?

767
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,530
I mean, what if we can't
do anything and everything?

768
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,734
Are you saying
you don't want to...

769
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,030
Are you saying you
don't want a baby?

770
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,166
'Cause, then, what
are we doing here?

771
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,666
Why are we
meeting with this lady

772
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,469
who's gonna help us find
someone to help us make a baby

773
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,703
if you don't want a baby?

774
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,793
Don't put words in my
mouth. This was my idea.

775
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,790
Yeah, but you
don't want to carry it,

776
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:22,159
and then I couldn't, and
you still didn't want to carry it,

777
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,251
and then we find this,

778
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,896
and then you find something else
to do. Oh, my God. It's so obvious.

779
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,454
I can't believe it.

780
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,823
Say it.

781
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:33,173
Just say the words.
You don't want a baby.

782
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,963
Hi.

783
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,636
35-Year-old male admitted status

784
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:45,905
post-ejection from a
motorcycle without a helmet.

785
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,074
Head CT revealed...

786
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,230
What?

787
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,698
I'll do the op note if you want.

788
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,028
You gonna steal this part, too?

789
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,713
Stealing? No, I'm
just trying to help.

790
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,671
This guy was a lost cause.

791
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,207
Whether he was or wasn't,
he was my responsibility,

792
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,419
and I didn't need your help,

793
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,044
and I don't need any
more of your bullying.

794
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,680
Bullying? I am
trying to be nice.

795
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,315
Look, I get it!

796
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,535
You were king of all neurosurgeons,
right hand to the president.

797
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:17,304
And now you can't have that,

798
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:20,723
so you need to be king of the
hospital and kick around the peons.

799
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,904
You of all people
should understand

800
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,894
that this was the
future of neuroscience.

801
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,841
I mean, this is what we
would've dreamt of in med school

802
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,144
if we'd thought it was even
possible that it could be done.

803
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,648
Then you shouldn't
have given it up.

804
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,703
But the least you can do is
stop stomping around here

805
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,172
punishing people for
a choice you made.

806
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,408
I didn't make a choice.

807
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:42,011
Meredith made a choice
and backed me into a corner.

808
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,381
And because I love my
kids and I love my wife

809
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,562
and I want to do what's
best for her... I do.

810
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,119
I want to give her everything.

811
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,587
But something like
this will not come again.

812
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,458
This is it. This
is as high as I go.

813
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,131
I have never taken a step
back in my career ever.

814
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,245
I've never felt like this before,
and I feel like she forced me.

815
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,202
Okay, well, I know the feeling,

816
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,254
because it is happening
to me right now.

817
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,839
I'm not trying to...

818
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,342
No, I know that you're not
trying to, but you are, Derek!

819
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,959
You are doing it to me.

820
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,273
And Meredith, you say that
you want her to have everything,

821
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,359
but not if it interferes with
you having your everything.

822
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,717
And it is not fair, and
I am saying no, too,

823
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,919
because you have to live
with the choices you make.

824
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,021
I am trying to.

825
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,175
I am trying.

826
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:33,613
I know.

827
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,482
We're all trying.

828
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,106
It's just, no one
wants to give up.

829
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,841
Or give in.

830
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,645
And no one should.

831
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,516
Right?

832
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,397
Hey, time for the board meeting.

833
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,566
Hmm. Okay.

834
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,318
How's our masterpiece doing?

835
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,048
- Good. He's good.
- Great. You coming?

836
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,422
Yeah, no, I'm just
gonna be a minute.

837
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,124
I'm just reviewing his chart.

838
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:19,804
Want to make sure
everything's perfect

839
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:22,762
since they are gonna be
teaching this in med schools.

840
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,409
I know, right? It's crazy.

841
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,183
Yeah.

842
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,351
Let's go.

843
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,532
I'll make sure that
she gets there.

844
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,355
All right, fine. Don't be late.

845
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,758
And actually, the three of us,
we should, you know, meet,

846
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,666
get together, talk
about timelines, protocol.

847
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,322
Yeah, I'll fill you in
on the funding stuff,

848
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,386
and we'll figure out
a subject pipeline.

849
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,081
Okay.

850
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:46,820
You okay?

851
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,356
Yeah. I just...

852
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:55,039
I need something
to be good, too.

853
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,691
Okay.

854
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,260
All right.

855
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,646
How sobby do I look? One to 10.

856
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,148
Hmm...

857
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:16,699
Six.

858
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,802
Okay.

859
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,907
So, how'd it go today?

860
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,620
Did Meredith help
you with your speech?

861
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,943
Oh. Not really.

862
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,856
If this doesn't work out, I
hear RadioShack's hiring.

863
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,146
She must have helped some.

864
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,959
I mean, you guys were at
the house together all day.

865
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,794
Yeah, well, she's got
a lot of stuff going on.

866
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,818
Do I have pit stains?

867
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,947
What kind of stuff?

868
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,753
Oh, nothing. Don't
worry about it.

869
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,222
You sure I look okay?

870
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,124
Yeah. You look great.

871
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,712
Dr. Karev.

872
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,047
Dr. Bailey.

873
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,377
I'll tell them
you're on your way.

874
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,107
Pierce?

875
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,375
Hey! Dr. Webber!

876
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,071
Did you check in on
our impalement patient?

877
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,227
He is doing great!

878
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,562
I need to tell you something.

879
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,799
I should have told you sooner.

880
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:40,900
Okay.

881
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,711
Ellis Grey and I
knew each other.

882
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,041
Very well.

883
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:50,805
We had a relationship...

884
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,829
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Stop talking.

885
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,733
It's funny, but that is
the first thing I thought

886
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,669
when we first spoke and you told
me that you'd known my mother.

887
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,620
I thought, "What if it's him?"

888
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,756
But then you
never said anything.

889
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:06,054
And then days went by, and
you still never said anything,

890
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:09,628
so I thought it couldn't
possibly be true,

891
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,265
because what kind of person
would do something like that?

892
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,968
Would let me sit there
and talk like an idiot

893
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,869
and never speak up?

894
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,738
No one decent. No one honest.

895
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,908
A coward.

896
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:28,314
The only reason that you
would do something like that...

897
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:31,383
Is if you'd known
about me all along

898
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,768
and never wanted me, either.

899
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,231
No. No, that's not
true. That's not...

900
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,621
Why should I believe you?

901
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,570
Why should I believe
a word you say to me?

902
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,321
Well, this must've been
a nightmare for you,

903
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,379
me showing up here like this.

904
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,084
Don't worry, it has
been worse for me.

905
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,239
Good night, Dr. Webber.

906
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,361
<i>Surgeons are bred
to be invulnerable.</i>

907
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,998
<i>It's very hard to
lay ourselves bare.</i>

908
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:04,667
Hey. How are you feeling?

909
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,936
Hey. Uh, not great. Weird day.

910
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,938
You don't have a
fever. You still sick?

911
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,324
No, I wasn't sick. I am
a little drunk, though.

912
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,522
You're drunk? Yes.
I was at Alex's...

913
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,392
Okay, Meredith, you got to
help me. I'm trying to understand.

914
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,382
Okay, listen, this crazy
thing is happening...

915
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,862
You said you had to stay here
to make the most of your career.

916
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,351
Just listen to me.

917
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,148
Wait, so, I gave up the
brain mapping initiative

918
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,516
so you can play hooky and
get drunk with your friends?

919
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,940
This is why we're
staying in Seattle?

920
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,511
<i>Because we know exactly
how deep some injuries can go.</i>

921
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:53,365
<i>But vulnerability isn't
the opposite of strength.</i>

922
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,937
<i>It's a necessary part.</i>

923
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,377
<i>We have to force
ourselves to open up,</i>

924
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,249
<i>to expose ourselves,</i>

925
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,220
<i>to offer up everything we have</i>

926
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:23,046
<i>and just pray that
it's good enough.</i>

927
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:25,782
I'm sure you did fine.

928
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,736
Sure are taking a long time.

929
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,408
Alex?

930
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:53,876
<i>Otherwise, we'll never succeed.</i>

931
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,586
Congratulations.

932
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,688
I... Wait. Karev?

933
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,757
Bailey?

934
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,912
Hey! There she is.

935
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:16,465
Hey. Congratulations.

936
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,414
Oh, my...
