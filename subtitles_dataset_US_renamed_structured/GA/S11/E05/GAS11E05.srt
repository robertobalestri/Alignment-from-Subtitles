1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,015
<i>Uncontrollable bleeding.</i>

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,404
<i>Acidosis.</i>

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,107
<i>Cold.</i>

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,326
<i>We all know what the
combination means.</i>

5
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:14,396
<i>We call it the triad of death,</i>

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:18,116
<i>the point of no return.</i>

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,530
We've been talking about
having another baby for months!

8
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,797
We were excited!

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,299
We were discussing
freaking names!

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,901
Why would you do that,
just to get my hopes up?

11
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,942
You're attacking me for
something that I never even said!

12
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,639
You didn't have to say anything!

13
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,508
It's clear from everything that
you do that you don't want this.

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,343
Why start training
all over again?

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,378
You're an amazing
pediatric surgeon.

16
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,946
People cross the country just
to have you operate on their kids.

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,252
For the last time,

18
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,050
the fellowship is advancing
my career, which is...

19
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,752
Which is not
advancing this family!

20
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>It's the moment in the OR</i>

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,522
<i>when you turn to damage control.</i>

22
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,796
Callie, actually, if I
could stop you there,

23
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,515
I'm interested to hear the
rest of Arizona's sentence.

24
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,951
Arizona, you were going to say?

25
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,203
<i>You stop.</i>

26
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:56,872
<i>You step back.</i>

27
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,925
<i>You let the body rest and
see if you can find a solution</i>

28
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,144
<i>to the chaos that's
happening inside.</i>

29
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,858
Courtney, you're doing great.
- Clamp.

30
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:06,576
Is she okay? Tell me she's okay.

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,694
Are you kidding? She's
absolutely beautiful.

32
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,597
- Isn't that right, Robbins?
- She's so beautiful.

33
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,083
We're just gonna check her
out and get her a little oxygen.

34
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,390
Lap pads.

35
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,925
All right, the
placenta, Robbins.

36
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,393
Yeah, I got it.

37
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,923
Hey, Alex, how are her sats?

38
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,440
Below 90, but
improving with bagging.

39
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:22,792
All right, let's get
her ready to go.

40
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,294
Robbins, the baby is
no longer your patient.

41
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,400
Pay attention here.

42
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:32,523
Arizona, you ready?

43
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,943
Um...

44
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,865
I love when you
talk to a patient

45
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,779
and it's like they're the only
person in the whole world.

46
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:47,205
I love... Um, you bite
your lip just a teeny bit,

47
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,443
it's barely noticeable, when you
study scans, and I find it really sexy.

48
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,313
I love when you do the voices

49
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,317
when you read to Sofia at
night and make her laugh

50
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,619
and I could listen
to that sound all day

51
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,972
for the rest of my life.

52
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,724
And you smile when you sleep,

53
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,427
like, big, like, crazy-big.

54
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,430
And I love that when I wake
up, that's the first thing I see.

55
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,278
And I love...

56
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,770
See, why... Why
don't you just... God.

57
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,290
Callie, do you want to talk about
how Arizona's words make you feel?

58
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,760
Um, well, it's
just... I just... I... I...

59
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,746
If you'd say this stuff
out loud once in a while.

60
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,698
I would if you'd let me.

61
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,233
Wait, what?

62
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,047
I was just saying them right
now, and then you cut me off,

63
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,138
I mean, you're too busy
trying to speak for me...

64
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:39,441
Okay, remember the language we
talked about using with each other.

65
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,696
I feel that you're
always cutting...

66
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,443
Well, I feel that you're
constantly accusing me of this...

67
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,060
I feel that you
just did that again.

68
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,117
She just did it again!

69
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,385
Let's try again.

70
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,201
Callie, I feel that you should
go with a primary repair.

71
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,203
I feel the artery's
missing too large a piece.

72
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,522
We'll do an interposition graft.

73
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,995
You agreed with me in pre-op.

74
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,691
Yeah, well, I changed
my mind once I got in here

75
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,865
and saw the
extent of the defect.

76
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,178
Um, finished ligating

77
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,329
the bleeders, so
we're all set up here.

78
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,452
Yeah, and I don't see

79
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,065
any more bone
fragments, Dr. Torres, so...

80
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,967
When you so quickly
disregard my medical opinion,

81
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,859
it makes me feel like you
forget that I'm a pediatric surgeon

82
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,254
who knows that
interpositional grafts

83
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,723
can cause
complications in children.

84
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,491
Well, when you
question me in the OR,

85
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,177
it makes me feel like you
don't think I can do my job.

86
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,544
We'll use a PTFE graft, Wilson.

87
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,978
Use the great
saphenous vein, Wilson.

88
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,247
We don't need any
synthetic materials.

89
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,031
Okay, fine, cut
into the kid's leg.

90
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,993
It's not about the leg.

91
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,978
It was never about the...
It goes way before the leg.

92
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:38,483
Four years ago, I received
the grant of a lifetime.

93
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,397
Going to Africa,
working in that clinic,

94
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,699
that was an opportunity that I
never thought that I would get.

95
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,934
You followed your
dream. You went.

96
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,468
But you were
supposed to go with me,

97
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,787
and you were miserable and
letting everyone know about it.

98
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,122
And so I went. I
went without you,

99
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,313
and then I came back for you.

100
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,681
I came back for you.

101
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,017
And when I came
back, you were...

102
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,100
Pregnant?

103
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,605
I'm bisexual.

104
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,885
I'm attracted to both men and
women, and it freaks her out.

105
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,041
Yes, I slept with
Mark. I got pregnant.

106
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,145
I was pregnant. And?

107
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,814
And I had no time to process it.

108
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,583
I was so in love with you,

109
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,597
I just wanted to be
with you, no matter what.

110
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,065
And if in order
to be with you...

111
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,949
If you're about to say what
I think you're about to say...

112
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,101
Let me get a word in, Callie!

113
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,557
I trapped you into a kid,

114
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,276
a kid you never wanted,
and now you're stuck.

115
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,315
Don't you ever say
that I don't love my child

116
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,917
or that I regret my child!

117
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,130
I regret that you made
a decision for me!

118
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,237
You make all the choices!

119
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,485
And every time that I try to
make a decision for myself,

120
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,253
it's like you make
me feel like the worst,

121
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,955
most selfish person
in the whole world!

122
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,745
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,774
Did I make you feel selfish when you
decided to sleep with another woman?

124
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,551
I'm so sorry.

125
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,604
That's not what I meant, and
you know that's not what I meant.

126
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,701
I meant that anytime that I try
and do something for myself,

127
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,393
you... You... J...

128
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,642
Callie, the session's
not done yet.

129
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,065
It feels pretty done.

130
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,501
No!

131
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,046
That's the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.

132
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,949
It is not a stupid idea.
She didn't mean "stupid."

133
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,967
She just said the
word "stupid," so...

134
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,287
You're talking about spending a
large portion of my grant money

135
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:14,312
on a complicated staged facial
reconstruction for one patient.

136
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,141
So, what, you want
to just reject him?

137
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,711
No, we find a way to
help him that's less stupid!

138
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,136
Okay, I'm gonna grab
lunch. Hunt, find me later.

139
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,943
What's going on?

140
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,681
It's just I keep giving
and giving and giving.

141
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,611
You're giving me things
I didn't ask for, Callie.

142
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,068
That is not true!

143
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,031
All I've done is everything
that you've asked me to do.

144
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:40,200
You asked me to not leave you

145
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,068
after the plane crash. I didn't.

146
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,937
You wanted me to stay
after you cheated on me. I did.

147
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,838
Then you wanted
a house. We got it.

148
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,641
I do everything for you,
Arizona, because I love you.

149
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,232
<i>I love you, too!</i>

150
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,961
<i>Well, and now we're
here, and I want something,</i>

151
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,963
and you can't give it to
me. You won't give it to me.

152
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,820
I never said that I
didn't want a baby!

153
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,290
The whole reason that we're here is
because of you and what you want.

154
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,459
<i>I am trying to give
you what you want,</i>

155
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,761
but you make it so hard.

156
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,574
Why can't you
commit to anything?

157
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,432
<i>I've committed the past
five years of my life to you.</i>

158
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,385
We're not getting anywhere.

159
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,730
We've circled right back

160
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,632
to where we started.

161
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:15,351
It may be time to
hit the reset button.

162
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,909
Great. Let's reset.

163
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,343
How?

164
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,113
Have you ever considered
spending some time apart?

165
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,426
Because a break can actually...

166
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,844
You mean a separation? No.

167
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,179
We're trying to save our
marriage, not destroy it.

168
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,186
I don't want to do
that. Let her finish.

169
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,670
Don't think of it
as a separation.

170
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,568
You two have gone
through so much.

171
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,036
You're completely
different people

172
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,470
than when you
first got together.

173
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,061
It can be helpful to
rediscover who you are,

174
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,008
take a break from one another.

175
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,044
Break, separation.
It's the same thing.

176
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,679
It's the first step to divorce.

177
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,581
Is this what you
want? Let her finish.

178
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,837
Look, in my experience,
couples come to therapy

179
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,540
for one of two reasons.

180
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,352
Either one person wants
out of the relationship

181
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,438
and they need
help telling the other,

182
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,863
or they both desperately
want to make it work.

183
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,509
They want to fight
to make it work.

184
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,410
Well, we want to
make it work, right?

185
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,001
Right. Right.

186
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,731
And a break is not an end.

187
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,122
A break is a tool to help make
it work, for an agreed-upon time,

188
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,357
and then we come together,

189
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,920
re-evaluate the relationship.

190
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,589
No. I don't like
it. I don't... No.

191
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,746
I think it's crazy.
I'm sorry, I do.

192
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:13,092
I mean, we're supposed
to be getting closer,

193
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,527
so, what, we need more space?

194
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,612
No, we need more
time together, not apart.

195
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,065
That's how you make
things work, right?

196
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,673
No break, right?

197
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,961
I think we should take a break.

198
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,627
How long... How long
will the break last?

199
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,457
As long as you'd like.
We decide that now.

200
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,847
Okay. Um...

201
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,066
Thirty days?

202
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,234
Thirty days? A month?

203
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,905
You need a break from
me for a whole month?

204
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,369
Arizona, you want to say
something, now is the time.

205
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,760
Callie, I was trying to be nice.

206
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,305
I don't even think
that that'd be enough.

207
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,849
I mean, if I thought
you'd go for it,

208
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,598
maybe three months, six months.

209
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,667
Oh, my God. Six months?

210
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,096
I'm trying to be honest.

211
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,721
I want to save us,

212
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,350
but the only way that I know
how to do this is by being honest.

213
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,441
This feels like a joke.

214
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,210
Or a reality show.

215
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,399
"Real lesbian
housewives MD of Seattle."

216
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,905
Fine, 30 days. How does it work?

217
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,674
<i>You have a child,
so for her sake,</i>

218
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,721
<i>you two will live in
the house as parents,</i>

219
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,913
<i>but with separate
lives, separate rooms.</i>

220
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,931
<i>Boundaries are vital.</i>

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,250
<i>Make a schedule for
child-care responsibilities,</i>

222
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,451
<i>and stick to it.</i>

223
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,588
<i>No talking,</i>

224
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:47,208
<i>no communication,
except in emergencies.</i>

225
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,877
<i>Lastly, this is important...</i>

226
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,848
<i>No intimacy, no sex,</i>

227
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,519
<i>with other people
or with each other.</i>

228
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,362
Sofia's getting dressed.

229
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,159
She also seems to be continuing

230
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,623
the purple theme she's
got going on this week.

231
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,990
Arizona, I didn't sleep at all.

232
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,172
I can't do this. It's been
one night, and, um...

233
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,350
I feel we don't need this.

234
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:32,138
How are we seriously supposed
to not talk for an entire month?

235
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,675
Just... Please, just please
look at me. I need to talk.

236
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,093
Emily, I'm sorry.
I know it hurts.

237
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,355
Hurts like a bitch.

238
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,556
Yeah, meds will kick in soon.

239
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,091
You got your arm
caught in what, again?

240
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,716
A noodle-making machine. Huh.

241
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:05,019
It's the dumbest job
ever, but it just pays well,

242
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,150
and I'm trying to get
into culinary school,

243
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,434
which is freaking expensive.

244
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,668
Looks like comminuted,

245
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,526
displaced mid-shaft
radius and ulna fractures.

246
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,113
Yep. Well, Emily, unfortunately,

247
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,592
your arm definitely
needs surgery.

248
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,416
Now, in order to
stabilize the fracture,

249
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,918
I will most likely need to put
in a plate and some screws.

250
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,787
Uh, Edwards, call up to the OR.

251
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,684
How long will it take to heal?

252
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,069
I need my arm in shape
to cook, to train for school.

253
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,787
Applications are due in a month.

254
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,746
Well, obviously, it's a pretty
bad fracture, but we will fix you up,

255
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,475
we will get you into
PT as soon as we can,

256
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,783
and you will be back at it
before you know it, okay?

257
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,285
All right.

258
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,707
Lee Franklin, one day old,

259
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,942
diagnosed with
esophageal atresia at birth.

260
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,124
Which means that his esophagus
developed in two separate pieces.

261
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,159
I'm sorry, but I thought you
said you could fix the gap.

262
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,226
When is that gonna happen?

263
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,933
Well, unfortunately,
Lee's images

264
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,935
show a longer gap
than we predicted.

265
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:57,572
It's measuring around 4
centimeters, which prevents us

266
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,452
from simply sewing the
two ends back together.

267
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:00,870
Dr. Karev can still operate.

268
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,738
It just makes the surgery a
little bit more complicated.

269
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,011
Wilson?

270
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,715
We'll attach sutures to both
ends of Lee's esophagus,

271
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,051
threading them out
through incisions in his back.

272
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,270
Every day, we'll
pull on the sutures,

273
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,073
thereby stretching the ends
inside toward each other

274
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,575
in order to connect
them in a later surgery.

275
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,778
However, for the
procedure to work,

276
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,147
we'll need Lee to
remain extremely still,

277
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,915
so we'll need to put him in
a medically induced coma.

278
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,451
I'm sorry, but, Dr. Robbins,

279
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,813
why aren't you
doing the surgery?

280
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,104
Dr. Karev is now the
attending on this case.

281
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:33,169
I have recently started a new
specialty in a different department.

282
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,128
But I can assure you, I trained
Dr. Karev, and he is awesome.

283
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,880
You have to put our
baby into a coma?

284
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,632
For how long?

285
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,202
This process could take weeks.

286
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,148
There are other surgical
options I'd love to go over...

287
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,722
But this is the
best one for Lee.

288
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,231
Dr. Robbins, can
I see you outside?

289
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,924
What was that? You're
just gonna make them worry.

290
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,948
I was thinking of doing
a colonic interposition.

291
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,283
I fix the kid in one surgery,
he can go home sooner.

292
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,097
No, using the native
esophagus is better.

293
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,199
It's a prolonged
hospital stay, but...

294
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,957
We could have him in a coma
for weeks, maybe months.

295
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,737
I mean, that'll put the
parents through hell.

296
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,239
Using the colon has
increased risks of stricture,

297
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,075
anastomotic leaks, GERD.

298
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,475
I mean, it's not fun to watch
your kid go through that, either.

299
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,744
Are you gonna let me do my job,

300
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,245
or are you gonna do it
for me the whole time?

301
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,613
Oh, crap, I'm late for rounds.

302
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,115
Okay, listen, just
do it my way, okay?

303
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,649
Fine, only because he
was once your patient

304
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,168
and because you're having
trouble cutting the strings.

305
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,352
Yeah, or because
you know that I'm right.

306
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,712
Here you go, Doctor. Thanks.

307
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,831
I sent your husband
down to the gift shop.

308
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,999
He fainted last time
we talked about needles.

309
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,562
Oh, he's such a lightweight.

310
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,987
Well, hopefully, he's
buying you some chocolate.

311
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,905
You're late.

312
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,284
I'm so sorry. Uh, I was
checking on a baby in the NICU...

313
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,409
Don't care.
Graham, start talking.

314
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,494
Jaclyn Werlein,
23 weeks along...

315
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,574
Recent fetal echo
of her baby's heart

316
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,443
unfortunately confirmed
critical aortic stenosis.

317
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,101
Today, we'll be performing
a fetal aortic valvuloplasty

318
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,202
in order to open up the
narrowed aortic valve.

319
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,489
Your BP's a little
high. You feeling okay?

320
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,207
I'm a little nervous.

321
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,870
The idea of a giant
needle going through me

322
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:00,261
and then my
baby's teeny heart...

323
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,158
There doesn't seem to
be much room for error.

324
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,898
Dr. Herman has made
us the go-to hospital

325
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,247
for fetal cardiac intervention.

326
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,422
She is the only surgeon
who even does this procedure

327
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,648
in the Pacific Northwest.

328
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,506
She's why I'm here,
to learn from her.

329
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,426
Jaclyn, I'm not even
going to insert the needle

330
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,245
until I'm sure your baby's
in the precise position

331
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,131
that he needs to be. - Okay.

332
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,328
Position is critical to success.

333
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,752
If the fetus isn't facing
forward, chest up,

334
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,748
we can't get to the
apex of the heart.

335
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,289
Perfect approach, Graham.

336
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:29,924
We have direct access now.

337
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,793
I've been practicing in the lab.

338
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:34,379
Dr. Herman, I'd
be happy to assist.

339
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,975
Graham is assisting on
this one. Watch. Take notes.

340
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,978
I've performed dozens of
percutaneous procedures on babies.

341
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,813
Were the babies still in utero?

342
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,648
Did they have hearts
the size of a walnut?

343
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,106
No. No, but...

344
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,453
Well, that's not the
same, then, is it?

345
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:51,228
Robbins, you have an impeccable
record as a pediatric surgeon.

346
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,465
As a fetal surgeon,
big, fat zero.

347
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,102
I suggest you pay close
attention to Graham's hands,

348
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,615
and next time, you can assist.

349
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,172
Well, Dr. Herman, my hands

350
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,834
are only trying
to emulate yours.

351
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:05,837
Graham, one more word,
we're gonna go over to plastics

352
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:09,414
and have your lips surgically
removed from my ass.

353
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,333
Now, shut up, everyone.
I'm deploying the balloon.

354
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,483
Oh, in case you're interested,

355
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,924
there's a model you can
practice on in the skills lab.

356
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,926
It's old, and the
rubber's hardened,

357
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,811
and it smells
gross, but have fun.

358
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,979
Thanks.

359
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,158
It took me about
two months to nail it.

360
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,298
Good luck.

361
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,203
Oh, Edwards, hey.

362
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,232
Um, are you still
on Callie's service?

363
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:37,791
No, this is the fourth time that
she has switched Sofia duty on me.

364
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,277
She said she had to practice.

365
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,723
You tell her that
her daughter's asking

366
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,191
when she's gonna
tuck her in at night,

367
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,110
and remind her that we share
custody in this stupid arrangement.

368
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,179
Okay, this really isn't something
that I feel comfortable...

369
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,403
Get out, Edwards.

370
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,907
Sorry.

371
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,442
You were saying thyroid cancer?

372
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,273
Patient is David Lasher.

373
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,213
I did a thyroidectomy on him,

374
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:01,360
and since then, he
has been cancer-free,

375
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,729
but this morning, he came
in complaining of hip pain,

376
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,569
so I did a pet scan, and...

377
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,687
Bone mets to the hip.

378
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,200
Is there any way to resect this

379
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,002
without doing a total
hip replacement?

380
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,004
No, it looks like it involves
too much of the proximal femur.

381
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:15,128
How old is David?
Thirty-three, two kids and a wife.

382
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,465
How long will a
replacement last?

383
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,199
Uh, 10, 15 years.

384
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,436
So, he'll need
another one eventually.

385
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,100
Well, yeah, but we either
resect it and do a total hip now,

386
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,791
or his cancer continues
to spread, and he dies.

387
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,338
Well, it looks like I'm
scheduling a hip replacement.

388
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,962
Yeah. Oh, no.

389
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,713
Don't schedule
it now. I have a...

390
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,114
A kid to pick up.

391
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,429
And you have to keep
a smile on your face

392
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,530
despite your spouse
barely speaking to you.

393
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,904
Totally get that.

394
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,144
Good night.

395
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,846
Sweet dreams.

396
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,518
Okay.

397
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,090
I had to look at so many places

398
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,741
to find this, but I did.

399
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:02,911
Hey, Callie.

400
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,846
Are we too loud for Sofia?

401
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,999
No, I just put her
down. I thought y...

402
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,302
I thought Arizona had to study.

403
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,223
Right, uh, talking
is against the rules.

404
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,526
Sorry. Yes, Arizona is studying.

405
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,894
I am helping her make
Jell-O moms to practice on.

406
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,597
The Jell-O is the uterus,

407
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,126
and the grapes,
tiny, little baby hearts.

408
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,550
It's the perfect surgical model.

409
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,917
You go in right here, and...

410
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,453
Neat.

411
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,523
I'm also making ambrosia
salad... Kepner family recipe.

412
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,405
<i>So, then what did you do?</i>

413
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,369
<i>I followed the rules.</i>

414
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,890
Your rules, by
the way, they suck.

415
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,017
Okay, almost there.

416
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:04,071
Just move the baby's
left shoulder down, down.

417
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,907
Okay. That's good.
Congratulations, Robbins.

418
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:10,310
That's the fastest I've ever seen
anyone flip a fetus into position.

419
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,457
Thank you, Dr. Herman.

420
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,724
So, once we get the needle in,

421
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,326
you want to do the
rest of the procedure?

422
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,470
Yes.

423
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,336
But I'm not sure I should.

424
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,298
I've only practiced a
couple times in the skills lab,

425
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,000
and I don't know
if I'm there yet.

426
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,319
Well, I'm happy to
assist if she's not ready.

427
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,826
Graham, I want you to take

428
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,390
special note of what
Robbins did there.

429
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,797
Oh, yes, ma'am. I saw it.

430
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,077
That's what being an
experienced surgeon gains you,

431
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,234
the wisdom to know
your limitations.

432
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,852
She's not gonna let
her own arrogance

433
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,148
get in the way of patient care.

434
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,412
Good call, Robbins.

435
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,574
Nice work, guys.

436
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,521
Robbins, you'll take the lead
on the next one. Be ready.

437
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,345
Of course, Dr. Herman.

438
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,681
Yes!

439
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,329
Emily, I need
you to remain still.

440
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:52,431
I thought the surgery
was supposed to fix it!

441
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:56,357
It still hurts, almost worse
than when it got caught!

442
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,709
Okay, well, you're a little
over a week post-op, Emily.

443
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,389
It's still gonna hurt from
time to time. Edwards, labs?

444
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,957
Her blood work's
completely normal.

445
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,414
The incision looks good,

446
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,427
no sign of infection, no
compartment syndrome.

447
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,152
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

448
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,121
Okay. Okay.

449
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,257
I get these shocks like
two or three times a minute,

450
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,446
and I can't do it, Dr. Torres.

451
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,131
Emily, I am so sorry.
I've run every test.

452
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,933
Nothing's coming up.

453
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,795
I'm not sure what I can do.
- Something!

454
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:26,003
You got to do
something to help me.

455
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,055
I can't live like this.

456
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:31,158
If I had known it was
gonna be like this...

457
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:35,045
Please.

458
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,888
Whoa.

459
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,006
Sorry.

460
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,691
You're good? You okay?

461
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,160
Am I good?

462
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,244
I am obviously not good.
I'm obviously not okay.

463
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,092
Why would you ask that if
you already know the answer?

464
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,065
Why not try,
"What is it, Callie?"

465
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,417
"What can I do, Callie,"
like a human person?

466
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,287
Sorry. I have my own stuff.

467
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,722
No, I'm...

468
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,423
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

469
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:07,812
I just... I have
no one to talk to.

470
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,181
You on call right now?

471
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,483
No, why?

472
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:14,751
Two more.

473
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,948
It's called an
in-home separation.

474
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,055
We live in the same house.

475
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,757
We trade off caring for Sofia.

476
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,275
We just can't talk or have sex.

477
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,038
Exactly what Derek and
I are doing, only healthy.

478
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,629
Oh. Well, cheers to that.

479
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,165
Good man in the storm.

480
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,528
What's so "good man in
the storm" about a break?

481
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,762
"How was your day, Meredith?

482
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,197
"Did you cure death
today, Meredith?

483
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,531
"When are you gonna
cure death, Meredith?"

484
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,267
Oh, God. "I could
have cured death

485
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,885
"if you let me move to D.C.
and work for the President."

486
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,859
So, I'm bisexual! So what?

487
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,262
It's a thing, and it's real.

488
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:45,166
I mean, it's called
LGBTQ for a reason.

489
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,518
There's a "B" in there, and
it doesn't mean "badass."

490
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,854
Okay, it kind of does,
but it also means bi.

491
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,590
Mmm.

492
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,509
Mmm.

493
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,023
My mom and the chief were
doing it all over the hospital.

494
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,030
Mmm-mmm. All over the hospital,

495
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,516
like me and Derek,
cheating on Addison.

496
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,451
I'm a legacy cheater. Mmm.

497
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,604
Maybe Sofia will
be a legacy cheater.

498
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,622
Everyone in this
hospital's cheated on me.

499
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:12,476
Every single person I have
ever married has cheated on me.

500
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,878
All, uh, two of them?

501
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,046
Yeah.

502
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,698
Come on.

503
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,985
Cristina was the third
rail in our marriage,

504
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,838
dangerous, fully
charged, could kill us,

505
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,685
but necessary for
us to keep going.

506
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,337
She got me. Mmm-hmm.

507
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,012
You think it's possible that my
one true love in my life is a girl?

508
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,632
Did you get excited
by her vagina?

509
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,866
No.

510
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,051
Then no.

511
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,752
Good point.

00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:46,861
<i>♪ Vagina ♪</i>

517
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,195
It's a weird word.

518
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:50,581
I think it sounds pretty.
People should say it more.

519
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,566
Oh, God, I miss sex.

520
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,568
I'm hot. My husband's an idiot.

521
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,088
Do it.

522
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,194
That might come back up.

523
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,493
Mmm.

524
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,164
So, you broke the rules.

525
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,889
No. No, we stopped.
We didn't have sex.

526
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,536
We just... We kissed
and, uh, somehow stopped.

527
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,005
I mean, she'd had that big
surgery with Dr. Herman that day,

528
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:31,365
and all I wanted to do
was ask her how it went.

529
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,167
We didn't have sex.

530
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,769
Close enough.

531
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:38,139
Well, now I wish that
we hadn't stopped. So...

532
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,407
So, what happens now?

533
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:43,005
In order for this to work, you have
to follow the rules for the full 30 days.

534
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,478
You don't mean...

535
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,387
When are you planning
on doing the anastomosis?

536
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,868
Ends will be close enough
to join in a day or two.

537
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:59,037
Latest gapogram
shows we're almost there.

538
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,488
How much are you
pulling each day?

539
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,379
Um, about 2 millimeters.

540
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,596
Oh. One's safer.

541
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,065
Why are you up here again?

542
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,534
Do you even know what I'm doing?

543
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,970
I am taking a wire
the width of a hair

544
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,456
and maneuvering it
through the mom's abdomen,

545
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,823
into the uterus,

546
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,559
and then through
the amniotic cavity,

547
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,711
and then into the
tiny fetus' chest,

548
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,248
into an insanely tiny
heart, to save a tiny human.

549
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,317
Hmm. Yay, you.

550
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,035
Hey, pull gently.

551
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,654
I am. Stop it.

552
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,433
Think about all the surgeries
I'll save you from having to do.

553
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,457
Remind me to thank you later.

554
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:31,741
Now, would you please...

555
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,171
My job's gonna make
your job obsolete.

556
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,178
Damn it. Oh, Alex, no!

557
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,031
You're saying we have to start
this whole ordeal over again?

558
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,768
Since we had to reattach
Lee's sutures in the OR,

559
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,464
it did set us back a few days.

560
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,383
But I assure you, it's a minor
complication of the technique.

561
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,173
Nothing about this is minor!

562
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:47,802
Now it sounds like you've
just made him worse!

563
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,142
Honey, maybe this...

564
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,477
She hasn't held her son once.

565
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:52,057
Do you know what
that's like for her,

566
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,292
for her to stand here and
just see him covered in tubes?

567
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:55,599
Sir, I'm very sorry.

568
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,261
You're the one who
should be apologizing.

569
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:58,530
You were supposed
to do the surgery,

570
00:23:58,554 --> 00:23:59,748
but you just
passed it off to him!

571
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,567
I assure you that Dr. Karev...

572
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:04,975
Yeah, he's very good. He's
"awesome." We remember.

573
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,911
My baby boy's chest has
now been cut into twice,

574
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,060
so you'll forgive me if I
don't share your opinion.

575
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:14,580
Alex, hey, I'm...

576
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:15,703
No, I'm sorry.

577
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,416
I'm sorry for not
telling you this sooner.

578
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,700
I never should
have let you dictate

579
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,257
a procedure I don't believe in.

580
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,943
This is my patient, this is
my service, this is my NICU.

581
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,641
And last time I checked, I was
the attending, and you were a fellow,

582
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,382
so stop overstepping, and
get the hell off my floor now!

583
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,438
This lesion is extending

584
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,357
all the way across
David's subtroch region.

585
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,741
I can't believe
he made it this far

586
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,076
without fracturing
his entire femur.

587
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,817
How's the break going?

588
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:47,984
Meredith.

589
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,786
I mean, diet.

590
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,855
How's the diet going?

591
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,947
Diet, right.

592
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,842
Uh, I'm back on track, I think.

593
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:56,927
Day 16.

594
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,278
No more late-night binges?

595
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:00,592
Well, I almost had
a, uh, cheeseburger,

596
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,799
but then I didn't, so...

597
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,051
That was rough, 'cause
I like cheeseburgers.

598
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,441
Oh, God, I miss cheeseburgers.

599
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,908
Derek wants a cheeseburger
every single night,

600
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,155
and I tell him he can't have
one till the end of the year,

601
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,913
so he should just go
and sleep on the couch.

602
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,692
Oh. You're lucky.

603
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,350
At least your diet has an
end date. Thirty days, right?

604
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,403
Imagine how good that
cheeseburger's gonna taste

605
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,234
when your diet's done. No.

606
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,258
Did I go too far?

607
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,791
No, no, no. Look, look.

608
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,020
See that inflammation?

609
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,788
The blood supply's
completely gone.

610
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,824
A total hip won't
survive in here.

611
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:36,016
Poor healing, crappy surgical
bed, his immunocompromised state.

612
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,395
It'd be infected within a week.

613
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,939
So, what do you want to do?

614
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,307
We removed the tumor
along with the necrotic bone,

615
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,309
and we completely
washed out the area.

616
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,778
It was fairly inflamed,

617
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,263
so we also placed
antibiotic-loaded cement spacers.

618
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,916
So, right now, he has no hip?

619
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,369
How can he get
out of bed or walk?

620
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,104
He can't.

621
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:59,155
That ex-fix I attached
is the only thing

622
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,202
securing his leg in place
to the rest of his body.

623
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,861
Oh, God. Why did you...

624
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,857
You said that you
do this all the time.

625
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,031
I am so sorry.

626
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,966
I didn't know how much
damage there would be

627
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,051
until we actually
opened your husband up.

628
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,380
The ex-fix is only temporary.

629
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,165
We will find a
permanent solution.

630
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:16,656
The important thing
is we got the tumor,

631
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:19,037
and we stopped it from causing
David any more problems.

632
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,677
I need to be with him.

633
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,045
Of course.

634
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:29,886
Oh, God, I'm having
the worst month.

635
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,321
I know what we need.

636
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,856
Hmm?

637
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,076
Oh, you are so smart. So smart.

638
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,822
Can't eat all of
this. Oh, no, no.

639
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,213
We'll split it.

640
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,115
Cheers.

641
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,683
Mmm.

642
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,858
Wait. What?

643
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,705
We could split it. We are.

644
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,580
No, no, no. What if
we... What if we split it?

645
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,360
If you want the whole thing,
you can have the whole thing.

646
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,184
No, the leg, for David,
the... Look, it's genius.

647
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:05,522
If we take his fibula bone
and we split it into two pieces,

648
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,758
we can use that to bridge the
gap from the tumor resection.

649
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,667
The fibula will still
have its native vessels

650
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,911
that we can attach.

651
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,325
So, you attach the pedicle
to the circumflex artery

652
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,194
and then core out
the necrotic bone?

653
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,283
You do that?

654
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,836
Works for non-unions.

655
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,248
I don't see why it
wouldn't work for a tumor.

656
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,155
And he still gets
to keep his leg?

657
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,906
Yes!

658
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,209
Okay, we're gonna
need more pickles.

659
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,988
We broke the rules again.

660
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,117
So, you had sex?

661
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:40,141
No, no.

662
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,513
<i>When she didn't come home,</i>

663
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,359
<i>I thought she was
sleeping with someone else,</i>

664
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:51,218
<i>which is against the rules,</i>

665
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:54,404
and, also, the idea
really, really bugged me.

666
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,451
And then, when I thought,
"Well, if she's not doing that,

667
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,509
"then what if she's not okay?"

668
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,544
'Cause that bugged me even more.

669
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,412
<i>So, I made her talk to me.</i>

670
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,113
So, I know that
we're not supposed to,

671
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,459
but we still live in
the same house,

672
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,923
so I know when you
don't come home.

673
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,819
Okay.

674
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,549
And I know it's none of my
business, but there's Sofia,

675
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,284
and so, you know, if something
were to happen to you,

676
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,591
I wouldn't know where you
were or who you were with.

677
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:15,943
I was here.

678
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,444
Don't.

679
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,056
Okay? 'Cause I searched
the call records for your name.

680
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,191
Oh, so, you stalked me?

681
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,215
I was worried.

682
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:23,916
I was at dinner with Grey.

683
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,396
We came up with
a fix for a patient,

684
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,631
and we came back
here to work on it.

685
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,505
With Meredith? Yes. What?

686
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,240
What, you think something...

687
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,226
I was with Meredith Grey,
and suddenly, it was 3:00 a.m.

688
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,339
I didn't want to drive home,

689
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:36,141
so I slept in an on-call room.

690
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,950
She was jealous...

691
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:44,354
Like, irrationally,
obviously jealous.

692
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,823
Do you know how that feels,
to have someone be jealous,

693
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,659
to be worried that
you're cheating?

694
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,844
It feels nice.

695
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,775
Well, it's not the healthiest...

696
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,027
No, no, no, no, no, I just mean,
she was worried about me.

697
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:57,851
She... She cared.

698
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,556
Does that mean this thing
might actually be working?

699
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,627
All right, just give
me a few minutes,

700
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,535
and I will have viable and structurally
sound bone coming your way.

701
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:18,132
There's no sign of infection
in the subtroch region,

702
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,651
so the antibiotic
spacers worked.

703
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,074
How's the blood supply?

704
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:22,960
Oh, it's freaking amazing.

705
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,373
All right, we'll use a portion of the
peroneal artery and its adjoining veins.

706
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,058
Okay, ready when you are.

707
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:28,125
All right, after I finish
the femoral canal,

708
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,629
we will incorporate the fibula

709
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,252
into a plate-and-screw
construct to span the defect.

710
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,105
And we'll do the vessel
anastomosis with an 8-0 nylon,

711
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,918
and we'll do simple,
interrupted sutures.

712
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,559
Then we will check for leaks

713
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,288
and patch any we
find with fat grafts.

714
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,772
Hopefully, we'll
have the patient

715
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,208
weight-bearing within a
couple of weeks. Any questions?

716
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:44,472
Dr. Torres. Yes?

717
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:45,727
When you're done in here,

718
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,649
they're asking that
you go down to the ER.

719
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,900
Why?

720
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,136
Push 50 of fentanyl.

721
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,921
What happened?

722
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,718
Paramedics said she ran her
car straight through a guard rail

723
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:55,403
and into a tree.
She's lucky to be alive.

724
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,526
Make it stop.

725
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,845
Let me die.
Please, make it stop.

726
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,630
Did she do it on purpose?

727
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,259
Well, can't get anything out of
her right now that makes sense.

728
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,985
Oh, God.

729
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,773
Wait, Callie.

730
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,592
What's the story with this girl?

731
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,596
I repaired her arm
fracture a month ago,

732
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,609
but she's still
in horrible pain,

733
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,361
and I can't find
anything wrong with her.

734
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,662
There's nothing wrong with her.

735
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,447
I don't know if it's
referred pain or some

736
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,832
kind of weird phantom
limb, but... Okay, listen.

737
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,316
I think she just
tried to kill herself.

738
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,985
And don't tell me it's
not my fault, because it is.

739
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,119
It's my fault.

740
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,671
It's my fault that I
can't stop the pain.

741
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:30,743
Stop.

742
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,481
There, see? You see that?

743
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,377
Those teeny things? Barely.

744
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,896
They're fluid-filled cysts.

745
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,320
Emily's arm injury ripped the
nerves from her spinal cord,

746
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:42,656
causing her to
develop spinal epilepsy.

747
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,908
Instead of having seizures,
she develops these...

748
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,476
Shocks of pain.

749
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,722
Is there any way to...

750
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:48,923
Fix it? Yeah. It's risky.

751
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,658
I have to burn the nerve
endings of her spine

752
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,811
to stop the communication
of the pain signals to her arm.

753
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,501
Oh, can you do it?

754
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:57,104
Are you kidding me?

755
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,456
So...

756
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,025
Addison Montgomery
with a toddler.

757
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,576
Oh, yeah.

758
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:06,196
Henry has completely destroyed
her white walls and carpets.

759
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,647
He's currently into drawing

760
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,817
and spilling and smearing.

761
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,397
Yeah, well, looks
like we won't see her

762
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,387
on the conference
circuit for a little while.

763
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,983
Um, I didn't know that
you knew Addison, too.

764
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,824
Did you finish rounding?

765
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,092
Yes.

766
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:20,394
Um, yeah.

767
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,539
I wanted to tell
you that Ms. Cain

768
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,495
gave consent to
her valvuloplasty.

769
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:23,708
Should I schedule it?

770
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:24,814
Yeah. Day after next.

771
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,816
And you're leading
this one, Robbins.

772
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,462
Graham will assist
and hold the needles.

773
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,486
I'll observe.

774
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:30,687
You be ready this time.

775
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,796
Yes, ma'am.

776
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,043
Did you need something else?

777
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,046
N... No.

778
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,115
Sorry.

779
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:44,450
So, Henry...

780
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,119
That's a cute name, though.
- It's cute.

781
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,205
Hey, um, how's he doing?

782
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,174
Can I see the most
recent gapogram?

783
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,563
Uh, I'm not sure that I should.

784
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,147
I'm leaving, okay?

785
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,716
It's your patient, your NICU,
your territory, so I'm gone.

786
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,706
Okay, the cord's exposed.

787
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:09,592
I'm about to send down
the radiofrequency probe.

788
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,913
I never even thought to
look past the arm, and now...

789
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:15,459
I may have blown her
chances at culinary school,

790
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,764
gotten her hooked
on pain meds, to boot.

791
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,086
It's not your fault.

792
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,087
No, this problem
goes much deeper

793
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,524
than anything you could have
seen or could have controlled.

794
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,159
It's not your fault at all.

795
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,911
Calliope. I... Shh.

796
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,194
I need... I need to practice.

797
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,494
No talking.

798
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,763
Rules.

799
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,789
Tomorrow's the last day.

800
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,392
So? Close enough, right?

801
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:33,759
Yeah.

802
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:36,296
Oh, what if she makes
us start over again?

803
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,176
So, what if we don't tell her?

804
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,499
Oh.

805
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,607
Hey, um, I just got your page.

806
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,642
I thought the Cain valvuloplasty
was scheduled for tomorrow.

807
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,266
It was.

808
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,796
Ultrasound showed
mild fetal hydrops.

809
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,730
So, not only does it
have to happen today,

810
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:01,994
it has to happen right now.

811
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,040
You ready?

812
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:08,511
Ready.

813
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,929
Needle, please?

814
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:18,555
Stop.

815
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,257
What's wrong?

816
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,871
I should be asking you that.

817
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,393
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

818
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,523
You hesitated.

819
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:26,991
You steadied your
hand. I watched you.

820
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,098
No, no, I'm fine.

821
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,644
Are you nervous? No.

822
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,284
I mean... Of course I am, but...

823
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:33,819
Why? Why are you
nervous? Are you well-rested?

824
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,121
Yes, Dr. Herman.

825
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,417
But you're prepared, right?

826
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,681
You studied the fetal echo,

827
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,037
you memorized the measurements,

828
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,310
you practiced the angles?

829
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,273
Do you know exactly
how far to insert the needle,

830
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,592
at which point to deploy
the wire, inflate the balloon?

831
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,544
I do. I think I... Do
you think, or you know?

832
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,668
I know. I know. I know!

833
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,800
Graham, trade
places with Robbins.

834
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,157
Absolutely.

835
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,359
Dr. Herman, I... It's fine.

836
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,747
We've just lost
some valuable time.

837
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,450
Hi. FEMALE DOCTOR: Hi.

838
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,714
Where you been? FEMALE
DOCTOR: Vacation.

839
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,879
Right in here is fine.

840
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,247
Oh, hi.

841
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,151
Let me just explain.

842
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,731
Do you know how many
fetal surgeons there are

843
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,266
west of the Mississippi River?

844
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,335
Five. There are five of us.

845
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,875
And I need a sixth,
Robbins, so I picked you.

846
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:32,596
Out of everyone,
I handpicked you.

847
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,945
And you are letting me down.

848
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:36,594
I'm not just questioning
your abilities.

849
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:38,368
Now I'm questioning mine.

850
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,548
I thought you had something.

851
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,150
I thought you were special.

852
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,118
You're the chief
of pediatric surgery.

853
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,453
You're a member of the board,

854
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,954
well-respected among peers.

855
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,746
I thought you would be
better and in less time.

856
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,615
But today? Today,
you embarrassed me.

857
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:56,102
Today, you were unprepared
for the second time.

858
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,048
So, I might have
to rethink this,

859
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,350
because you might not
have what it takes here.

860
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:01,819
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

861
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,521
I don't know what kind
of demons you have.

862
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:06,690
But I can tell you that you
are behind in this fellowship,

863
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:08,993
and I don't have time
for you to catch up.

864
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:12,886
I don't have time
for three strikes.

865
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:15,721
Something like this
happens again, you're out.

866
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,483
Any pain?

867
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,651
No.

868
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,220
It's all gone.

869
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,303
What about your arm?

870
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,972
Nothing.

871
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:37,344
When my car hit that tree,

872
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,892
the first thought that
came into my head was,

873
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,649
"At least it's over.
No more pain."

874
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,696
No more swallowing
a bunch of pills,

875
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,354
trying to make it stop,

876
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,356
no more crying on my couch

877
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:52,292
watching those stupid,
cheesy cooking shows,

878
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:54,505
thinking about
food I'd never make.

879
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:57,697
And, God, stop
feeling sorry for myself.

880
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,901
Thank you.

881
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:07,006
I finally feel like I might
actually survive this.

882
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:18,104
That's all you, you know.

883
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,822
Well, he's got a tough
road ahead... Months of PT...

884
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,007
But that graft should
last him for years.

885
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,954
Hopefully, this is the
beginning of the end for him.

886
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,224
So, what about you?
It's day 30, isn't it?

887
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,980
Hmm, it is.

888
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,649
Day 30.

889
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:36,336
Uh, I am... Weirdly nervous.

890
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:39,405
I mean, I feel good,
but I... I don't know.

891
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,157
It feels like coming
back from somewhere.

892
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,937
Well, even though
the diet's over,

893
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,256
I'm always up for
cheeseburgers and tequila.

894
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,312
Oh.

895
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:48,164
Actual cheeseburgers.

896
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,751
<i>Once the chaos subsides,</i>

897
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,753
<i>we have to go back...</i>

898
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,906
<i>Take another look.</i>

899
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:59,859
<i>We have to ask ourselves,</i>

900
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,848
<i>"Can this body be
put back together?"</i>

901
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,595
We were able to put Lee's
esophagus back together,

902
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,321
and I assure you,
it's stronger than ever.

903
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,357
Thank you so much.

904
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:19,162
<i>If we've done our
jobs right, it can.</i>

905
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,065
<i>We stop the bleeding.</i>

906
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:28,171
<i>We sew up the damage.</i>

907
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,473
<i>We make the body whole again.</i>

908
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,799
I understand why we did this.

909
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:43,486
You know, it was to make
us stronger, to make us better.

910
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,822
And it did. I mean, I
feel like it really did.

911
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,559
It took a long time,

912
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,695
and it was painful,
and it sucked,

913
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:57,834
but we've come a long way.

914
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,236
And I know that we
have further to go, but...

915
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,556
I love you, Calliope.

916
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,841
I love you.

917
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,512
Life without you terrifies me.

918
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,999
And the world is just
making less and less sense,

919
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:15,435
and, like, I don't know what
I'm doing at work anymore,

920
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:18,404
but the thing that I
need is my anchor.

921
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:19,989
It's you.

922
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,991
I need you.

923
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,511
And you're the only
thing that I will ever need.

924
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,882
And I'm so glad that
this break is over.

925
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:51,771
The last 30 days have
taught me so much.

926
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,385
And all I wanted when
we first came here

927
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,743
was to know that we
would leave together.

928
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,893
But from the minute I
sat down, I could feel it.

929
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:06,236
I felt like I was
gonna be suffocated.

930
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:17,663
The last several weeks,

931
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:20,599
I have laughed more,
I have done more,

932
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,037
I have enjoyed
myself more, than...

933
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,974
And I finally feel free.

934
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,964
And by being free,

935
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,768
I can see now that
constantly trying to fix us

936
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,637
is the thing that's
been killing me slowly.

937
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,921
And I don't want
to do it anymore.

938
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,712
I don't want to fix
it or fix us anymore.

939
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,237
Maybe instead of loving
you so hard, I should...

940
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,332
I should be myself for a while.

941
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:06,713
I should love me,

942
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:07,958
and you should love you,

943
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:11,351
and together we love
Sofia, rather than...

944
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:23,229
I want so much for you, Arizona.

945
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:25,831
For both of us.

946
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,937
So much more than this.

947
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,973
More than being stuck with
someone who feels stuck.

948
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,765
I want you to feel free, too.

949
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,760
<i>But no matter how hard we try...</i>

950
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,288
<i>we have to realize...</i>

951
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:14,997
<i>some things...</i>

952
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,234
<i>just can't be fixed.</i>
