00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,966
a severe misalignment of
your spine right here, okay?

181
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,384
It's supposed to look straight
like a piece of bamboo.

182
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,720
But yours is completely
bent. See that zigzag?

183
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,417
You've seen swinging
a club with this?

184
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,557
I try to tell her to
take it easy, but, uh...

185
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,171
You've been pushing
through the pain.

186
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,179
If I played football or soccer,
you wouldn't be surprised.

187
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,480
You'd be impressed.

188
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,533
I haven't lost a
tournament in four years.

189
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,247
I'm up for five athletic
scholarships at schools

190
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:30,038
none of my genius friends
can even get accepted to.

191
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,868
So what can we
do to fix her spine?

192
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,270
Well, Dr. Torres and I will
have to do a few more tests

193
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,239
before we can come
up with a plan of attack.

194
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,974
As long as it doesn't
affect my game, I'm in.

195
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,731
We will see what
we can figure out.

196
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,049
Excuse us.

197
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,350
Mmm.

198
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,030
She just kicked
you off the case?

199
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,188
No, first she bit my
head off for no reason.

200
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,834
Sometimes she
can be a little crazy,

201
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,292
and I just don't know if I'm
equipped to work under crazy!

202
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Oh, wah.

203
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,174
The new neuro-god's protegee
can't handle a little inconsistency.

204
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,241
Shut up.

205
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,810
So maybe you're not
Shepherd's protegee.

206
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,700
Maybe Herman's surgery
was a one-time thing.

207
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,914
Have you thought about
other options besides neuro?

really good about?

209
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,872
That's the problem.

210
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,573

It's okay! I've got you, Chef!

215
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,877

can see where the bleeding is!

Ahhh! My wife!

217
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,202
Here. Take this.

229
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,846
My wife! We can call your wife.

No! No!

to the severed appendage.

at a conference in San
Francisco this week.

253
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,953
I thought I'd see if
she could come up.

254
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,126
(GROANS) Is she good?

255
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,190
She's very good,
but so is Dr. McMurdo

256
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,908
in our urology department here.

257

of a successful reattachment.

knows all the techniques.

Okay, but I... All
right, everybody.

Let's give them some
room to work, okay? Let's go.

268

Have you finished
prepping the phallus?

Sort of.

278
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:13,780
I was the one who found Thomas.

279
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,682
And I went to put my
knives down at my station,

280
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,872
and there he was,
lying in a pool of blood.

281
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,136
He wasn't moving. I didn't
know, if he was alive or dead.

I ran over, and it
was so slippery,

I fell, too, and hit my face
on the damn induction range.

and injured you badly.

want to call the police.

are not because of her.

you were gonna
do general surgery?

353
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,050
Uh, I knew pretty
early on, yeah.

354
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,214
Okay, but how did you know
it was the right place for you?

355
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,016
Did you ever consider
anything else?

356
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,117
How did you choose it?

357
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,908
Well, I guess I didn't, really.

358
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,427
(SCOFFS) It chose me.

359
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,748
Uh, the patient was
a 54-year-old man.

360
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,767
A small bowel obstruction,
nothing out of the ordinary.

361
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:03,003
My attending allowed
me to resect, and...

362
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,840
That's when it happened.

363
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,509
The clamps were in,
cuts had been made.

364
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,861
I reached into the body cavity,

365
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,998
past the omentum,
around the liver,

366
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,634
and lifted the intestinal loops

367
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,404
from that living,
breathing body.

368
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,925
And that's when I knew.

369
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,561
I mean, holding those...

370
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,280
Those loops of
intestines in my hand,

371
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,584
the weight, the warmth...

372
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,136
I looked down at that
miracle in my hand,

373
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,805
and I just knew.

374
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,458
General surgery had chosen me.

00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,543
Mmm.

378
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,849
Well, one day, you'll know, too.

379
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,305
AMELIA: So I'm seeing two
rods on either side of the spine

380
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,952
to preserve nerve root function.

381
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,553
CALLIE: Yeah,
no, I get that. I get it.

382
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,921
But I can do a
graft on two levels.

383
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,758
But then I can place a frozen
graft directly into the spine

384
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,598
and then add a
metal support plate.

385
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,611
That will give her
way more stability.

386
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,270
And you'd be severely limiting
the range of motion in her spine,

387
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,200
when the point is to
keep her swinging, right?

388
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,242
This defect is so pronounced,
she might need to let that go.

389
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,038
I don't know if I'm
ready to let that go.

390
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,940
I mean, you're looking
at gross bone function,

391
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,815
but not thinking about the subtleties
of possible nerve impingement.

392
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,995
No, I think it's more that I'm
looking at the stability she needs

393
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,196
to keep her from
being paralyzed,

394
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,570
and that's where neuro can
sometimes underestimate

395
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,222
the fundamental biomechanics.

396
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,702
And I think that's where ortho
can tend to go a little overboard.

397
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,261
Ha! Well, we know
bones. We do stability.

398
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,124
You guys do brains.
And we do nerves.

399
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,243
That's why you wouldn't hire a
carpenter to rewire your house.

400
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,195
Whoa. Whoa. What
is the real issue here?

401
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,768

00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,445
Well, she wants to play golf.

404
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,973
No, she's a
teenaged golf prodigy.

405
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,970
Totally badass. But unfortunate...
So she wants the maximum

preserved mobility
we can offer her.

407
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,747
Putting her at risk
for a far worse injury.

408
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,650
Well, it seems like
Shepherd's plan works.

409
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,263
Chief Hunt, I
think that her plan

410
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,727
underestimates
the severity of...

411
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,538
We should do the
minimum possible

412
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,507
to maintain the mobility
this patient wants

413
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,159
and then work up from there.

414
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,162
Right.

It was only in the stock
pot for two minutes!

419
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,337
Okay, good. Then I
want to see this penis.

420

But first I want to see the

00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,639

00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,944
Huh. Well, it will make
reattachment much easier.

00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,746
Will it ever work again?

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,149
Mr. Archibald, I don't
want you to worry.

427
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,713
I've reattached many phalluses.

428
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,989
This situation is not as
uncommon as you might think.

429
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,402
Your vessels and
nerves are intact,

good that when I'm finished,

doing whatever it is you were doing

yourself into this mess.

much of a surprise,

needs to keep playing.

No, thank you.

You went on a date with me,
and you never called me back,

494
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,577
and I think that is very
rude and very hurtful.

495
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,691
And I know that that is a thing

496
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,648
that people do sometimes, but...

497
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,594
People have feelings, you know?

And maybe you don't
care, but I have feelings.

499

And, you know, the
least you could do

500
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,219
is not ignore me in the hallways

501
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,055
and make me feel like
some kind of pariah.

502
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,377
You're doing it again.

503
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,162
Doing what? Talking.

504
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,981
You never stopped talking.

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,783
On our date, even for a second.

506
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,952
You talked the entire time.

From the minute I picked you up

508
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,955
to the minute I dropped you off.

You never shut up.

510
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,558
And amazingly,
in all that talking,

511
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,543
you never asked me one question.

512
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,695
You don't know a
single thing about me.

513
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,164
I didn't need to be there.

514
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,349
It wasn't even a date.
It was a monolog.

515
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,785
You went on a
date with yourself.

516
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,721
And then you paid. You paid.

517
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,708
You did all the talking,
you ordered for me,

518
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,176
and then you paid, so...

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,867

severe in person than in the scans.

hold through L5? No.

522
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,790
Shoot.

523
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,137
Shoot. What?

524
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,538
I can't torque down the screws.

525
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,373
This won't keep the vertebrae

526
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,630
So what do we do?

527
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,564
We need to drill
through the sacrum

529
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,886

of bone to anchor L5 to S1.

00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,000
Exactly what Torres
was saying, yes.

532
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,819
Yeah, but can you do
that? Put in a bone graft?

00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,521
No, Warren, I can't.
I don't do bones.

00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,703
Bye.

Look, I appreciate that you
are looking out for Owen.

880
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,363
I do, but what I
do and who I see

881
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,466
are, quite honestly,
none of your business.

882
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,689
Wow.

883
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,591
Okay.

884
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,725
I was only trying to...

885
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,595
I moved here to start something,

886
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,430
to build a new life.

887
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,898
You don't know me.

888
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,901
Not really.

889
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,437
You don't know where I've been
or what I've had to overcome,

890
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,689
because you have never had to.

891
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,042
You've never lost
the love of your life.

you love most in this world.

You don't know how
that messes a person up.

You've never had to claw
your way back from that.

897
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,238
But I have.

898
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:47,184
I'm still trying to
pull myself together,

899
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,648
and I am doing the
very best that I can, so...

901
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:55,576
until you've had to
walk in my shoes,

902
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,251
I need you to cut me some slack.

me I was above average?

Yeah, yeah. You mentioned it.

00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:18,749
This might be it. I might
have found my specialty.

Give me the penis, and
everything will be fine.

Stop. Don't come any closer.

929
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,578
Just put it in my hand...

930
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:00,163
I said stop.

any closer, I'll flush it.

gonna be okay.

And the problem is, I hurt you.

978
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,997
I hurt your feelings,
and I'm sorry.

979
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,635
I came to you last year
intending to propose,

980
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,203
but I let our professional
differences stop me.

It's everything to us,

983
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:28,028
so it's easy to prioritize it.

984
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,441
I made that mistake before.
I don't want to make it again.

985
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,164
Let me stop you right there,

986
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:35,452
because I don't
think I can do this. I...

987
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,232
It's just happened
too many damn times.

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,652
You work... You work to
make something better,

990
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,005
and then it just all... It
just falls apart every time.

991
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,395
I know. It's true.

992
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,142
In fact, the only thing
I can truly promise

993
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,732
is I'll probably hurt you again.

994
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,501
Well, that's really enticing.

995
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,935
And you'll hurt me,

996
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,672
and I'll come right back
to you again when you do.

997
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,423
I'll accept the risk,

998
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,241
because you are worth it,

999
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,593
because you matter to me.

1000
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,813
Because I love you.

1001
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,283
And I'm not going anywhere.

What do you think?

1005
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:36,929
I think there are
probably a hundred things

that you'd be great at that
you haven't even tried yet.

1007

My mom thinks I did all this,

1008
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,484
because I get some
kind of weird high

1009
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:48,868
off being better
than everyone else.

1010
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,376
And don't get me wrong.

1011
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,645
Being excellent is...

1012
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,648
Amazing.

1013
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,718
But that's because I love this.

1014
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,754
Loved this.

1015
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:04,990
Even if you're both right,

1016
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:06,726
that I'll find something else,

1017
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,562
I'll never really love it.

1018
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,348
Not like this.

00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,339
Maybe not, but I believe (SIGHS)

1020

we get more than
just one thing to love.

00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,736
And you'll know you found it.

1026
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,056
I have to believe that.

as she ran down the hall
(CHUCKLING) with his penis?

1030

Tell me again about the gloves.

1031
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,472
How on earth did you
think to grab gloves?

1032
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,789
Instinct, I guess.

1033
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,342
So when do you leave for Boston?

1034
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,094
I don't know. Can...
Let's not talk about it.

1035
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,642
(SIGHS) I can't believe she
handed the penis over to you,

1036
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,066
just like that.

1037
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,367
So lucky.

1038
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,414
Yeah, she did.
She handed it to me.

1039
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,304
Severed penis.

1040
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,118
I was standing there holding
a severed penis in my hand,

"This isn't why I
became a surgeon."

1043
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,130
I do not love this penis.

1044
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,950
I do not want a
career in urology.

know what I do want,

WOMAN: No. No, no, no,
no. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

MEREDITH: <i>The
thing about love is,</i>

1053
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,336
<i>when it's good,
it's so very good.</i>

1054
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,538
What? Nothing.

1055
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,367
Let's get some tots. Okay.

1056
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:48,228
<i>And when it's bad,
it hurts so much.</i>

1057
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,163
Hey, can we talk?

1058
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:52,498
Uh, actually, I was just...

1059
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,033
What's really going on?

1060
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:56,419
I need you to tell me, 'cause...

(SIGHS)

1062
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,088
You say one thing,

1063
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,634
and I think you mean
something else entirely,

1064
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,158
and I want to understand.

1065
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,575
I am trying to.

1066
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:06,596
Because I want
what we started here.

1067
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:08,515
I do.

1068
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,918
But I need a little help.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

1070
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:16,990
I don't think

1071
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,669
that this is really the place
that we should be talking...

1072
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,260
Dr. Shepherd? You
have a call on Line 4.

1073
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,931
I got to get that.

1074

<i>And if you can't find a way to
balance all those ups and downs,</i>

1075
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,788

1076
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,292
Hello?

1077
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,128
Oh, no, sorry. You want
the other Dr. Shepherd.

1078
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,345
Here's his wife.

1079
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,800
Hi. This is Dr. Shepherd's wife.

1080
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,820
Uh, no, he's not here. Can
I take a message for you?

1081
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:50,604
Okay, sure.

1082
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:54,160
Oh.

1083
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:55,478
I thought he was there.

1084
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,664
Okay. Sure. No problem.

1085
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,199
Okay, thank you.

1086
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,300
Bye-bye.

1087
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,678
Well, that was weird.

1088
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:06,272
What was? Nothing.

1089
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,302
Just that was the
White House calling.

1090
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,609
Derek never showed up
at his meeting this morning.

1091
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:11,877
Oh, yeah?

1092
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,106
I'm sure his flight got
delayed or something.
