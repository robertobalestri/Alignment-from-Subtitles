1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,510
<i>When I was five, my
mom lost me in a park.</i>

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,346
<i>I don't remember much,</i>

3
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,696
<i>except that one minute,
I was riding the carousel,</i>

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,999
<i>and the next...</i>

5
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:20,835
<i>She was gone.</i>

6
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,624
I'll be home before you know it.

7
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,289
It's good. It's time.

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,369
<i>I know. I just feel
like I just got you back,</i>

9
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,725
<i>and now you're going again,</i>

10
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,995
and I just have to stay here.

11
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,162
You're right. You do.

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,232
You have to stay here.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,684
Stay here. Don't
move. Don't move.

14
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:36,768
Wait for me.

15
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,136
Wait for me.

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,615
<i>I don't remember
how I found her.</i>

17
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,139
<i>Richard!</i>

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,236
<i>I don't remember how I got home.</i>

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,288
<i>Are you okay?</i>

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,113
<i>All I remember is
what happened next.</i>

21
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,115
<i>She told me not to worry.</i>

22
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,468
<i>She told me everything
would be fine.</i>

23
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,203
I'll be back before you know it.

24
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,439
<i>Funny, isn't it, the
way memory works?</i>

25
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:01,392
<i>The things you
can't quite remember</i>

26
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,129
<i>and the things you
can never forget.</i>

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,117
<i>The carousel
never stops turning.</i>

28
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,181
Okay, Zozo, walk a little
faster 'cause we are late.

29
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:29,866
And who can never be late?

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,122
Surgeons.

31
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,535
What happens if
surgeons are late?

32
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,625
People die?

33
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,026
Right on, sister.

34
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,830
Hey, it's me.

35
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,131
I'm on the ferry.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,351
I just wanted to say that...

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,821
You're never gonna
make your flight.

38
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,478
<i>I'll make it.</i>

39
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,091
No, you won't. You're
gonna miss your flight.

40
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,699
Now, who's that? Bailey?
I'm not gonna miss my flight.

41
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,730
There was a huge accident on
the 5. All the lanes are closed.

42
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,220
The traffic is insane.

43
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,467
Now, why does Kepner make
that sound like it's a good thing?

44
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,436
<i>We have a guy from
the accident on our table.</i>

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,555
<i>Bailey and Kepner are sewing
up all the holes in his gut.</i>

46
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,530
I am repairing the un-repairable.
I am out-of-control amazing.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,566
No, I am out-of-control amazing.

48
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,302
You are a guest
in my guts. Hush.

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,681
The point is,

50
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:36,850
you might as well
turn around now

51
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,118
'cause you'll miss your flight.

52
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:39,351
<i>I'm not gonna miss my flight.</i>

53
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,858
I have a secret shortcut.

54
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,705
There are no
shortcuts to the airport.

55
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,123
- That you know about.
<i>- Come on.</i>

56
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,064
I'm doing a
spondylolisthesis today.

57
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,812
I'm saying if you head
back now, I might let you...

58
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,087
I'm gonna lose you here in a
second. Cell phone reception's bad.

59
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:54,455
Derek, are you still
there? I can't hear you.

60
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,303
No, I said I'm gonna lose the
cell phone reception. It's bad here.

61
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:58,994
Amy?

62
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,862
Derek? Derek?

63
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,771
<i>Amy, are you there?</i>

64
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,741
Lost him.

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,875
Look, I'm doing 10
miles over the speed limit.

66
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,219
That's not fast
enough for you? Gee.

67
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,575
Where's my phone?

68
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,487
Hey. Ma'am? Ma'am?

69
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:34,823
Winnie? Winnie?

70
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:36,725
My name's Derek. Are you okay?

71
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,159
Winnie?

72
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,665
Winnie! Winnie! Winnie!

73
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,694
Hey, I can't open
the door. Winnie!

74
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,603
Winnie! Winnie! Ma'am. Hey.

75
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,171
Hey. What's your name?

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,290
Sarah. Sarah, who's Winnie?

77
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,576
My daughter. She's,
uh... She's in the back.

78
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,178
She's not answering, and
I don't know if she's okay.

79
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,060
Sarah. Sarah, I need you to stay
calm, okay? Deep breaths. Good.

80
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,628
Stay calm. I'm
gonna be right back.

81
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:04,052
Okay? Try not to move,
okay? Okay. Mmm-hmm.

82
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,606
Hey. You Winnie?

83
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,794
Is anything hurt,
like your neck or...

84
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,127
Is that why you can't talk?

85
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:17,199
I think I'm dead.

86
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,516
Am I dead?

87
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,035
Let me feel your wrist.

88
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,741
Well, you're not dead.

89
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,722
I can feel a pulse in your wrist.
You know what that means?

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,762
What?

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,274
It means your
heart's still beating.

92
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,683
And you can't be dead if
your heart's still beating.

93
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,935
See, I'm a doctor,
and I'm telling you,

94
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,164
if you ever want to know if
you're dead, feel your pulse.

95
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,918
I can feel it.

96
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,924
I'm not dead.

97
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,993
You're not dead.

98
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,127
I'm not dead, Mommy!

99
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,818
She's okay?

100
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,786
Okay, she's fine.

101
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,700
Do you have a cell phone in
there? I need to call for help.

102
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,055
Yeah. I see it.

103
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,336
It shattered, though. It...
It wouldn't matter, anyway.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,544
I drive this road every week,
and there's never any cell signal.

105
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,258
Okay, I'm gonna check
on the other driver,

106
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,860
see if they have a
phone. You're leaving us?

107
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,762
What? No. I just said there's
never any cell signal up here.

108
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,268
It's not gonna be different.

109
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,881
Sarah, I'm gonna
check on them. I can't...

110
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,383
Like I checked on you,
okay? I can't move. I am stuck.

111
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,367
Please don't leave.
I'll be right back.

112
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,908
You promise?

113
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,043
I promise.

114
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,111
Okay.

115
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,203
Hello?

116
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,570
Hello?

117
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,491
Hello?

118
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,464
Help.

119
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,652
Help!

120
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,054
Help!

121
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,605
Hey.

122
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,718
Can you tell me your name?

123
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,342
Alana. Alana.

124
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,938
It's hard to breathe. Okay.

125
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,062
All right. Let's take a second.

126
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,992
You probably got the
wind knocked out of you

127
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,265
when you hit the ground.

128
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,511
Lucky you didn't
hit the pavement.

129
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,634
Yeah.

130
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:00,902
You feel any pain?

131
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,603
I don't... I don't think so.

132
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,689
Does it hurt anywhere? No.

133
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,192
I'm not supposed to
be here. I have to go.

134
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,206
I have to go. I have to go.
Careful. Careful. Okay, enough.

135
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,180
I have to call my mom.
Where's my phone?

136
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,369
My phone's not working.
Why is my phone not working?

137
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,112
Okay. Listen to
me. Listen to me.

138
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,796
You're probably in shock, okay?

139
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,565
You have a lot of adrenaline
going through you right now.

140
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,117
There might be
something wrong with you

141
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,318
that you don't feel right now,

142
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,859
so I need you to slow down.

143
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,410
Okay. Okay.

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,879
All right.

145
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,592
Can you tell me what day it is?

146
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,483
Thursday. I'm
supposed to be at school.

147
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,868
Chem. We have a quiz.

148
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,715
Is that why you were
driving so crazy?

149
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:36,955
I wasn't driving.

150
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,290
Who was driving?

151
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,059
Charlie. It's his dad's car.

152
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,648
Hey! Hey, Charlie.

153
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,834
Hey.

154
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,053
Stop.

155
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,588
Stop.

156
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,624
You okay?

157
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,560
Yeah. I'm fine.

158
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,762
Hey, let's get out of the road.

159
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,065
I don't feel good.

160
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,745
What happened? You
were in an accident.

161
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,904
Hey, what happened?

162
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,267
Let's get you out of this
road. I really don't feel so good.

163
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,573
What happened?

164
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,074
Um, let's get out of the road.

165
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,621
Sir, do you know what
happened? Yeah, you...

166
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,339
'Cause I really
don't feel so good.

167
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:35,124
No, no, no, no, no. Charlie.
What... What happened?

168
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,349
I don't know what
happened, Charlie. I don't...

169
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,139
Oh, my God, Charlie. Look
at your head. Are you okay?

170
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,592
Help me get him down.

171
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,893
What's wrong with him?

172
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,012
Why isn't he saying
anything? Charlie?

173
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,761
He hit his head really hard.
I need to find a first-aid kit.

174
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,722
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

175
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,442
Okay.

176
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,159
Okay, are you... You guys
still doing okay in there?

177
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,443
Yeah. You're gonna
get us out now?

178
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,378
I need supplies. What
do you got in the back?

179
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,636
Um, a first-aid kit,
Winnie's backpack.

180
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,852
Okay, Winnie, it's safety
glass. It's not gonna hurt you,

181
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,060
but I need you to
get back, all right?

182
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,444
Get back.

183
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,281
Are you gonna
leave us here again?

184
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,656
No.

185
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:36,768
Think you can climb out for me?

186
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,432
Yeah, I can. SARAH: Be careful.

187
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,006
Can you make sure Winnie's
careful? Okay, I got her.

188
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,030
Is she out? Yeah, she's out.

189
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,918
I'm out, Mom. I'm good. Okay.

190
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,330
All right, Sarah,
I'll be right back.

191
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,687
Not going anywhere.

192
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm gonna get your mom.

193
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,354
Winnie, you think you can go down
there and keep those two company?

194
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:59,914
The people who hit our car?
No, thanks. I'm good to wait here.

195
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:03,217
There's bandages in
here. They could use them.

196
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,097
My mom's gonna
be in a lot of pain,

197
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,321
and you don't want me to see it.

198
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:08,724
No.

199
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,543
Yes.

200
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,025
I can deal with seeing stuff.

201
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,129
My dad died
right in front of me.

202
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:20,479
We were fishing on the lake,

203
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,887
and he had a heart
attack on the boat and died.

204
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,184
Do you fish?

205
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,877
No one's gonna die, Winnie.

206
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:34,416
You aren't God,
so you don't know.

207
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,837
I'll go wait with them.

208
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,880
Okay, Sarah, you
ready? One, two, three.

209
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,711
I loved this car so much!

210
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,447
It's the first new
car that we ever had.

211
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:10,985
And boom, some rich guy in
an overpriced midlife crisis just...

212
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,354
You saw him, right?
The guy that hit us?

213
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,423
Total pig, right?

214
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,257
He was a 17-year-old kid.

215
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,911
Crap. Now I can't even hate him.

216
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,981
I bet his parents are awful.

217
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,028
All right, Sarah, I got
to get you out of this car.

218
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,830
Listen, getting you
out is going to hurt a lot.

219
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,353
Okay.

220
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,023
I know that I should be in pain,

221
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,425
and I don't know if it's shock

222
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,595
or if it's that my
leg hurts so badly

223
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,230
that I almost
can't recognize it.

224
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,418
Almost feels normal, so maybe
it won't be so bad getting me out.

225
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,803
Sounds like you
dislocated your hip.

226
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,351
Which means I got to
get you out of this car...

227
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,974
Okay. Down on the ground,

228
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,820
and then pop it
back into the socket.

229
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,211
Okay. All right.

230
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,720
All right, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it. It's gonna be horrible.

231
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,817
What happened?
There was an accident.

232
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,420
What happened?

233
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,733
There was a car
accident, Charlie.

234
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,789
Ow!

235
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,740
Are you okay?

236
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,645
My stomach hurts. Really bad. I
think I'm gonna throw up or something.

237
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,414
Where are we?

238
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,399
We had a car accident, okay?

239
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,768
We had an accident!

240
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,483
Okay, stop. Please
stop. I need to fix your leg.

241
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,391
No, let's wait.

242
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,171
Let's wait, uh, for help 'cause
help's coming. It's coming.

243
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,439
Sarah, the dislocation has cut
off the blood supply to your leg.

244
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,914
If I don't do something,
you could lose it.

245
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,111
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.

246
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,201
Okay.

247
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,204
Oh!

248
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:37,405
Good.

249
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,594
Oh. Thank God.

250
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:39,891
It's good.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,141
I hate you.

252
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,662
Derek! Charlie's
car! The car's on fire!

253
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,082
Hey!

254
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,712
Alana, run! What about Charlie?

255
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,780
Get away from the car!

256
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,199
Come on, Charlie,
you got to get up.

257
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:54,884
Get up, get up, get
up, get up. Come on.

258
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,908
Aah! Aah!

259
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,443
Come on.

260
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,033
Oh, my God!

261
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,777
That explosion was huge.

262
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,022
Do you see all that smoke?

263
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,212
Someone's gonna see it,

264
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,508
and then that someone
is gonna send some help.

265
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,393
It's like a smoke
signal. Mmm-hmm.

266
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,484
We're so rescued.

267
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,031
I'm not supposed to be here.

268
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,715
Okay, we just need to
hang on for a little bit longer.

269
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,667
Is everybody okay? I'm
not supposed to be here.

270
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:31,959
I'm a mathlete. I
take five AP classes.

271
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,596
I'm first chair on cello. I have
a perfect attendance record.

272
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:38,132
I haven't missed one
day, not one day of school.

273
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,683
I'm boring.

274
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,136
Charlie Abbott's prom king.

275
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,082
He's in remedial math.

276
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,968
He's never even heard of AP.

277
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,909
He's dumb and popular
and totally gorgeous.

278
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:51,640
And this morning, he says,
"You want to go for a ride?" to me.

279
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,532
So, the Earth is shifting on
its axis or something crazy

280
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,841
because no way.

281
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,386
Charlie Abbott is not
supposed to kiss me.

282
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,988
Aah!

283
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,124
So something is wrong.

284
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:05,488
Some wormhole to another
universe has opened.

285
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,162
I don't know, but
now I am on a road

286
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,476
because the car I was
in just flew through the air

287
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,378
and I just ran
from a giant fireball

288
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:15,736
and Charlie Abbott's brain is
broken and my stomach is killing me.

289
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:18,205
So I am obviously not
supposed to be here.

290
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,291
So, can someone
please wake me up

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,538
or wave your magic wand
or click your heels three times

292
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,022
or whatever so I can go home?

293
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,629
Please. Please.

294
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,976
What? What is it? What's
wrong? Just look at my eyes.

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,126
Look at my face.
Look at my eyes, okay?

296
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,212
I'm scared.

297
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,629
Okay, okay, just look at me.

298
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,952
Derek?

299
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,266
Okay, we need to get her down
on the ground. Help me, okay?

300
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,834
Just come with
me right now. Okay.

301
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,898
Easy, easy.

302
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,655
I just need to undo a button so I
can look at your stomach, okay?

303
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm scared. I know.

304
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:44,164
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
I'm here, okay? Look at me.

305
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,233
Look at me. Look
at me in the eyes.

306
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,081
All right, I'm gonna
open up your pants

307
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,817
so I can just see
your stomach, okay?

308
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,161
I just want to
take a quick look.

309
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,512
I'm gonna take a look.

310
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,746
Oh, God!

311
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,775
Sarah. Derek.

312
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,601
What's wrong with me?

313
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,448
Is it my stomach? Is
it bleeding? It's okay.

314
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,199
Am I dying? Please, I
want to know. No, no, no.

315
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:09,484
You have a little cut in your
tummy. It's gonna be okay.

316
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,104
It's no big deal. I
can take care of it.

317
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,888
How? How are you gonna fix it?

318
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,810
You don't know.

319
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,667
Oh, my God, I'm
gonna die out here.

320
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:24,605
Can you stop saying that? It's
insulting. I don't let people die.

321
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,975
I'm very good at my job, even
next to the roadside, okay?

322
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:31,378
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

323
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,452
Sarah.

324
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,215
You have dry-cleaning
in the car, right, Sarah?

325
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,239
Yeah, I think so.

326
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:52,082
So, Charlie kissed
you this morning.

327
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,584
Was that your first kiss?

328
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,571
Yes. Except for the guy
who plays second-chair cello.

329
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,568
He doesn't count. Why?

330
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,192
It was just practice kissing.

331
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,688
So, should I be practicing?

332
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,828
No.

333
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,062
Yeah, but she just...

334
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,042
But how much trouble do
you think she's gonna be in

335
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,517
when her mother finds out
what she's been up to today?

336
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:12,119
She has a point. I'm
not your role model,

337
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:15,623
and I don't think kissing
Charlie was worth all this.

338
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,358
Every kiss before the right
kiss doesn't count anyway.

339
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,328
I've kissed a lot of women.

340
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,265
The first time I
kissed my wife, well...

341
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,802
I mean, she wasn't my wife then.

342
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,805
She was just this girl in a bar.

343
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:34,374
And when we kissed,
it... It was like...

344
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:38,846
I got to tell you, it was like I never
kissed any other woman before.

345
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,317
It was like the first kiss.

346
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,452
The right kiss.

347
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:47,604
Do you have a brother?

348
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
It's a beautiful
day to save lives.

349
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,619
What... What does that mean?

350
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,953
It's just a thing I say.

351
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,054
Oh.

352
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,463
Do you hear that?

353
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,564
Hear what?

354
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,549
Hear that?

355
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,285
They got our smoke signal!

356
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,648
Yeah, they got our smoke signal.

357
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,838
They got us!

358
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,979
I'll visit you first thing in the
morning at the hospital, okay?

359
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,781
Thank you.

360
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,983
Okay, watch your step.

361
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,238
Thank you.

362
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,861
Got to hand it to you, Doc.

363
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,329
Now go home and
have yourself a drink.

364
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,086
You earned it. Thanks.

365
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,168
<i>She told me not to worry.</i>

366
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,854
<i>She told me everything
would be fine.</i>

367
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,324
<i>Funny, isn't it, the
way memory works?</i>

368
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,878
<i>The things you
can't quite remember</i>

369
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,140
<i>and the things you
can never forget.</i>

370
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,212
What do we have?
Where should I start?

371
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,701
A bad one. Jerome Davis.

372
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,954
Blunt-force trauma,
open skull fracture.

373
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,639
He keeps trying to die on us.

374
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:19,851
Let's get him inside.

375
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,225
Let's go.

376
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,066
No, no, no, wait.
What, no! Another one?

377
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,375
No, no, no, no, no.

378
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,530
We've already got
that lady and her kid,

379
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,700
the girl with the guts, and then
that dude with the head injury.

380
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,784
When it rains, it pours.

381
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,619
Okay, it needs to
pour somewhere else

382
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,337
because we are
not a trauma center.

383
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,681
We're not properly
equipped for this kind of thing.

384
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,442
We don't have rooms.
You guys know that.

385
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,566
Make room.

386
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,668
What are we supposed
to do with the guy?

387
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:48,869
Look at him.

388
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,551
All right, fine.
This isn't on me.

389
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,850
John Doe broadsided
by a semitruck.

390
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:05,548
Blunt-force trauma to the
head, chest, and abdomen.

391
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,833
Persistent hypotension
after two liters of saline.

392
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,306
Pulse is thready at 130.

393
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,592
<i>You're not dead.</i>

394
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:12,893
<i>Just breathe.</i>

395
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,745
I need four units of blood.

396
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,548
<i>Scalp lac. Probably multiple
fractures. Try to hold still.</i>

397
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,485
John Doe. Bad MVA.
Had to be extricated.

398
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,737
Positive loss of
consciousness at the scene.

399
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,955
He's poorly responsive.

400
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,323
GCS of 10.

401
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,225
What's your name,
sir? Can you hear me?

402
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,395
<i>Yes. Yes, I can hear you.</i>

403
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,298
<i>Loss of verbal skills.
Possible bleeding in the brain.</i>

404
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,844
His pupils are
equal and reactive.

405
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,929
<i>Good sign. Still
should get a CT.</i>

406
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,937
He's got a flail chest in the
right. I need a 36 French tube now.

407
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,601
Sir, can you tell me your name?

408
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,742
He's still hypotensive and
tachycardic after two fluid boluses.

409
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,278
He could be
bleeding in his chest.

410
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,857
Hang two units of
blood on the infuser.

411
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,648
I need a trauma panel and
X-ray, and cross him for four.

412
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,595
And somebody page surgery again.
- Right away.

413
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,135
<i>She's smart. I like her.</i>

414
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:58,188
I'm sorry. This is gonna
hurt, but we have to do it.

415
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,753
That must have hurt. I'm sorry.

416
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,071
Can you please
tell me your name?

417
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,790
Can you tell me anything?

418
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,459
Excuse me, Toby?

419
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,776
Mom, I'm going to the bathroom.

420
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,428
Ask a nurse where it is.

421
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,730
Ow. Yeah. Right there.

422
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,278
I'm ordering a head CT.

423
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,713
We don't know the
extent of his head injury.

424
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,005
<i>She's right. You don't.</i>

425
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,440
Look at the ultrasound.

426
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,009
He's bleeding into his belly.
We don't have time for a CT.

427
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,623
<i>Arrogant. Because
she's younger than you.</i>

428
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,274
<i>And probably because
she's a woman.</i>

429
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,531
I just think that...

430
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
We don't have time for a CT.

431
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,818
He needs to go
straight to the OR.

432
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,065
<i>You have this. Come
on. Don't back down.</i>

433
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,499
But I don't think we
have a handle on...

434
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,991
His GCS hasn't changed
since he got here.

435
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,358
The CT can wait.

436
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,595
C-spine, chest, and
pelvis films are up.

437
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,171
Derek?

438
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:44,595
<i>Winnie. You
shouldn't be in here.</i>

439
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,560
You're not dead.

440
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,802
I know you're not dead.

441
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,371
You know how I know?

442
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,058
'Cause I can feel your pulse,

443
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,671
which means your
heart is beating.

444
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:00,806
Your heart is beating,

445
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,296
which means you're
not dead, okay?

446
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:10,237
Hey. Eyes on me.

447
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,658
You stay not dead, okay?

448
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,928
It's a beautiful day
to save lives, right?

449
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,331
So you stay not dead.

450
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,483
Where are you supposed to be?

451
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,747
Is he gonna be all right?

452
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,826
Whose kid is this?

453
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,236
I'll deal with it.

454
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,454
<i>I'm not dead. I'm not dead.</i>

455
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,990
That man, do you know him?

456
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,440
Yeah, that's Derek.

457
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,377
Derek? Derek who? Is he a
family member? A neighbor?

458
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:51,995
He's my friend.

459
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,665
Okay. Do you know
your friend's last name?

460
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,284
No, I mean, I just
met him today.

461
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,937
He pulled me and my mom
out of our car after the accident.

462
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,924
He fixed her leg,
he helped Charlie,

463
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,844
and he put Alana's insides
back in. He saved us.

464
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,978
He saved you?

465
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,207
All of us.

466
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,231
He's a doctor.

467
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,151
He's a doctor?

468
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,420
A surgeon, I think.

469
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,727
<i>My head. Look at my head.</i>

470
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,780
Sedation, please!

471
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,200
You need to calm down, buddy.

472
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,469
He's a surgeon. Let's get a...

473
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,818
He's a surgeon, and
he just saved everyone

474
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,082
from the car accident
that just came through.

475
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,175
Doctor, we're gonna
sedate you now

476
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,425
so we can secure your airway.

477
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,699
You're gonna be fine.

478
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:46,983
<i>No. I'm not.</i>

479
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,135
<i>You need to wait.</i>

480
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:52,106
Sux and etomidation in? Yes.

481
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:01,065
It's okay. We've got you.
It is all gonna be okay.

482
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,518
<i>This isn't right.</i>

483
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,454
<i>You should have taken
me to get a head CT.</i>

484
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,287
His pressure's holding.
Maybe we should get the scan.

485
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,262
<i>Yes, listen to her.</i>

486
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:16,658
Too risky. He could
bottom out in the scanner.

487
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,543
We need to open him up.
Find the source of the bleeding.

488
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,233
<i>No, you don't.
You have the time.</i>

489
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,603
We have to work
fast, people. <i>I'm stable.</i>

490
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,254
<i>Guys, I'm stable.</i>

491
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,456
<i>Take me to get the head CT.</i>

492
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,510
Let's set up for an
ex-lap. Coming through.

493
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:33,346
<i>I'm going to die because these
people aren't properly trained.</i>

494
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,005
One, two, three.

495
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,118
He's hypotensive.

496
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,069
Start him on pressors. Betadine.

497
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:48,195
<i>I can't feel my arm.
What is happening?</i>

498
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,030
Ready to put him under.

499
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,200
<i>No, I have a head lac.</i>

500
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,135
<i>Don't miss. Don't miss!</i>

501
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,788
The colon's avulsed.

502
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,684
We'll need to resect and
create a temporary colostomy.

503
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,036
<i>Well, it's better than
being dead, I guess.</i>

504
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,821
He's got a
grade-two splenic lac.

505
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,445
<i>Meredith would leave
it.</i> PAUL: Let's leave it.

506
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,097
Check the four quadrants.

507
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,093
<i>And she'd double check
the retrohepatic space.</i>

508
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,837
Make sure to check
the retrohepatic space.

509
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,102
<i>Not bad.</i>

510
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,215
Crap. Dropped his sats.

511
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,135
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

512
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,269
<i>Check the chest tube.</i>

513
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,471
The chest tube looks good.

514
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,495
<i>Check it again.</i>

515
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,532
Crap. He's got a
huge hemothorax.

516
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,151
We have to open his
chest. Thoracotomy tray.

517
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,221
<i>No, don't. Just wait. See
how much blood comes out.</i>

518
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,050
<i>It'll probably stop. Just wait!</i>

519
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:34,725
Scalpel.

520
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,192
He's still hypotensive.

521
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:42,432
I can't find any
lung laceration.

522
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,428
Hilum's intact. He's not
bleeding into his chest.

523
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:45,980
This makes no sense.
We're missing something.

524
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,254
Set up for a TEE.

525
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,922
<i>Not that. That's not
what you're missing.</i>

526
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,408
Persistent bradycardia.

527
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:52,592
<i>Check my head.</i>

528
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:54,461
I don't understand
what the hell is...

529
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,413
He had a head lac.

530
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,215
Check his pupils.

531
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,320
His right pupil is blown.

532
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,583
Page Neurosurgery
right-freaking now.

533
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,689
We did.

534
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,868
<i>Then page them again.</i>

535
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,092
Then page them again.

536
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,815
Any word?

537
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,112
The neurosurgeon
was at a dinner.

538
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,630
Dinner? DEREK: <i>Dinner?</i>

539
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:20,999
He said he'll be
here in 20 minutes.

540
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,263
<i>It will be too late.</i>

541
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,009
Damn it.

542
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,020
Where the hell is he?

543
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:39,306
Page him again.

544
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,111
Thank God.

545
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,114
What the hell have you
people screwed up now?

546
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,432
Us?

547
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,745
You're on call for trauma.
What took you so long?

548
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,119
Who the hell are you?

549
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,815
Your response time was
supposed to be 20 minutes.

550
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,284
<i>It wouldn't have
made a difference.</i>

551
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,551
If you guys had
ordered a head CT,

552
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:14,752
you would have called me sooner.

553
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,336
What am I supposed
to do about that?

554
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,072
We needed to control... He
was bleeding into his belly.

555
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,714
He was stable. You had the time.

556
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,383
Now I've got to work like hell
to save this man, thanks to you.

557
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,403
<i>There's no point.</i>

558
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,533
You were supposed to
be here in 20 minutes,

559
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:30,056
not an hour and a half.

560
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,776
We had a chance. He
had a freaking chance.

561
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,427
Get out of my OR.

562
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,678
What?

563
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,331
You heard me.

564
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,044
Unless you're gonna be
cutting into this man's head,

565
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,868
you can get out. Now.

566
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,771
Now!

567
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,769
I'm gonna scrub in.

568
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,120
Someone pull in
the craniotomy tray.

569
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,190
We've already
wasted enough time.

570
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,592
<i>It's too late.</i>

571
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,394
<i>You're too late.</i>

572
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,852
Hey.

573
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:37,841
What did you do?

574
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,410
I did what I always do,

575
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,280
except I almost
killed myself doing it.

576
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,383
Don't make jokes. I was scared.

577
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,352
No, don't be scared.

578
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:50,603
I'm not going anywhere.

579
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,525
Come here.

580
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,794
Mmm.

581
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,329
I'm right here.

582
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,235
<i>Ma'am?</i>

583
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,421
Ma'am?

584
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,456
Ma'am, is this the home
of Derek Shepherd?

585
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:12,459
It is. He's my husband.

586
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,763
I'm afraid there's
been an accident.

587
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,798
Could you come with us, please?

588
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,769
Are you okay?

589
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:26,005
I can't just go. I...

590
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,309
What am I supposed
to do with my kids?

591
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,661
<i>Blood. It's just blood.</i>

592
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,102
<i>Meredith, don't be
afraid. Don't be afraid.</i>

593
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:09,222
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

594
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:12,131
<i>My mother tried to kill herself.</i>

595
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,756
<i>Dr. Grey.</i>

596
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,912
Dr. Grey, I can't...

597
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,048
We can't tell you how sorry...

598
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,452
I am so sorry for your loss.

599
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,772
Dr. Shepherd was a
tremendous surgeon,

600
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,991
a tremendously gifted...

601
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,195
I've long admired
his techniques. I...

602
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,314
It was an honor.

603
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,240
The call to not get a
head CT was a bad call.

604
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,361
We're not a trauma center.
We're a teaching hospital.

605
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,031
You did the best you could.

606
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,610
Ma'am?

607
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,163
I thought that if this
was a good time,

608
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:50,634
I might take a moment to
explain how this all works.

609
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,201
Where are the papers?

610
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,949
Mrs. Shepherd, there's
some things you need to know,

611
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,434
some things we need to discuss.

612
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,940
Difficult things.

613
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,411
I'm a doctor. Dr. Grey.

614
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,380
I'm a surgeon, just
like my husband was.

615
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,697
I know how this works.

616
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,033
You've waited the
requisite number of hours,

617
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:09,536
and now you can
officially declare him dead.

618
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:12,372
Normally, you'd talk to
me about organ donation.

619
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,207
But by the looks of his chart,

620
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:17,861
there's not much left
that works to donate.

621
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,846
So, the ICU needs a bed.

622
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,649
Those must be the papers.

623
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:26,920
The papers you want me to sign to
decide what to do with my husband

624
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:29,823
now that he's dead,
but not really dead.

625
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,760
Do we ship him off to
a long-term care facility

626
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:37,897
and cross our fingers and
hope for fairy tales and magic?

627
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,799
Or do I pull the plug?

628
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,070
And stop all
curative intervention?

629
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:46,472
Discontinue all
routine monitoring,

630
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,375
remove all the catheters,
drains, and tubes,

631
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,477
end any and all
treatments that might

632
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,513
provide comfort to the patient.

633
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,353
Terminate all
life-sustaining measures

634
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:06,793
and behave as any sane
doctor would behave.

635
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,950
Does that about
cover it, Doctor?

636
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,753
Is that what you want
to talk to me about

637
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,423
while I sit here with
my sleeping children?

638
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,258
You want to talk about
killing my husband?

639
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,327
Give me the papers.

640
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,156
Ma'am...

641
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,495
Give me the papers!

642
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,177
I'm so sorry.

643
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,716
I know that that's
useless to you right now.

644
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:05,919
But I am.

645
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:08,755
He saved all those people.

646
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:12,959
And it was my job to save him.

647
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:14,795
And I failed.

648
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:18,698
And now he's gonna die

649
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:23,403
because I was not a
good enough doctor...

650
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:25,972
to keep him alive.

651
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:34,948
Yeah, you're right. You did
fail. You weren't good enough.

652
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:38,396
But do you know
what tomorrow is?

653
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,187
It's Friday. There's gonna
be more patients who come in

654
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:42,622
who need you to save them,

655
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:46,053
someone's mother, someone's
kid, someone's husband.

656
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,077
They need you to save them
because they can't save themselves.

657
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,416
So learn from
this, better yourself,

658
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,085
and you will be
better for next time.

659
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,288
What if I'm not?

660
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,890
You will be.

661
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,694
How can you know that?

662
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:08,632
Because he was your one.

663
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,779
Every patient you treat, you're
going to see my husband's face

664
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:16,072
and remember that he was
the one that died on your watch.

665
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,578
He will haunt you. The
hard ones always do.

666
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,680
And it only takes that one.

667
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,968
But that one will make you work
harder, and they make you better.

668
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:30,503
Or they make you quit,

669
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:31,938
and you don't get to waste

670
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,450
what would have been
the rest of my husband's life

671
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:35,174
being a quitter.

672
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,713
So get back inside because
you're not saving any lives out here.

673
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,690
I really am... Yeah,
I know. I know.

674
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:41,774
There's a social worker
out there with my kids.

675
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,293
If this takes a while...

676
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,912
We got them. Don't worry.

677
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,832
I just need the papers.

678
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:14,040
We're gonna begin now.
You can sit next to him.

679
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,414
Wait.

680
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,403
Ma'am... Just wait!

681
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,845
Derek.

682
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,621
Derek.

683
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,038
<i>So, what's your story?</i>

684
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,676
I don't have a story.
I'm just a girl in a bar.

685
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,345
I'm just a guy in a bar.

686
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:27,414
Want to go again?

687
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:32,135
<i>I love you, Meredith Grey.</i>

688
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:37,073
<i>And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.</i>

689
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,424
<i>You're the love of my life.</i>

690
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,643
<i>I can't leave you.</i>

691
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,315
<i>You were like
coming up for fresh air.</i>

692
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,600
<i>It's like I was drowning,
and you saved me.</i>

693
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,489
<i>I'm in love with you.</i>

694
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,811
<i>I've been in love
with you forever.</i>

695
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:08,037
<i>So, um... Goodbye...</i>

696
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,622
Um...

697
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,476
Derek. Derek.

698
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,810
Right. Meredith.

699
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,595
Meredith. Yeah.

700
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,997
Mmm-hmm.

701
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,450
Nice meeting you. Bye, Derek.

702
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,657
Derek?

703
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,680
It's okay.

704
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,919
You go.

705
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:46,209
We'll be fine.

706
00:40:58,506 --> 00:40:59,772
Are you ready?

707
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:05,745
No. But go ahead.
