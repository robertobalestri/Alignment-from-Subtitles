1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,137
<i>Nobody's memory
is perfect or complete.</i>

2
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,958
<i>We jumble things up.</i>

3
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,989
Richard. YOUNG
RICHARD: I'm sorry. I can't.

4
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,156
<i>We lose track of time.</i>

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,657
Richard!

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,858
<i>We are in one place...</i>

7
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,277
You believe that your career

8
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,166
is more important
than mine. It is!

9
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>Then another.</i>

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,914
I gave it up for
you. I don't want it.

11
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,772
<i>And it all feels like one
long, inescapable moment.</i>

12
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,586
I raised you to be an
extraordinary human being.

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,188
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

14
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,613
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

15
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:33,827
<i>It's just like my
mother used to say.</i>

16
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,451
<i>"The carousel
never stops turning."</i>

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,448
You asked for a consult. This
is my... That's not the point.

18
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,716
I have to control the
infection. Surgery first.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,900
She has an abscess...

20
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,051
If I don't operate,
she will die...

21
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,703
Let's have one conversation.

22
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,638
Meredith, what do you
need? Pierce paged me.

23
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,540
Yeah, I need a general
consult on her chest.

24
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,142
What about Webber?
I paged Dr. Grey.

25
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,765
Pierce, make your case.

26
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,250
I respect
Dr. Shepherd's opinion,

27
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,402
but I need to go in first
to debride the infection

28
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,905
before it shuts down her heart,
her lungs, all of her organs.

29
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,375
And she is my patient. I
paged you for a consult.

30
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,889
I'm sorry, but if the ventricle
ruptures, it could be catastrophic.

31
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,207
I can't sit back
and let that happen.

32
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,959
If you go in first, she
will die on your table.

33
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,928
If you do, she could come
out a brain-dead patient.

34
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,395
Owen, will you
look at the scans?

35
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:10,797
The abscess is up
against the ventricle.

36
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,416
It could cause significant brain
edema and severe meningitis.

37
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,219
So, basically, you're both
racing the clock on this girl.

38
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,437
If the time hasn't
run out already.

39
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,772
We'll know if her heart stops.

40
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:20,257
Grey, what do you
think? I agree with Pierce.

41
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,497
I think we get to the neck
and the mediastinum first.

42
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,483
Look at the head CT. I
did. I still think Pierce is right.

43
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,864
No, no, no, let me show you. I
know how to read a brain scan, Derek.

44
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,215
I learned from the
best, remember?

45
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,867
All right, enough. I know
what we're gonna do.

46
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,651
Let's go and
talk to the patient.

47
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,710
I'd had a root canal.

48
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:38,279
Last week, and it's
hurt for like a week.

49
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,792
But I figured,
it's a root canal.

50
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:40,960
It's supposed to hurt, right?

51
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,112
Yeah, well, you
should have told me.

52
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,852
Anyway, she passed
out at work yesterday,

53
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,720
and she's run a
fever ever since.

54
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,634
Holly, you got an infection
from the dental procedure

55
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:50,542
called descending
necrotizing mediastinitis.

56
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,055
It spread quickly into your neck

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,790
and down into your mediastinum,

58
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,109
which is the space between
your lungs that houses your heart.

59
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,495
And the fever is caused from
the sepsis from the infection.

60
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,696
Holly, in addition
to the sepsis,

61
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,947
I found a lesion in your brain,

62
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,515
and I think we
should start there first.

63
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,467
Are you telling me that my
daughter needs brain surgery?

64
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,224
Yes, immediately.

65
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,754
She needs chest debridement
as soon as possible.

66
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,005
What are you saying? Here
is what we're going to do.

67
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,157
You've not responded
to the IV antibiotics,

68
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:14,249
so I would like to run a
chest CT with contrast

69
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,202
to determine which
infection is most urgent.

70
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,471
We will have a decision
very soon, okay?

71
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,847
Edwards? Hi.

72
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,298
What are you doing here?

73
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,567
I am interested
in fetal surgery,

74
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,403
and Dr. Webber said that I could
do some OB ultrasounds so...

75
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,267
So, you're doing my ultrasound?

76
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,724
Unless you don't want
me to. No, no, no, it's fine.

77
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,110
You got to learn.

78
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,691
On me. I mean, it's
fine with me either way.

79
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:46,180
No, it's all good.

80
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,410
We just don't wanna know
the sex, so I'm not gonna look.

81
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,954
I will do all of the looking.

82
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,738
All right, so, there are
the feet and the toes.

83
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,675
He's breech, sitting
cross-legged like a little Buddha.

84
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,210
Yeah, he does that.

85
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,440
Oh, my God. What?

86
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,841
You said, "He." No, I didn't.

87
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,859
Yeah, you did.
You said, "He." No.

88
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,963
You said, "He." Oh. Oh, God!

89
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,181
I just said I didn't
want to know the sex!

90
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,716
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It
was a rookie mistake.

91
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,124
How's it looking in... Hey.

92
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,771
Stephanie. Hi.

93
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,355
Why... I'm practicing.

94
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,013
Okay. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

95
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,815
Yeah. Um...

96
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,861
All right, just don't
let her know the sex.

97
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,485
Oh, no.

98
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,030
No, she says the baby's sitting

99
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,289
like a little Buddha,
just like last time.

100
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:30,875
Last time? Hey,
there, little thing, you.

101
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,856
All right, well, I got
surgeries most of the day,

102
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,690
so I'm gonna miss
our lunch. Sorry.

103
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,075
Torres might get one
of our guys back up

104
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,727
on his feet today, and
I'm gonna miss that, too.

105
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,185
Oh, but, yay, you
guys. Good luck.

106
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,120
All right.

107
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,055
And I just lied to my husband.

108
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,046
That's a great way to
start parenthood. Lying.

109
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,426
Awesome. Thanks, Edwards.

110
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm really sorry,
but we're not done.

111
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,184
Oh, we're done.

112
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,005
Whoa, Rick, you're
pulling way ahead.

113
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,439
All right, you got to do
better than that, Jordan,

114
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:09,142
if you want to beat
Rick's numbers.

115
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,398
Oh. Have we started?

116
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,610
See, I thought this
was still the warm-up.

117
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,012
Oh! Gloves are off.

118
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,414
You don't want
a tie, right, guys?

119
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:16,699
Don't get his hopes up,
Dr. T., he can't touch my scores.

120
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,518
Oh, bite me. I'm getting
up on that leg first.

121
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:19,902
Ooh, you gonna take that?

122
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,654
What was it you said
my scores were earlier?

123
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,989
"Phenomenal."

124
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,112
Guys, you're doing fine.

125
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,164
You're both gonna
get the leg eventually.

126
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,944
This is not a contest.
Where's the fun in that, sir?

127
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,048
Yeah.

128
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,749
You're pitting these
guys against each other?

129
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,683
I just spent the morning
refereeing the surgeons.

130
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,920
I don't need this.
This is not a good idea.

131
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,142
They came up with this.

132
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,056
The one to master the
virtual-reality leg first

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,396
gets to try the real leg first.

134
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,009
It's just a little
friendly competition.

135
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,011
I'm just saying don't push them.

136
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,435
Hey, we are this close, Owen.

137
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:50,238
We're gonna have
someone walking today.

138
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:54,443
Whoo! Yes! Smoked you,
Schultz! Congrats, man.

139
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,289
See, that's the thing
about soldiers, Hunt.

140
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:58,446
I don't have to push them.
They come wired that way.

141
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,533
All right, Carter, you
ready to take a walk?

142
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,396
<i>It's a pretty
straightforward procedure.</i>

143
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,421
I'll do the initial approach.
Robbins, you can do the cutting.

144
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,856
God, this is good.

145
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,525
Did you ever try this?
Banana Clambake?

146
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:12,434
I haven't, and certainly
not before 8:00 a.m.

147
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,807
Does it have actual clams?

148
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,030
You're very perky today.

149
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,165
Why not? Life is short.

150
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,545
And at this point, I can eat
whatever the hell I want for breakfast.

151
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,214
Right, Robbins?
Right. You've earned it.

152
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,683
I just wish I could do that
and stay as trim as you do.

153
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:24,906
Shut up, Graham.

154
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,428
I'll finish prep.
See you in there.

155
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,047
God, that was worth it.

156
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,515
I'm trying to get through
every flavor they have

157
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,934
before I cash in.

158
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,619
Please don't say that.
Why? Why be so serious?

159
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,350
Because we're about to
operate on a pregnant woman,

160
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,884
and I have no idea if
you're in any condition...

161
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,025
I told you... You
told me nothing!

162
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,943
You told me you
have a brain tumor,

163
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,423
but I don't know
anything else about you.

164
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,042
I don't know if you're married.

165
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,544
That's not the deal. You
get access to my knowledge.

166
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,146
It doesn't give you
access to my life.

167
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,652
I'm talking about next of kin.

168
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,666
Like if something should
happen to you, who do I call?

169
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,623
God, you are so annoying!

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,195
Divorced, no kids.

171
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,525
Marry the work, Robbins.
It's always there for you.

172
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:08,683
So, um, no family?

173
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:13,821
I have work and you and Graham.

174
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,290
God, that's the saddest
thing I've ever said.

175
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,788
What kind of
tumor is it? Enough.

176
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,411
I need to know
if this could affect

177
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,040
your motor skills
or your cognition.

178
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,393
You don't need to know
anything that I haven't...

179
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,650
I need to know if I'm
helping you treat patients

180
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,080
with a time bomb in your head!

181
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:29,670
Robbins, I have a
team of neurosurgeons

182
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,735
who are far more
experienced than you are,

183
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,536
so your input at this point

184
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,006
is nothing more than an
invasion of my privacy.

185
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,381
Stop. Drop it.

186
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,867
So it's inoperable.

187
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,550
Who says? That's it.
You're done. You can't focus.

188
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,285
You're off the surgery.
Graham can do it.

189
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,208
Go do consults. Fine.

190
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,058
Dr. Shepherd, do
you have a minute?

191
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,347
I'm afraid I don't.

192
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,461
I'm Deborah Curzon. I was
asked to come talk to you.

193
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,785
Deborah, I'm really
sorry, but I don't have time.

194
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:06,107
Dr. Shepherd, I was
asked by the President.

195
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,405
We didn't get a chance to meet
when you were in Washington.

196
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,179
I'm the special assistant to the
President of the United States.

197
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,542
He asked you to talk to me?

198
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,144
About leadership of the
brain mapping initiative.

199
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,278
We had that conversation.

200
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,334
Oh, I remember.

201
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,569
You told him no.

202
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,455
Confidentially, he
doesn't love being told no.

203
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,136
He thought another conversation
was the least you could do for him.

204
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,043
Those were the
words of the President.

205
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,273
We couldn't have had this
conversation through an e-mail?

206
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:30,498
I know you're busy. I can
wait for you. I'll be here.

207
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,453
You already
started on her chest.

208
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,938
The sooner I see a head CT...

209
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,274
We got here first. I will wait.

210
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,861
Okay, easy. Easy.

211
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,413
Whoa. It's way harder
than the simulator.

212
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,136
Yeah. That's all
right. That's all right.

213
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,467
You'll get it back.
Just concentrate.

214
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,258
Yeah. How does it feel?

215
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:58,905
It's amazing. Yeah?

216
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,528
Friggin' hard.

217
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,742
If I had a dollar for every time
you said that about something,

218
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,376
I'd buy a whole
robot leg factory.

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,551
Suck it, Schultz. He's jealous.

220
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,860
You'll see, man.

221
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,004
You just wait.

222
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,009
I got it. I got it.

223
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,294
Let me go.

224
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,445
You got it.

225
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,278
Don't fall, now. Schultz.

226
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,853
Sweet!

227
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,670
Can I do the stairs?
That's enough for one day.

228
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:32,526
They don't think you can.

229
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,231
I got this. No. No.
Seriously, don't.

230
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,444
No!

231
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,769
Jordan!

232
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,340
We're gonna need neuro now!

233
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,038
Could be just a concussion,
but it's acting like a bleed.

234
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,540
I've already called CT.

235
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,908
He's gonna be okay, right?

236
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,344
Sir, he's my best friend.
He's got to make it.

237
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,590
We're gonna take care of him.

238
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,725
I'll meet you in the OR?

239
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,148
No. Stay with Rick.
You've done enough.

240
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,903
Is it my fault?

241
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,573
Did I push him too hard?

242
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,598
Can I get a 3D vascular
reconstruction, too?

243
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,691
Do you need that? We need
the images that we need.

244
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:26,898
In your opinion.

245
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,517
I'll be right back.

246
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,464
Derek, why are you
pushing back on this?

247
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,565
Pierce and I both agree...

248
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,755
I'm sorry, but I
think you're wrong,

249
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,557
and she called
me for an opinion.

250
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:39,304
She called me for an opinion,
as well. Of course she did.

251
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,128
She probably thought
you could talk me down.

252
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,865
I need a 3D pericardial
reconstruction, please.

253
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,908
Hey.

254
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,671
Look at this. No. Look at that.

255
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,178
He doesn't even
eat with me anymore.

256
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,213
Grey is in my bed
and my bathroom.

257
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,866
I used to eat with my
boyfriend at that table.

258
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,950
Am I being weird?

259
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,470
So, I did an ultrasound
on April Kepner today.

260
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,154
Okay, that's
weirder, way weirder.

261
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,056
It could have been your baby.

262
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,975
Jo, don't talk.

263
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,922
I'm really bad at these,
and I'm pretty sure I'm wrong,

264
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,226
but I think something's wrong
with Jackson and April's baby.

265
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,646
Man, your husband
can really dig in his heels.

266
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,499
You shouldn't have called me. He's
digging in his heels to piss me off.

267
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,606
Or maybe it's a
you thing. Stop it.

268
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,243
I'm just saying, you got
heels, too. You dig. I've seen it.

269
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,788
She agreed with
me to piss him off?

270
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,145
Takes two to tango.

271
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,809
I agreed with you
because you're right.

272
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,076
But you shouldn't
have called me,

273
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,945
not if you think I
can sweet-talk Derek.

274
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,680
I called you because
you're the best surgeon.

275
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,881
Why would you say that?

276
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:39,987
See? It is a you thing.

277
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,322
What's the matter
with you? Nothing.

278
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,125
I have a patient who got hurt,
and Hunt thinks it's my fault.

279
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,009
I'm divorced again, and
Arizona thinks it's my fault.

280
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,273
And basically I destroy
whatever I touch.

281
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,084
So, by "nothing," you
meant "everything."

282
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,010
Scans are ready.

283
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,036
You gonna pull a muscle.

284
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,549
What are you talking about?

285
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,624
Yuck. Trying to pretend
you're not staring at Pierce.

286
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,493
Your left eye is gonna
pop out of your head.

287
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,924
Ugh! I don't know
what else to do.

288
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,432
I apologized, which
she seemed to hear.

289
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:26,400
But the next move is hers.

290
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,382
At this point, I just have to sit
here and wait for her to come to me.

291
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:30,605
Oh, good idea.

292
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,840
Just sit still and
stare like a creep.

293
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,193
That'll get you nothing
more than hardened arteries

294
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,661
and a restraining order.

295
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,164
What is that?

296
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,326
And why on earth do
you keep drinking it?

297
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,517
It's a kale smoothie.
It's healthy.

298
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,635
Kale's a superfood.
It looks like bile.

299
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,522
Doesn't taste much better.

300
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm just gonna stay
out of Pierce's way.

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,993
Hey, uh, Richard, do
you have a moment?

302
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,679
Yeah, I might. Can I have
you look at something?

303
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,883
How's he look?

304
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,753
CT showed a multifocal
hemorrhage with some edema.

305
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,432
I'll know more
once I'm in there,

306
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,967
but he's gonna need
a full craniotomy.

307
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,975
All right. Page me
when you're out, okay?

308
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,044
I feel like I owe
you an explanation.

309
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
About what you heard last week.

310
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,426
You don't need...

311
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,684
I had a pill
problem. I got clean.

312
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,520
Two years ago, I relapsed,

313
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,122
and for a brief
time, I got into oxy

314
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,808
and then shooting oxy.

315
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,594
I lost someone. Um...

316
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,791
That was rock bottom, and I
have been clean ever since.

317
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,143
Listen, Derek told me everything
I need, so you don't have...

318
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,103
I work for you and I
respect you and I like you,

319
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,404
so if it's all right,

320
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:38,706
I don't care to hang my
professional relationships

321
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,708
on Derek Shepherd's reputation.

322
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,811
I needed you to hear it from me.

323
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,164
I know it's a choice,
keeping me on.

324
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,883
I know I'm a risk.

325
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,185
We're all a risk.

326
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,521
We all have something.

327
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,758
I mean, I have my own version.

328
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:01,829
And it was different.
It took a different toll.

329
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:05,249
It still does, and I
push through every day.

330
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,263
And I'm assuming you're
doing the same thing,

331
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,454
unless I see otherwise.

332
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,355
Okay? Okay.

333
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,307
Look at how the air is tracking
through the fascial planes.

334
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,708
We'll have to
debride the neck, too.

335
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,159
We should have
been in there already.

336
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:22,561
You're scrubbing
in with me, right?

337
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:23,851
Of course.

338
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,147
Any word from your husband?

339
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,121
No, but when he sees
these, he'll come around.

340
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,391
Pierce, is this your
mediastinitis girl?

341
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,660
That is a massive infection.
This is just in a week?

342
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,708
Yeah, that thing
moves like a track star.

343
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,044
Have you seen the repeat brain
scans yet? Any increase there?

344
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,068
No, but it's already
invading the pericardium.

345
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,098
Yeah, but it's tricky, though.

346
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,682
We should wait until we talk
to Derek, see what they found.

347
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:46,390
Sorry. "We"? Wait.
Why are you here?

348
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,937
Derek asked me to have a look.

349
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,905
Why? He wanted a second opinion.

350
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,379
Of course. Any opinion but mine.

351
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,027
Just do it. I don't think I can.

352
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,234
It's bad, and I'm not
good at doing bad stuff.

353
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,704
Will you do it? What am I doing?

354
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,990
I can't tell you. It's so bad.
Then what am I doing here?

355
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:04,303
You know what? I
don't want to know.

356
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,404
Whatever it is, you can do it.

357
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,828
Just do it. Okay. Okay.

358
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,800
Hi. Um, this is Dr. Robbins.

359
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:17,038
I'm Amelia Shepherd's
fellow at Grey-Sloan.

360
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,773
Um, yeah. I'm calling about
a patient of Dr. Weaver's.

361
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,309
Nicole Herman?

362
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,077
Yep. Uh-huh. No. I'll wait.

363
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,081
She is? Oh, great, great.

364
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,615
Um, Dr. Herman is requesting

365
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:32,353
that her neuro records
be sent to Dr. Shepherd.

366
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,156
Yeah, yeah,
histories, scans, CTs.

367
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,092
You know what? Actually,
could you send it all?

368
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,893
Yeah. Care of Robbins.

369
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,695
Thank you. Thank you so much.

370
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,532
Oh... Thanks for
taking the time.

371
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,733
Yeah, I don't
have a lot of time.

372
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,134
Then I'll cut to the chase.

373
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,371
I was told not to come back
to DC without a "yes" from you.

374
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,755
And I have a dog who's gonna
starve, so I have to get back.

375
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,032
Help me out.

376
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,045
What kind of dog do you
have? Springer spaniel.

377
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,701
Damn it. That's a good dog.

378
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,832
Deborah, I'd like to
help you out, I would,

379
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,606
but turning down this post was

380
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,026
the hardest decision
I ever had to make.

381
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,727
And I made that
choice for my family.

382
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,429
I know he will understand that.

383
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,033
Yes.

384
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,112
He's just a hard
man to say no to.

385
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:24,438
I know, but I did it, and
I know it can be done.

386
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,723
Good luck.

387
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,045
Hi. Did you get
anything messengered

388
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,989
for, um, Dr. Shepherd? A chart?

389
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,221
It might have been
addressed to Dr. Robbins.

390
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,249
Mmm... I don't...
Looking for this?

391
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,076
Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,544
Thanks.

393
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,930
Is this our Nicole Herman?

394
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,382
Dr. Herman?

395
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,384
What's going on?

396
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,554
It's bad, right?

397
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,591
It's spectacular, a big, bad
mother of an astrocytoma.

398
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,380
See how it ignores
the anatomical borders?

399
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,173
It's like a perfect butterfly.

400
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,908
Look, it starts
in the subfrontal

401
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,649
and extends practically
into the hypothalamus.

402
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,953
That is a thing of beauty.

403
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,606
Is she showing symptoms?
No. No, but she's...

404
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,376
Wait. What kind of
symptoms would they be?

405
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,745
Oh, God. With this, it
could be almost anything

406
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,814
from dizziness, headaches,

407
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,150
uh, vision loss,
inappropriate sexual behavior,

408
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,436
impulse control
stuff, fatigue...

409
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,004
Fatigue?

410
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,972
Uh...

411
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,787
She texted me earlier to say that
she needed to lie down for a while.

412
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,828
Arizona, who else knows about
this? People know about this, right?

413
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,431
Yeah, everybody who
needs to know knows.

414
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,666
But she'd prefer
discretion, you know.

415
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,246
If you could just
keep it to yourself...

416
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,938
Of course. I'm a locked box.

417
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,658
Thanks. See you.

418
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:54,061
Based on the information we have,
we'd like to take Holly to surgery now

419
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,531
to get out as much of the
chest infection as possible.

420
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,501
Wait. Wasn't there talk
about brain surgery?

421
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:01,914
We feel we can't
wait any longer.

422
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,137
My throat hurts.

423
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,250
Can we get her some water?

424
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,023
Not before surgery.

425
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,936
Mom, I just want to go
home. Please take me home.

426
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Whatever you think is best.
Just tell us what to do. We'll listen.

427
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,925
Dr. Pierce's approach
is the way to go.

428
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,527
Let's take care of
that chest infection,

429
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:16,094
and then we'll do
the brain surgery.

430
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,672
Holly? Holly?

431
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,374
What's happening to her?

432
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,687
Step out of the way, please.

433
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,544
Holly.

434
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,956
Her airway's completely closed,

435
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,224
and she's too
swollen to intubate.

436
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,893
I need a crash cart
and a crike tray now!

437
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,157
Right away!

438
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,673
Shepherd said he's
in a coma. Yeah.

439
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,663
Early signs of herniation.

440
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,699
It's impossible to tell
how deep the damage is,

441
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,084
and there's no signs
of him coming around.

442
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,672
I told you.

443
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,902
Hey, I didn't push him.

444
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:58,454
I know you think I did, but
they pushed each other.

445
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,372
You should have stopped
them. Owen, they're...

446
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,557
You know these guys. There's...

447
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,159
You don't know the
first thing about them.

448
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,432
You don't know what
risk means to them.

449
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,153
Jordan is a 22-year-old kid
who's asked to defuse bombs

450
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,155
left in a supermarket
filled with families.

451
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,457
That's risk to them.

452
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,926
These guys have to
decide in an instant

453
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,762
whether the person
they're about to shoot

454
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,747
is an insurgent with a pistol

455
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,582
or a school kid
with a cellphone.

456
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,184
That's risk.

457
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:26,787
So, no, they don't see the
danger in stepping up on a stair.

458
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,176
You should have stopped him.

459
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,626
Dr. Herman?

460
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,565
Dr. Herman...

461
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,125
Robbins. Occupied.

462
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,845
Sorry.

463
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:56,661
Trach tube and dilator.

464
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:57,863
We got you. We got you.

465
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,120
What happened?

466
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,799
We lost her airway,
so Pierce criked her.

467
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,255
This is what I
was worried about.

468
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,719
This is why I'm
taking her to surgery.

469
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,986
Pierce, I think Derek's right.

470
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,593
What are you even doing here?

471
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,307
Pierce, the steroids you gave
her may have ruptured her abscess.

472
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:10,665
There's no evidence of
that, and she is hypotensive.

473
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,851
Pierce, with respect, I have
been here longer than you.

474
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,799
You asked for my
advice. You ignored it.

475
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,471
We're doing this. It's done.

476
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,774
You take over.

477
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,810
Book an OR.

478
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,112
As soon as she is
stable, I am taking her up.

479
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,942
Excuse me. Derek,
you cannot just...

480
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,844
Meredith, I am begging you.
This is not about you and me.

481
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,884
This is about this
girl. If we don't do this,

482
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,481
her mother is gonna be bathing
and feeding her for the rest of her life.

483
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,724
I am sure of this. And as
sure as you are, I am, too.

484
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,470
You are pulling rank
here. Meredith, listen.

485
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,355
And you don't have rank to
pull. From what I saw on the...

486
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,841
I mean, can we all agree that
this is Dr. Pierce's patient here?

487
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,149
She is the department
head, and Derek is not,

488
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,179
so if there's any
rank to pull, it's hers.

489
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:49,484
So, what would you
like to do, Dr. Pierce?

490
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,594
Let's take her up.

491
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,447
How long has that
been happening?

492
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,755
None of your business.

493
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,257
How long? Was it
sudden? Was it just today?

494
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,570
It's happened more than once.

495
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:13,754
You're jealous.

496
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,036
Okay. It stops now. No more.

497
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,158
You're taking advantage of her.

498
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,515
I beg your pardon.

499
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,328
She's the one in the
power position here.

500
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,279
She suggested it.
I'm just scoring points.

501
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,970
Oh, God, shut up.

502
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,183
Dr. Robbins?

503
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:26,017
You could try. She's
pretty open to ideas.

504
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,374
Go away. Go away, Graham.

505
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,254
Dr. Robbins, I just need
you to look at this ultrasound.

506
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,944
Yeah. Oh... Sure.

507
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,453
Is it what I think it is?
I mean, it's not, right?

508
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,883
Yeah, it could be,
type II or III maybe.

509
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,602
Oh, God. What's the matter?

510
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,449
I shouldn't say.
Or maybe I should.

511
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,057
I don't know. Tell
me what to do.

512
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,654
This is April Kepner's baby. I
haven't told her. I haven't told Jackson.

513
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,023
I didn't know what to do. I
just wanted us to be sure.

514
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,391
Don't mention it
to either of them.

515
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,500
I'll, uh... I'll ask Herman.

516
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:53,817
Because maybe we're wrong?

517
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,986
I hope so.

518
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:03,911
So, what happens now?

519
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,180
Well, listen, take some time.

520
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,551
And we'll get you up
as soon as you're ready.

521
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,854
I'll be ready when
Jordan's awake.

522
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:15,990
He's going first.

523
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,408
How long till he can walk?

524
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,753
We're not sure
when he'll wake up.

525
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,461
It could be days, months.

526
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,674
I'm not just gonna
give up on him.

527
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,213
Oh, that's if we're lucky.

528
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,050
Look, I know. I know
how bad you feel.

529
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,886
I do.

530
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,899
But it doesn't mean that you
should give up on the possibility

531
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,222
of walking yourself.

532
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,785
I'm sure that Jordan
wouldn't want you to.

533
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,360
Yeah? You know what he wants?

534
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,861
See, he's my best friend.

535
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,341
Oh, no, no, no. I
didn't mean it like that.

536
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,398
See, when I got
shipped home to rehab,

537
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,201
I was ready to give up.

538
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,253
I wanted to quit every day.

539
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,739
But Jordan...

540
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,310
he had this stupid
plastic football

541
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,113
that he'd just throw at
me every time I'd complain.

542
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,350
At my face, hard.

543
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:05,922
And every day, I
got a little bit better

544
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,125
just so I could
throw it back at him.

545
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,911
He saved my life.

546
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,782
He's gonna wake up.

547
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,484
And when he does, he's
not gonna see that I...

548
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:21,438
That I stole what's
his, what he earned.

549
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,435
I am so sorry, but we
just... We don't know how...

550
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,526
What are we to you?
What are we, trash?

551
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,596
He broke, so you just throw him
away, move on to the next one?

552
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,048
Screw that.

553
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,419
He's gonna wake up. Rick. Rick.

554
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,742
Are you okay?

555
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,922
Uh...

556
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,673
I will be. I will be.

557
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,812
Could... Could we just pretend

558
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,592
that everything between
you and I is okay,

559
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,916
just for a little bit?

560
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,224
I could use that.

561
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,252
Yeah.

562
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:18,323
I feel like everything is going wrong,
and I have no idea what to do about it.

563
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:20,781
I feel...

564
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,234
like every single thing
I am doing is wrong.

565
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,693
You will figure
it out. You will.

566
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:35,696
You will, too.

567
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:38,815
Thanks.

568
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:52,262
Do you miss me at all?

569
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,965
Of course.

570
00:23:56,752 --> 00:24:00,888
Just not enough.

571
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,845
This infection is a lot
deeper than the CT showed.

572
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,569
How are you doing? Okay.

573
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,905
It's really adhered to
her ascending aorta.

574
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:20,118
Be careful. I'm coming
across a lot of adhesions.

575
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,386
I think this would
be a lot easier

576
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,170
without those two
breathing down our necks.

577
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,845
Welcome to my life.

578
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,901
That girl's brain could
be herniating right now.

579
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,664
She thinks I've been
working against her.

580
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,422
And to be truthful,

581
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,692
I have given her plenty
of reason to believe that.

582
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,079
But that is not the case
right here. I swear it.

583
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,814
Yeah, I know.

584
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,029
And I know how
frustrating it can be

585
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,953
when someone chooses
only to see you one way.

586
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,422
They're both so
much like their mother.

587
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,892
You really screwed
me here, with Pierce.

588
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,806
First the dinner, now
this. You know that, right?

589
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,697
Yeah. Sorry about that.

590
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,844
She's bradying.
Constrictive pericarditis.

591
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,746
I'm gonna have to strip
the entire pericardium.

592
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,864
Grey. I'm here.

593
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,122
Dry laps and a 15 blade, please.

594
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,430
Are they still watching?
You can count on it.

595
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,512
Hey, um, Dr. Edwards and I would
like you to look at an ultrasound.

596
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:21,713
Have to be later.

597
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,932
Got paged for an
emergency C. You'll assist.

598
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,236
Uh, will you excuse us, please?

599
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,073
Come find me later.

600
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,542
You spoke to Graham?

601
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,513
You spoke to
Graham? I was worried.

602
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:35,849
Robbins, I don't know how
many orgasms I have left in life,

603
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,284
but it may be fewer
than flavors of ice cream,

604
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:40,220
so I can't spare any.

605
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,455
Stop stealing my orgasms.

606
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:45,158
I didn't try... And stop
invading my privacy.

607
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,776
I was worried about you.

608
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,824
It's not your business to be
worried. I'm a doctor. It's my nature.

609
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,232
And you're sick.
And I want to help.

610
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,635
I want to keep you and
our patients out of danger,

611
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,887
and I just found you having
a quickie with Graham.

612
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,638
Graham, okay?

613
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:00,685
And I have a hard time believing
that that's not a symptom,

614
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,843
and also, it's
against hospital rules.

615
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:05,390
Robbins, when you have an
expiration date of five months,

616
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:09,216
it's amazing how many rules
you don't give a damn about.

617
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:12,702
Graham is a nominal surgeon,
and he's a complete tool,

618
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:17,024
but he's young, he's attractive,
and he's very physically fit.

619
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:20,327
What you saw was not
a symptom of a tumor.

620
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:24,164
It was a symptom of dying soon.

621
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,400
So I'm gonna screw as
many Grahams as I can.

622
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,422
And I totally support that.

623
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,158
C-section. Let's go.

624
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,046
You paged me 911?

625
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,825
Is it a me thing?
Is what a you thing?

626
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,378
God, can you keep something
in your head for like two seconds?

627
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,280
Me and Derek and this patient.

628
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,071
Am I just digging
in because it's him?

629
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,873
911 for this?

630
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,120
I was telling a mom her 5-year-old
has a spinal malformation.

631
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,384
I need two minutes.

632
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,345
Two minutes.

633
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,808
And promise me you won't
crash in my bed tonight.

634
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,977
Because we saved this
patient from organ failure,

635
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,234
but now she could wake
up with brain damage.

636
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,543
What if you were right?

637
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:05,366
What if he wasn't being a
stubborn, pig-faced jackass?

638
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,869
What if it is me? Take
Shepherd out of the equation.

639
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,539
If it was another doctor you were
going up against, if it was me or...

640
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,223
Someone who was
really good, like Bailey?

641
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,998
Would you have made the
same decision for your patient

642
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,516
if it wasn't him?

643
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,206
Thank you. Sure. And bite me.

644
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,858
I ended up taking a
stand against Pierce.

645
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:28,273
That doesn't sound like
staying out of her way.

646
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:31,098
Ah, I didn't know what I
was getting myself into.

647
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,665
I thought it was just a consult.

648
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,767
Shepherd screwed me again.

649
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:37,076
I don't care for the
way that sounds.

650
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,342
Where are you going?
Up. I got my wrist thingy on.

651
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,344
I've got to get my
billion steps a day.

652
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,114
I feel like I'm making a bunch
of steps in the wrong direction.

653
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,927
Maybe I should
apologize to Pierce.

654
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,017
Apologize?

655
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,086
Haven't you apologized
enough already?

656
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,522
You are a good
man, a great surgeon.

657
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,792
You shouldn't be turning yourself
inside out for her or anybody else.

658
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,110
You deserve better.

659
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,190
And if she can't see that,
she doesn't deserve you.

660
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,959
I'm just afraid I've undone
the progress I've already made.

661
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,449
Okay. Now I'm bored,

662
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,586
bored with kale smoothies
and walking up stairs

663
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,949
and listening to you
talk about Pierce.

664
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:12,733
You sound like a broken record.

665
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,908
Sorry.

666
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:16,443
Kale rage talking.

667
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,811
But I'm not wrong.

668
00:28:19,315 --> 00:28:20,547
Do not follow me.

669
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,638
Shepherd, you were
looking for us? Yes.

670
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,841
Uh, Jordan's awake.
He came around.

671
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,504
Thank God. That's great.

672
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:36,580
Wait. He is awake
but unresponsive.

673
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,359
There's no new or
recurrent hemorrhage,

674
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,512
but it's too soon to know
how much function he'll regain

675
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:43,003
or if there will be
deficits. I'm sorry.

676
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,188
Does he have people,
besides his friend?

677
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,924
His parents are in Florida.
They're on their way.

678
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,220
Hunt, can I talk to you outside?

679
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,360
Sure.

680
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:00,437
You have people, right?
What do you mean?

681
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,441
I just mean... I mean,
you're not trying to...

682
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,593
It's hard to deal with
all this stuff on your own.

683
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,861
But you have Meredith
and Derek, so...

684
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,597
Yeah.

685
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,532
And meetings.

686
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:15,385
I'm pushing through.
That's what we do.

687
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,519
Right.

688
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:19,939
Do you?

689
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,979
Have people? I'm... That's...

690
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:28,281
Um, I'm fine. No, I know.

691
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,750
But you're right there,

692
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:33,219
living in that little tin box
on my brother's back lawn.

693
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean, I keep saying
I'm gonna move out,

694
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:35,856
but I'm still up at the
house, watching them

695
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,441
glare at each other.

696
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,829
Let me know if you, you
know, if you need people.

697
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:44,397
I'm around. Thanks.

698
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,317
And thanks for the update.

699
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,978
I don't think I can do this. I
think I need to take a step back.

700
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,965
What do you mean? The
program, the vets. I'm...

701
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,267
You were right, Owen.
I don't know these guys.

702
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,918
I'm trying to help them.

703
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,066
I'm ruining their lives.
It was an accident.

704
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,968
I know I was angry,
but you can't just stop.

705
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:12,120
Rick says he won't move
forward until Jordan's all right.

706
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,711
Callie, that is... Jordan
might not be all right.

707
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:17,041
And I'm not just gonna throw Rick
aside and move on to someone else.

708
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,332
I can't do that.

709
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,245
So you're gonna just stop
'cause things got hard?

710
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,837
'Cause you're hurt?
That is not acceptable.

711
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,588
You push through it.

712
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,635
You're not gonna give up
on the program or on Rick.

713
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,504
Get him back here.
Owen, for what?

714
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,606
Get him back here, and... I
don't want to give him false hope.

715
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,012
Then give him real hope.

716
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,983
Okay. Okay. I get it.

717
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:40,086
Stop throwing the
football at my face.

718
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,788
What?

719
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,925
Nothing. It worked.

720
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,584
Okay, Claire, I need
to do a neuro check.

721
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,536
I thought you said the
surgery was successful.

722
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,918
We just have to make sure there
was no problem with the brain abscess.

723
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,642
She could have brain
damage? He's just making sure.

724
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:03,893
Can you follow this?

725
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,649
Can you give me a good squeeze?

726
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,189
Try and squeeze.

727
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,776
Is she okay?

728
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,532
Dr. Shepherd?
From what I can see...

729
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,603
You know, actually,
why don't we ask her?

730
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:31,471
Holly, how are you feeling?

731
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,722
Her second surgery for the
brain abscess will be tomorrow,

732
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,057
but I don't foresee
any problems.

733
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:53,694
Thank you so much.

734
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,094
Mmm-hmm.

735
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:58,115
Doctors.

736
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,022
Nice work delivering
the placenta.

737
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,590
Your sutures need
improvement, which is surprising.

738
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,970
Now? Yes. Um...

739
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,805
We need to show
you an ultrasound.

740
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,607
Uh, I... I don't trust myself,

741
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,492
and Robbins thinks
we might be wrong.

742
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,950
Robbins, a fetal surgeon
who can't read an ultrasound

743
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,718
is like a chef who
can't boil water.

744
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,964
Just tell me what
I'm looking at.

745
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,874
What do you think
it is? I'm asking you.

746
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,476
I want to know what
you think you know.

747
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm concerned that it's
osteogenesis imperfecta.

748
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:35,864
Define it, please. A
congenital birth defect

749
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:37,565
in which the child
has fragile bones

750
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,501
that are easily broken
and for no reason.

751
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,007
With the more fatal cases,

752
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,804
sometimes you can
see the fractures in utero.

753
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,428
I assume that we're
wrong. I mean, it's so rare.

754
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,596
What makes you suspect it?

755
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,831
Size and mineralization
of the head,

756
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,352
no movement in the fetus,
short femurs that haven't grown.

757
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,104
Prognosis?

758
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,540
That's what I'm asking you.

759
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,443
It's very sad.

760
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,963
If it is, indeed, type II and
the infant survives birth,

761
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,800
they don't usually live more
than a couple of days or weeks.

762
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:10,954
Robbins, someone you know?

763
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,063
A friend.

764
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,591
I'm very, very sorry.

765
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,872
There's got to be
something we can do.

766
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,663
I mean, what can I do?

767
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,566
Be there for her.

768
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,220
Oh! Uh, Edwards!

769
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,008
I forgive you. You... Why?

770
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,927
For spilling the beans
about our little Buddha boy.

771
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,513
It was an honest mistake,
and I was a total jerk.

772
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:55,615
I'm honestly kind
of glad to know.

773
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,702
I'm gonna tell
Jackson tonight. Okay.

774
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,236
Um, well...

775
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,291
I'm sorry.

776
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,361
Uh... Like I said,
it's really okay.

777
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,136
You're really committing
to this thing, aren't you?

778
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,525
Got to get my steps in.

779
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,772
Dr. Webber! Ooh, look
who's coming around.

780
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,129
Do not apologize.

781
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:30,550
You sided with
Shepherd today. I did.

782
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,553
I want to know why.
Pierce, it was a coin toss.

783
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,004
Could have gone either way.

784
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,207
But, uh, I'm glad it went yours.

785
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,227
I'm not asking for
an "attaboy" here.

786
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:44,542
You really didn't think the lesions in
her chest warranted immediate care?

787
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:47,233
Absolutely. But
it was a catch-22,

788
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,786
so I did a quick
risk/benefit analysis,

789
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:53,072
outcome measurements,
adverse effects.

790
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,908
It makes quite a
quantitative list.

791
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,175
Really?

792
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,477
It's not infallible, obviously,

793
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:00,380
but it's right most of the time.

794
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:04,300
May I see it? No.
I do it in my head.

795
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,519
All of... All of that?

796
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:09,089
Well, uh, I had lots
of years of practice.

797
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:12,597
I'd be very interested in going over
that list with you if you have time.

798
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,361
Um...

799
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,031
You know, now's
not a great time,

800
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,818
but, you know, maybe I could
catch up with you in the morning

801
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,337
or we could grab coffee.

802
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:27,173
I would appreciate
that. Thank you.

803
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,866
Can you hurry up?

804
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,734
Hang on. It's Meredith.

805
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,503
She and Shepherd
are having a thing.

806
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,116
Oh, do you want to wait for her?

807
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,952
We could give her
a ride to our place,

808
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,853
save her the trouble
of coming over later.

809
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,312
You could tuck her in, leave
a little mint on her pillow.

810
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,114
Come on. She's
not there that much.

811
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,849
She's always in our bed.

812
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:55,062
And now Arizona
is in our shower.

813
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,954
I actually feel like I'm
part of a commune.

814
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,290
Shut up. Look, I told
you it's your house, too.

815
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,187
Yeah, apparently, you
say that to all the girls.

816
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,778
Listen, that house
was always open.

817
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,315
Even when Mer hated
me, I could be there.

818
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,817
People went through their
crap, they needed a place to be,

819
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,035
they came there.

820
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,004
You should understand
that more than anybody.

821
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,657
And as long as I'm the...

822
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,260
It stays open, all right?

823
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,597
All right.

824
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,300
And come on.

825
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,502
You in my bed and
Meredith in my bed

826
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,937
are two really different things.

827
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:33,134
They better be. What,
you need me to prove it?

828
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,424
Uh-huh.

829
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,172
Where are you going?

830
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,560
I think I need more convincing.

831
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,826
Come on!

832
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:04,955
Can I?

833
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,225
Go for it.

834
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,872
Hey.

835
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,318
There you are.
Listen, I think...

836
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,320
I got your page. Why
are you down here?

837
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,311
Wait. What are you doing?

838
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,124
You told me to be
discreet, so I set up in here.

839
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,498
Nobody comes down here.
No. No. Take them down.

840
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,912
Why? Give it back.
Just give it all back.

841
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,087
If she finds me with
these, she will kill me.

842
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,783
Just... You know what?
Forget that I ever told you.

843
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,885
I thought you said that everybody
who needed to know knew.

844
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,589
Yeah, and that's
her and that's me,

845
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,361
and she doesn't know
that I know all of this, okay?

846
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,665
She cannot find out that
I stole these. Arizona...

847
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,612
I thought that she was
dangerous and reckless,

848
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,103
and it turns out
that she's just dying.

849
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,032
And she's alone and she's smart

850
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:57,535
and she's funny and horny
and lonely. Arizona, listen...

851
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,537
And she deserves to
die however she wants to.

852
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,372
And I know what to look
for now, and I can watch her.

853
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,524
And she deserves to die with
whatever dignity she can possibly...

854
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,381
Arizona, shut up
and listen to me!

855
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,353
I think I can remove this
tumor. I think I can save her life.

856
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,875
Dr. Herman?

857
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,844
Can I just ask you
about these scans again?

858
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:20,580
Oh, yes. Good catch,
by the way. Sharp eye.

859
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,582
Is there really nothing
to help their baby?

860
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:25,818
I mean, if anyone knows
some way to help them, it's you.

861
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,065
Edwards, I wish I
could tell you there was,

862
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:32,058
but it wouldn't
serve you or them.

863
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,427
Cases like this are
usually hopeless.

864
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:38,381
This baby would have a very
short, painful life. I'm sorry.

865
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,916
So cute, sitting
like a little Buddha.

866
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,740
What was that about?

867
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,858
I can get the kids if you
want to just go home.

868
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:56,348
Did you remember Zola's
coat? You forgot it yesterday.

869
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,017
I remembered the coat.

870
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,086
She can't keep going out in the
cold if she doesn't have a coat.

871
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:03,200
She has the coat.
Yesterday you forgot it.

872
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:06,242
I remembered the damn
coat. Why don't you trust me?

873
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,995
For God's sakes, Meredith,
of course I trust you.

874
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,914
Why did you call Richard
today for a second opinion?

875
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,461
If that had been
any other surgeon,

876
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,845
Dr. Bailey, would
you have done it?

877
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,619
It was a surgical consult.

878
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,932
It doesn't matter whether
it's a surgical consult or a coat.

879
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,802
You don't trust me, and all
you want to do is fight me.

880
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,037
I don't want to fight with you,

881
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,738
but I'm not gonna
compromise myself, Meredith,

882
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,440
just because you think I...
You've already done that.

883
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,559
You've already compromised
yourself and diminished yourself for me.

884
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,480
I feel that, your pissiness
and your resentment, Derek.

885
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,638
You know why? Do you
know why I resent you?

886
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,385
Because you've never
had my back on this,

887
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,442
not since the day I
told you I would stay.

888
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,194
I told you that you and the
kids were more important.

889
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:44,564
You have been determined
to prove me wrong,

890
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,199
that this is the wrong choice.

891
00:39:46,268 --> 00:39:48,179
I have proven it, because
you can't be happy here.

892
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:50,964
You diminish everyone
around you. I did this for you.

893
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,322
I gave up everything for you.

894
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,174
There it is. Everything.

895
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:56,909
You gave up everything.

896
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,058
That was everything to you?

897
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,364
Where are you going?

898
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,368
<i>Nobody's memory
is perfect or complete.</i>

899
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,057
<i>We jumble things up.</i>

900
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,493
<i>We lose track of time.</i>

901
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,395
Derek, slow down. No. I'm done.

902
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,663
I'm not gonna do this
anymore, this constant battling.

903
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:19,877
I'm not battling, but I just
am not gonna let you just...

904
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:21,845
Yes. Yes, you think
I'm some sort of tyrant

905
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:23,102
determined to keep you down.

906
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,604
You keep you down,
and now I'm paying for it.

907
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,234
And I don't know how to fix it.

908
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,719
You should have just gone to DC.

909
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:30,093
Is that what you want?

910
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,405
Because that door is wide open.

911
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,262
That's what you want!

912
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:36,615
Meredith, they offered
me the job again today.

913
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,818
I could take this job right now.

914
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:40,607
<i>We are in one place...</i>

915
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,302
Derek. MEREDITH: Derek.

916
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:45,486
Right. Meredith.

917
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:48,060
<i>Then another.</i>

918
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:52,749
You should. Take it.

919
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,326
Deborah, it's Dr. Shepherd.
Glad I could catch you.

920
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:06,312
It was great that
you came by today.

921
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,982
Please tell the President I would
be thrilled to accept the post.

922
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:11,918
Yes, absolutely.

923
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,970
We can talk more then.

924
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,271
I look forward to it.
I will see you soon.

925
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,771
Good. Go. Oh, I'm going.

926
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:24,046
No. I mean it. Go now.

927
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:27,583
<i>And it all feels like one
long, inescapable moment.</i>

928
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,718
Go.

929
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,421
<i>So, what does it mean?</i>

930
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,534
Richard!

931
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,238
<i>What do we take away?</i>

932
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,645
<i>Which pieces will haunt us?</i>

933
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:44,066
And I was jealous.

934
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,468
So I ruined it.

935
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,636
<i>Hurt us?</i>

936
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:48,437
Richard!

937
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,642
<i>End us?</i>

938
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,196
<i>Inspire us?</i>

939
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,683
He's very dreamy.
But he is not the sun.

940
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,068
You are.

941
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:05,633
<i>It's just like my
mother used to say.</i>

942
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,690
<i>"The carousel
never stops turning.</i>

943
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,514
<i>"You can't get off."</i>
