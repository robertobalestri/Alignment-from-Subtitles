1
00:00:02,886 --> 00:00:04,787
<i>Trauma is messy.</i>

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,254
<i>Chaotic.</i>

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,790
<i>Looking at a body that's
been reduced to a bloody pulp,</i>

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>it might seem difficult
to know where to start.</i>

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,982
Edwards, got a
vomiter in bed five.

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,450
Rule out obstruction, please?

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,085
Yay!

8
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,764
How we doing? Good,
she's in all right shape,

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,687
but she's complaining
about abdominal pains. Okay.

10
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,556
Kepner, what do you have?

11
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,502
MVC, bed three. Shepherd's
doing a neuro consult,

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,686
but she just started
complaining of stomach pain.

13
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,895
Dr. Pierce!

14
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,274
Busy morning.
Yeah, when it rains.

15
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,976
Can you go see chest
pains in bed six, please?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,867
Got it.

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,113
<i>Luckily, some very clever
person developed a protocol,</i>

18
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,205
<i>the ABCs. Airway,
breathing, circulation.</i>

19
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,808
20-something female carjacking
victim. Multiple lacs and contusions,

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,879
open tibia fracture,
hypotensive and tachycardic.

21
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,680
This was a carjacking?

22
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,493
And a hell of a beating.
Wilson, you're with me.

23
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,628
<i>The ABCs keep your patient alive</i>

24
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,553
<i>so you can figure out how
to tackle the rest of the mess.</i>

25
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,367
<i>If only all life's
problems could be</i>

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,641
<i>solved with an intubation tube.</i>

27
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,242
They took my car!

28
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,911
Shh, shh, shh. They took my...

29
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:04,797
What's your name?

30
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,614
Melissa. My car...

31
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,245
Melissa, I'm sure
your car's fine.

32
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,779
We're gonna take
care of you, okay?

33
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,903
Wilson, go see if anyone
came in with her, okay?

34
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:12,972
Okay.

35
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,696
I think you're fine, but
I want to make sure.

36
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,263
Let's do a head CT. To be safe.

37
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,732
Right away.

38
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,978
Let's get an
abdominal CT, as well.

39
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,112
Mmm-hmm.

40
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:29,071
Dr. Grey, I have your... Our...

41
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:31,389
Ellis' journals.

42
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,808
You went through them already?

43
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:35,260
Yeah, I've had them for a while.

44
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,345
I got a good sense
of her as a surgeon,

45
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,897
if not as a person.

46
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,232
So, thank you.

47
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,367
Sure.

48
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,468
Okay.

49
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,805
She still calls you "Dr. Grey"?

50
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,357
That's my name.

51
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,309
We should invite
her over. For dinner.

52
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,378
Why?

53
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,596
She's family. Ish.

54
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,431
Dinner tomorrow night.
It's what people do.

55
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,099
What people?

56
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:02,270
Dr. Hunt in trauma one
needs an ortho consult.

57
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,772
On it.

58
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,473
April.

59
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,353
Hey, I thought you
were on the... In the...

60
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,395
Yeah, your mom's flight got
in early, so I brought her here.

61
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,558
Why would you do that?

62
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:12,692
'Cause she wanted to see you.

63
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,093
I set her up in the
attendings' lounge.

64
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,361
Just give me a page
when you get a second.

65
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,319
Uh, I... Love you!

66
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,716
Sorry, what was I saying?

67
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,251
This is where
you've been staying?

68
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,919
I figured you'd
gone to a hotel, or...

69
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,954
Yeah, well, Herman's been
breathing down my neck day and night.

70
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,378
This is easier.

71
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,725
Plus, where I sleep is no
longer any of your concern.

72
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,428
I didn't kick you out. I
never said that you had to go.

73
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,696
No, no, you just
made it very clear

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,397
that my being around
you was suffocating.

75
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,907
Okay, well, have
you told anyone?

76
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,653
No. Have you? No.

77
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,004
I... Do you think
that we should?

78
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,363
Can we just not yet?

79
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,781
Whatever you want.

80
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,750
I didn't want any of this.

81
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,819
I have rounds.

82
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,490
I'm saying you
skipped breakfast.

83
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,458
Didn't have time!

84
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,639
Avery made me point person on
the board's strategic planning meeting.

85
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,740
And I have consults.

86
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,931
Got to keep the
trains running on time.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,099
Ah, ah, ah...

88
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,168
Oh, mmm.

89
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,935
You're my favorite resident.

90
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,215
Hey. You were looking for me?

91
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,319
Yes. Mr. Weaver here is...

92
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,456
Oh, Jeremy. Hi.

93
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,259
Yeah, he's complaining
of chest pains.

94
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,494
EKG is fine except
for a little LVH,

95
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,713
but his first troponin
is within normal limits,

96
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,115
so I've ruled out a dissection,

97
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,494
but his belly is
still a little tender.

98
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:22,918
I'm fine, really.

99
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,080
Well, let's see.

100
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,144
Take it easy, Mr. Weaver.

101
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,172
Okay, see you later.

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,555
Okay.

103
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,125
Ow!

104
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:33,345
Hurts there? Yeah, but
it's heartburn, I swear.

105
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,114
My wife made me come. I
should be at work, you know?

106
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,299
And I got to pick
up my kid later.

107
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,751
Jeremy, have you eaten today?

108
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,003
Coffee.

109
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,598
Oh, you skipped breakfast, too?

110
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,572
Oh, no, no, no,
and then, pancakes,

111
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,024
sausage, eggs, a
couple of energy drinks.

112
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,321
I would've had
more, but I've been

113
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:49,689
having trouble
swallowing lately.

114
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:50,857
Sounds like you did pretty well.

115
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:51,947
Well, you got to fuel up.

116
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,465
I got a lot of balls in the air!

117
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,700
Sorry.

118
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,479
Look, we're gonna
admit you for observation.

119
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,003
No, no, no.

120
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,599
And I'll try to make
it quick, okay? Okay.

121
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:03,691
Um, add on LFTs, a second
troponin, and an abdominal CT.

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,988
Call me when
you get the results.

123
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,111
Ah, ah, ah...

124
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,713
Finish your donut.

125
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,133
Melissa works with us.

126
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,435
We do computer
repair at Office Hub.

127
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,137
I found her on
the way into work.

128
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,667
She was just lying there
on the ground, not moving.

129
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,074
I thought she was dead!

130
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,727
Do you know anything about
her family, anyone we can contact?

131
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,340
We don't really
know her that well.

132
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,925
OWEN: Wilson!

133
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,611
Uh, why don't you guys
take a seat? I'll be right back.

134
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,701
She's crashing.

135
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,470
You paged ortho? Oh, whoa!

136
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,049
Yeah, you're gonna have to wait.

137
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,367
Belly's expanding even though
I cross-clamped the aorta.

138
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,102
Should we book an OR?
Yeah, but she's not gonna

139
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,853
make it to an OR. With
this much blood in the belly,

140
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,739
we're gonna need to do
an emergency laparotomy.

141
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,629
Uh, right now? Here?

142
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,832
Wilson, we're gonna
need gauze, laps,

143
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,168
whatever we have
to pack this abdomen.

144
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:53,825
You sure you want to do this?

145
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,844
I'm sure we don't have a choice.

146
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,680
Okay.

147
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,401
Oh!

148
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,314
All right, Wilson.
Liver's intact.

149
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,850
Let's look at the
retroperitoneum.

150
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,587
Oh, God, it's the IVC.

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,699
Okay, put some pressure on it.

152
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,657
Satinsky, please. Suction ready.

153
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,236
All right, fracture's all
cleaned out for now.

154
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,627
I'll do the repair tomorrow.

155
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,172
Have we found out
anything about this girl?

156
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,863
No purse, no I.D.

157
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,343
We know she worked
at the Office Hub,

158
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,494
but the only emergency contact
they had was her own number.

159
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,686
Actually, we know something
else. She's a veteran.

160
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,090
Yeah, she has an Operation
Iraqi Freedom tattoo, 2011-2012.

161
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,442
I've been examining a lot
of vets lately, thanks to you.

162
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:45,494
Good eye, Torres.

163
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,512
The injury's
exposed. 4-0 prolene.

164
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,944
This should never
have happened to her.

165
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,368
It shouldn't have
happened to anyone.

166
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,037
More suction, please.

167
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,274
Hi, Mom!

168
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,763
Oh, look at you!

169
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:06,030
Oh!

170
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,259
How was your flight?

171
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,883
Not as good as my ride over.

172
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,103
My chauffeur has
the prettiest eyes.

173
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:12,632
Mom! Oh.

174
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:13,896
Uh, thank you?

175
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,257
Oh, look, I almost forgot.

176
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,544
Look what I found in
the airport gift shop.

177
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:23,215
Zoo animal decals
from the Seattle Zoo!

178
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,800
I thought they'd be
adorable on the nursery wall,

179
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:29,054
and they'll go with whatever
color you're planning on painting,

180
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,300
which I assume
is gender neutral.

181
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,024
Oh, actually, we haven't...

182
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,704
We haven't really had
time to think about colors.

183
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,927
Mmm-mmm.

184
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,663
Oh, you two and
work. Busy, busy, busy!

185
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:40,948
Speaking of which,

186
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:42,228
um, the ER is a madhouse.

187
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,985
Oh, yeah.

188
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,448
I probably... I just need
to get back down there,

189
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,155
but I promise I will try to
make it back for dinner.

190
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:49,574
Oh, dinner?

191
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,578
Mom, what?

192
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,147
I thought maybe you
could take off the afternoon.

193
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,232
We could shop for paint
samples for the nursery

194
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,379
and open a baby registry.
Mrs. Frye at church asks over...

195
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,781
Mom, you know
what I do for a living.

196
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,132
I don't know why
you thought I could

197
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,550
just take a whole
afternoon off to...

198
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,859
You know what? I have a
super-light day, so I can...

199
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,594
I can do all of those things.

200
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,307
Jackson, you don't
have to do that.

201
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,098
It's not a problem.

202
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,516
It'll be fun!

203
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,816
Yes, it will.

204
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,368
We've got this.

205
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,284
Guys, I don't want
to sound like a jerk,

206
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,886
but I got clients to
see all over town,

207
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,121
and then I got to pick up my
kid and drop her at volleyball,

208
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,745
and then I got two
more clients to see.

209
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:27,991
And believe me, I get it.

210
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,492
The number of
things I've got on my

211
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,094
agenda would
make your head spin.

212
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,535
Perfect, then send me home,
and we can both get back to it.

213
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,320
Look at me. I'm fit as a fiddle.

214
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,066
Well, that's not
what your labs say.

215
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,491
Uh, cholesterol is in the 300s.

216
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,058
Your triglycerides are worse.

217
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,389
Your BP's too high,
and your blood sugar

218
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,764
is in the pre-diabetic range.

219
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,633
Who are you gonna
believe, me or science?

220
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,468
Okay, you've got an honest face,

221
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,186
but science and I go way back.

222
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,216
CT doesn't show
abdominal problems,

223
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,102
but we'd like to do
some extensive studies.

224
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,554
So I need to do a
barium swallow test.

225
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,012
When we get that back,
depending on the results,

226
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,147
I might need to do an EGD.

227
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,283
Is there any way we could
skip a step, cut to the chase?

228
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,831
Okay, Dr. Bailey is
just trying to avoid

229
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,201
putting a tube down
your throat or up your...

230
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,841
Oh. Indeed.

231
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,011
I appreciate the thought, but if
it'll get me out of here sooner,

232
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,147
Dr. Bailey can stick a
tube wherever she wants.

233
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,568
All right.

234
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,253
This is Waldo Pfeiffer,
gestational age 23 weeks.

235
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:29,107
In addition to an incredibly
unfortunate first name,

236
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,993
Waldo's dealing with a
particularly nasty CCAM.

237
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,961
Tell me what CCAM stands for.

238
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,231
Congenital cystic
adenomatoid malformation.

239
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,266
The mass is pressing
on his heart and lungs.

240
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:41,503
Waldo's CCAM has been
unresponsive to steroid treatment.

241
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,870
Now he's developing hydrops.

242
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,773
This is what fetal
surgery was created for.

243
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,525
First, we're gonna
open up the mother,

244
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,293
then incise the uterus,

245
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,312
then we're gonna remove the CCAM

246
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,781
and put him right back
where we found him,

247
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,133
and hopefully he'll
be carried to term.

248
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,285
You have a consultation
in 20 minutes.

249
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,253
Make it fast, get back here,

250
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,789
and we're going to go over
this procedure step by step.

251
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,591
Terrific. Thank you.

252
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,959
Well, don't thank me.

253
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,595
I decided it was necessary
when it took you two months

254
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,064
to wrap your head around
a fetal valvuloplasty.

255
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,511
You ready for this?

256
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,969
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

257
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,673
It's a chronic subdural.
It should reabsorb itself.

258
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:22,243
Great. Thanks.

259
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,180
Your wife invited me
to dinner at your house.

260
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,681
Perfect.

261
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,668
Yeah, I was so
surprised by the invitation,

262
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,619
I forgot to ask if I
should bring anything.

263
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,649
Just yourself.
Anything you don't eat?

264
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,290
No. Not at all.

265
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,608
Oh, perfect.

266
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,409
How about a pot roast?

267
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,038
Great.

268
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,630
Uh, I'm sorry.

269
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,493
Uh, Shepherd, I was
looking for a consult.

270
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,095
I can come back later.
No, we're done here.

271
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,468
Thanks, Dr. Shepherd.

272
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,023
Richard.

273
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,195
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

274
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Um...

275
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,099
This could be you if you
keep eating like you do.

276
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,184
I bet if we took your
blood right now...

277
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:06,588
Mmm-hmm, see, I could
say the same thing about you,

278
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:10,491
but I wouldn't want to change a
single thing about you, so I won't.

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,061
I don't want to change
anything about you either.

280
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,329
I like you alive,

281
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,298
not dead on a toilet
after having a heart attack

282
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,067
trying to pass a
deep-fried onion blossom.

283
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,203
God, Miranda, why
would you even think...

284
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,705
What the hell?

285
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,673
Oh, what is this?

286
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,120
Not a deep-fried onion blossom
'cause that'd just be too much.

287
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:29,177
No.

288
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,112
It's a tumor.

289
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,736
And it's a big one.

290
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,423
Hey, sorry, the consultation
went off without a hitch,

291
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,869
but then Mom
got a little nervous,

292
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,773
so I just wanted to make
sure that she was okay.

293
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,248
CCAM. Um, I'm ready
whenever you are.

294
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,249
There's been a change in plans.

295
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,736
I'm having a personal...

296
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,321
I'm going home.

297
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,989
Here are the materials on
the procedure. Internalize them.

298
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,725
I've made notes in the margins

299
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,554
because my approach is better
than most of the crap that's in there.

300
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,091
You'll also need
to cover my service.

301
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,393
Wait, hold on. Is
everything okay?

302
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,599
I said it's personal!

303
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,296
You have what you
need from me there.

304
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,030
Read it. What if I
have questions?

305
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,271
They'll be answered in
there. I'll see you tomorrow.

306
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,270
<i>I keep telling you
to take more walks,</i>

307
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,294
yeah, have a salad,
maybe. Mmm-hmm.

308
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,057
Instead of all the
Philly cheesesteaks.

309
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:26,384
You certainly do, honey,
constantly, and just every time... Hello.

310
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,367
You don't look like
you have good news.

311
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,057
Jeremy,

312
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:37,078
I'm afraid the EGD
revealed a tumor.

313
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,630
It's early-stage adenocarcinoma.

314
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,914
Oh, God!

315
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,150
Cancer?

316
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,752
But I came in
here for heartburn.

317
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,255
And that's most
likely what you had,

318
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:50,141
but the cheesesteaks
and the fried foods

319
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,144
have caused intense acid reflux,

320
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,082
and over time, that reflux
has made your esophagus

321
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,849
the perfect home for cancer.

322
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,918
I'm sorry.

323
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,937
So, what do we do?

324
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,250
We'd like to keep you overnight
and do some pre-op tests,

325
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,059
then do an esophagectomy
where we remove your esophagus

326
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,894
and replace it with
a piece of your colon.

327
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,429
And then the cancer
would be gone?

328
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,731
That's the hope.

329
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,733
Yeah, it will be.

330
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,150
Okay, it'll be fine.

331
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,296
You go and get Erin.

332
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,786
Yeah.

333
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:20,783
And tell her what's going
on, but don't scare her, okay?

334
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,185
It's gonna be fine. Okay.

335
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,441
It's gonna be fine.

336
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,193
Hello, Jackson?

337
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,796
In here, Dr. Mom!

338
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,377
Hey.

339
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,800
Wow.

340
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,586
You've been busy.

341
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,889
We were just gonna
start a gift registry,

342
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,425
but then we saw
this adorable mobile,

343
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,611
and the next thing I knew,
I filled a shopping cart.

344
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,013
Yeah, we actually had
a pretty good day today.

345
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,967
Don't sound so
surprised! I am quite fun.

346
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,536
Uh, this didn't
come from a store.

347
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,839
Four generations
of Kepner babies

348
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,225
have slept in that
old war-horse.

349
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,293
How did you...

350
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,073
You didn't bring
this in your carry-on.

351
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,697
Shipping cost a fortune.

352
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,665
Your sisters thought
I should send it along,

353
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,101
but I wanted to be here to
see your face when it arrived,

354
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,569
so last week, I called Jackson.

355
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:10,771
You called Jackson?

356
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,192
I do know how to use
a telephone, little miss.

357
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,463
I am famished.

358
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,642
Well, why did you
wait for me to eat?

359
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,093
I called. I told
you I'd be late.

360
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:23,301
We probably just
lost track of time.

361
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,764
It's no big deal. I'll just hop in
the kitchen and whip something up.

362
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,121
Well, I didn't go to the store

363
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,068
because I thought that
we would be going out.

364
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,025
I'm sure I can
figure something out.

365
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,334
No, no, Mom, stop it!

366
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,646
I don't need you to
whip something up,

367
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,882
and I didn't need you to come out
here and set up my whole nursery.

368
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,251
I don't want your help!

369
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,380
Do you understand?

370
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,448
April.

371
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,138
Come on, that's not fair.

372
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,408
You invited Richard to dinner?

373
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,543
This was already a bad idea.

374
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,057
You're trying to make it worse?

375
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,364
She doesn't want to know him.

376
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,832
He said exactly the same thing.

377
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,912
Okay, then why are
you trying to force it?

378
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,837
Because he's my
friend. He's our friend.

379
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,005
He's family, and this
is one of the reasons

380
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,142
why you didn't want to leave
Seattle in the first place, remember?

381
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,959
You have family here, roots.

382
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,178
Are you kidding me?

383
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,295
What?

384
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,661
I have to have dinner
with the sister I don't know

385
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,051
and the bio-dad she hates

386
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,063
because you gave up your
chance to work for Obama?

387
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,554
You're gonna play that card?

388
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,683
Of course you are

389
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:18,818
because you'll be
playing that card

390
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:19,935
until the end of freaking time!

391
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,392
Time-out.

392
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,988
No, I am so sick of your
passive-aggressive...

393
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:24,779
Time-out.

394
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:27,114
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

395
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,200
I am just trying
to help out here.

396
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,969
I'm trying to help you, and
I am trying to help them.

397
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,654
I come from a big family.

398
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,873
It's crazy, it's
messy, but it's good,

399
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,242
and I want that for you.

400
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,110
I want you to have that.

401
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,517
She's your sister, and
he's practically your father.

402
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,286
And Zola needs more
black people in the family

403
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,116
because I'm running out
of ways to braid her hair

404
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,073
and Bailey won't
show me anymore.

405
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,199
Fine.

406
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,746
You want Richard
to come to dinner,

407
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,264
call Pierce and make
sure she's okay with it.

408
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,403
Me?

409
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,084
You want Richard
to come to dinner.

410
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,506
You win. Accept the win.

411
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,875
Don't push for more.

412
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,088
Okay, but shouldn't you be
the one who's making the...

413
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,579
Accept the win.

414
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,823
I thought I was clear.

415
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,236
I don't need you up here
double-checking my work.

416
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,294
Don't get all Sharks
and Jets on me, okay?

417
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,162
One of Herman's
patients landed in here,

418
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,797
and I'm learning the steps

419
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,332
of tomorrow's CCAM fetal
surgery from a journal article.

420
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,651
Actually, not even...

421
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,587
From the chicken scratch
in the margin of an article.

422
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,057
I think she's trying to haze me.

423
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,343
Or set me up for a
failure or maybe kill me.

424
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,745
You know what? No
one forced you to do this,

425
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,491
and now you're gonna
pout because it's kind of hard

426
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,475
and your teacher's
mean? Suck it up.

427
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,858
Hey.

428
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,807
Melissa, it's okay.
What are you...

429
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,862
Shh, you're in the hospital.

430
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,608
You were... Where's...

431
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,843
You were pretty badly
banged up, but you're all right.

432
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,134
Where's my car? Did they...

433
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,313
It's... Did they find my car?

434
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,698
It's all right. Did
they find my car?

435
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,755
Shh, just try and sleep.

436
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:16,323
Okay?

437
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,938
Dr. Bailey!

438
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:32,947
Dr. Pierce!

439
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,325
I didn't know you were a runner!

440
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,244
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I usually just spin.

441
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,813
I take a spin class.

442
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:41,449
I thought I could get
some fresh air for a change.

443
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,267
It's a gorgeous
morning, isn't it?

444
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,621
You know, I was only gonna
go like another three miles,

445
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,789
but I could stretch it
out if you want to join.

446
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,358
Oh, no. I mean, thank you. I...

447
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,039
I'm sorry. I just picked
up a new audiobook.

448
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,207
Oprah recommended it.

449
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,263
Totally understand.

450
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,332
Let me know how it is.

451
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,416
Okay.

452
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,272
Uh, you're the last
person who gets to

453
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,540
lecture me on
avoiding my mother.

454
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,741
That's not true.

455
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,276
My mother is a
nightmare, and yours

456
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,860
is the sweetest
person I've ever met.

457
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,118
No, what happened
last night was not sweet.

458
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:19,270
It was condescending.

459
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,938
Come on, you're overreacting.

460
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,691
Yes, 'cause she just
decided that I needed her help.

461
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,000
I needed help.

462
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,144
I asked her for it, okay?

463
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,557
I have no idea what
the hell I'm doing here.

464
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,831
I just spent four hours in that

465
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,066
baby store, and
my mind was blown.

466
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,470
Do you know how much I
don't know about having babies?

467
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,356
So much.

468
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,036
And she knows everything and so

469
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,570
do you, and it's
easy for you guys.

470
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,355
My family was
not built that way.

471
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,107
I didn't have
grandparents falling

472
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,742
over themselves
trying to love me,

473
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,934
but lucky for us, our kid will.

474
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,304
That is, provided that you
do not drive her away first.

475
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,738
Hey. Hey, uh,

476
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,062
OR three is ready for
Melissa's tibia repair,

477
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,827
and the police are finishing
up getting her statement now.

478
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,667
All right, thank you, ma'am.

479
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,270
Oh.

480
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,044
Melissa, are you okay?

481
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,646
They found it.

482
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:23,467
They found my car in pieces
in some chop shop in Bellevue,

483
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,869
and it's gone.

484
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,204
Okay. It's okay.
It's all replaceable.

485
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,056
Let's just be glad
you didn't get killed.

486
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,158
Damn it.

487
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,643
If I hadn't been asleep...

488
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:37,381
What happened? Do you remember?

489
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,884
I was sleeping, and then
they broke the window,

490
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,687
and they pulled
me out of it, and...

491
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:48,025
And I tried to hold on,
but I got stuck in the door,

492
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,612
and they dragged me for a while,

493
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,459
and then they punched me,
and then they kicked me, and...

494
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,284
And then I couldn't
hold on anymore.

495
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,288
God, why didn't you
just let them take it?

496
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,741
Everything was in that car.

497
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,297
Everything.

498
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,944
The car was the first thing she
asked about when she woke up.

499
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,979
She said she was asleep
in it when she was attacked.

500
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,447
It sounds like it's all she had.

501
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,915
So you're saying she's homeless?

502
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,623
I'm saying I think she's
living in her car, so, yeah.

503
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,486
Well, I thought you
said she had a job.

504
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,172
No, you can have a job
and not have a home.

505
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,978
That just makes it even worse.

506
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,715
Try going through high
school living in your car.

507
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:30,935
You got to lie all the time, you
can never have anyone over,

508
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,337
you have to make up excuses
why, you have no bathroom,

509
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,451
and then you know what?
You can't even tell anybody

510
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,075
'cause then they just look at
you like you're weird and pitiful.

511
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,761
Find me when she wakes up.

512
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,179
Okay.

513
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,981
You lived in your
car in high school?

514
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,521
See, that's the look.

515
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,982
Glove me.

516
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:04,101
Karev?

517
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,947
Dr. Karev expressed an interest

518
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,516
in our little CCAM
surgery today.

519
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,939
Yeah, it sounds amazing,

520
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,635
but I want to make
sure I'm not in the way.

521
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,677
Happy to have you.

522
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,162
Hope to hell you
studied, Robbins.

523
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,760
I'll warn you, I did not
sleep well last night.

524
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,800
My patience will be thin.

525
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,503
Richard Webber is coming?

526
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,338
No, that's...

527
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:25,639
I can't believe him.

528
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,686
No, no, no. It didn't
come from Richard, okay?

529
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,409
I invited him.

530
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,878
Well, I can't
make it. I'm sorry.

531
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:33,531
Look, you came here
to find out about Ellis.

532
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,834
Why don't you talk to
someone who actually knew her?

533
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,135
To Richard.

534
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,248
Come and have dinner
with me and Meredith.

535
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,690
Less pressure, it's a baby step.

536
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,477
Let me think about it.

537
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,546
Okay.

538
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,354
Is this about how I'm
gonna pay for all this?

539
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,623
No. No, no, no.

540
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,658
We just wanted to know...

541
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,095
'Cause I have some insurance
left, but all the paperwork was...

542
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,698
Inside your car?

543
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,594
I'm just saying
that I'll figure it out.

544
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,618
Melissa, are you
living in your car?

545
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,382
Wilson.

546
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,372
I don't know how else to ask.

547
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,468
We don't mean to
pry, but we just...

548
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,708
I...

549
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,710
It was only gonna be temporary.

550
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,679
I... When I got out of the army,

551
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,626
the job I had lined up was gone.

552
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,449
My fiance was gone, and...

553
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,351
My apartment with him.

554
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,786
All I could get was
the job at Office Hub,

555
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,722
and it doesn't pay great,
and I couldn't afford rent,

556
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,192
so, yeah, I'm making it work.

557
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,531
But now the car's
gone, uh, with my cash.

558
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,399
And my clothes, my savings

559
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,268
'cause banks want
you to have an address.

560
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,388
Um...

561
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,074
So, yeah.

562
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,910
Yeah.

563
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,178
Everything I have is gone,

564
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,447
but if I can't get back to work,

565
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,683
then I'm gonna lose my job, too.

566
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Melissa, there are
programs available

567
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,224
with the sole purpose of
helping homeless veterans.

568
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,695
Oh, I'm not homeless.
I'm... It's only temporary.

569
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,747
They will get you into
real, dependable housing,

570
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,976
then after that, everything
else is that much easier.

571
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,584
See, that's not for me.

572
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,603
You served in Iraq.

573
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,751
I fixed computers in an
operations office in the green zone.

574
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,242
There are guys who
were wounded in combat,

575
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,512
who were blown to pieces,
who had their faces burned off,

576
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:32,933
and I've met guys who have
been on the street since Vietnam.

577
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:34,919
I was carjacked.

578
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,353
In Seattle.

579
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,693
Excuse me.

580
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:40,874
You have some visitors.

581
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,446
Oh.

582
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,982
Oh, my God. Uh...

583
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,819
Just, uh, please go?

584
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,521
And don't say a
word to those guys?

585
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,561
Melissa, I...

586
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,870
I'll figure it out.

587
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:05,048
I always do.

588
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:08,753
Just go, please.

589
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,612
Okay, everybody, we're
about to meet Waldo.

590
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:21,265
Let's be quiet so we
don't wake him up.

591
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,855
Robbins, next step?

592
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:31,909
A 20-cc-per-kilo bolus of normal
saline into the umbilical vein.

593
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,427
So you did read my notes.

594
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,147
I'll give the bolus.

595
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,882
You pull out Waldo's arm
so we can attach the monitor.

596
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,546
Okay.

597
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,032
It's amazing.

598
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,400
Indeed.

599
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,152
Now you're ready for
chest exposure and incision.

600
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,261
Scalpel.

601
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,805
Now, every step counts here.

602
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,591
Tell me what you're about to do.

603
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,437
I'll perform a
posterolateral thoracotomy

604
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:07,194
and slowly deliver the mass.

605
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:09,029
Slowly and controlled.

606
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,759
I'm sorry? My notes said

607
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,951
the mass needs to be delivered
slowly and in a controlled manner.

608
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,537
Did you read my notes or not?

609
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:19,607
I did. It also told me to
prepare for bradycardia.

610
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,579
Proceed.

611
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,449
Okay. There's the mass.

612
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,819
And there's the bradycardia.
How do we handle that?

613
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,350
Atropine and epi
IM into the deltoid.

614
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,352
And why is this important?
Why this approach?

615
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,121
'Cause if the CCAM
starts to pop out,

616
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,007
then this little guy is
at risk for heart failure.

617
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,814
That's not what my notes said.

618
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:44,976
Well, not in those words, but...

619
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,284
I want my words. I
want my exact words.

620
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,868
You're giving me the gist.

621
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:52,272
I'm not interested in your
interpretation of my notes.

622
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,375
I want to know that the
specific words that I wrote

623
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,060
are now embedded in your brain.

624
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,662
That's what this is all about.

625
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,731
That's what this
fellowship is all about.

626
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,811
If you're only interested
in learning the gist of...

627
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,702
All right, she gets the point.

628
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:09,874
Dr. Karev, we're just
getting to the good part.

629
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,310
You don't want to
have to leave now.

630
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,965
My notes said that
before my approach,

631
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:21,668
this surgery resulted
in fetal cardiac arrest

632
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,120
50% of the time.

633
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,143
Feels strange, doesn't it?

634
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,462
To touch a baby
before he's even born?

635
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,767
You know what it feels like?

636
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,635
Privilege.

637
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,737
Great privilege.

638
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,434
Um...

639
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:54,502
Okay.

640
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,613
What happened?

641
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,171
Nothing.

642
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,283
Did you fall?

643
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,606
No!

644
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:00,907
I'm fine.

645
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,154
You're not fine.

646
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:03,543
You're limping.

647
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:04,945
Limping?

648
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:07,547
I hope you didn't
overdo it this morning.

649
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,049
Overdo what?

650
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,767
Jogging.

651
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,916
Jogging?

652
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,438
Yes, jogging.

653
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,001
She didn't tell you?
We ran into each other

654
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,390
at the Seward Park trail.

655
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,392
Mmm-mmm.

656
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,215
Are we gonna go get
a tumor out of a man

657
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,667
or just sit around
and talk about it?

658
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,339
Okay. Meredith.

659
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,552
Did Derek talk to you about
me coming to this dinner?

660
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,321
He did. Okay, what do you think?

661
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,877
Because I'm not 100% convinced.

662
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:39,279
I'm not either.

663
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,125
I think it might
seem... A little pushy.

664
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,515
A little too much, too soon.

665
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,196
I'm thinking of calling it off.

666
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,669
Well, if you think that's best.

667
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,187
I think Derek will understand.

668
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:48,806
What is wrong with you people?

669
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,674
You can't un-invite
someone to dinner,

670
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,687
not after the song and
dance I had to go through

671
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,271
to get her to even
think about coming.

672
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,014
You're not calling this off!

673
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,583
Okay, I have an
aneurysm I need to clip.

674
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,885
I will see you
both there tonight.

675
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,573
I'll bring dessert.

676
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,158
Thanks. That would be nice.

677
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,560
Edwards, start his work-up.
I'll be there in a second.

678
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,183
Copy that.

679
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:22,289
47-year-old male. He was
the passenger in a vehicle.

680
00:27:22,358 --> 00:27:25,058
I thought your flight wasn't
till later this afternoon.

681
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,360
I pushed it.

682
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,429
You owe me an apology.

683
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:31,131
And I'm not leaving
until I get one.

684
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,765
I owe you an apology?

685
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,902
You were rude, and
I raised you better.

686
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,237
I understand you're very busy,

687
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,772
and I understand
you work hard, but...

688
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,353
Mom, I am not going to apologize

689
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:42,820
for having the life that I want,

690
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,884
even if you think...
April Kepner!

691
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:47,981
You have made
choices that are very

692
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,550
different from
mine, and it's scary.

693
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,436
Any mother who watches her child

694
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,740
do something she
hasn't done herself...

695
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,274
It's scary.

696
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,178
But that doesn't mean I
haven't been proud of you,

697
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:06,032
and the more I see you
in this world, in this work,

698
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,685
in this marriage,

699
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,671
the prouder I am.

700
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:15,442
I have no earthly understanding
of what it is you do,

701
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,110
but I know a lot about babies,

702
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,596
and I don't want to take
anything away from you.

703
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,131
I just want to help you.

704
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,536
And I get to do that
because I am a grandma.

705
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:32,141
And I am also your mother.

706
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,003
I'm sorry.

707
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:46,306
Thank you.

708
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,993
So, can I...

709
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,330
Can I call you if I
have questions?

710
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,532
Well...

711
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,071
I suppose.

712
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,339
If you must.

713
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,280
Thanks for having
my back in there.

714
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,514
You can't let her
talk to you like that.

715
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:17,604
I know.

716
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,072
Well, so do something about it.

717
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,251
I can't.

718
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,308
Well, you have to.

719
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,793
Callie and I are splitting up.

720
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,632
And there are a lot of
reasons why it happened,

721
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,236
but taking this fellowship
might've been the nail in the coffin.

722
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,305
I traded my
marriage for this job,

723
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,176
and it's pretty much all I have
right now, so it has to work.

724
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,910
I need it to work.

725
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,480
Okay.

726
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,417
No, screw that. It's not okay.

727
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,903
I saw what happened in
there. She's got it in for you.

728
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,871
She's either looking
for a reason to fire you,

729
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,118
or she's gonna grind you down

730
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,769
and make you miserable
trying to please her.

731
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,860
She'll probably
fire you either way.

732
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,645
What do you got to lose?

733
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:01,859
Melissa? Yeah?

734
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,661
I brought these for
you. I told you I...

735
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,485
What rank were you
when you got out?

736
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,265
PFC. Okay, well, I was a major,

737
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,522
so you're gonna listen to
me if for no other reason

738
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:10,624
than I outrank you.

739
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,826
But mostly because
we have this in common.

740
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,496
I served, just like you.

741
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:21,267
I did two tours as a surgeon with
an army forward surgical team.

742
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,835
I gave what I had to offer.

743
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,138
So did you.

744
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,973
I patched up guys.

745
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,175
I can no more
re-jigger a hard drive...

746
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,877
Reformat. What?

747
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,412
Reformat a hard drive.

748
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,602
You gave what you had to give.

749
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,139
You served.

750
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:47,210
And you deserve all the help
and gratitude that's offered to you.

751
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,546
But if you think that
by accepting this help

752
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,192
you're taking it away from
the next guy, you are wrong.

753
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,910
But there are so
many guys out there.

754
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,312
If you want to make
sure these guys get help,

755
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:55,519
I have friends at the VA.

756
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,870
You can volunteer.

757
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,772
There's so much you can do,

758
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:02,291
but to start, you have to
get up on your own feet.

759
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,110
That is how you help.

760
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,263
That is how you serve.

761
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,332
Understood?

762
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:12,819
Yes, sir.

763
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,962
Starting the neck incision.

764
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,896
How old did this guy
say he was again?

765
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,798
Forty-two.

766
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,012
He's got the esophagus
of an 80-year-old.

767
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,769
You went jogging?

768
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:35,107
Yes, I jogged half a mile,
and now I can barely walk,

769
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:36,459
and that's embarrassing enough

770
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,648
without you acting like I
took a rocket to the moon!

771
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:40,380
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

772
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,466
I hope you don't give up.

773
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,003
The thing is, no
matter when you start

774
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,511
something like this,
it's gonna be hard.

775
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,074
Just, you have to start.

776
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,642
And take baby steps.

777
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,029
Was that a short joke?

778
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,876
BP's dropping.

779
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,944
What the... There's a
third-degree AV block.

780
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:01,796
We need to try to pace
him. Dr. Bailey, can you...

781
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,086
No, I have his colon.

782
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,649
Okay, hold it, hold it!

783
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,183
Bring the crash cart
over for temporary pacing.

784
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:09,159
Too late, he's coding.
- Crap. V-fib!

785
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,845
Dr. Warren, get the
paddles and charge to 150.

786
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,633
Clear!

787
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,238
Restart CPR.

788
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,588
Push one of epi,
push one of atropine!

789
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,110
Hold compressions!

790
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,766
No, it's not too late.

791
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,201
Oh, it can't be too late!

792
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,921
Go again!

793
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:39,539
Clear!

794
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:43,326
No. No.

795
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,028
We did everything we could.

796
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,233
Go again.

797
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:51,936
Clear.

798
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,453
Jeremy died during surgery.

799
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,649
I'm so sorry.

800
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,873
It was supposed to be heartburn.

801
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,903
It was just heartburn. It was
supposed to be heartburn!

802
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,638
How could this happen? Shh.

803
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:01,940
How could this happen?

804
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:04,697
No! No, no, no!

805
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,821
Hey. You done soon?

806
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,156
Let's go home.

807
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:16,426
You mean, go to your house.

808
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,661
What?

809
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,131
Well, it's your house.

810
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,166
I just crash there, right?

811
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,636
I mean, you never
asked me to move in.

812
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:30,140
You never
complained, but never...

813
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,405
Did I do something? 'Cause
I feel like I'm in trouble.

814
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,796
No, I'm in trouble

815
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:38,648
'cause when this changes I
don't have any place to be.

816
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,266
God...

817
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:44,270
I used to be so careful.

818
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,671
Wait, um...

819
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,709
What's changing? I
thought we were good.

820
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,179
Yes, but it all changes,
Alex. It always does.

821
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:57,150
You can't hold on to anything
that you don't want to lose.

822
00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:00,453
Right now, I feel like I have

823
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:04,591
a bed and a house.

824
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:07,344
And it is so good.

825
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:11,948
But my bed isn't
my bed. It's your bed.

826
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,618
And I hate that I
don't want to lose it.

827
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,791
Hey.

828
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,100
Look at me.

829
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:27,147
You got me. I swear to God.

830
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,577
I'm not going anywhere
except home with you.

831
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,607
Come on.

832
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,515
Let's go home.

833
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,367
Did you take the pot
roast out of the oven?

834
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,898
Uh, I shut the oven off because
I don't want that thing to get cold.

835
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,255
I'll take it out.

836
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,302
Really? You're
not really a chef.

837
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,425
And you are?

838
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,494
I'm better than you.

839
00:34:58,446 --> 00:34:59,757
Why would you say
something like that?

840
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,225
Because you called
the pot roast a "thing."

841
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:02,376
But it's not true.

842
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,833
You're not better than me.

843
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,384
Have you ever
cooked a meal before?

844
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:06,936
Okay, wait, time-out.

845
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,492
Well? Well, what?

846
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,843
You called a time-out.

847
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,890
You have to say something
when you call a time-out.

848
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,909
That's how it out works.
It is not a mute button.

849
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:19,911
It is right now. That's
not how it works.

850
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:21,551
I need a time-out!

851
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,020
I need a break, from
you, from the fighting,

852
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,950
from the pot roast
because the table isn't set.

853
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:27,214
The candles aren't lit.

854
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:28,919
The guests are gonna
arrive in 30 minutes.

855
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,493
I still need to take a shower.

856
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,228
I need a time-out!

857
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,205
Don't look at me like that.

858
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,383
I could use a shower, too.

859
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:43,423
How's the baby book?

860
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,642
Uh...

861
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,394
It's the scariest
thing I've ever read.

862
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,913
I was a jerk today.

863
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,583
Yeah, you were.

864
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,062
So, this is the
part where you say,

865
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,655
"No, you weren't the
jerk. I was the jerk."

866
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,291
Yeah, but I wasn't,
and you were.

867
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,327
Get up. I want to sit down.

868
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,728
Okay.

869
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,568
Mmm?

870
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,102
Right?

871
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:15,938
You built this?

872
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,540
Twice, actually.

873
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,410
I'm pretty sure there's something
wrong with the directions.

874
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,080
It's perfect.

875
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,833
You did a good job.

876
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:33,473
You're gonna be a great daddy.

877
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,193
Thank you.

878
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,411
Thank you.

879
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:45,384
I'm dying. I'm just
gonna drop dead.

880
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,487
Oh, we've talked about you
reading horror stories before bed.

881
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,200
I don't want to get punched
in the middle of the night

882
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:51,769
because you're
having nightmares.

883
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,028
I ran my labs yesterday after
we found Mr. Weaver's tumor.

884
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,897
Look, LDL cholesterol 178.

885
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,232
HDL 26.

886
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,886
Triglycerides 320.

887
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,170
Glucose 152.

888
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,850
Well, this explains the jogging.

889
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,290
I'm such a hypocrite.

890
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,592
I tell people every day

891
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,929
how important it is to
eat right and to exercise.

892
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,065
I just think I'm saying it
so much, I'm not hearing it.

893
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,567
You're not dying.

894
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,896
The numbers aren't great, but...

895
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,221
No, I have to make some changes.

896
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:22,822
Starting now.

897
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,124
But not right now.

898
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,770
You go for a jog
right this second,

899
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,873
I don't think you'd ever
be able to walk again.

900
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:30,263
Ow! Okay, I...

901
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,376
I did mention not wanting
to be punched, didn't I?

902
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,035
Yeah, but it's good cardio.

903
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:38,037
Like that really
hurt. That hurt?

904
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,301
<i>The ABCs of trauma are</i>

905
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,586
<i>a handy tool for
keeping a patient alive.</i>

906
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,069
<i>But they're only
a starting point.</i>

907
00:37:58,093 --> 00:37:59,375
Hi?

908
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,311
Oh.

909
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,647
Uh, hello.

910
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:09,735
Um, I just rang the
bell. No one answered.

911
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,322
Um, they did say 8:00, right?

912
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,956
They did, yeah.

913
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,041
The table is set.

914
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,259
Yeah, it is.

915
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,895
It's strange.

916
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,325
<i>Once the patient's airway,
breathing, and circulation</i>

917
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:24,417
<i>are all clear and accounted
for, the real work begins.</i>

918
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,518
<i>The messy work.</i>

919
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,603
I brought wine.

920
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,354
I'm an alcoholic.

921
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,560
This was a mistake.
I'm gonna go.

922
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,363
Look, I screwed up!

923
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:43,752
I Screwed up. I'm sorry.

924
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,542
Look, 31 years ago, I had a kid.

925
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:51,994
And nobody told me.

926
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,665
I've known you for
only, what, two months.

927
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,967
Two months.

928
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:02,471
Most parents mess up a
lot in those first few months,

929
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,685
and it's fine
because their kid's

930
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,770
too young to notice or remember.

931
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:10,596
But you... I hurt
you, and I know that.

932
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:15,685
And all I want to do is
just take it back, okay?

933
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:21,674
You've got the wrong idea.

934
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:25,778
I'm not angry with you
for being a bad father.

935
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:27,713
You're not my dad.

936
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,817
You are just a man
who slept with a woman

937
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:33,286
and made it possible
for me to be born.

938
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,322
My dad is my present.

939
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:40,426
You are my past. You
are my genetic history.

940
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:42,712
I didn't need you
to be a good father.

941
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:47,733
I just needed you to be
honest with me from the start,

942
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,137
instead of letting me walk
around here for weeks like a fool,

943
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,939
without a clue, letting
me confide in you.

944
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,878
I didn't know what to do.

945
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:03,883
And I'll never be
anything but sorry for that.

946
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:06,130
<i>There's no telling how
long it's going to take</i>

947
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,619
<i>to clean up that chaos...</i>

948
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:08,754
Okay.

949
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,158
Good night.

950
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,071
<i>Once you've begun...</i>

951
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:15,812
Sorry.

952
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,981
I think I must've
lost track of time.

953
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,068
I hope you brought an appetite.

954
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:24,782
<i>Because sometimes,</i>

955
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,923
<i>you don't know
what you're in for.</i>

956
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,290
Can I talk to you?

957
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,259
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you.

958
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,139
Dr. Herman, I
wasn't kidding when

959
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,874
I said that I wanted
this fellowship,

960
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,799
and today's surgery only
confirmed that more for me.

961
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,267
Close the door.

962
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:46,342
But no matter how much I
need or want this fellowship,

963
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,344
I refuse to spend the year

964
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,213
with you speaking to me
the way that you speak to me.

965
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,215
We won't have a year together.

966
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,620
Fine.

967
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:58,929
Great. Thanks.

968
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,708
I'll be dead in six months.

969
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:04,496
<i>You don't know exactly
what you're about to face.</i>

970
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,629
I have a brain tumor.

971
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,117
It's inoperable.

972
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:15,154
I thought I had
longer, but it's growing.

973
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,642
Soon, I will show symptoms,
and after that, I will die.

974
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,314
Who knows about this?

975
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,765
Hunt? Anyone?

976
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:29,668
Fetal surgery is a new field.

977
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,854
The few of us who
are practicing it are

978
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,956
basically inventing
it as we go along.

979
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,608
The things I know,

980
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:38,022
<i>the things I scribble down in
the margins, no one has them.</i>

981
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:42,248
They're not in any textbook.
They're only in my brain.

982
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:46,135
So I can fight to write papers
and try to get them published,

983
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,170
or I can use the
time I have left

984
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,358
to try to teach you a year's
worth of medicine in six months.

985
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:55,728
Or...

986
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:59,982
You can tell Hunt and the
board, and it all goes away forever.

987
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,836
<i>You don't know what secrets
the body in front of you holds...</i>

988
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:06,265
I don't know how
to feel about this.

989
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:09,908
Well, hurry up and decide.

990
00:42:09,978 --> 00:42:12,611
We don't have any time to waste.

991
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,848
<i>And whether, by
the time it's all over,</i>

992
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,217
<i>if there's anything
left worth saving.</i>
