1
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,048
Oh, boy. Hold on one second.

2
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,883
I got lost here yesterday.

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,338
<i>I love puzzles.
Since I was a kid.</i>

4
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,540
Nope, your present
hasn't come yet.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,708
What is this present?

6
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,222
You keep saying I'll
know it when I see it.

7
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,046
When am I gonna see it?

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,573
Yes, Mom, I am still at work.

9
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,676
I've got all the last guy's
caseload, plus the new patients.

10
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,212
There's almost no
time for research.

11
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, I've made friends.

12
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,586
"What are their names," Mom?

13
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,804
<i>My record for the Friday</i>
New York Times <i>crossword</i>

14
00:00:56,873 --> 00:01:01,009
<i>is 11 minutes, when I was 13.</i>

15
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:03,211
<i>I'm still trying to beat that.</i>

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,380
Why do I need to make friends?

17
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,582
I'm here to run a department.

18
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,850
<i>Okay, that sounds braggy.</i>

19
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,553
<i>I just mean once
I pick a puzzle up,</i>

20
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:14,222
<i>I can't put it down
until it's solved.</i>

21
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,658
No, I haven't talked to her yet.

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,061
I don't think I'm going to.

23
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,477
I've gotten by just
fine without a sister.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,403
I don't need one now.
At least not this one.

25
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,684
I was curious. I
picked up the rock.

26
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,877
I saw what was underneath
it. I'm gonna put the rock back.

27
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:39,548
It was stupid to have
picked it up in the first place.

28
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,718
No, I'm just saying I don't need
answers about my birth mom.

29
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:46,166
I have a family. I have the
best family I could ask for.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,739
I have you guys.

31
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,944
Dad. Dad, stop crying.
I'm not coming home.

32
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,981
Mom. Tell him I'm
not coming home.

33
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,881
Guys, I love you. I got to go.

34
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,738
<i>I think puzzles are why
I went into medicine.</i>

35
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,435
<i>That's most of what medicine is.</i>

36
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,203
<i>Gather all available
information...</i>

37
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,705
How long has she been
down? Less than a minute.

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,674
She brady'd, and then
she went into asystole.

39
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:11,858
We started CPR.

40
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,682
<i>Assess the problem...</i>

41
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,289
That's not gonna do it. Let me.

42
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,292
<i>You focus your attention...</i>

43
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,231
Shoot, I'm gonna break her ribs.

44
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,350
Sorry, Marjorie. Hold on.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,154
V-fib. Paddles,
please. Charge to 100.

46
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,531
Charged. Clear.

47
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:43,943
Charge to 200.

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,797
Charging. Clear.

49
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,725
<i>And you solve the puzzle.</i>

50
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,890
Thank you. Thank you.

51
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,512
<i>People are a harder puzzle.</i>

52
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,281
<i>There's never one right answer.</i>

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,233
Oh. No, thanks. I'm going down.

54
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,452
Me, too.

55
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,841
<i>And you never have
all of the information.</i>

56
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:13,508
I mean down the stairs.
You know, heart health.

57
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,570
You both work here. You
can't keep avoiding her.

58
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,650
I came here to work.
That's what I'm gonna do.

59
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,267
When I have to work
with Dr. Grey, I will.

60
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,003
I don't think that's
all you came here for.

61
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,578
Look, can we go back to
before I opened my mouth

62
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,912
about my personal problems?

63
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,614
And we can just
be work colleagues.

64
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,348
Can we do that, please?

65
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,202
Number 32 down is "cornpone."

66
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,771
Took me forever.

67
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,074
When are you gonna
talk to Lebackes?

68
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,209
Not till I'm sure I have
my old job back. Dr. Willis?

69
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,744
I thought this board
appointment was a done deal.

70
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,413
But now that I have to
compete for it... Dr. Willis.

71
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,664
I think Lebackes
will understand.

72
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:58,831
I just have to find
the right moment.

73
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,087
Dr. Willis.

74
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,356
I think she's talking to you.

75
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,791
Oh. Hi!

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,404
I think you're with me
today. You ready for rounds?

77
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,179
Yes. Sorry, but it's
Wilson, not Willis.

78
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,489
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

79
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,666
That's okay.

80
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,383
Wilson. What's first?

81
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,002
Jo. Josephine.

82
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:17,522
Not your name.
What patient is first?

83
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,525
Right. Uh, Dr. Bailey
needs a consult.

84
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,730
Dr. Bailey.

85
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,948
This is Robbie McCutcheon, 22,

86
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,401
no medical history
or cardiac risk factors.

87
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,336
Robbie is currently
trying to pass

88
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,154
a pretty impressive
kidney stone.

89
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:35,340
Hi, Robbie. I'm Dr. Pierce.

90
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,842
You hang in there, Robbie.

91
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,161
He's scheduled for a
percutaneous nephrolithotomy

92
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,207
to remove the stone. Too
big to pass on his own?

93
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,098
I had a child once.

94
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,962
I'd rather have four more
than do what he's trying to do.

95
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,402
Hang in there, Robbie.

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,332
Robbie's been having fairly
sustained runs of V-tach.

97
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,340
Dr. Bailey ordered a
cardiac panel and a stat EKG.

98
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,504
Robbie, is the pain
just in your stomach,

99
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,961
or does your chest hurt, too?

100
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,279
Chest.

101
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,632
Get me 80 milligrams IV
Sotalol and 6 of morphine.

102
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,963
Robbie, I'm going to need
you to take some deep breaths.

103
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,265
It hurts. I know.

104
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:10,003
Bundle branch block
re-entrant V-tach.

105
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,043
He's at risk for
sudden cardiac death?

106
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,645
Breathe, Robbie.

107
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,518
Just relax.

108
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,387
Good.

109
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,568
Okay, you got a
normal sinus rhythm.

110
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,072
He's at risk for
even minor surgery.

111
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,155
You'll have to postpone
until I can do a full work-up.

112
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,678
He'll need an echo. Who's next?

113
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,081
Rita, Eric.

114
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,248
All settled in?

115
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,383
Getting there.

116
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:36,651
Hit it, Milton.

117
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,836
Wilson.

118
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:40,539
God. I'm Sorry.

119
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,626
Rita Choudry, 35,
33 weeks pregnant,

120
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,071
admitted for low
sats and bed rest.

121
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,962
Forever.

122
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,465
Really? I have to be here
until this baby comes out?

123
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,696
Yes, you do. Tell me why.

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,731
Rita suffers from
Ebstein's malformation.

125
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,103
Which is?

126
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,950
A congenital malformation
of the tricuspid valve.

127
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,935
Excuse me, Dr. Pierce. Do
you mind if we play through?

128
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,360
Absolutely. You have
a patient here, too.

129
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,579
Baby Girl Choudry,
EDD six weeks.

130
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,526
She suffers from
double inlet left ventricle,

131
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,861
which will require immediate
heart surgery when she's born

132
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,869
and fetal monitoring until then,

133
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,882
which is why we've
admitted her mom.

134
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,826
And also because...
I know. I know.

135
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,419
Because the strain
of childbirth might

136
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,626
cause my crappy
heart to poop out.

137
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,339
I just need to be sure
you know the risks.

138
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,491
And the risks are having
this baby could kill me.

139
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,782
Please stop saying it.

140
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,551
I've heard it, and I refuse
to believe it, right, hon?

141
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,620
Yep.

142
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,972
Well, get settled, relax.

143
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,401
You'll be seeing
way too much of us.

144
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,545
Her chances are that bad?

145
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:40,126
There's a good possibility
she'll die trying to have this baby.

146
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,560
She was strongly
advised against it.

147
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,851
Then why take the case?

148
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,197
Because she decided
to have it anyway.

149
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,966
And I like my chances
better than hers.

150
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,167
That sounds braggy.

151
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,257
No, it sounds badass.

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,943
What's next?

153
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,663
Marjorie Reed, 88, stage IV
small cell cancer of the lung

154
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,065
with mets to the liver.

155
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,399
Marjorie, how you doing now?

156
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,784
She says her stomach hurts,

157
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,621
but I think she's doing
better, thanks to you.

158
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,272
Thank you again.

159
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,892
Mom! I'm gonna go get some tea!

160
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,693
I'll be right back, okay?

161
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,343
You gave us a big
scare this morning.

162
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,683
No more of that, okay?

163
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,673
That happens
again, I want to die.

164
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,458
Oh, please, please, let me die.

165
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,660
Marjorie, do you
know where you are?

166
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,929
Do you know... You think...

167
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,998
You ask me if I'm
out of my mind?

168
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,834
I wouldn't say...

169
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,138
Yes.

170
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:58,042
I've lived 88 years, 65
of them with my husband.

171
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,810
More with him than without.

172
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,848
We taught English
in Japan for a while.

173
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,752
Looks like here, Japan.

174
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,287
So green.

175
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,390
We taught English.

176
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,288
Did I say that?

177
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,591
Yes, you did. Oh.

178
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:23,818
Now I live in this ugly room
with these ugly machines, alone.

179
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:30,124
But hurting constantly.

180
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,263
Those drugs you give
me made me forget.

181
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,266
I'm forgetting my life.

182
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,337
It was beautiful, my life.

183
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,638
I earned a better end than this.

184
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,707
There are forms you can sign.

185
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,976
Oh.

186
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,012
Jeannie won't let me.

187
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,549
She'd never forgive herself if
she didn't do everything she could.

188
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,058
Bless her heart,
but she's scared.

189
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,322
Always has been.

190
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:05,560
Where she gets
it, I have no idea.

191
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,199
And am I out of my mind? No.

192
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,390
When it's my time, I should
get to die remembering my life.

193
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,825
Shouldn't I?

194
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,666
I don't understand. Can't
we override the daughter?

195
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,003
She has power of attorney,
and the mother won't do it.

196
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,415
And unless she has a signed DNR,

197
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,717
we are legally required to do...

198
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,841
To do everything
we can to save her.

199
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,230
Even though I almost killed
her this morning trying to do it.

200
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,380
Then talk to the daughter.

201
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,848
It's trickier than that.

202
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,501
She's better, right?
She seems better.

203
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,771
Jeannie, I'm afraid she's not.

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,556
Your mother's
cancer has progressed

205
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,275
beyond what we can
hope to treat or cure.

206
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,905
But she survived
this morning and...

207
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,979
She is in incredible pain,

208
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:01,393
and the process of
resuscitation is so hard on her.

209
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,445
If it happens again...
What? What is she saying?

210
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,249
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time
now, and your mother deserves...

211
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,117
Is she saying I
should let her die?

212
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,409
No! You're her doctor.

213
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,195
You do whatever you
have to do to keep her alive,

214
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:15,930
to save her, right?

215
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,033
You're her doctors, right?

216
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,653
Of course.

217
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,849
You don't speak to a
patient unless I tell you to,

218
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,156
is that understood?

219
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,225
I was just trying to help...

220
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,561
You don't counsel a patient's
family on patient care, understood?

221
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,975
I got it. Now you've
made that woman think

222
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,026
that we are pushing
for her mother to die.

223
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,750
I got it. I'm sorry.

224
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,152
Okay.

225
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,033
I just had to bring the thunder.

226
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,390
Bring the thunder?

227
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,909
When you seem really
nice or young or pretty,

228
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,128
sometimes people
don't take you seriously.

229
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:50,481
You have to help them
understand who they're dealing with.

230
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,501
You have to bring the thunder.

231
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,947
If you don't do
this, you should.

232
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,271
You're really
pretty. What's next?

233
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,773
Robbie McCutcheon's
cardiac echo came back.

234
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:04,007
Well, that sucks. What sucks?

235
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,230
Robbie has dilated
cardiomyopathy.

236
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,660
Should get cardiac anesthesia
involved before you operate.

237
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,469
Oh, hang in there.

238
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,321
We're gonna have
to before that boy

239
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,858
tries to push a pencil
eraser through his pin hole.

240
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,395
If you don't mind, I'd like to send
out for Robbie's full exome panel.

241
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,997
Just out of curiosity.

242
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:26,617
You want to know if his
cardiomyopathy is genetic?

243
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,197
It's a little project
I'm working on.

244
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,021
I can run it for you.

245
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,472
You have a genome lab here?

246
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,269
We did. The board just voted...

247
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,904
We do, and I still
have a set of keys.

248
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,028
And if the board has
a problem with that,

249
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,412
you have them come talk to me,

250
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,099
and I'll tell them what hole
they can push that through!

251
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,973
Was she bringing the thunder
or did we just piss her off?

252
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,919
Dr. Bailey doesn't
need to bring anything.

253
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,910
She is the thunder. Oh.

254
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,990
The board just voted to
shut down her genome lab,

255
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,525
then they promised
her a seat on the board,

256
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,794
but she's probably gonna
lose it to another surgeon.

257
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,618
Wow. Rightfully pissed.

258
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,365
Well, there's two
sides to every...

259
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,699
What's next?

260
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,724
Uh, Rita Choudry's
complaining of back pain.

261
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,958
Who is Dr. Karev?

262
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,126
Why?

263
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,061
He's paging me for a consult.

264
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,510
Oh. That's the guy that's
gonna take Bailey's board seat.

265
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,011
You saw me talking
to him this morning.

266
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,179
He's in private practice,

267
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,514
but he's gonna be
appointed to the board,

268
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,304
so he'll be coming back.

269
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,341
Okay. First Rita,
then Dr. Karev.

270
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,177
I don't know. I've had
a lot of lower back pain

271
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,548
throughout this whole
pregnancy, but this is different.

272
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,618
It's high in the
center and it burns.

273
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,804
All right, Rita. Dr...

274
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,623
Wilson.

275
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,858
Sorry. It's weird.

276
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,359
I'm really good with names.

277
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,795
Really?

278
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,630
Dr. Wilson is gonna
take you for a CT.

279
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,311
Okay? Is there something wrong?

280
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,101
Not necessarily.

281
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,181
Back pain can
mean a lot of things.

282
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,325
Could just mean you're pregnant.

283
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:07,101
This kid's had persistent
hypoxia and occasional PVCs.

284
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,731
Could you check
his cardiac function?

285
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,865
We'll just take a look.

286
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,155
Who are you?

287
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,852
How is it you and
I haven't met yet?

288
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,909
I've been here
less than a month.

289
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:17,344
Maggie Pierce,
new head of cardio.

290
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,264
Well, don't be afraid
to dance, Maggie.

291
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,333
Oh, I'm not afraid.
I'm just not going to.

292
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,019
People are great here,
really fun. Right, Karev?

293
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,832
Karev worked here. I know.

294
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,807
And I hear congratulations
are in order. The board?

295
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,320
What's that? - Nothing.

296
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,156
I said I hear
congratulations are in order!

297
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,440
No. OLIVER: For what?

298
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,941
I hear you've been
appointed to our board.

299
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,182
Well, that's not
really... It's...

300
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,184
Stop the music.

301
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,054
Something you want to tell me?

302
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,506
Was that...

303
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,320
I was gonna talk to
you at the right time.

304
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,537
Are you quitting my practice?

305
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,672
No, I've just been offered a...

306
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,462
Are you quitting my practice?

307
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,115
I might be.

308
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,216
I chose you!

309
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,113
I selected you to have the keys

310
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,565
to the premier imperforate-anus
practice in the nation,

311
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,966
and you take another
job behind my back?

312
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,019
I was gonna talk... You
are not quitting my practice.

313
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,520
I am firing you
from my practice.

314
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,122
I'm not seeing any
cardiac abnormalities, so...

315
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,073
And I am gonna tell your tale of
disloyalty far and wide, my friend.

316
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,375
I will make sure that
everybody knows

317
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,043
that you're as deceitful
as you are stupid.

318
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,227
I'm just gonna go.

319
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,895
Watson.

320
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,496
That is not my name.

321
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,349
You were indiscrete and
stupid, and you are off my service.

322
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,550
Wait, what?

323
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,859
Karev's your boyfriend, right?

324
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,648
I've been...

325
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,138
Yeah, he is. I could tell.

326
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,252
But you just met me and
apparently felt it appropriate

327
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,709
to casually share
confidential information

328
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,277
about your boyfriend's career

329
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,891
and then fail to tell
me it was confidential,

330
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,647
so I just used it
to make small talk.

331
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,666
And now I don't ever
need to learn your name

332
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,652
because you are off my service.

333
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,520
Is this you bringing
more thunder?

334
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,156
No, no. No, this
is me being pissed.

335
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,857
Because I can't trust you.

336
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,011
Go swap with a
resident I can trust.

337
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,910
And you just got
your boyfriend fired.

338
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,545
Dr. Pierce, did
you ask for all of

339
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,112
Dr. Yang's chart on
the McNeil family?

340
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,249
Yes. I did link McNeil's
transplant the day Yang left.

341
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,506
I know. I just wondered
why you needed access

342
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,375
to the rest of the family's.

343
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,023
I mean, three kids in one
family with cardiomyopathy?

344
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,313
It just bugged me why
no one found out why.

345
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,982
It bugged us, too.

346
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,502
Dr. Yang ran every imaginable
test, including a full exome panel.

347
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,814
Now, you really think you could

348
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,983
find something that she didn't?

349
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,534
Do you think that's impossible?

350
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,959
I think in most cases,
this disease is idiopathic,

351
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,538
and its cause remains a mystery.

352
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,707
I think the McNeils have
been through a year of hell.

353
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,409
Unless you have
something new to tell them,

354
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,611
they're gonna build up
their hopes for nothing.

355
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,452
I think we should leave
them alone to heal.

356
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:41,955
Yes, sir.

357
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,358
Thank you.

358
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,083
Hi.

359
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,487
Hello. Hello.

360
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,233
- Who are you?
- Zola, sweetie.

361
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,085
Zola, sweetie.
Come on over here.

362
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,720
Come and sit down right here.

363
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,384
Dr. Pierce, right?
Dr. Shepherd. Nice to meet you.

364
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,791
Hi. You've met Dr. Grey.

365
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,448
Yes. Hi. We've met.

366
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,183
Who is this?

367
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:10,362
This is our daughter, Zola.

368
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,486
Oh. Hi, Zola. I'm Maggie.

369
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,555
Oh.

370
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,774
I hear you're going
to run the new

371
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,342
brain-mapping
initiative at the NIH.

372
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,877
That's very exciting.

373
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,547
Uh... I'm not.

374
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,617
I'm sorry. I was misinformed.

375
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,785
I'm really killing it today.

376
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,822
We have two children.
Their lives are here.

377
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:36,027
Being away from my family
is... It's untenable for me.

378
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,595
I totally understand.

379
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,414
My family's back in Boston.
It's very hard being away.

380
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,983
Isn't that gonna get cold?

381
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,572
Would you like to join us?

382
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,023
I'm gonna... I have
to talk to Dr. Webber.

383
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,859
Nice to meet you both.

384
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,239
This big secret is
why you ended up

385
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,506
at a meeting in the first place.

386
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,596
Look, I...

387
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:56,758
May I join you?

388
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,449
Um...

389
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,618
Amelia Shepherd, do you
know Dr. Maggie Pierce?

390
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,638
Weird, you're the second
Dr. Shepherd I've met today.

391
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,757
Derek is my brother.

392
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,910
I'm sorry. Is everyone in
this room somehow related?

393
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,217
I'm gonna leave you two
alone. Nice meeting you.

394
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,407
Meredith Grey has
an adopted daughter.

395
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,443
Uh... I know this.

396
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,411
Well, I didn't.

397
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,198
Zola came to them as a patient
through the African exchange program.

398
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,551
Spina bifida. And
they adopted her.

399
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,818
Oh, my God, just stop.

400
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,187
I'm sorry?

401
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,422
It's easier when she's
just a rude bitchy person

402
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,509
I don't care to know,
but she keeps getting...

403
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:45,613
She adopted a beautiful,
surgically needy African orphan.

404
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,047
It's annoying.

405
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,102
Should I talk to her? What
do you think? Honestly.

406
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,190
I think she's more
than you bargained for.

407
00:17:56,258 --> 00:18:00,361
But I think when the world gives
you more than you bargain for,

408
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,784
you usually end
up glad you got it.

409
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,885
You're staring.

410
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,956
Isn't it funny?

411
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,608
She adopts a kid, her
mother gives one up.

412
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,465
You have no idea what
the story was there?

413
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,430
I never knew anything about it.

414
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,237
I do know this.

415
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,442
Based on what I
know about Ellis,

416
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,631
leaving you would have been
the most difficult decision of her life.

417
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,447
How well did you know her?

418
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,636
Dr. Pierce, bad news.

419
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,100
You're off my service.

420
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,920
I know. Just look, though.

421
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,424
Oh, God. Let me find
Dr. Robbins. I'll go talk to them.

422
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,558
Okay.

423
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,925
The fellowship committee
wants an answer tonight?

424
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,559
Sorry, Dr. Robbins?
One minute, okay?

425
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,101
Listen, I'm surprised that
you're surprised by this.

426
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,114
I mean, it's a natural
extension of what I already do.

427
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,816
I'm surprised because
it came out of the blue.

428
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,774
No, I thought about it for a while.
I mean, I need something new.

429
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,788
We're having another
kid. That's not new?

430
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,823
This is different. It has
nothing to do with that.

431
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,914
It does, though.
I have research.

432
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,249
With you at work and
then the fellowship,

433
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,751
how do we have time
for a new baby? How?

434
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,198
You know what? I
haven't said yes yet.

435
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,521
But you're going to.

436
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,423
Listen to me. I haven't
made up my mind.

437
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,109
Oh. See, I thought you had. I
thought we were having a kid.

438
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,948
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,260
About what? I wasn't listening.

440
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,851
You're nice and full of crap.

441
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,848
How's it going? Not good.

442
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,916
You're having an
aortic dissection.

443
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,518
There's a tear in the
inner wall of your aorta

444
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,776
that causes blood to
force the vessel apart.

445
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,310
Oh, God, I knew it.

446
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,691
What about the baby? ARIZONA:
The baby needs to come out.

447
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,326
An OB will do an
emergency C-section,

448
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,077
and then Dr. Pierce
will repair the dissection.

449
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,652
But isn't she too little?
Can she handle the surgery?

450
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,321
We don't have a choice.
If I don't operate, you'll die.

451
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,135
Just make sure
that my baby is...

452
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,043
Rita, please! Please stop
talking about the baby!

453
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,952
I told you not to do this! Eric!

454
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,009
I knew something
like this would happen!

455
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,151
Step outside. Please.

456
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,264
I'm gonna call up and let
them know we're coming.

457
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,905
Okay?

458
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,374
Edwards, Whitton,
get her ready to move.

459
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,260
I know this is scary,
but it's happening.

460
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,524
And the only thing she needs
right now is your support.

461
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,182
I can't do it anymore. I can't
support her killing herself!

462
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,917
She doesn't want
to lose a child.

463
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:27,008
We already lost our child.

464
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:30,561
Five years ago.
Madeleine. She was two.

465
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,441
They were walking
down the sidewalk.

466
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,576
Maddie wanted to run.

467
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,627
Rita let go of her
hand so she could run.

468
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,797
Maddie tripped, she hit
her head, and she was gone.

469
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,221
Four feet away from her mother.

470
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,041
Just a freak thing, you know?

471
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,681
But Rita will always believe it's
because she let go of her hand.

472
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,416
I'm sorry.

473
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,947
And then when Rita
got her diagnosis,

474
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,949
we never thought
we'd have another child.

475
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,573
We knew, with her heart,
what it would do to her.

476
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:03,160
And when she got
pregnant, it was an accident.

477
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,594
And I begged.

478
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,103
I begged her not to have
the baby, but she just...

479
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,415
She wouldn't let it go.

480
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:12,202
Yeah, now I'm
gonna lose them both.

481
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:17,291
Eric, nobody wants it
this way, least of all Rita.

482
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,861
She made a hard choice
for the sake of the baby.

483
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,831
We just need to have
the faith that she has.

484
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,420
Okay, they're ready for us.

485
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,272
We're gonna do our
best for her, okay?

486
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,874
How do you feel?

487
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,637
I wish she could have
cooked it a little longer.

488
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,294
How do you feel?

489
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:55,913
I wish I was anywhere else.

490
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,649
Good luck. You too.

491
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,721
How's that baby doing?

492
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,001
Baby's cyanotic and
apneic. Dr. Robbins?

493
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,569
Let's get to work on Rita.

494
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,605
We need to get the
baby's airway cleared.

495
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,095
Let's get her breathing
and get her to the OR.

496
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,566
You ready? Mmm-hmm.

497
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,458
I think she's breathing.
She's ready to move.

498
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,399
Robbins, keep me posted.

499
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,822
I will.

500
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,240
Scalpel.

501
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,382
Dacron graft and
4-0 Prolene, please.

502
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,702
Damn it. Damn
it. It's tearing more.

503
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,788
Pledget.

504
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,725
When we're done here, I'd like
you to remember that you are...

505
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,493
Off your service. I know.

506
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,641
You want me to leave
now, I'll leave now.

507
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,746
Another pledget.

508
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,686
All right. Let's see
if this heart will start.

509
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,021
Internal paddles, please.

510
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,633
Any update from
Robbins? How's the baby?

511
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,424
Dr. Robbins can't talk.

512
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,960
That can't be good.

513
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:01,811
Okay, charge to 10, please.

514
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,998
All right, everybody,
cross your fingers, pray,

515
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,482
do whatever you do.

516
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,434
And clear.

517
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:13,390
Again? Wait.

518
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,347
We have sinus.
Thanks, everybody.

519
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,577
I got to go check on
that baby. Can you close?

520
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,279
Can I close? You're
a third-year resident.

521
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,781
Can you close a
midline sternotomy?

522
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,387
Can I trust you to do that?

523
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,039
Yes. Yes, absolutely I can.

524
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,238
She's flatline. Suction. I
can't even see the field.

525
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:34,339
Come on. Come on.

526
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,462
What happened?

527
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,531
I'm losing her.

528
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,564
There's a solution. We'll
find it. Talk me through it.

529
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,016
I was banding the
pulmonary artery together

530
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,350
when it perfed
through her vessels.

531
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,702
Okay, can you try a systemic
to pulmonary artery shunt?

532
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,238
It won't help. They're
both too small...

533
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,706
To take the pulmonary pressure.

534
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,810
It's not in her vessels.
It's something else.

535
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,699
It's the ventricle. I
can do a septation.

536
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,928
Separate her one
good ventricle...

537
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,235
Into two ventricles.

538
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,337
Septation has a pretty
high mortality rate.

539
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,350
She currently has
zero chance of survival.

540
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,841
So this is better.

541
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,337
This is better.
Let's start bypass.

542
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,881
Push heparin and
get me my loops.

543
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,047
Nurses' station.

544
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,615
How's Rita Choudry?

545
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,978
Good. Easy closure.
She's in post-op.

546
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,447
You can check my work.

547
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,711
How's the baby?
It got complicated.

548
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,034
I'm going to the
ER for a consult.

549
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,269
I'll come with you.

550
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,427
You can go home.
You're off my service.

551
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,140
See, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

552
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,430
Hey, it's Dr. Blabbermouth.

553
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,697
Dr. Karev, I am sorry...

554
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,027
Next time, maybe don't speak up

555
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,628
till you know what
you're talking about.

556
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,297
Look, it's my fault. I sent
her in there with half the story.

557
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,382
It's me you should be pissed at.

558
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,738
Okay, now I'm pissed at you.

559
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,485
Sorry. I didn't know she
was gonna say anything.

560
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,253
Why did you even tell
her in the first place?

561
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,197
Alex, I said...
Now I got no job.

562
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,998
Dr. Shepherd, I was
called for a cardio consult.

563
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,300
Was that you or the
other Dr. Shepherd?

564
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,203
I love you.

565
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,604
Thank you.

566
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:51,950
I'm sorry. No one
has ever called

567
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:53,351
my brother, "The
other Dr. Shepherd."

568
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,386
It's beautiful. I
called you. Over here.

569
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,928
This is Tracey, early 20s,
possible minor ischemic stroke.

570
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,742
A stroke? I gave her a stroke?

571
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,948
After sexual activity.

572
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,394
Tracey, could you
squeeze my fingers?

573
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,735
Really hard.

574
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,064
It's okay. I've got
you. Just relax.

575
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,016
Any more history? We
don't have a last name.

576
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,152
We just met, like, an
hour ago at the gym.

577
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,416
We went to my place.

578
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,777
What? We hit it off.

579
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,479
Like gangbusters.

580
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:18,632
Sorry, but was this sexual
activity pretty vigorous?

581
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,962
It was really good. At
one point, we were...

582
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,514
That's all I need.
And then it was over,

583
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:25,606
and she went all
wonky like this.

584
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:27,286
Do people get strokes from sex?

585
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,276
Almost never.

586
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:32,212
So, was it just me?

587
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,382
What answer are you hoping for?

588
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,651
Did she say if she
was on the pill?

589
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,103
We used a condom.
I'm not stupid.

590
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,706
I'm looking for possible
risk factors for stroke.

591
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,342
Birth-control pills can
increase the risk of blood clots.

592
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,543
There was no ID?

593
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,312
I couldn't find her purse.

594
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,581
Tracey, can you tell
us your last name?

595
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:57,504
Regger? Roger?

596
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,801
Yeah, I did this for
10 minutes, guys.

597
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,991
She was at the gym. Did
she have headphones?

598
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,928
Uh, yeah. This is hers.

599
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,281
She'd have to register
that thing to put music on it.

600
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:10,967
Get a serial number, call the
company, get a name, and get a history.

601
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,286
On it. Nice one, Sherlock.

602
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,467
I'll get an echo and
some chest films.

603
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,934
Okay, meantime,
let's get a head CT

604
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,059
and a bilateral
carotid artery Doppler.

605
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,705
What the hell is she doing?

606
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,633
Marjorie got hypotensive.
Grey was here.

607
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:29,553
She decided to put in a
central line to give her pressors.

608
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:30,999
Dr. Pierce, Dr. Bailey told me

609
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,103
you ordered an exome
panel for her patient.

610
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,659
They caught me, and I threw
you under the bus. Sorry.

611
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,205
Yeah, Dr. Bailey's
genome-research program

612
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,796
has been discontinued.

613
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,276
You know, I heard that. And I
have to say, I think it's stupid.

614
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,067
Genome mapping is like getting
the answers in the back of the book.

615
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,152
It is the key to so
many medical solutions.

616
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,854
Closing that program makes your

617
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,522
board look like a
bunch of morons.

618
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,208
Have you met Dr. Avery?

619
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,826
Yeah, Plastics, right?

620
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:56,346
Dr. Avery is also a voting
member on the board.

621
00:26:58,484 --> 00:26:59,516
Of course you are.

622
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:00,701
Yeah, I like her.

623
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:05,338
You put a central line in my
patient without notifying me first.

624
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:06,973
There wasn't time.

625
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,126
There was time to
ask a nurse to tell me.

626
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,755
Doesn't work like
that here, Pierce.

627
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,263
I don't need your permission
to keep her from dying.

628
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,099
She's right, Dr. Pierce.

629
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,836
Damn it.

630
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,526
Listen, I get that I'm new.

631
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:27,772
I get that you don't know me,

632
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,063
but I'm gonna demand
that you listen to me.

633
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:33,651
Like it or not, I am the chief
of cardiothoracic surgery.

634
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,047
You can't even look at
me when I'm talking to you.

635
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,454

649
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:28,889

I just miss you guys.

00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,988
No, nothing
happened, Mom. I just...

654
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,326
I think it might have
been a mistake,

655
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,929
coming here.

656
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,034
I don't feel like
I can be myself.

657
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,523
Dad, don't start crying.

658
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:03,924
I got to go.

659
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,510
So, Tracey's coming around.

660
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,079
She was lucky. Minor stroke.

661
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,226
Nerve responses
returning, no signs of deficits,

662
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,827
but we still don't know...
What caused it, right?

663
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,851
Uh-huh.

664
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
No signs of cardiovascular
disease, no signs of carotid disease.

665
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:36,456
So I thought...

666
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,075
Are you listening?

667
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,578
Sorry.

668
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,513
I was thinking I
have had good sex,

669
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,366
but I've never had
put-you-in-the-hospital sex.

670
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:49,219
I feel like I'm missing out.

671
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,449
So, I was thinking, could the
clot be coming from some...

672
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,641
I mean, I don't want a
stroke, but I'd like to get close.

673
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,340
The clot could have
come from someplace else.

674
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,207
Guess that's what you call
one mind-blowing orgasm.

675
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,743
Are you done? I have one more.

676
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,583
He nearly screwed
her brains out. I'm done.

677
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,971
And I found one in her leg.

678
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,408
I have not had
sex in a long time.

679
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,758
You're preaching
to the choir, sister.

680
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:20,233
The clot in her left leg meant
there must be a hole in her heart.

681
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:25,555
Through which
the clot in her leg,

682
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:29,293
with help from pressure
changes during very good sex,

683
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,229
traveled from the right to
the left chamber of her heart,

684
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,280
on up to her brain.

685
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:39,269
Now I just have to
plug the hole like this.

686
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,354
<i>Nice catch, Doctor.</i>

687
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,656
<i>Or should I say...</i>

688
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,992

<i>Your parents sound

691
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:55,001

692
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,387
and nothing at all like me.

693
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:01,091
No understanding of what
I do or why I like doing it.

694
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,310
<i>Oh, I know that feeling.</i>

695
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,123
<i>I always felt like
the odd man out.</i>

696
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,713
<i>I have three sisters
and a brother.</i>

697
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,882
<i>They are all very put together,</i>

698
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:14,821
<i>and I, kind of a mess.</i>

699
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,259
<i>It wasn't until I met Meredith
I had a sister I could relate to.</i>

700
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:21,828
Really? <i>Not at first. You know?</i>

701
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:27,667
<i>She's hard to get to know,
but she's worth knowing.</i>

702
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:29,857
<i>Really.</i>

703
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,556
Dr. Pierce. Dr. Bailey...

704
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,024
You are not on...

705
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,691
On your service. Yes.

706
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
Dr. Bailey asked to see
you when you're finished.

707
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,965
I apprehended the culprit.

708
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,535
RAF-One mutation right there.

709
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:49,172
That little orange bastard
caused Robbie's cardiomyopathy.

710
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,941
RAF-One. Since when?

711
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,879
It was just isolated a month
ago by a doctor in Australia,

712
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,915
and the screening panel
was updated last week.

713
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,250
So, until a week ago...

714
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,086
We didn't know it
caused cardiomyopathy.

715
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,755
Is this what you wanted?

716
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,663
Yes!

717
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,399
Genetic profiling is a
rapidly growing science.

718
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,236
New findings crop
up every single day.

719
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,249
For example, three months ago,

720
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,609
there were only 33 known
genetic causes for cardiomyopathy.

721
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,011
Today, there are 34.

722
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,818
This right here, this
is the genetic mutation

723
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,287
that gave your kids
cardiomyopathy.

724
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,939
That's what made our kids sick?

725
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:41,374
Yes.

726
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,709
There's...

727
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,879
So it isn't our house.

728
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:49,098
It isn't the water. It isn't
anything, uh, we did.

729
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,938
It wasn't me.

730
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,908
No, Sabine, it
wasn't you. Sabine.

731
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,645
Everything that
you have done has

732
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,298
made your kids
healthier and safer.

733
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,900
You did everything you could.

734
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:09,519
Dr. Yang did
everything she could.

735
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,067
No one could have
known about this.

736
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,739
Okay.

737
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,609
Why... Why did you keep looking?

738
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,994
I just...

739
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,364
When I find a puzzle,

740
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,833
it's very hard for
me to put it down.

741
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,243
Son of a bitch. I'm
sorry. I got to go.

742
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,030
Thank you. WOMAN:
Thank you so much.

743
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,010
I need that crash cart in here!

744
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,203
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

745
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,683
Wait for what? Get off.

746
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:46,947
I got it! I got her!

747
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,473
You got to go harder
than that, Pierce.

748
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,657
She's my patient. I
know what she can take.

749
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:59,497
Okay, let me in. I
have to shock her.

750
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:00,670
I have this.

751
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,183
Pierce, you're not helping her!

752
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,208
Dr. Grey, she can't
take the defibrillation.

753
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,426
I got this.

754
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:11,781
Marjorie. You're all
right. You're okay.

755
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,433
I'm here with you. It's okay.

756
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:14,942
Pierce, you're letting her die.

757
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:16,903
Pierce.

758
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,404
You're okay.

759
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,024
Pierce! It's okay.

760
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,213
You're okay.

761
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,175
Time of death?

762
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:42,529
Time of death, Dr. Grey?

763
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,820
Nurse, what is the time?

764
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,789
20:42.

765
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,428
Time of death, 20:42.

766
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,759
Pierce.

767
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,945
Pierce. Pierce, hold up.

768
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,615
Chief.

769
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,719
I just wanted to say thank you
for what you did for the McNeils.

770
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,457
You gave them some peace.

771
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:32,745
And I'm... I'm glad
you're here, so thank you.

772
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,124
You and Yang did
all the hard work.

773
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:36,749
I just got to bring it
over the finish line.

774
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:39,019
Chief.

775
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,566
I think you should know that
Dr. Pierce just slow-coded a patient

776
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,667
right in front of me.

777
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,918
What? Grey, that is a...

778
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,208
I watched it happen.

779
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,010
She deliberately withheld
care from a coding patient.

780
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,480
Her CPR was totally ineffectual

781
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,360
and she would not let
me defibrillate. Slow down.

782
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,678
Dr. Grey. You let
that woman die.

783
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,084
Grey, slow down! Pierce?

784
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,488
Dr. Grey has been
doubting my effectiveness

785
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:01,625
and undermining my authority
since the minute I got here.

786
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,060
Maybe I'm being judged too
harshly against my predecessor

787
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,761
or maybe she just
doesn't like me,

788
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,065
but I can only say to her what
I will say to my patient's family.

789
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:12,135
I did everything in my power
as a physician to help her,

790
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,104
but I am sorry to
say she's gone.

791
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,548
Are we finished, Chief?

792
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,334
For now.

793
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,407
Grey, wait.

794
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,929
If you want to get me
fired, go ahead. I don't care.

795
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,958
If you want to tell that
woman what I did, fine.

796
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,999
But tell her the whole truth.

797
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,769
Her mother begged
me, in no uncertain terms,

798
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,521
to end her suffering naturally.

799
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,068
She would have signed
papers to that effect,

800
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:52,626
but her daughter
wouldn't allow her to.

801
00:36:52,694 --> 00:36:54,427
Her daughter was
too scared to realize

802
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:57,163
that she was keeping
her alive and in agony.

803
00:36:57,232 --> 00:37:01,635
I did what my patient and I
decided was in her best interest.

804
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,269
You look me in the
eye and tell me you

805
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,538
wouldn't have
done the same thing.

806
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,085
Is she all right, my mother?

807
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:09,586
I went for dinner and some
errands, but when I came...

808
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,445
Jeannie. I'm sorry.

809
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:16,832
Your mother's heart
stopped again, and I...

810
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:27,176
I... Dr. Pierce did
everything in her power.

811
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,963
Despite all our
efforts and capabilities,

812
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:33,116
we were unable to
save your mother.

813
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,465
I am very sorry for your loss.

814
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,377
I'm saying that I
think you're right.

815
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,412
You know, maybe this is
something that I can give up

816
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,314
so that we can have,
you know... Hey!

817
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,937
How's she doing?

818
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,118
Oh, um, no signs of cyanosis
or congestive heart failure.

819
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,908
So far, so good.

820
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,354
Nice work. You, too.

821
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,711
You should go see her.

822
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,179
Thank you, Doctor.

823
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,683
So?

824
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,213
So, I'm gonna pass
on the fellowship.

825
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:10,715
No, you're not. You can't. What?

826
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:12,572
Look, I was wrong this morning.

827
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,451
This isn't a sacrifice that
you should have to make.

828
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:15,715
We can figure this out.

829
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:18,811
If it makes you happy,
that will benefit our kid,

830
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,997
kids, more than anything.

831
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,166
So, you think I should do it?

832
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,079
I think you have to.

833
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,256
Thank you.

834
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:32,275
Goodnight,
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Torres.

835
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,519
Where's the baby? Is the baby...

836
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,371
The baby's fine.
She's beautiful.

837
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,608
Thanks to you, she's fine.

838
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:54,762
I'll let you know as soon
as you can go see her.

839
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,621
Looks like a full recovery, and
we found her parents, Sherlock.

840
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,058
They're on their
way in from Arizona.

841
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,393
Can I ask you guys something?

842
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:09,546
We just hooked up the one time,

843
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,148
but I wanted to ask her out
because she was really cool,

844
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,166
you know, before
she went all derp.

845
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,353
Should I hang out
till she wakes up or

846
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,188
does that make
me look, like, clingy?

847
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,493
Um, that's sweet.

848
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,061
Well, I was once the girl

849
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,581
who went home with the
guy she met an hour ago.

850
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,299
If this had been me,

851
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,401
you would be the last
person I'd want to see.

852
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,186
Oh. Okay.

853
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, maybe run
into her at the gym.

854
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:39,726
Maybe learn her last name.
Maybe invite her to dinner.

855
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,410
Yeah.

856
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,529
Can I have your number?

857
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,866
Go.

858
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:48,835
<i>Most puzzles come down to</i>

859
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:51,638
<i>one last missing
piece of information.</i>

860
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:54,007
<i>Whether it's the answer
to a medical mystery...</i>

861
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,185
Pierce figured out what happened

862
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,671
to the McNeil kids? JO: Mmm-hmm.

863
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,372
That's surprising.
- She solved it.

864
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,181
She did what Yang couldn't
do, and she hates me.

865
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,787
Hi.

866
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,839
I finished your
post-ops. Anything else?

867
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,641
You don't take no for an answer.

868
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,927
So you're insubordinate,
as well as everything else.

869
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,795
No. No?

870
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:21,550
No. I am not insubordinate
or untrustworthy.

871
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,330
I think we got
off to a bad start.

872
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,833
I made a mistake. I should
have told you the whole story.

873
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,523
But I came here to learn,

874
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,193
and I learned a
crap-ton from you today,

875
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:32,394
so I decided I deserved
a second chance,

876
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,493
and you weren't gonna give
me one, so I gave myself one.

877
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:39,018
<i>Or to the question of who
you are, where you fit...</i>

878
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:40,236
Is this your thunder?

879
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,354
Yeah.

880
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,774
All right, Wilson.

881
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,037
I'll see you in the morning.

882
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:49,022
You called me by my name.

883
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,363
I did.

884
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,814
You keep checking your watch.

885
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,345
Did you write my name
on your wrist? I did.

886
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,619
Hmm. I appreciate the effort.

887
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:59,422
<i>It all comes down
to that last piece.</i>

888
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,091
Grey, wait. Can I talk to you?

889
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,504
Tomorrow. I'm heading home.

890
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,839
There's something
I should tell you.

891
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,407
You know what?
I've heard enough.

892
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,871
It's fine. We're
fine. You're fine.

893
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,851
My mother was Ellis Grey.

894
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:13,997
<i>That's why the final
piece of a jigsaw puzzle</i>

895
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,422
<i>is so satisfying to place.</i>

896
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,424
I know. I'm sorry.

897
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:20,926
We... This isn't fair to you.

898
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:23,529
And we got off to a bad
start, but I'm here to work.

899
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,782
And if I'm gonna be
here, I got to be who I am.

900
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,717
So I need you to
know the whole story.

901
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,821
I was put up for
adoption in Boston.

902
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,589
In Boston? Yes.

903
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,724
And I was adopted
by a very nice couple,

904
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,026
an amazing couple.

905
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,945
They are my parents,
but my mother...

906
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,031
My mother, I found
out a year ago,

907
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,634
my mother was your
mother, Ellis Grey.

908
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:52,942
<i>Unless, of course, the
piece doesn't quite fit.</i>

909
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,911
What do you want?

910
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,079
What?

911
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,429
What are you after here?

912
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:01,700
I know it sounds like...

913
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,214
You're five years
younger than me.

914
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:05,905
If my mother were
pregnant, I would have known.

915
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,356
You're wrong.

916
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,802
Just... Or you're lying.

917
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,192
What? What? Just listen.

918
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,527
Stay away from me.

919
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,410
<i>That can make you
wish you'd never opened</i>

920
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,534
<i>the puzzle in the first place.</i>
