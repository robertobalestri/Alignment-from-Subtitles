1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:08,874
So, he's just back? Mmm.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,025
For good? Yeah.

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,195
Okay, that face
that you're making,

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,814
I don't know you well enough
to know what that means.

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:19,551
You know those very happy,
cheerful people who have everything

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,332
and when the fact that they
have everything comes up,

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,741
they act very humble, and
they say, "I'm just so blessed."

8
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,722
Those people, you want to
punch those people in the face.

9
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,679
Yes. I do know those people.

10
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,292
Yeah, I'm one of those
people now. Okay.

11
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:37,102
This morning, I was standing
on my porch of my perfect house

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,171
<i>looking in the window at
my amazing, perfect children</i>

13
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,185
<i>and my amazing,
gorgeous husband,</i>

14
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,809
<i>on the way to my amazing job.</i>

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,580
<i>And I thought to myself, "I
have everything I've ever wanted.</i>

16
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,866
"I am just so blessed."

17
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,335
I really want to pummel
your face in right now.

18
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:55,937
Right, I would beat myself up.

19
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,255
Except I'm too tired from...

20
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,052
Were you about to say
that you're so exhausted

21
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,596
from all the great
sex you're having?

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,512
I am just so blessed.

23
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,925
I'm gonna walk
away from you now.

24
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,230
<i>Picture the life you
dreamed of living,</i>

25
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,707
<i>the person you
pictured being with.</i>

26
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,709
<i>Picture the job you
dreamed you'd have.</i>

27
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,989
I'm a surgeon
here at Grey Sloan,

28
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,392
but I like to think of
myself first as a teacher.

29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,699
I train young doctors
to become surgeons.

30
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,786
<i>Are you living the life you
envisioned for yourself?</i>

31
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,688
<i>Are you who you wanted to be...</i>

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,437
Okay, guys, let's get
a picture. Come on.

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,750
Everybody, eyes over
there. One, two, three.

34
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,697
Cheese!

35
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>When you grew up?</i>

36
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,505
I have some loose ends in DC,

37
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,518
so I'll be flying back
and forth for a few weeks.

38
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,820
Tie them up, hand them off,
and then I'll be here for good.

39
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,355
And you want to
come back full-time?

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,756
That's the plan. This is great.

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
Mmm-hmm.

42
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,826
Uh, you realize all this
has to be approved?

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,528
By whom? I'm on the
board. I have privileges.

44
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,485
By Amelia.

45
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,522
Of course. I'll ask Amelia.

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,419
I am the head of the
department of neurosurgery,

47
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:10,311
and that means I
operate on brains.

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,314
Cool! Awesome!

49
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,311
It's very cool, actually,

50
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,119
because I fix the big,
squishy, slimy computer

51
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,986
that runs your whole body.

52
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,240
If the brain goes,
everything goes.

53
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,501
It is the coolest.

54
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,759
And, uh, this is
Dr. Derek Shepherd,

55
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:28,079
and he's a member
of our board and, um...

56
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,581
I'm her brother.

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,751
I'm also a neurosurgeon.
I work for her.

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,899
Your sister is your boss?

59
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,155
My sister is my boss.

60
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,906
Okay, kids, uh,
let's keep it moving.

61
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,986
- Uh, thank you, doctors.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

62
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,044
Oh, sweet!

63
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,891
How hard was
that for you to say?

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,665
Rolls off the tongue.

65
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,311
It's not gonna be
like it was before.

66
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,213
I'm not gonna
angle for your job.

67
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,648
I'm not gonna steal your
patients. I just want to work.

68
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,306
You say that now,
but I know you, Derek.

69
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,490
I know us.

70
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,442
You grew up bossing me around.

71
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,494
I don't know that this can work.

72
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,541
Give me a chance,
and I will show you.

73
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,566
I don't have anything
for you today.

74
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:07,202
I'm clipping an aneurysm later.

75
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,770
I will let you know.

76
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,867
You're not gonna
make this fun, are you?

77
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,991
It's a lot of fun for me.

78
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,811
No, no, no.

79
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,046
Ew. Super no.

80
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,425
Wait, no, he's cute, I think.

81
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,049
You're going so fast.

82
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,912
He's 32 and wearing a
high-school letterman jacket.

83
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,714
Your glory days are
over, Steve. Give it up.

84
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,738
You are so quick to judge.

85
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,072
It's a skill.

86
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,652
You spend enough
time on this thing,

87
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,255
you can learn everything you
need to know from the first picture.

88
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,824
Will. Cares too much
about his cars. Hmm.

89
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,310
Mike. Too close with those cats.

90
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,695
Theo needs to
learn to wear a shirt.

91
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,919
Okay, okay, Theo is a no-go,

92
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,032
but maybe your
pickiness is keeping you

93
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,401
from going on any real dates.

94
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,135
You need to expand
your horizons.

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,593
Ugh.

96
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:51,029
My horizons haven't been
expanded in a very long time.

97
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,466
Ugh! Gross! I
mean, yes, but gross.

98
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,381
So, I am a plastic surgeon.

99
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,906
I also operate on the
ear, nose, and throat.

100
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,225
This is Dr. Warren. He is
a terrific surgical resident.

101
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:08,079
And together, we
form the Plastics Posse.

102
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,451
Well, he calls us
that, but I do not.

103
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,814
It's what we're called. It's,
you know, what they call us.

104
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,716
No, see, they don't think
it's cool because it's not.

105
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,351
Well, it's not for
them, Ben. Hmm.

106
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,158
It's for us, okay?

107
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,194
All right, kids, let's
go check out the ER.

108
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,608
All right. Let's go.

109
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,414
Making medicine cool.

110
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,684
Huh? Not familiar with
the high-five. All right.

111
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,180
So, I have a
teleconference all day,

112
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,348
so you can hold
down the fort for me?

113
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,917
But I'm not on
your service today.

114
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,418
You're always on my service.

115
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,086
At least in spirit.

116
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,738
Can I hear it? Once?
You want to say it?

117
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,129
No.

118
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,031
No? Thinking about it? No.

119
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,899
Plastics Posse.

120
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,117
Uh, excuse me. Yeah?

121
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,353
I lost track of my
kids and I... Your kids?

122
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,810
Ten of them, fifth
graders, varying heights.

123
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,545
Oh, the field trip. Yeah.

124
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,514
I went to the restroom, and I
came out, and they'd vanished, so I...

125
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,628
You're a terrible chaperone
is what you're saying.

126
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,848
That's what it looks like, yeah.

127
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,784
I think they're with Dr. Webber
in the emergency room.

128
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,008
You don't, uh, happen to
know where that is, do you?

129
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,426
I do. Follow me.

130
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,744
Okay. Thank you.

131
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,992
A trauma is any kind of injury.

132
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,317
So, if you cut yourself or you
break your leg skateboarding

133
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,499
or wreck your bike, all of
those injuries are called traumas,

134
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,801
and that's what we
are set up here to treat.

135
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,202
Now, for a lot of people,

136
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,103
the emergency room can
be kind of a scary place,

137
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,322
but it's actually...

138
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,445
Cool!

139
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,198
Cool! BOY: A police car!

140
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,910
The police! DAN: I need
some help over here!

141
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,245
Right here, right
here, set him down.

142
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,886
Kids, let's move.

143
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,699
We got two guys down. We
couldn't wait for the medics.

144
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,533
Okay, I need a gurney.
Trauma room is in there.

145
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:42,824
Let's back up.

146
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,989
Page Grey, Torres.
Let's get Cardio in here.

147
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,806
Brett, they got you now, buddy.

148
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,870
All right, you just relax. You
let them take care of you, okay?

149
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,173
It's okay. Okay, let's go.

150
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,733
Just stick against the wall
and let the doctors through.

151
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,101
To the side.

152
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,291
Where are they going?

153
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,759
Is that policeman gonna die?

154
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,556
All right, everyone stay calm.
Everything's okay, all right?

155
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,046
What's going on?

156
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,992
Multiple gunshot wounds
from a robbery still in progress.

157
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,499
Sounds like a bloodbath. Whoa!

158
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,335
Hi, kids. Sorry.

159
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,866
Uh, I should probably
go with them, right?

160
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,022
Did you get paged?

161
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,602
No. Then no.

162
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,386
We should just take the
kids back to the school.

163
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,655
No, we can't. I can't
reach the bus driver,

164
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,805
and he's not due back till 3:00.

165
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,174
Is there someplace
that we can...

166
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,398
Dr. Webber, you coming?

167
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,132
Yeah, I'll be right there.

168
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,234
Um, kids, let's
go see the babies.

169
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,931
It's nice and peaceful up there.
- Excuse me.

170
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:46,153
Dr. Edwards will take you.

171
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,934
I will? Yeah, it'll be fine.

172
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,290
Make medicine fun.

173
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,625
Educate, entertain, inspire.

174
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,661
And keep them away
from the scary stuff.

175
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,996
<i>It was a bank robbery.</i>

176
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,642
Three suspects held up
the bank tellers at gunpoint.

177
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,810
Brett and I moved in first,

178
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,512
but as soon as they
saw us, they panicked.

179
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:02,269
They just started firing, hit me
right through the side of my vest.

180
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,649
Pete, try not to move
your neck, okay?

181
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,173
What are we looking at?

182
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,153
Two gunshot wounds to
the upper left chest cavity.

183
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,655
At least three bullet
holes in his left abdomen.

184
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,123
I'm gonna need access. Here,
I'm gonna start a subclavian line.

185
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,575
Have they brought Brett in yet?

186
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,809
He's being worked
on right next door.

187
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,216
Is he okay?

188
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,080
He took the brunt of it. DAN:
Two of them were armed.

189
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,115
Brett took one of them down,
then he grabbed the other one.

190
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,617
He ended the thing,
even after he was hit.

191
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,619
He's the only reason I'm
standing here right now.

192
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,510
Brett saved it.

193
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,957
Blood's filling his chest
cavity. He'll need bilateral tubes.

194
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,413
Betadine.

195
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,860
Then take him up right
now and start an ex-lap.

196
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,101
Pete, we're gonna
cut into your chest

197
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,314
to place a tube that
will help you breathe.

198
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,300
Even with the pain meds,
it's gonna hurt like hell,

199
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,472
but it's the only way.

200
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,276
All right, C-spine's clear.
I'll get out of your way.

201
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,711
Oh. Whoa!

202
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,019
Uh, hey, you're
bleeding quite a bit there.

203
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,614
I'm fine.

204
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,411
No, you got shot in the leg.

205
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,813
Come on. Let's
get you into a bed.

206
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,048
I need a nurse in here.

207
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm right outside,
Pete, all right?

208
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,340
Mmm.

209
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,786
Dr. Hunt, the officer's
mother is here.

210
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,856
Richard, can you?
Yeah, go ahead. We got it.

211
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,345
Pete, you ready?

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,316
They said I should
speak to a doctor.

213
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,618
Mrs. Gibson, your son sustained

214
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:13,819
multiple gunshot wounds.

215
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:15,320
We're assessing
his injuries now,

216
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,189
and I will update you as
soon as we know more.

217
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,479
Which one?

218
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,898
I'm sorry?

219
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,767
Which one of my
sons? They're both here.

220
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:27,188
The GSW to the neck
definitely hit the trachea.

221
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,724
And he's got one to the abdomen.

222
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,376
Brett, do not try
to talk. We got you.

223
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,157
I need to crike him
before he loses his airway.

224
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,058
Okay, do it quickly. I
got to get him upstairs

225
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,732
and examine these
abdominal injuries.

226
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,713
OR Two is ready for us whenever
he's stable enough to transport.

227
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:43,054
Guys, these two
cops are brothers,

228
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,323
and Pete's injuries
are pretty severe.

229
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,632
So let's not let their mother
lose two sons in one day.

230
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,666
Move, please!

231
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,212
Make way, guys.
Doctor coming through.

232
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,770
Excuse me. Excuse
me! Excuse me, guys.

233
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,471
Move, please.

234
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,807
Um, do you think you could

235
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,493
maybe relocate your guys?

236
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,459
I could try, but
they'll never listen.

237
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,610
Is there any update on Brett?

238
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,902
Um, it is too early to say,
but he's in good hands.

239
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,116
All right, now this looks
like a through-and-through.

240
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,156
Whoa!

241
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,502
You're missing a
chunk of muscle,

242
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,276
and you have exposed
bone fragments.

243
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,677
Wow. What?

244
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,179
Uh, no, I just can't
believe what I'm looking at.

245
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,048
That bad, huh? No, no, no.

246
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:30,017
I just mean I can't believe that
you carried your guy in on this leg.

247
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,326
I didn't have a choice.

248
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,140
No, of course you didn't.
And you know what?

249
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,529
You can tell your guys they
can be wherever they need to.

250
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:44,015
I'm Dan Pruitt.

251
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,734
Dr. Callie Torres.

252
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,297
There he is!

253
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,570
Coming through!

254
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,169
Is that another gunshot victim?

255
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,873
Oh, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Easy. You got to stay off this leg.

256
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,562
Multiple GSWs to the
right abdomen and chest.

257
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,064
Okay, Trauma Three.

258
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,811
Get him intubated,
put in a central line,

259
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,219
and send a trauma panel. Move!

260
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,982
Is he alive? He's alive, right?

261
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,772
Do you know him?

262
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,573
He's one of the suspects.

263
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,372
He was sitting in the car while
the others were in the bank.

264
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,677
I want to know how he turns out.

265
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,727
Hey, guys, do you see
that one in the back?

266
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,966
Yeah, that's one of mine.

267
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,569
I operated on him
before he was even born.

268
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,439
Now he's two hours
old and cute as a button.

269
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:25,673
A healthy little Pop-Tart.

270
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:26,785
Pop-Tart?

271
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,109
Yeah, a fetus that's popped.

272
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:29,994
A baby that's born
from his mother's womb.

273
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,258
You just ruined
Pop-Tarts for me.

274
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,115
Yes? What's a womb?

275
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,616
Oh, boy.

276
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,970
Um...

277
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,124
You're tanking at this.

278
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,821
I don't understand why 'cause
I'm usually really good with kids.

279
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,838
- I have a question.
- Go ahead.

280
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,825
Is that policeman going to die?

281
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,181
He was shot in the throat.

282
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,328
That's why he was
gurgling blood like that.

283
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,096
And that means he can't breathe,

284
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,820
so isn't he going to die?

285
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,891
How we doing, Pete?

286
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,554
Thinking of going for a run.

287
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,729
This one, always the wise guy.

288
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,643
Does this remind you
of that trip to the ER

289
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,865
when I got hit by the pitch?

290
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,528
You didn't even try
to get out of the way.

291
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:10,952
Nothing changes, right?

292
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,555
I got to learn to duck.

293
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,578
Mom? Yes?

294
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:25,266
Remember that potluck
we did a couple years ago?

295
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,596
With all the guys in your
backyard? Mmm-hmm.

296
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,071
When we get out of here,
we got to do that again, okay?

297
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,991
But bigger, more people.

298
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,043
We'll invite these
doctors. Everybody loved it.

299
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,646
Okay. Sure, honey.

300
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:41,649
We were gonna make it
an annual thing, remember?

301
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:42,984
We never did.

302
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,286
We got to do that...

303
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,704
Pete?

304
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,920
Peter!

305
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,427
We're gonna take good
care of your boy, ma'am.

306
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,856
We need Pierce back in here!

307
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,834
They've got him, Mrs.
Gibson. Pete's a tough kid.

308
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,368
What are you doing?

309
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,086
There's a trauma.
I didn't page you.

310
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,009
Amelia, I'm here to
help you. Let me help.

311
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:10,523
You're the boss. I'll
do whatever you need.

312
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,875
You want to help?
Take my aneurysm.

313
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,483
OR Four. Go clip it.

314
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:18,002
And there it is. That pause.

315
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,249
The one that means, "I don't
want the boring aneurysm.

316
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,556
"I want the big,
exciting neuro trauma."

317
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,409
You don't do second place.

318
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,193
I do now. I'm
clipping an aneurysm.

319
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,725
We have an audience
out there. I know.

320
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,002
Starting cardiac massage.

321
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,154
Hang another unit of
blood on the rapid infuser.

322
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,433
Right away.

323
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,357
Come on.

324
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,804
Come on, Pete.
Give me something.

325
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,328
Give me anything.

326
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,850
I have a heartbeat.

327
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,764
Got a pulse. There he is.

328
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,188
What's the story?

329
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:55,897
Traumatic arrest.
Down for 14 minutes.

330
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,014
Pupils are fixed.

331
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,348
No.

332
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,250
We lost him?

333
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,485
No corneal reflex, either.

334
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,897
I'll do a formal
exam in six hours,

335
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,641
but someone needs
to prepare the family.

336
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,976
He's most likely
brain dead. I'm sorry.

337
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,030
We lost him.

338
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,928
Pete's body is still strong,

339
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,350
but I'm afraid his brain

340
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,659
has been deprived
of oxygen for too long.

341
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,723
He won't wake up?

342
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,844
No. I'm afraid he's brain dead.

343
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:57,017
Mrs. Gibson, I am
so sorry for your loss.

344
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,236
And Brett?

345
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,421
He's still in surgery.

346
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,323
And he's gonna be okay?

347
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:04,425
He's stable now.

348
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,614
We're taking care of
him as best we can.

349
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,650
Who would do this to them?

350
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,803
Okay, blood in the
abdomen. Possible liver injury.

351
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,273
Turn him on three.
One, two, three.

352
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,337
No visible wounds on his back.

353
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,695
Looks like a bullet's
lodged near his spine.

354
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,064
Page Neuro! Tell them
to meet us in the OR.

355
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,193
Bailey, there's a cop
asking about this...

356
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,117
Oh, my God, how old is he, 15?

357
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,747
Too young to be
playing with guns.

358
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,655
This kid was really
shooting at cops?

359
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,084
But he's the driver,
according to the police.

360
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,156
Alleged driver.

361
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,276
Can I tell him anything?

362
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,378
Tell him he's
still alive, for now.

363
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,741
Notify OR Six we're on our
way up with an emergency ex-lap.

364
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,005
Right away.

365
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,801
Whoa!

366
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,170
Awesome!

367
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,972
What did I tell you?
Pretty cool, right?

368
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,259
Questions? Me! Me! Me! I do!

369
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,960
Mmm.

370
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,145
I got a marble stuck
in my nose once.

371
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,848
That's not a question.

372
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:01,916
Gross.

373
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,462
Are you sure this is okay?

374
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,863
Yeah, it's totally fine.

375
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,021
We got the nail out. "We"?

376
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,789
You pulled that nail
out of a guy's head?

377
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,975
I did.

378
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,761
Wow. So, you're
kind of a badass, huh?

379
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,991
I am. ALEX: Okay, next slide.

380
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,349
And this is a coffee
can in a man's abdomen.

381
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,634
Cool! That's disgusting.

382
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,648
Okay, now that is...

383
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,712
That's definitely
not appropriate.

384
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,887
It's totally fine. We
got the can out, too.

385
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,510
Sure, yeah.

386
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,929
But they're gonna
ask how it got in there.

387
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,511
Okay, guys, bus is
here. Let's roll out.

388
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,869
What is that?

389
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,020
It's a coffee can.

390
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,390
All right. Let's go,
guys. Come on.

391
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,759
Dang, just when we
were starting to have fun.

392
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,049
Bye! Bye.

393
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,863
Hey.

394
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,621
Hey. I thought Amelia...

395
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,006
Uh, I was looking for
the other Dr. Shepherd.

396
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,485
She's busy with a trauma. Ah.

397
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,976
Did you talk to her?

398
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,288
I did. And?

399
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,341
I'm clipping an
aneurysm for her.

400
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,365
Huh.

401
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,631
And you're good with that?

402
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,217
What do you mean?

403
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:12,470
Well, it's a far cry from mapping
the brain for the president.

404
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,955
She's been talking to you.

405
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,606
A bit.

406
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm good with it. Actually,
I'm a little nervous.

407
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,044
You sure you
want to tell me that?

408
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,725
No, I mean, it's a good
nervous, a good, excited.

409
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,810
I just haven't operated
in months, and...

410
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,397
It feels really good to be back.

411
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,865
Well, I'm glad to have you back.

412
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,873
Hey, Hunt. We
should hang out more.

413
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,041
Do you fish?

414
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,110
Never. Never have.

415
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:36,418
You should. We will.

416
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,611
Okay.

417
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
All right. Okay.

418
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,767
The bullet's nicked the bone,
but there's no cord damage.

419
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,381
I'd say leave it. Your call.

420
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,806
This liver's in bad shape.
It's actually avulsed.

421
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,869
The blood supply's
completely gone.

422
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,337
A kid this young
helps commit robbery?

423
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,921
He's not much older than Tuck.

424
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,998
Aw, damn it.

425
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,401
No, there's no
saving this liver.

426
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,381
He's gonna need a
transplant and fast.

427
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,939
Wow. So, someone
doesn't get a liver

428
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,552
because this shooter gets one?

429
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,609
He won't survive without one.

430
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,956
And we don't know if this
boy even had a gun on him.

431
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,813
Please. If he
didn't shoot a cop,

432
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,682
he was an accessory
to someone who did.

433
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,867
He'll be tried as an
adult. Hey, he's a patient.

434
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,602
We don't pay attention
to the backstory.

435
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,149
We don't know
anything about him.

436
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,151
We know we lost a cop today.

437
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,285
And we know he chose

438
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,887
to help his friends hold
people up at gunpoint.

439
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,244
You do that, you pretty
much get the hand you're dealt.

440
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:32,600
Pack him and
aggressively resuscitate.

441
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,212
Then leave him here
with a scrub nurse.

442
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,787
And you go find his
family. I'll call UNOS.

443
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,775
All right. First things first.

444
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:43,505
I checked on your partner,
Brett. He's still in surgery.

445
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,129
Minimal internal injury.

446
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,692
They're still working
on the trachea repair,

447
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,761
but it didn't hit any of
the major blood vessels,

448
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,450
which is really great news.

449
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,253
Thank you. That's... Thanks.

450
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,466
Now you.

451
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,502
You aren't going to
need surgery, just a splint,

452
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,237
but it does mean that
you'll need to stay off of it

453
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,445
for at least six
weeks, maybe eight.

454
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,792
You think that means
one week, I can tell.

455
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,136
But it means six.
At least, okay?

456
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,970
After today, you know,

457
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,339
I think I might want to
ride a desk for a while.

458
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,725
After 14 years on the
force, this is the first time

459
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,560
I ever had to fire
my weapon on duty.

460
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,195
First time we were fired at.

461
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,431
Wow.

462
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,046
Well, it sounds like it was a
good run. I'm sorry it ended.

463
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,103
Thank you.

464
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,223
Any word on the kid?

465
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,009
Uh, no. Still in the OR. Okay.

466
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,157
I just need something
good to come out of this day.

467
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,465
Abdominal injuries
are under control.

468
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,434
I'm ready to close. You
about done, Kepner?

469
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,281
Almost. Then I'll
let Wilson close.

470
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:43,621
Thank you, Dr. Kepner.

471
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,884
Okay, update me
when you're done.

472
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:50,527
He's de-satting. What is it?

473
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,531
Uh, it's not me. Field is
clear. There's no bleeders.

474
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,367
Nothing here. Tube's
intact. No leaks.

475
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,831
Check his pupils.

476
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,161
No response.

477
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,989
Oh, damn it. Damn
it, damn it, Brett.

478
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:10,159
Did he throw a clot?

479
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,550
We won't know until
we get him up to CT.

480
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,685
Page Neuro, ask them
to meet us post-op.

481
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,603
Right away. We had him.

482
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,572
We had him.

483
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,817
I'm so sorry, Mrs.
Gibson. Brett's gone.

484
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,692
I knew this could happen.

485
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,087
I'm afraid Brett suffered a
large stroke during surgery.

486
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,623
Unfortunately,
it's not uncommon.

487
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,625
In this case, the
damage was very severe,

488
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,795
and it resulted in brain death.

489
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,916
Mrs. Gibson, there was
nothing anyone could do.

490
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,184
But his hand is
still warm in mine.

491
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:09,139
His heart's beating.
I can see his breath.

492
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,330
I woke up this morning the
mother of two perfect children.

493
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:20,117
Happy, proud. And now...

494
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,422
I just don't understand.

495
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,325
Very sorry, Mrs. Gibson.

496
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,261
Oh, God.

497
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,209
Hey, how's he doing?

498
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,555
Pressure's dropping, and
he's oozing from his drains.

499
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,230
Well, UNOS didn't
have anything available.

500
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:53,818
Neither did any of the
hospitals here or in Oregon.

501
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,180
Did you track down his family?

502
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,204
Oh, he's in the system.

503
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,993
His latest foster
parents haven't seen him

504
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,669
since the night he came
to stay with them, though,

505
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,860
so, they're not exactly
racing down here.

506
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,497
So he's alone? He's just
gonna die here, alone.

507
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,998
How much time do we have?

508
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,267
Well, without a
liver, he's got hours.

509
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,757
Ben, stay with him.
Keep his SBP above 100.

510
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,425
Where you going?

511
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,071
Well, I just can't
go to sleep tonight

512
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,495
knowing I didn't try
absolutely everything.

513
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,478
God, I mean, how
did this happen?

514
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,213
This day started out so great.

515
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,003
"Blessed," I think you said.

516
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,339
Now I have to go ask the
mom for her son's organs.

517
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,302
That sucks. But is
this how it has to be?

518
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,844
If I'm that happy, someone
else has to be that unhappy?

519
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,747
I mean, this poor cops'
mom lost two sons today.

520
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,251
What? Two sons?

521
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,720
Stroke. On the table.

522
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,505
Oh, God!

523
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:49,807
Uh, ugh.

524
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,908
Okay, you have to tell
their commanding officer.

525
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,927
He's been asking
for good news all day.

526
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:57,381
Sure, I'll go talk to him as soon
as I'm done asking the mom

527
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,967
if we can cut up her
hero sons for body parts.

528
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,785
Which, what time is it?

529
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,615
Those organs will
be dead soon, too.

530
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,149
Also, the commanding
officer keeps asking

531
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,540
about the kid they brought in.

532
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,370
I think it's 'cause he just
wants to hear that he's dead.

533
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,476
Can you blame him?

534
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,478
Uh...

535
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:12,858
I showed a bunch of school kids

536
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:15,466
that x-ray of a coffee can
stuck up some guy's butt.

537
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,962
Riveting. Alex.

538
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,201
Read the room, man.

539
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,982
I was just trying
to cheer you up.

540
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,190
Oh, Grey, um, is your
patient an organ donor?

541
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,675
I'm about to go ask her now.

542
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,706
Oh, when? Now? 'Cause,
you know, there's a window.

543
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,996
I know, Bailey. I know.

544
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,981
And I have a 15-year-old
boy open in the OR

545
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,267
who needs a liver, and
UNOS is coming up empty.

546
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,986
Fifteen-year-old?
You're not talking about...

547
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,322
I checked your patient,
and he's a perfect match.

548
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,573
And we can do it today

549
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:43,377
if the mother would
consider a directed donation.

550
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,911
Are you serious?

551
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,547
Okay, all I'm asking is
that you bring it up with her.

552
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,299
Just ask. No!

553
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,518
He will not survive
without a new liver.

554
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:54,655
Bailey, asking for her
sons' organs is hard enough.

555
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,857
Now you want me
to ask her for organs

556
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:59,037
to give to the kid
that killed her sons?

557
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,438
Okay, take away
the story. Right?

558
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,496
Take away the good
guys and the bad guys.

559
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,632
It's a child who needs an organ

560
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,100
and a patient with one to give.

561
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:10,203
Bailey, that woman
lost everything today.

562
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:13,007
I know! Okay, you
don't think I know that?

563
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,876
But ethically, you have to.

564
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,223
Ethically, I'm looking
out for the best interest

565
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,407
of my patient and his family.

566
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,581
Hey, thanks for walking us out.

567
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,915
You know, you
didn't have to do that.

568
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,819
With your sense of
direction, I kind of did.

569
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,874
That's...

570
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,059
That is absolutely true.

571
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,956
I know it's been a drag for you,

572
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,814
but I really appreciate it.

573
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,416
You really did make
it fun, so thank you.

574
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,152
Well, thank you. Where's Julie?

575
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,116
What? I can't find Julie.
She's not on the bus.

576
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,806
Have you seen her? No.

577
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,552
Oh. Wait, Julie
is the one who...

578
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,954
Who was asking about
the policeman. That Julie.

579
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,945
She was just right
here, wasn't she?

580
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,713
Julie?

581
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:54,926
Hey, don't worry.
We'll find her.

582
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,061
We'll find her, ma'am.

583
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,602
I know this is a difficult time

584
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,171
and it's the last thing
you'd want to think about,

585
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,560
but you do have a
decision to make.

586
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,788
Do you know if your sons

587
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,847
would have considered
becoming organ donors?

588
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,617
They were always helping
people, even as little boys.

589
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,821
That's why they
wanted to be policemen.

590
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,756
Well, Brett did.

591
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,325
Pete, he was always
a little mixed up.

592
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,361
He just followed Brett,
but then he found his way.

593
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,500
I think that that's
what they'd want.

594
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,918
I think they'd want to help.

595
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:35,456
Okay. There'll be some
paperwork to fill out.

596
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:38,959
Uh, Mrs. Gibson, it is
possible for you to designate

597
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:41,712
where you want
your son's liver to go.

598
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,514
Uh, specifically, I
have a young patient,

599
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,884
he's only 15, desperately
in need of a liver.

600
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,738
He's a perfect match
with your son Brett.

601
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:54,642
Oh, God. So
young. That's terrible.

602
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,394
And you think Brett
could help that boy?

603
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,614
He could. You could.

604
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,933
Fifteen. Mmm. What
happened to him?

605
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,338
Well, he was
injured in the robbery.

606
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,324
Wait, you're not saying...

607
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:14,578
Okay, Mrs. Gibson, I understand
it's an impossible question,

608
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,079
but we need to ask...

609
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,899
No, he murdered my boys.

610
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:22,336
You have the
audacity to walk in here

611
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,639
and ask me to give
him my child's body,

612
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:29,042
my child's blood,
so he can live?

613
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,965
No, he's not getting
anything. He can go to hell.

614
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,270
Grey, well, I had
to try for my...

615
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,200
For your patient, I know.

616
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,569
But now that's dozens
of transplant patients

617
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,633
that you just screwed
out of a chance.

618
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,651
What happened? My
daughter's missing.

619
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:01,436
I knew we should have
gone home immediately.

620
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,794
Ma'am, just try and
stay calm, okay?

621
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,440
Is she the kind of
kid who wanders off?

622
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,847
No. No. What if
someone took her?

623
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,316
Do you think someone took her?

624
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:12,419
Now, look, we took a
class picture this morning.

625
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,721
This is her. This is
what she's wearing.

626
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,268
I'll send this out to my guys,

627
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,187
and we'll track her down, okay?

628
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,273
Edwards, have the
paging system call for her.

629
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:22,707
You know what
the girl looks like.

630
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,343
Start checking the
floors, room by room.

631
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,761
Okay.

632
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,500
<i>Julie Hamilton,</i>

633
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,314
<i>Julie Hamilton,
please report to...</i>

634
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,339
And he's so cute and
he's incredible with the kids.

635
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,886
Really? Seems like he
wouldn't have lost one, then.

636
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,221
No, no, you should have seen him

637
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:37,488
when she actually went missing.

638
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,313
He stepped up and...

639
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,514
Well, he might be a little
young for me, though.

640
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,083
Well, better than too old.

641
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,298
And can I really date a teacher?

642
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:48,188
Why not?

643
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:51,058
He gets off work at 3:00
p.m. I get off work at 3:00 a.m.

644
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,071
When will we have time
to... Steph, stop. Stop!

645
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,229
This isn't shirtless
cat guy on the Internet.

646
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:58,365
Stop looking for reasons
not to like the nice, cute guy.

647
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,245
You're hot for
teacher. Let it happen.

648
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,803
I'm gonna let it happen.

649
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,957
Is there any hope?

650
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,236
I'm afraid not.

651
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,371
We'll observe them
for the next six hours,

652
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,555
but there's no
brain activity at all.

653
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:14,965
How's their mom?

654
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:18,194
She is going to need all
the support you can give her.

655
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,620
Thank you. Okay.

656
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,224
What about the kid? Jared?

657
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:25,604
Listen, Dan, I
know you're angry,

658
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:26,988
and I know that
you need to know,

659
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,407
but we can't talk about a
suspect's condition, not legally.

660
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:31,615
I'm not looking to
settle a score, okay?

661
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,885
I knew this kid.

662
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,337
Brett knew this kid.

663
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,474
We put him in juvie. We
got him into the foster system.

664
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:41,591
We tried.

665
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,675
Jared's one of those kids, you
know. He's smart. He's funny.

666
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,465
He's just susceptible
to bad things,

667
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:49,983
bad choices, bad kids.

668
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,489
Brett would have
called this his moment.

669
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:56,797
What's his moment?

670
00:27:58,494 --> 00:28:00,927
He called it... He
called it the moment,

671
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:03,963
when a kid would back
themselves into a corner.

672
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,599
When it would
hit the fan so bad,

673
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,646
that there's no other
choice but to turn it around,

674
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,952
wind up in lockup, or dead.

675
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,410
Brett would say, "That's
when you can get them, Dan.

676
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,780
"That's when you
can turn them around."

677
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:23,577
And this would have
been it for Jared.

678
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,488
And Brett would have
been here to help.

679
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,282
So, Derek's back.

680
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,786
Is that a question?

681
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,755
No, it's just...

682
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,358
And I'm glad, I am,
for you and the kids,

683
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,405
and I don't want to
make this all about me.

684
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:54,464
It's just he says he wants
to come back and just work.

685
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,399
For me.

686
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,952
Still not sure
what you're asking.

687
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:02,456
Well, I'm asking should I
believe that? Can I believe that?

688
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:03,657
I do.

689
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:04,825
You do.

690
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:06,209
Yeah, he's different.

691
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,011
I don't know how to explain it,

692
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,349
but I think he realizes
what makes him happy,

693
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,517
and he's choosing it.

694
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,119
And that makes me happy.

695
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,389
I think this is his moment.

696
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,102
Grey, what did you call me for?

697
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,070
'Cause if you just want
to yell at me some more...

698
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,062
Nope. I think I just
got that kid his liver.

699
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,878
Jared is prepped and
ready, still in OR Six.

700
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,331
Thank you. And thank
you, Officer Gibson.

701
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,750
Here's your second
chance, Jared.

702
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,374
Okay, first kidney is out.

703
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,642
<i>Julie Hamilton, Julie Hamilton,</i>

704
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,466
<i>please report to any hospital
personnel member immediately.</i>

705
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:27,684
<i>You see that?</i>

706
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,993
<i>Yeah...</i>

707
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,494
Well, there you are.

708
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:43,333
Am I in trouble?

709
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,172
You know, you're not really
supposed to be up here.

710
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,176
I saw that man in the
ER. He was bleeding.

711
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,174
Yeah, the doctors worked
really hard to try to save him.

712
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:59,850
But he died. So they're
taking all his parts out?

713
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,918
Mmm-hmm.

714
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,986
He's a donor,

715
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,622
so his body is
gonna help save lives

716
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,174
of people who
need organs to live.

717
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:10,527
My grandpa had a
heart transplant once.

718
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,898
Will she give his
heart to someone else?

719
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,182
Yes, she will.

720
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,452
I want to do that.

721
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,505
Be a donor? No.

722
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,741
The doctor. I want to
do what she's doing.

723
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,347
That's my wife. See
the lead surgeon?

724
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,800
And right now she's making
sure that the artery to the kidney

725
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,868
is long enough to
attach to someone else.

726
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,271
How did she learn all that?

727
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:43,343
She went to school
a lot and practiced.

728
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:48,114
And she's just really great.

729
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:50,450
Yeah.

730
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,736
I think that's
what I want to be.

731
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:57,791
Feels good, doesn't it?

732
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,180
Knowing what you
want to do next.

733
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,549
Thank God, Julie!

734
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,884
Oh!

735
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,223
Hey, baby.

736
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,535
That boy's alive?

737
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,803
He is.

738
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,090
Because of my son?

739
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:35,679
That boy and the 37 others
that were in the bank today.

740
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:39,750
Thirty-seven people got to
go home to their families today

741
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,318
because of your sons.

742
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,938
Now, I would have called
that a pretty good day's work.

743
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:46,086
But, Grey...

744
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,909
This is a list of 100 people

745
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:52,028
who all got second chances
today because of your sons.

746
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,641
Now, they won't
know who to thank,

747
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:57,100
so I would like
to say thank you.

748
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,276
They were good boys.

749
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,949
Okay, here we are.

750
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,299
I'll just put on the brakes.

751
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,920
All right.

752
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,557
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

753
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,069
Oh.

754
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,293
Good.

755
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,278
All right, looks good.

756
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,635
Use the crutches.

757
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,715
I know you won't think
you need them, but do it.

758
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,039
It'll heal faster.

759
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,242
Thank you, Dr. Torres.
For everything.

760
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,027
Oh, I'm...

761
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:44,024
I'm so sorry about your
friends, Officer Pruitt.

762
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,281
Thanks.

763
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,731
Hey, listen, um... Yeah?

764
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,654
Never mind.

765
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,123
No, no, no. What is it?

766
00:34:55,677 --> 00:35:02,015
Well, it's just that if
today weren't today,

767
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:05,585
if it was any other day,
like, you know, a regular day,

768
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,022
I'd ask you if you'd like
to have dinner with me.

769
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,944
It's like I said, you know,

770
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,948
I just needed something
to come out of this day right.

771
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,475
Um...

772
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:34,714
Well, I will need to see you
back here in, um, 10 days

773
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:37,064
for a follow-up on that leg.

774
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,554
Ten days?

775
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:43,707
Is that all right?

776
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,594
Sounds like a plan.

777
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:48,894
That is a plan.

778
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,016
All right. See you in 10 days.

779
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:57,904
Hmm.

780
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:05,128
Nick. Hey. Dr. Edwards.

781
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,608
Glad I get the chance to say
goodbye. Better make it quick, though.

782
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,994
I'm not letting this kid out of
my sight again. Oh, son of a...

783
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:12,458
Wait, wait, hang on.
Before you run off.

784
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:15,088
Uh...

785
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:19,242
I could be totally off base
here, but you and I maybe had...

786
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,546
Hmm.

787
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,099
Would you like to maybe
hang out sometime?

788
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,402
Wait, really?

789
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,856
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
you'd really want to?

790
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,975
Yeah. I would.

791
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:36,176
Um...

792
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,455
We could grab a
drink or something.

793
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,761
Oh, I can't drink. I'm...

794
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,913
Oh, okay. Then coffee.

795
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,799
Coffee's great. Yeah,
I'm all about the coffee.

796
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,945
Perfect. Cool.

797
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,236
Well, I'm free Friday night.

798
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:50,639
I can't. Friday's
the junior prom.

799
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,759
You chaperone
high-school events, too?

800
00:36:52,828 --> 00:36:54,477
No, I go to them.

801
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,983
Seventeen years old?

802
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,997
Could you maybe
not scream it like that?

803
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,254
Oh, my God! I
can't... I can't breathe.

804
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,790
Oh!

805
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,926
I know I told you to expand
your horizons, but oh, my...

806
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,707
It was his little
sister's class.

807
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:18,067
He said he was doing this
teacher-helper-volunteer thing.

808
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,671
Thought it would look good
on his college applications.

809
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,626
I'm gonna need
many more of these.

810
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,433
Hey. Thanks for
doing this for me.

811
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:42,859
These two will look as
good as they possibly can

812
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,428
before their mother
sees them one last time.

813
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,399
Though it's taking a little
longer than I expected.

814
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,970
You okay?

815
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:54,921
Yeah.

816
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:56,256
Yeah?

817
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,624
Yeah. I'm fine.

818
00:38:01,563 --> 00:38:04,330
This is totally something
Sloan would've done.

819
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,699
Really? Yeah.

820
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:09,169
You know, he really
did treat me like a son.

821
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,237
Passed everything on.

822
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:14,707
Got such a charge out
of it, the Plastics Posse.

823
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,455
It got a little goofy
sometimes... Mmm-hmm.

824
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,678
Honestly, but...

825
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:21,214
I want to do that.

826
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,117
You know, pass it on to someone,

827
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,419
the way he did for me.

828
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,921
Whatever. I don't know
if I'm making any sense.

829
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:35,027
It makes a lot of sense.

830
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,934
Yeah.

831
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,329
Whew.

832
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,630
It's cold out here.

833
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,865
It's quiet out here.

834
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,467
Mmm.

835
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,503
Ever since you've been back,
you guys have been reconnecting.

836
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,505
Vigorously.

837
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,640
You should have
built thicker walls.

838
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,890
You okay?

839
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,347
What do you mean?

840
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,882
I didn't want to ask you,

841
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,651
and I'm not supposed
to big-brother you.

842
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,120
And you don't need me to.

843
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,574
There was a robbery,

844
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:25,042
two shootings, and you
declared two men dead.

845
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,932
I kept thinking about Dad.

846
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,795
I wanted to know if you're okay.

847
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,641
I'm happy for you.

848
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,577
That you're back,

849
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,413
you're making it work.

850
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:45,742
That you're not running.

851
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,911
What do you mean, "running"?

852
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:52,638
Hey, I am not judging.
We are runners.

853
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,608
I ran from my engagement.
You ran from Addison.

854
00:39:57,112 --> 00:40:00,813
I think, after Dad,

855
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:07,536
if something scares us,
we sprint, fast as we can.

856
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:12,618
But you turned around this time.

857
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:17,463
That's something. I'm inspired.

858
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,232
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

859
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,433
<i>Take a good look around you.</i>

860
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,647
Did mom tell you I
went to go see her?

861
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,188
No.

862
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,523
Wow. How did that go?

863
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:31,294
She said I was tired and
miserable, which I was.

864
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,308
Told me to get it together.

865
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,266
No sympathy. Oh, no, never.

866
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:42,272
She said, "Derek, take a
good, hard look at your life.

867
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,141
"If it's not working,
shut up and fix it."

868
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,728
<i>How's the view?</i>

869
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,330
<i>Do you like what you see?</i>

870
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,134
Amy, I've been missing
out on everything in my life.

871
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:00,005
I mean, I'm watching my
kids grow up on a computer.

872
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:03,509
I don't want to miss my family.

873
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,978
I don't want to miss
another second.

874
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,848
I want to coach soccer,
go to ballet recitals.

875
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:12,271
I don't need to
change the world.

876
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:17,323
Clipping aneurysms,
stopping bleeds,

877
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,925
that's the fun.

878
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:22,462
That's changing the
world with our hands.

879
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,383
<i>Think back again to
when you were little.</i>

880
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,733
When did that stop being enough?

881
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,255
Saving someone's life?

882
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,725
<i>Are you living the life
you pictured for yourself?</i>

883
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,126
That's more than enough.

884
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:44,968
I'm glad you're back.

885
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,344
Me too.

886
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,795
I think I'm falling in
love with Owen Hunt.

887
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,852
And I'm really afraid
that it's gonna destroy me.

888
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,625
It wouldn't be
love if it didn't.

889
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,234
<i>Or are you still dreaming
of something even bigger?</i>
