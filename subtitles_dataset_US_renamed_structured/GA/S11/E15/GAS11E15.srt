1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:08,073
<i>Your kids, your keys,
your family photo album.</i>

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,386
Little more suction.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,527
Perfect. There it is.
Clipping the cystic duct.

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>It's the list you
repeat in your head</i>

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,241
<i>before you fall asleep.</i>

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,399
I just went to prep Lizzie
Hagans for her biopsy,

7
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:20,301
and it was already
done. By you. At 5:00 a.m.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,803
You're welcome.

9
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,783
I thought you were going to D.C.

10
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:27,609
I was, until Mr. Cordell got
septic from his gallstones.

11
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,557
Derek can wait.
Mr. Cordell can't.

12
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,883
Why is your
girlfriend stalking me?

13
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:40,272
<i>It's the short list of things
you'd grab in case of disaster.</i>

14
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,625
So apparently, Grey
starts morning pre-rounds

15
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,761
in the middle of the night now.

16
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,630
I've been here for hours.

17
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,810
<i>The list makes
you feel in control.</i>

18
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,684
What are we looking at?

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:56,538
I don't know. I'll
know when I see it.

20
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,267
Okay, now what am I looking at?

21
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,625
All of Grey's surgeries
since November.

22
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,694
At first, I thought
it was just a fluke.

23
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,464
My God. Is this right?

24
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,592
<i>Your kids.</i>

25
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,694
She hasn't lost
a single patient,

26
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,696
not one bad outcome
since November?

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,036
How is that possible?

28
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,588
She's on a streak.

29
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,737
<i>Your keys.</i>

30
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,969
It's time for rounds. Let's go.

31
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,510
Dude, Grey is
pitching a no-hitter.

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,690
She hasn't lost a single
patient since November.

33
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,846
What?

34
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,848
<i>Your family photo album.</i>

35
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,328
Whoa.

36
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,032
<i>When the fire starts,</i>

37
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,190
<i>when the tsunami hits,</i>

38
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,174
<i>when the earth literally quakes,</i>

39
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:34,120
<i>do you remember your list?</i>

40
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,314
Whoa! Watch the cabinet!

41
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,055
Somebody...

42
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,300
I got it! I got it!

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,347
<i>Or do you just duck and cover?</i>

44
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,083
You okay? We're okay.

45
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,717
Everybody okay?

46
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,306
We're not moving.

47
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,691
Yeah, safety feature.

48
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,521
It did this to me after
the last earthquake.

49
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,860
The last earthquake?

50
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,034
I did a lot of research about
Seattle before I moved out here.

51
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,682
Earthquakes were
never mentioned.

52
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,146
They don't happen too often.

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,664
Only when you ride in
elevators, apparently.

54
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,133
Apparently.

55
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,291
Remind me not to ride in
an elevator with you again.

56
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,493
Sure, Dr. Pierce, or I guess I
could just start taking the stairs.

57
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,596
It is Dr. Pierce, right?

58
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,352
Yeah, uh... Um...

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Ethan.

60
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,705
Sorry. Ethan. Yeah.

61
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,679
Oncology, right?

62
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,409
Radiology.

63
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,995
Sorry.

64
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,064
No problem.

65
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,151
Ah. There we are. Oh. Yeah.

66
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,415
Anyway, see you around.

67
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,642
Yep.

68
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,712
<i>My God!</i>

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,248
You had to dive on top of me?

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,001
I was being your human
shield. I was protecting you.

71
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,904
Do I strike you as a woman
who needs protecting?

72
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:10,438
You're right. All right.

73
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,387
Next time, I'm gonna use
you as my human shield.

74
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,088
Oh, I should call
and check on Tuck.

75
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,791
Oh, you know who probably
felt it where she lives?

76
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,614
Hmm? Your sister.

77
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,751
Yeah, you should call
and see if she's okay.

78
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,819
I will call when I am ready.

79
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:29,274
I've asked you, Miranda.
Please, just let this rest.

80
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,421
Well, what about the
trans-family support group tonight,

81
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,029
the one I told you about?
You planning to go, or...

82
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,341
No. Why not?

83
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,016
Why is this any
of your business?

84
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,769
Why, indeed?

85
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,823
Miranda. Miranda!

86
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,725
Warren. There he is.
Hey, you feel that quake?

87
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,027
Yes. Yes, I did.

88
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,706
Exciting stuff, exciting stuff.

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,633
Almost as exciting as what I
have planned for you today.

90
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,635
Breast enhancements
and nose jobs.

91
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,732
You need to fix that attitude.

92
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,907
Today is all about instilling
self-confidence and changing lives.

93
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,836
So, you play your cards right,

94
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,813
you just might get an invite
from me to join the Plastics Posse.

95
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,451
You think that sounds cool?

96
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,520
I did not, at first,
but it grows on you.

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,758
Come on.

98
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,729
Two more on the way,

99
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,408
one adult male, blunt
abdominal trauma,

100
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,176
one minor with a
leg fracture post-fall.

101
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,282
Page Grey and Karev.

102
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,718
Right away.

103
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,305
Kepner, you're here.
I'm glad to see you back.

104
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,841
Yep, back and busy.
Here, you take bed eight.

105
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,371
I'm gonna head
over to five and six.

106
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,254
Grey Sloan Emergency.

107
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,316
I got a page? Bed seven.

108
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,352
Okay. Got it.

109
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,621
Did you need something else?

110
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,672
No, no. Bed eight.
I'm on my way.

111
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,641
Okay. Yes.

112
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,021
Yeah. MAN: You've
got more incoming?

113
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,945
I was paged about a hip? Yes.

114
00:04:57,014 --> 00:05:00,966
Jean Dominy, 75, angioplasty
patient, discharged last week,

115
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,579
brought in today with
shortness of breath after a fall.

116
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,237
Well, I fell out of bed,
dear, onto my hip.

117
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,534
I'm pretty sure I
busted the damn thing.

118
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,003
You know, I had it
replaced 15 years ago.

119
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,172
Oh, wow. Okay, so the
earthquake threw you off balance?

120
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:17,398
Yes. Well, that and Herbert.
He lives down the hall.

121
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,546
I invited him over so I
could spit-shine his nine-iron.

122
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,166
His club, dears.

123
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,190
Oh, of course.

124
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,107
I mean, his penis, ooh...

125
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,871
Anyway, well, we
were having sex.

126
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,289
You know, vigorously,
legs up in the air. I mean...

127
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,941
Well, you know how
it goes. Mmm-hmm.

128
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,442
And then... Okay.

129
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,944
So, I'll just check off the
box for "sexually active."

130
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,312
Yeah. Oh, uh, yeah.

131
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,070
See, I have this book
with all the positions listed.

132
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,190
It is like a menu for
love-making. Really?

133
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,437
And, anyway, we
were trying number 28,

134
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,205
you know the... Uh-huh. Oh.

135
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,041
And then the earth
started shaking.

136
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:49,409
And I thought,

137
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,544
"Whoa, there is no
way that Herbert..."

138
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,184
Ow! Ooh. Hmm.

139
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,137
See, now, that's no good.

140
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,240
I'll never get to 29 if
I'm hurting like that.

141
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,143
You can fix it, right?

142
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,755
I'll tell you what. We're
gonna get you some films.

143
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,879
And then we'll go
from there, okay?

144
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,548
Okay. Okay.

145
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,154
14-year-old male, sustained
a non-displaced tib-fib fracture

146
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:14,889
secondary to a 14-foot
fall from a chair lift.

147
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,091
44-year-old male with
blunt abdominal trauma.

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,961
BP is 135 over 85, pulse 95.

149
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,848
So, you all were skiing
when the earthquake hit?

150
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,530
If only. Didn't even get a chance
to ski, thanks to the dweeb.

151
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,488
Danielle, be nice.

152
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,818
Edwards, set up
for a trauma panel

153
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,258
and an abdominal ultrasound.

154
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,654
On it. We were on the lift.

155
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:37,479
I was with Danielle.
Brian was with Micah.

156
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,359
Everything started
shaking, and they fell.

157
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,949
You mean, the dweeb
fell. Dad tried to stop him.

158
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,563
And he took my dad
down with him. Danielle!

159
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,997
You know, he shouldn't
have been up there.

160
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,299
He doesn't ski. He
didn't even want to go.

161
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,789
Okay, why don't you and your mom

162
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,374
go wait in the
waiting room, please?

163
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,242
She's not my mom. Yet.

164
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:53,594
We're engaged.

165
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,041
Brian thought we should
take a family ski trip.

166
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,676
Of course, we always
do what Brian wants to do.

167
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,211
Shut your face. Shut your face!

168
00:06:58,235 --> 00:06:59,511
Why don't we all shut our faces

169
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:03,237
and let us figure out what's
wrong with you guys, okay?

170
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,718
Hey, we need to re-stock the
supply cart in trauma two right away.

171
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:06,875
Right away.

172
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,589
Hey, that kid in bed two's
ready to be discharged.

173
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,558
Ditto bed one, who
has hypochondria

174
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,494
and not a giant tumor
growing in her head.

175
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,637
Heard anything from
Herman? How's she doing?

176
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,350
Ooh, um...

177
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,525
"Enjoying blind institute. Learning
how to not bump into things.

178
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,027
"Not typing this, obvi.
Don't kill any babies."

179
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,673
Okay, well, she
sounds all right.

180
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,408
Is Somebody gonna
answer that call?

181
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:30,794
Not it. Yeah, no, all yours.

182
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,702
I'll page someone for you.

183
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,270
Thank you.

184
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,637
Grey Sloan Emergency.

185
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,217
<i>Is this the hospital?
I need help.</i>

186
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,075
Well, you need to
hang up and call 911.

187
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:42,343
<i>I tried. It was busy.
My mom fell off a chair.</i>

188
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,563
<i>She's not moving. I don't
know what to do. What do I do?</i>

189
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,282
Your what? Your
mom? How old are you?

190
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,918
<i>I'm 11.</i>

191
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,898
Where are you? <i>Our
cabin. I don't know.</i>

192
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,900
<i>The power's out. Please help.</i>

193
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:56,107
All right, it's all
right. Just hang on.

194
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,426
Somebody, Kepner,
get on with 911

195
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,062
and get them to trace the
call on line three right now.

196
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,548
It's a kid with her injured mom
in the mountains somewhere.

197
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,793
Go. Okay.

198
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,384
<i>Are you still there?</i>

199
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,952
I'm here. I'm right here.

200
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,187
What's your name?

201
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,355
<i>Ruby.</i>

202
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,590
Ruby, I'm Owen.

203
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,792
<i>Are you a doctor? Can you help?</i>

204
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,246
I can. I'm right here,
and I'm going to help you.

205
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,658
<i>We were making S'mores.</i>

206
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,004
<i>She was getting hot
chocolate from the cabinet.</i>

207
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,394
Watch your back.

208
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,258
Yes, it's a line coming
into Grey Sloan Memorial.

209
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,577
<i>She was standing on the chair,
and then everything was shaking.</i>

210
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,601
<i>Then she fell. Now she's on the
floor. I can barely see anything.</i>

211
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,755
She's on the floor. Is she
awake? <i>No. What do I do?</i>

212
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,934
Two hours! I waited two hours!

213
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,152
And now I still
can't leave because

214
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,320
somebody
double-parked behind me!

215
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,542
Quiet, please.

216
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,256
Don't you have
security here or a valet?

217
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,808
Listen, I'll find someone...
You better waive my co-pay!

218
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,381
He said, "Quiet!"

219
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,485
I'll get it. I'll help you.

220
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,539
Ruby, I am gonna
move to another phone

221
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,728
so I can hear you better.

222
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,220
<i>Don't hang up.</i> No, no, no.

223
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,545
I'm just moving to another
phone. I'll be right there, okay?

224
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,146
Okay?

225
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,432
<i>Okay.</i>

226
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,051
I always screw this up.

227
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,453
<i>What?</i>

228
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,021
No, no, no. No. Nothing.

229
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,992
Don't worry. I'll be
right back. Just hang on.

230
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,228
Where's that chest X-ray?

231
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,818
Move, move.

232
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,032
- Ruby, you still there?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

233
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,239
What's going on?

234
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,107
Okay.

235
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,909
Uh, is your mom breathing?

236
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,694
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

237
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,463
<i>It sounds like she's snoring.</i>

238
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,365
And what position is she in?

239
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,666
Is she on her side? Is she...

240
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,900
<i>She's on her back.</i>

241
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,114
<i>She's just laying
there.</i> 11-year-old kid,

242
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,583
her mom fell at a
vacation cabin somewhere.

243
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,085
Kepner's trying
to trace the call.

244
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,543
Ruby, I need you to hold the
phone to your mom's mouth, okay?

245
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,290
I need to listen. <i>Okay.</i>

246
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,583
An obstructed airway.

247
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,396
We need a trauma room.
This one's free, right?

248
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,170
No. No.

249
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,437
Occupied, apparently.

250
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,184
She needs to call
911 from a land line.

251
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,708
It's the only way the
EMS can trace her directly.

252
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,943
Ruby, listen to me.

253
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,379
What kind of phone
are you calling on?

254
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,398
If it is the phone in the cabin,

255
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,377
you need to hang
up and call 911.

256
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,869
<i>No, that one's dead.
I'm on a cell, my mom's.</i>

257
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,133
Cell won't work.
Crap. Okay, okay.

258
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:44,992
<i>Her lips are blue. Why
are her lips turning blue?</i>

259
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,630
Because your mom's
not getting enough air.

260
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,046
So, no go on the
open trauma room.

261
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,055
It's fine. These injuries
look pretty superficial.

262
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,791
You know, we would be
on the Wolf Run right now

263
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,605
if it was just you and me on the
trip, like it was supposed to be.

264
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,897
Dani, honey, this
is not Micah's fault.

265
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,605
It's not his fault he can't sit in
a chair? Because I think it is.

266
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,423
The kids don't get along.

267
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,057
Oh, you're kidding.

268
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,445
Karen and I got
engaged over the summer

269
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,447
after three years of dating.

270
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,427
I would have proposed
after the third date,

271
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,235
but the kids...

272
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,856
I thought, "Let's take a trip.

273
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:36,461
"Let's do something together
as a family, see if it might help."

274
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,463
I think I made it worse.

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
Do you think I made it worse?

276
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:48,222
Sometimes, adversity
can make a family stronger.

277
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,812
Or tear it apart.

278
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,486
I'm just saying, swap me out. I
want to be close to the good stuff.

279
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,688
Not that you're not the good
stuff, but she's got a streak going.

280
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,969
Stop saying that, and
definitely don't say it to Meredith,

281
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,460
unless you want it
to end. You'll jinx her.

282
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,548
Ow. That hurts?

283
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,261
I'm concerned about this
abdominal tenderness.

284
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,046
Schedule a CT and rush his labs.

285
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,004
So what, so you're not
gonna swap me out?

286
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,856
Never mind.

287
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,360
Could you go back one?

288
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,764
One more?

289
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,404
This one.

290
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,306
How soon can we do it?

291
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:39,751
Well... You know what?

292
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,526
We're not gonna schedule
the surgery quite yet.

293
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,189
But I want to do
it before summer.

294
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,664
Six weeks. Then
we'll all meet again.

295
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,917
We'll talk through our
options. Thanks for coming in.

296
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:55,673
Yeah, I don't get it.

297
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,119
Are we no longer
granting wishes today, or...

298
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,693
Did you see how she
looked to the boyfriend?

299
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,613
He's not here for support.
He's here for approval.

300
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,382
Six weeks.

301
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,028
That's how long it's
gonna take her to realize

302
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,252
that it's not her wish
that we'd be granting.

303
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,999
So, you're saying she
was being too hasty.

304
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,084
I'm saying I'm not giving
that girl a set of new breasts

305
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,819
that were never her
idea in the first place.

306
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,910
That's just a
bra full of regret.

307
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:18,495
All right, time to power up.

308
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,231
The Posse's got a big afternoon.

309
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,837
Ruby, open your mom's
mouth and take two fingers

310
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,739
and sweep the back
of your mom's throat,

311
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,675
like a scooping motion.

312
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,538
She might have something
blocking her airway.

313
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,794
Let's see if you can get it.

314
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,312
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

315
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,032
<i>There's nothing. What now?</i>

316
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,947
Try a Heimlich. Give a
hard push on your mom's...

317
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,138
<i>Belly? I've seen it on
TV. How hard do I...</i>

318
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,073
As hard as you can.

319
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,965
<i>Nothing happened. Nothing...</i>

320
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,066
<i>Nothing came out. Her
breathing's getting worse.</i>

321
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,435
Okay...

322
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,571
Okay, we're gonna try
opening her airway another way.

323
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,724
I need you to put your
hand under your mom's chin

324
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,660
and very gently lift it up.

325
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,362
No, wait, stop.
You'll paralyze her.

326
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,634
<i>Hello? What should I do?</i>

327
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,337
<i>Hello?</i>

328
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,738
So, the good news is,

329
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,975
your EKG and chest
films came back clear.

330
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,928
So, my ticker's good.
How about my kicker?

331
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:29,734
Well, you have what is called a
below-the-stem femur fracture.

332
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,068
Oopsy.

333
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,650
Now, you have two cracks in
the bone, one here and here.

334
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:40,010
So, how do we get me back
in the saddle? So to speak.

335
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,330
Well, I would like to
completely replace the hardware.

336
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,150
Now, it's a very big surgery,
and it does carry risks,

337
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,520
but you would come
out of it with full flexibility,

338
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,904
which I think is what...

339
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,307
So, I'd be good
to go on my back?

340
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:54,456
You should be.

341
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,526
Or on my side.

342
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,710
Or that thing, you know,

343
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,629
where you bend over
the couch and then he...

344
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,915
Like I said, full flexibility.

345
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,161
Yeah, okay, but considering
your cardiac history,

346
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,620
I'm not sure a big
surgery is a great idea.

347
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,589
Tell me, dear, have
you ever been married?

348
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,925
Are you seeing
anyone or getting laid?

349
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,234
Well, that's not... I mean...

350
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,631
You see, I was married to
my husband for 44 years.

351
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,049
That's 44 years
with the same man.

352
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,102
We had three children,
seven grandchildren,

353
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,338
and a lifetime of memories.

354
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,126
He was the first
man that I ever loved.

355
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,913
And he's the only
man that I ever will love.

356
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:34,648
But I'll be hot-damned

357
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:38,602
if he's going to be the only
man to ever razz my berries.

358
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,055
I mean, I have time left,

359
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,941
and there's still things
that I want to do, you know?

360
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,977
There's things
that I haven't done,

361
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,528
and there's a
whole lot of things

362
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,964
that, I mean, I didn't
even know you could do.

363
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,113
You know, like that thing
where you go... You know?

364
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,451
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Right, right, we got it.

365
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Yeah.

366
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:57,705
I mean, what's
the point of living

367
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,873
if you can't try something new?

368
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,926
Hmm?

369
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,429
I want that surgery.

370
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,976
Sounds good.

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,534
That is a five-hour
surgery on a 75-year-old

372
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,019
who has a stent and
is on blood thinners.

373
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,265
I can't believe
you would suggest

374
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,533
a surgery like that to a patient

375
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,018
without running it by me first.

376
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,853
I'm sorry. You called
me for my opinion.

377
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,322
Look, I do hip
replacements all the time

378
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,429
on far older patients
with far weaker hearts.

379
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,948
She is clearly still active. I think
her heart's in pretty good shape.

380
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,351
That's not your call.

381
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,287
Okay, we are talking about a
healthy, vibrant woman here.

382
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,733
She deserves the best quality
of life that we can give her.

383
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,008
If she wants a new
hip, that's her call.

384
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,328
So she can get
laid? Really? Really?

385
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,807
You think that's
important enough

386
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,176
to risk her dying on the table?

387
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,850
If her hip is so damaged
that she winds up immobilized

388
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,897
and bed-ridden for the rest of
her life, then, yeah, I sure do,

389
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,253
because either way, she's dying.

390
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,925
Fine.

391
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:55,362
I will reevaluate the images
and take a closer look.

392
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,982
Maybe there's
another option. Okay?

393
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,151
Thank you.

394
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,948
<i>Kepner told me
about the little girl.</i>

395
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,950
What can I do?
Tell me, can I help?

396
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,284
We are trying to get an airway.

397
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,475
By risking paralysis.

398
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,372
I'd rather have her
paralyzed and alive

399
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,173
than dead with
respiratory arrest.

400
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,598
Do you have a better idea?

401
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,043
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

402
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,769
Ruby. Go ahead.

403
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,654
Lift her chin and
pull it forward, gently.

404
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,607
<i>Okay.</i>

405
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:27,144
Okay, now put the phone
on your mom's chest, okay?

406
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,247
And let me listen.

407
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,049
The stridor's gone. She
opened the airway, but...

408
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,184
She still could be in distress.

409
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,334
It's something else.

410
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,156
Ruby, put your head
on your mom's chest

411
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,824
on the left side and listen.

412
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,841
<i>I don't hear anything.
What am I listening for?</i>

413
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,581
Breathing. Do you
hear her breathing?

414
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,517
<i>No.</i>

415
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,570
Owen. Owen.

416
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,605
Okay, okay, okay, Ruby,

417
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,225
now put your ear on
the right side and listen.

418
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,112
Anything?

419
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,043
Ruby?

420
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,834
<i>She's breathing! I hear it!</i>

421
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:08,769
Okay, could be a tension pneumo.

422
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,939
Ruby, now just push the
phone into your mom's chest,

423
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,486
right where you
were just listening.

424
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,161
Just push the
phone in and move it.

425
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,544
That's sub-Q air.
Do you hear that?

426
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,612
Mmm-hmm. She's gonna need...

427
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,070
She's gonna need to
release the trapped air

428
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,567
with a chest tube
or something. Okay.

429
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,059
It's the only way, or her
mom's gonna suffocate.

430
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,261
You mean... You're
gonna ask her to...

431
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,797
Okay. Ruby,

432
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,033
I'm gonna ask you to try
something. It's gonna be fine,

433
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,703
and I'm gonna walk you
through it, step by step, okay?

434
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,073
<i>Okay, but can you tell me
fast? The phone keeps beeping.</i>

435
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,941
<i>I think it's running
out of battery.</i>

436
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:02,697
What are you doing here?

437
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,907
I am hiding out.

438
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,387
We're waiting on the dad's labs,

439
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,356
but I couldn't sit there
and listen to those two

440
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,874
bite each other's
heads off anymore.

441
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,364
Me, neither.

442
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,901
Brian's labs came back
clear. How's Micah?

443
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,748
Looks like a grade four
splenic lac, possible rupture.

444
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,283
We need to prep him for ex-lap.

445
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,174
What? He's crashing.

446
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,004
Crap. Oh, crap!

447
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,012
His pressure's bottoming out.

448
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,330
Hurry up!

449
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,758
He's in v-fib. We
got to bag him.

450
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:31,001
One, two, three.

451
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,071
Easy.

452
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,941
Where is that crash
cart? I need those paddles.

453
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,246
Almost here.

454
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,300
There's no time.

455
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,772
Got a rhythm.

456
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,835
Edwards, you and Wilson
go and prep that OR, please.

457
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,685
Magical. Told you.

458
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,420
What?

459
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,155
Nothing.

460
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,457
Get going. Move.

461
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,438
Ruby, do you guys have
straws in the kitchen?

462
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,772
<i>No.</i> A pen, maybe?

463
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,862
A ballpoint pen?

464
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,180
Anything?

465
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,792
Not yet. Lines are down
because of the earthquake.

466
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,461
They're trying to triangulate
from the cell towers.

467
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,668
How's the mom?

468
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,582
Okay. <i>Wait! Wait.</i>

469
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,784
<i>We got milkshakes on
the way here. Got a straw!</i>

470
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,168
Great. Now, we're
gonna need you to get a...

471
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,311
What? What?

472
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,690
I don't want to
ask her to do this.

473
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,935
Ruby, we're gonna...

474
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,556
We're gonna need you to get a
knife. Not a big one, but a sharp...

475
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,276
You were making s'mores?
Are the skewers there?

476
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,412
<i>Yes. Got one. Oh, God.</i>

477
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,225
<i>You want me to stick
this into her, don't you?</i>

478
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,949
Ruby, you can do this. You can.

479
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,645
It's gonna help your mom, okay?

480
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,429
We just need you to find the...

481
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,632
Second intercostal. I don't
know how to explain that to her.

482
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,688
Wait, wait, wait.

483
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,493
Um, Ruby.

484
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:07,197
Okay, touch your
mom's left collarbone,

485
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,084
the one that looks like a
wing, coming out from her neck.

486
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,485
Now walk your
fingers down from it.

487
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,106
Two steps. You got it?

488
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,458
<i>Okay. One. Two.</i>

489
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,772
Stop. Stop.

490
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,740
Now slide your finger
right underneath that rib.

491
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:25,066
And with your other hand,
right above that finger,

492
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,534
push the skewer
in about an inch.

493
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,124
<i>I can't do that.</i>

494
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,282
Ruby, yes, you can.

495
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,050
What if we're
wrong? I'm not wrong.

496
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,407
Okay. Ruby, you can do this.

497
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,320
She could puncture
her heart. She won't.

498
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,593
Ruby, right now.

499
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,245
<i>Oh, God.</i>

500
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,597
Ruby, push. Hard.

501
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,182
Push hard. Push hard. Right now.

502
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,920
<i>Oh, my God! There's blood!</i>

503
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,166
<i>She's bleeding!</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

504
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,923
Now take the straw
and put it over the skewer

505
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:53,072
into the hole that you
just made and push hard.

506
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,873
<i>She's breathing
a lot!</i> You did it.

507
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,996
Thank God.

508
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,850
<i>Wait, wait. She stopped.</i>

509
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,468
<i>Her lips are going blue again.</i>

510
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,154
Ruby, put your fingers on
the right side of her neck,

511
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,889
right by her throat.

512
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,124
Do you feel a pulse?

513
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,275
<i>No.</i>

514
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,593
Okay.

515
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,640
Ruby, I need you to
get on top of your mom

516
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,082
and put your hands on her
chest and push hard right now.

517
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,191
Okay, I'm gonna teach
you how to do CPR.

518
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:20,788
All right, let's take a look.

519
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,492
Yikes. That hip took
a hell of a pounding.

520
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,074
Oh, Ethan, you have no idea.

521
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,848
Could you, please, zoom in
on the right femoral prosthesis?

522
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,917
Sure thing.

523
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:36,587
Twice in one day, Dr. Pierce.

524
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,256
Yeah. Careful, or
you'll get sick of me.

525
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,242
Unlikely.

526
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,445
Yeah, see that? There.

527
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,364
Her femur lateral to
the stem is cracked.

528
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,593
Her hip isn't gonna
resolve on its own.

529
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,295
She needs surgery.

530
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,080
Although, I guess the
femur fracture isn't displaced.

531
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,806
Maybe I could put in a
plate to bridge the fracture,

532
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,086
go in from the side. It
would be a little less invasive.

533
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,276
And less time in the OR?

534
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,494
A lot less, actually.

535
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,407
Good, so she could stay
on her blood thinners,

536
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,397
substantially lowering
the risk to her heart.

537
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,444
And she can get back
to getting her freak on.

538
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,228
I'll let her know.

539
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,591
I've been taking the
stairs, by the way.

540
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,979
Since this morning,
you know, just in case.

541
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,412
Oh, I wasn't serious
before. I was just...

542
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,797
Yeah, I know.

543
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,026
I'm not actually
taking the stairs.

544
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,468
Oh!

545
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,070
Okay.

546
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,300
I would like to take you
out, though, sometime.

547
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,591
Maybe for coffee,
or a drink, or...

548
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,261
The point is, I'm flexible.

549
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,621
This is coming out all wrong.

550
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,060
I'm gonna start
over. No, no, it's...

551
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,619
I'm gonna stop you, actually.

552
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:44,187
I'm sorry, Ethan.
You seem really...

553
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,624
Tall... Nice.

554
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,176
But, I'm just...
I'm not... I don't...

555
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:52,179
Sure. That's okay. I understand.

556
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,115
Okay.

557
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,189
This is basically my office,

558
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:06,727
so, if you're waiting for me to make
this less awkward by leaving, I...

559
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,662
Oh, right. Of course. Okay.

560
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:12,666
I'm gonna get out of here.
Take this with me. Bye.

561
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,655
Is Karen around?

562
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,764
She went to get
snacks. How's Micah?

563
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,827
Actually, we need
to talk to Karen.

564
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:27,297
Sorry. Legally, we can
only talk to the legal parent.

565
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,532
Are you serious?

566
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,716
Who cares?

567
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:32,830
Dani! What?

568
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,894
They didn't have turkey,
so I got a ham and Swiss.

569
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,941
Ugh, nast.

570
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,275
Lovely.

571
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,810
Really?

572
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,144
They have news on Micah.

573
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,746
Micah's stable,

574
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,743
but I'm afraid his injury
is worse than we thought.

575
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:47,100
His spleen is ruptured,
and he's lost a lot of blood.

576
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,531
He had a cardiac episode in
CT, and his heart stopped beating.

577
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,721
Oh, God.

578
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,834
But we're taking
him to surgery now.

579
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,290
We do have to remove his spleen.

580
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,843
My God.

581
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,361
What were we doing up there?

582
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,531
Why did I let you talk
us into that stupid ski trip?

583
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,733
Karen, come on.
It was an accident.

584
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,946
But he didn't want to go.
There was an earthquake.

585
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,581
Karen, come on. For
god's sake, this is...

586
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:07,720
I didn't plan on any...

587
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,723
Okay, so we will
give you an update

588
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,658
as soon as Micah
is out of surgery.

589
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,861
He's 14. He's 14!

590
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,175
This couple might be the
biggest casualty of the earthquake.

591
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,276
Oh, my God!

592
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,817
Ruby, you're doing great.

593
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,269
<i>My battery's at five
percent. I'm getting tired.</i>

594
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:24,082
You can do this.
Just keep pushing.

595
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:29,093
Push, push, push, over and
over, like the beat of a song.

596
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,394
Ruby, do you know
the song <i>Stayin' Alive?</i>

597
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,047
<i>Is it new?</i>

598
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,827
We'll sing it for you, okay?

599
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:38,730
And you just... You push
to the beat, just like this...

600
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,531
Okay, Ruby, you sing
now. You sing with us.

601
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,765
They found the region.

602
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,977
Ruby, did you hear that?

603
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,646
Help is on their way.
They're gonna find you.

604
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,880
Some of the roads are blocked.

605
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:57,048
They're sending a helicopter in,

606
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,773
but they don't know
how long it will take.

607
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:02,876
Okay, Ruby, you just keep
going until they find you, okay?

608
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:05,612
You keep singing,
and you keep pushing.

609
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:09,265
And when they find you, use
their phone and you call me back.

610
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,334
<i>Okay.</i>

611
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,835
Okay.

612
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,771
Ruby?

613
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,259
She's gone.

614
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,049
They'll find her. She'll
call. They'll find her.

615
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,753
Yeah, she could be
on her way in right now.

616
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,155
Unless she's alone in a
cabin with her dead mother.

617
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,611
She'll call.

618
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,714
Anything?

619
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,421
She'll call.

620
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,385
Did you hear the
mom going at that guy?

621
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,809
That couple is
doomed, all that fighting.

622
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,588
I do not miss that.

623
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:14,498
Look at us, we're both in
adult, stable relationships.

624
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,828
For once, we're on the
healthy side of things.

625
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:17,984
Sure.

626
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,164
I had to cancel
D.C., but it's okay.

627
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,689
Sometimes he cancels,
and I say it's okay.

628
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,936
We're happy. We're in a groove.

629
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,276
Kind of sounds like a rut.

630
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,827
We are not in a rut.

631
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,062
Whatever.

632
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:30,308
I resent you saying it.

633
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:31,548
Okay.

634
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,584
And you're hardly an expert
at long-term relationships.

635
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,603
Really? And
that's not even true.

636
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,938
What? Izzie?

637
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,873
That was a cancer marriage
that lasted five minutes.

638
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:43,510
And then there was Ava,
who peed on my couch.

639
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,756
All right, would
you quit it? No,

640
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,642
there's one more I'm forgetting.

641
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,166
Hello? I'm right here.

642
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,368
Oh, I know. The
nurse who had syph.

643
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,486
As in syphilis?

644
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,455
It was a long time
ago, Wilson. Relax.

645
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,557
Bovie.

646
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:58,825
It's not a rut.

647
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,506
I have an entire world to
manage, all on my own.

648
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,860
My world does not and should
not revolve around Derek Shepherd.

649
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,627
I wanted to go to
D.C. this weekend,

650
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,080
but I'm a busy surgeon
with two kids at home,

651
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,837
and he's at the NIH.

652
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,718
So right now, we're just
going to have to accept

653
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,553
that this is the
way our lives work.

654
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,289
But that doesn't
mean we're not happy.

655
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,579
All right, fine. You
have a happy marriage.

656
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:20,847
With no husband in it.

657
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,071
All right, plate's in position.

658
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,451
I'll be placing the screws next.

659
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,975
Her pressure's good.
Rhythm's stable.

660
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,645
So, you and Ethan.
Is that a thing?

661
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,184
No. I'm not... No,
he's not my type.

662
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,785
Sure. Right.

663
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,397
You're not so into
cute, smart, or funny?

664
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,857
No, he is. I mean, he's great.

665
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,160
He's a radiologist.

666
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you
just go all upstairs-downstairs?

667
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:53,997
No. No!

668
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,660
No, I didn't mean it like that.

669
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,245
No, I just... I
don't date at work.

670
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,653
Or you don't date down
at work. No, no, it's cool.

671
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:02,856
Don't worry. I'm sure you
have many other fine qualities.

672
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,858
It's okay if you're
kind of a snob.

673
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:08,762
I am not a... God, you
make me sound awful.

674
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,910
"Dating down?"
What is that even?

675
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,312
I just don't date
people who are...

676
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,685
Beneath you?

677
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,782
No, that is not what
I was going to say.

678
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:18,906
Underlings?

679
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,535
No, stop it. I
wasn't gonna say...

680
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,753
Just a lowly maker
of X-rays, madam.

681
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:23,404
I didn't mean to...
Will you stop it?

682
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:28,364
And we'll use the rasp
to smooth out the bridge.

683
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,945
You know, Mrs.
Thurman could come out

684
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,636
looking like a completely
different person.

685
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:36,385
So that she can be happy
with what she sees in the mirror.

686
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,661
But what if it's not her nose
that makes her unhappy?

687
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,375
I mean, maybe it's
some other part of her life,

688
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:45,999
like that patient with
her boyfriend's boobs.

689
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:49,385
How can you be sure that
she's making the right choice?

690
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,899
You do realize I
can't talk to you

691
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,963
about your sister's case, right?

692
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,725
I'm not asking about
my sister's case.

693
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,894
I'm asking about
this lady right here.

694
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,197
All right, well, I know she's
making the right choice

695
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,134
because I talked to her
at length, and I listened.

696
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,839
And I've gotten very
good at knowing.

697
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:39,264
44-year-old
female, vitals stable,

698
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,488
tension pneumo relieved
by a needle thoracostomy.

699
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,185
Is she okay? Is she...
Trauma from the fall.

700
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,636
Her pupils are fully
responsive. GCS of eight.

701
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,411
Yeah, I got this.

702
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,054
Ruby?

703
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,108
Hey.

704
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,894
My phone died,

705
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,375
but I kept singing till they
came, just like you said.

706
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,032
I know. I know.

707
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,435
You did great. You were perfect.

708
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,005
You're okay.

709
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,643
How is she?

710
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,613
Subdural hematoma with a shift.

711
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:24,981
What can I tell Ruby?

712
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,183
Nothing. Not yet.

713
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,204
Heart rate's dropping. Damn it.

714
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:31,638
Drill, now.

715
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:33,039
I need to evacuate this clot.

716
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,586
What can I do? Let me help.

717
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,742
Let me work.

718
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:43,967
Mrs. Thurman's awake.

719
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,218
Good.

720
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:46,848
She looks like she's
been in a bar fight,

721
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,766
and she says she can't wait
to see what she looks like

722
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,106
when the swelling goes down.

723
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,777
What else?

724
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,147
Nothing.

725
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,250
It's a big change.

726
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,846
She's had that nose
for plenty of years.

727
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,771
I just... I hope she
doesn't regret it.

728
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,758
It was not a new thing,
this change that she wanted.

729
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,308
It wasn't a whim.

730
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:13,212
It was how she had
always seen herself.

731
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:15,782
Her best version of her.

732
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,029
The one that was the most true.

733
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,364
Now, with a
patient like this one,

734
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,955
a patient who's dreamt
about these changes

735
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,304
since they were six years old,

736
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,943
those patients do
not change their mind.

737
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,179
For them, change isn't elective.

738
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,614
It's not a choice.
It's a chance.

739
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,883
It is her chance.

740
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,821
And you can't know
that without talking.

741
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,009
And listening.

742
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,569
It's not because
he's a radiologist.

743
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,206
Okay, and it's not just because
I don't date people from work.

744
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,941
I just... I kind of don't date.

745
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,838
Hey, listen. I was just
giving you a hard time.

746
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:02,006
No, no, no. I didn't...

747
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,731
There's a gap between
me and most people.

748
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,233
There just always has been.

749
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:09,903
I used to think it was because
I was younger in school,

750
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:12,238
but even after school...

751
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,911
The gap, it just got bigger
and more impossible.

752
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,581
I wasn't too young.
I was just too...

753
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,651
Different.

754
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,970
So, I know what it looks
like when I say yes to Ethan.

755
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,674
It's fun, and we're happy
for a while until it's not.

756
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:36,179
Things always get
awkward and weird.

757
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,315
So, I overcorrect,
or he misinterprets.

758
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,028
And then we're not on
the same page anymore

759
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,652
because we never
were on the same page.

760
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:47,073
We were always miles and miles
apart with this gap between us,

761
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,409
pretending it wasn't there.

762
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,347
I don't want to pretend.

763
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:58,351
I came here to work and
just stay focused on that,

764
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,687
and I'm fine on
my side of the gap.

765
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:05,858
I'm a little lonely, but fine.

766
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,094
There's just no point
to me saying yes.

767
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,913
Yeah.

768
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,682
Okay, that's a load of crap.

769
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,753
When you were younger,
fine. Kids are weird. But now?

770
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,456
You're a grown-up

771
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,902
doing your grown-up
job with other grown-ups.

772
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,323
There's no gap. And
there's nothing to lose.

773
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,241
There's just you being scared.

774
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,999
And for no reason.

775
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,218
So choose not to be.

776
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:34,132
Life's too short to be
scared. Screw the gap.

777
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,724
Let Ethan, I don't
know, razz your berries.

778
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,392
Ew!

779
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,043
Okay, goose your gander. Okay.

780
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,378
Tickle your tail feathers.

781
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,924
Cup your coconuts. Nope.

782
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,315
Rock your rump.

783
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,994
Poke your hontas.

784
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,718
Wallop your wonderland!

785
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,375
There's still bleeding from
the short gastric arteries.

786
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,462
I see it.

787
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,773
Close to the pancreas. I see it!

788
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,274
Well, I can't get
to it from here.

789
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,343
How many units did
he use? Four units.

790
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,502
If everyone would just shut up
and give me two freaking seconds,

791
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:06,998
I can get this suture to hold.

792
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,262
There. Edwards?

793
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,739
No leaks. Looks good.

794
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,074
The streak's alive.

795
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,169
What was that, Wilson?

796
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,859
No.

797
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:16,262
Wait, nothing. I
didn't say anything.

798
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,876
You said, "The streak is alive."

799
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,901
No! No, I said, "Freak." I
said, "The freak is alive."

800
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,548
No, you didn't. No, she didn't.

801
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:25,104
I didn't hear anything. I...

802
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,425
You're pitching a no-hitter.

803
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,330
You haven't lost a single
patient since November 14th.

804
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,816
Eighty-nine surgeries in
a row with good outcomes.

805
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,484
Did you say November 14th?

806
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:42,622
Yeah, and 22 were traumas.
I mean, who does that?

807
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,958
You, because you're magic.

808
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,978
Edwards, you can
close. Wilson can assist.

809
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:51,798
What did I tell you?

810
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,056
Look, I told her
not to tell you.

811
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,685
This kind of thing
messes with your head.

812
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,259
I'm on a streak.

813
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,778
There's no such thing.
It's just dumb luck.

814
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,292
Look, you're not that great,
anyway, so just forget about it.

815
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:12,953
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's the date that it started.

816
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,053
What about it?

817
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:16,790
That's the day that Derek left.

818
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,025
And I've been perfect ever
since, have not lost one patient,

819
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,862
not one, since the day he left.

820
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,232
What does that tell
you? That you're right?

821
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:28,501
That I'm better off without him?

822
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,594
Brian, your repeat
labs look really good.

823
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,596
I should be able to
discharge you very soon.

824
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,081
How's Micah?

825
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,434
Not my kid. I know.

826
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,515
Karen won't even
speak to me right now,

827
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,540
and, you know, I had
all the best intentions.

828
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,142
I was trying to bring
the family together.

829
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,878
I thought I was helping us.

830
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,749
It all backfired.

831
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,618
Maybe, now, we're too far gone.

832
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,237
Maybe I can't get Karen back.

833
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,489
Maybe Danielle is right.

834
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,358
Maybe Karen and Micah
are better off without me.

835
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,445
All I wanted was for us
to be happy, be a family.

836
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:21,871
Can you just nod or blink twice
or something if Micah's okay?

837
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:27,327
Thank you, Dr. Grey. Thank you.

838
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,661
You know, you should try and
close your eyes, get some sleep.

839
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,452
It could still be a while.

840
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,755
Do you think I hurt her?

841
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,741
No. No. Ruby, you
did everything right.

842
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,894
You don't know that.

843
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,567
How is she?

844
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:54,587
She's fine. Ruby, your
mom is gonna be fine.

845
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:55,688
Really?

846
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,174
Absolutely.

847
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:08,251
So, I called my
sister and checked in.

848
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,090
A bookcase fell. But
other than that, she's fine.

849
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,426
Good. Okay.

850
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,765
I owe you an apology
for what I said earlier.

851
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,934
Yes, you do.

852
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,971
And I will consider accepting
your apology, Ben Warren,

853
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,508
if you make it up
to me. At home.

854
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:35,345
You can start by
making me dinner.

855
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:39,715
And then some other things
that I haven't even thought of yet.

856
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,753
Well, you know
I'm still on call.

857
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,256
I can wait.

858
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,062
Six weeks, right?

859
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,182
Eight, just to be
sure. Ease back in.

860
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,691
Herbert isn't gonna
know what hit him.

861
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,222
Or Edward. Or Irving.

862
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,610
Or maybe that guy
upstairs with the bad toupee.

863
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,706
They're lucky guys. Mmm-hmm.

864
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,096
I'm telling you, girls.

865
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,782
You have healthy hips.
Put them to good use.

866
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,423
Hold that! Wait, please!

867
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,226
Hi. I will have
that drink with you.

868
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,772
If you want to, if
you still want to.

869
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,023
Great. Let's do it.

870
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,097
Wait. Now?

871
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,744
Do you mean now? No.

872
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:48,984
Yes? I don't know.

873
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:50,854
End of the week?

874
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,472
Yes.

875
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:09,221
Thank you. For today.

876
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,456
You're welcome.

877
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,159
Mmm.

878
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,294
So my streak lives on?

879
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,463
Sure. If you
believe in that stuff.

880
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,901
You're right. I
don't need Derek.

881
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,446
I don't need him in my house.

882
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,736
I obviously don't need him

883
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,541
to prove I can have 89
good outcomes in a row.

884
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:02,908
I'm doing great.

885
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:06,845
My kids are happy.
My career is soaring.

886
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,660
Derek going to D.C. did exactly
what it was supposed to do,

887
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,829
which is remind me of who
I am outside of my marriage,

888
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:16,021
which, by the way,
I'm kind of amazing.

889
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:18,257
Okay.

890
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:21,471
But that doesn't mean that I
don't want to share it with him.

891
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,796
I want to tell him that I'm...

892
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:27,183
We're on a streak.

893
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,303
I can handle Micah's
post-op if you want to take off.

894
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,792
<i>That list of things
you'd grab in a disaster.</i>

895
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,075
<i>Hello?</i>

896
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,865
Hi. Is he in the lab?

897
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,383
<i>What?</i>

898
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,664
I know this is Derek
Shepherd's phone.

899
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:49,422
Who is this?

900
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,959
<i>Your kids, your keys,
your family photo album.</i>

901
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,827
Who is this?

902
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:57,296
<i>That list goes out the window.</i>

903
00:41:57,365 --> 00:41:59,531
Who is this?

904
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,336
Hello?

905
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:06,138
<i>When the disaster
starts with you wondering</i>

906
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,486
<i>if this must be the woman who's
been screwing your husband.</i>

907
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,048
<i>That's a whole other earthquake.</i>
