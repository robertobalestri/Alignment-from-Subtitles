1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:06,938
Also, with the laparoscopic
common bile duct exploration,

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:11,743
post-op bile leaks and strictures
are significantly minimized.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:16,064
It was called, at the time,
an audacious technique.

4
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:18,372
<i>And it was.</i>

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,235
<i>Some context for you.</i>

6
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:24,506
<i>I was the only woman in my
surgical residency program.</i>

7
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:29,111
<i>They called me
"girl" and "Mrs. Grey."</i>

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:34,616
<i>Along with the one black male
resident, I was clearly excluded.</i>

9
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:37,318
<i>They didn't want me to
be a part of their boys' club.</i>

10
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,588
<i>So I did the only
audacious thing you can do</i>

11
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,022
<i>with an audacious technique.</i>

12
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,526
<i>I got myself published in</i> The
Journal of American Medicine.

13
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,228
<i>That caused an uproar.</i>

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:52,034
<i>A resident was not first
author of a published paper.</i>

15
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,769
<i>But the truly audacious
part came when they saw</i>

16
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,507
<i>what I named my technique.
"The Grey Method."</i>

17
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,861
<i>I put my own name on it.</i>

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,848
<i>You should have heard
the boys roar about that.</i>

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,569
<i>The first time I won
the Harper Avery,</i>

20
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,891
<i>I dedicated it to the men
who had been so supportive.</i>

21
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:21,830
<i>This is how my mother
wanted to be remembered.</i>

22
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,853
<i>My memory of her
is a little bit different.</i>

23
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,155
Where is the chief?
You're all amateurs!

24
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:31,856
Complaining of intermittent...

25
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,853
What the hell are you doing
here? Haven't I told you?

26
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:37,117
How many times have I told you
not to bother me when I'm at work?

27
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,883
<i>I'm sure everyone remembers
their own version of her.</i>

28
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,520
<i>Versions I wouldn't
even recognize.</i>

29
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,492
<i>It's all that's really left of
someone when they're gone.</i>

30
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,045
No.

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,014
<i>But that's the tricky thing.</i>

32
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,684
Meredith.

33
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,670
<i>Nobody's memory
is perfect or complete.</i>

34
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:02,954
Mommy.

35
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,722
Meredith, get up.

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,941
<i>We jumble things up.</i>

37
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,562
<i>We lose track of time.</i>

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,699
<i>We are in one
place, then another.</i>

39
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,036
<i>And it all feels like one
long, inescapable moment.</i>

40
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:22,591
<i>It's just like my
mother used to say.</i>

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,978
<i>"The carousel
never stops turning."</i>

42
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,612
<i>I spent the day with Alex.</i>

43
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,632
I needed a day,
Derek, so I took it.

44
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,584
That's fine. I just
need to know why.

45
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,696
No, you don't.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,165
You want to hear
that I cured cancer

47
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,567
or that I found a vaccine
for ALS before breakfast.

48
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,102
That'd be great.
Anything would be great.

49
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,487
There it is again. What?

50
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,221
You're waiting for me to pay up

51
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,079
for this grand sacrifice
that you made for our family.

52
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,343
How am I supposed to do
anything with you pressuring me

53
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,912
and hovering over me for
a decision that you made?

54
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,363
And you're waiting
for me to fail.

55
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm waiting for you to shine.

56
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,223
Remember? That's
why you're staying here.

57
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,354
And I told you, you should
go to DC and shine there.

58
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,174
It was you who decided to
stay here and martyr yourself

59
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,610
and now make me feel guilty
because of a decision you made.

60
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:04,677
Well, I am done.

61
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,033
I'm done feeling guilty,

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,814
and I am done measuring my
accomplishments against yours.

63
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,372
I won't do it anymore.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,856
Just stay out of my way.

65
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,957
Wow.

66
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,586
You sound just like your mother.

67
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:19,264
What happened to you?
Listen to me, Meredith.

68
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,734
Anyone can fall in love
and be blindly happy,

69
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,765
but not everyone can pick
up a scalpel and save a life.

70
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,757
I raised you to be an
extraordinary human being.

71
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,488
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

72
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,912
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

73
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,304
What happened to you?

74
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,720
This is crazy.

75
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,856
It has to stop.

76
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,503
I didn't hear you complaining
a few minutes ago.

77
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,172
I heard something. I
wouldn't call it complaining.

78
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,863
We're gonna get caught.

79
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,133
We've had so many
close calls already.

80
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,837
Is what we're doing so wrong?

81
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,406
Don't be naive.

82
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,943
Seattle's a small city with
a small-town mentality.

83
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,961
So let's leave Seattle.

84
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,297
Richard, you
deserve to be happy.

85
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,363
What? Nothing.

86
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,933
Just surprised to see you here.

87
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,668
I'm working here.

88
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,777
Oh.

89
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,474
What? Nothing.
That's great. Just, um...

90
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,787
Well, I thought Bailey
won the board seat.

91
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,010
She did.

92
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,999
They hired me back as
a peds surgery attending.

93
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,081
Oh. That's great.

94
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,567
That's really good.
That's awesome for you.

95
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,297
Congratulations, man.
Okay, you know what?

96
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,153
Shut it. I am a great surgeon.

97
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,184
It's not like they're doing me
a favor. I'm doing them a favor.

98
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,008
Besides, Robbins told me
that board vote was very close.

99
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,028
Okay. Of course.

100
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,631
What? Nothing. Just...

101
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,837
I will assign you to
impacted bowels for a month.

102
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,772
They'll call you Pooper Scooper.

103
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,209
Robbins told Bailey
it was unanimous.

104
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,580
Robbins.

105
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,826
Ah! There you are.
Hey, welcome back.

106
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,049
Can I talk to you?

107
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,329
Yeah. Marty Secord in 2313.

108
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,231
His liver enzymes
are looking good,

109
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,915
but I'm worried he might
have to go back in for an ERCP,

110
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,617
so you make sure
you keep an eye on it.

111
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,186
I hear you, Dr. Herman.
Give me two minutes.

112
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,454
God, you have no
idea how lucky you were

113
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:28,921
to have me as a teacher
during your fellowship.

114
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,073
We have to talk. One minute.

115
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,114
My God, I am coming.

116
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:36,384
Oh, no. No. Bummer.

117
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,382
Wait. Maggie Pierce is quitting?

118
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,772
I know. I'm into it.

119
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,485
Avery, tell me I'm not
losing another cardio chief.

120
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,770
I am into it, all right? My
mother's already called me twice.

121
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,745
It's a PR nightmare.

122
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,225
She's damn right it is. First
Russell, then Yang, now Pierce?

123
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,266
Yang and I busted our
asses interviewing people,

124
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,279
and now I have to start
this whole process over?

125
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,615
Evidently, because it looks
like we hire from week to week.

126
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,218
We're a revolving door.
Hey, you heard about Pierce?

127
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,942
Yeah, I just read the e-mail.
Well, what should we do?

128
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,477
I don't see anything we can do.

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,460
I mean, we should
talk to her. Not me.

130
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,151
Okay, I didn't mean
you! I meant all of us!

131
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,320
We should get the
whole board together,

132
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,855
do a full-court press.

133
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,217
Uh, yeah, yeah.
You spearhead that.

134
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,775
Well, I will.

135
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,428
Lucky for you, the board just
got a transfusion of new blood.

136
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:23,614
Maybe I could keep this place
from looking like a clown car.

137
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,116
Maggie Pierce cannot quit.

138
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,203
You cannot quit.

139
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,239
Uh-huh. Word's out.
How you feeling, Roy?

140
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,807
I like this mattress.

141
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,036
I got to get me one of these.

142
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,329
Mine is all foofy.

143
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,709
We will see what we can do.

144
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,093
What is this about
you resigning?

145
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,413
Graft's deployed.
Let's inject the dye.

146
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,753
Will you at least tell
me why you're leaving?

147
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:49,741
That is between me and
my employer, Dr. Shepherd.

148
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,850
I'm seeing diminished
perfusion to the spine.

149
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,965
Roy, wiggle your toes
for me, would you, please?

150
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,434
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

151
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,871
Like that?

152
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,350
Wiggle a little harder.

153
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,974
Let me check his
Babinski reflex.

154
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,807
When the toes fan out
reflexively, what's that indicate?

155
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,975
Just what you're afraid
of. High spinal injury.

156
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,078
Is he paralyzed? Try it again.

157
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,952
Something's wrong?

158
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,504
I can't feel my legs.
What's happening?

159
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,706
Roy, it's possible that
the blood to your spine

160
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,135
has been cut off by the graft,

161
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,726
but I'm gonna do everything
I can to fix it, okay?

162
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,397
Okay. Please do. Please.

163
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,243
I'm gonna give you
something to let you sleep.

164
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,962
Start with trying to
induce hypertension.

165
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,420
See if we can enhance
spinal perfusion.

166
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,052
Did you get Maggie
Pierce's e-mail?

167
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,542
I did, yes.

168
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,011
Are you going to
talk to her again?

169
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,482
She won't listen.
She doesn't trust me.

170
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,836
She's angry I didn't
tell her sooner. So am I.

171
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,699
I just still can't even remember
my mother being pregnant.

172
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,590
I just... I need that journal
from the spring of '83.

173
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,899
Do you have that one?

174
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,494
Yeah, I have them here.

175
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,897
I mean, we both looked
at them a hundred times.

176
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,833
It's mostly surgical stuff.

177
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,445
Can you just dig it
out for me, please?

178
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,868
Okay.

179
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,322
Help! Can you help, please?

180
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,835
Come with me. What happened?

181
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,453
I was just dropping my
friend off when I saw her here.

182
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,611
She was lying.
She was all alone.

183
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,625
Run inside and tell
someone I need a gurney!

184
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,466
Honey, I'm a doctor.

185
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,912
What's your name? Nadia.

186
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,598
Nadia, tell me where it hurts.

187
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,222
Everywhere.

188
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,707
Oh, God.

189
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,683
This is insane. Is she laboring?

190
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,168
Her pressure's
really low, 78 over 45.

191
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,687
Let's get her a
600cc fluid bolus.

192
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,490
Nadia, Nadia, how
far along are you?

193
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,359
Ten. Ten months?

194
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:05,621
She's saying she's 10 years old.

195
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,106
She doesn't know what
you're talking about.

196
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,250
Rigid abdomen with
generalized tenderness.

197
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,266
Edwards, let's
get the ultrasound.

198
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,900
Nadia, where are your parents?

199
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,280
If she has a mother,
where the hell's her mother?

200
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,304
Oh, she should be in prison.

201
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,323
Nadia, I need you to sit still.

202
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:22,360
I know. I know. I
just need to see if...

203
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,879
Just needed to see...

204
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,241
Okay. Okay.

205
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,036
What?

206
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,970
She's not pregnant.
It's not a baby.

207
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,473
Looks like a mass,
and there's free fluid.

208
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,775
Oh, thank God.
That was getting dark.

209
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,847
A mass the size of a
soccer ball is still pretty dark.

210
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,076
Okay, forget the CT.

211
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,267
She's hypotensive
with peritonitis.

212
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,618
This mass may have ruptured.

213
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,781
We really should
get her up to the OR.

214
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,238
I'll call up.

215
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,668
And then let's call the police
and Child Protective Services.

216
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,771
Letting your kid get this
sick and then abandoning her

217
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,515
is still child abuse. Okay.

218
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,164
Amy, what do you need?

219
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,809
On three. One, two, three.

220
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,178
Looks like paralysis caused

221
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,462
by SCI during a TEVAR procedure.

222
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:04,930
I've induced hypertension

223
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,332
and adjusted the
stent to alleviate,

224
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,499
but nothing has worked.

225
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,951
He needs immediate
spinal cord drainage.

226
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,519
You're here. Why do you need me?

227
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,910
I have stuff to do. I
thought you could take it.

228
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,879
Perks of being chief of neuro.

229
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,298
And this might be your
last chance to work together.

230
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,567
I was just telling Dr. Pierce

231
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,579
why I thought her departure
was such a bad idea.

232
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,203
I know, right?

233
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,073
I thought you've been here longer
than I have, you and Meredith.

234
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,176
Thought maybe you could talk
about it. Derek's easy to talk to.

235
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:31,730
You can tell him
anything. Anything.

236
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
Gown and glove, please.

237
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,547
Don't you have stuff to do?

238
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,838
Yes. Good luck. Good talk.

239
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,404
The Journal of
American Medicine!

240
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,878
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

241
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,729
What's not to
believe? The method.

242
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:52,010
You're calling... You actually
named it the Grey Method?

243
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,802
Well, what else am I
gonna call it? It's my name.

244
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,555
It's a little audacious.

245
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,056
Is that it?

246
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,544
Yeah. Spring of '83.

247
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:04,990
Is there anything in there?

248
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,814
There's some
surgical notes, ideas.

249
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,966
Maybe you'll see
something. I didn't.

250
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,475
I have a surgery.
Thanks for this.

251
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,016
We need to talk
about Maggie Pierce.

252
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,506
Bailey...

253
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,393
The e-mail said, "For
professional and personal reasons."

254
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:19,860
Now, you know
what that could be?

255
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,774
Why would I?
Well, you talk to her.

256
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:24,544
Bailey, she resigned. We
can't hold her against her will.

257
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not saying that.

258
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:29,070
I'm saying we change her will.

259
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,573
I'm trying to get
the board together,

260
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,125
but I think you
need to talk to her,

261
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,211
like you used to talk to me,
you know, when I was first here

262
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,380
and I didn't know my
ass from my elbow.

263
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,965
I probably would have quit...

264
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,967
Damn it, Bailey, she's leaving!

265
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,316
I can't do anything
about it. Just let it go.

266
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,369
Almost done
draining, Dr. Shepherd.

267
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:51,904
You know, I'm just curious.

268
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:55,274
Speaking as someone who
just had a pretty great job

269
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,647
and then turned it down,

270
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,434
I know a rash decision
can be pretty disastrous.

271
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,620
Could we just call it a bad fit?

272
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,468
We could if you'd been here
long enough to know that.

273
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,541
It's not the job.

274
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,849
Then what is it?

275
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,694
I'm sure your wife has told you.

276
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,262
How we doing?

277
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,631
My wife? Told me what?

278
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,149
Oh.

279
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,080
Look, I know you
two have butted heads

280
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,931
and she hasn't been welcoming.

281
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,866
- To say the least.
- She's just one surgeon.

282
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,818
Why don't you just, you
know, stay away from her

283
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,402
- until you figure out...
- It's not as simple as...

284
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,429
Oh, God.

285
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:32,416
You don't know anything.

286
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,447
I'm sorry. What's going on?

287
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,303
You should talk to your wife.

288
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,439
Yeah, okay. Let's
get him on his back.

289
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,343
On three. One, two, three.

290
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,835
Derek, Babinski reflex?

291
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,069
Damn it.

292
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,649
I'm sorry, Dr. Pierce.

293
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,341
You did everything you
could, but this man is paralyzed.

294
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:07,168
No.

295
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:10,338
Nope. Prep for a sternotomy. I
need a bypass machine in here, stat.

296
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,918
Wilson, go get his wife's
consent for an open-heart surgery.

297
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:13,986
What are you planning on doing?

298
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,693
I am going to fix it.

299
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,661
You can help if you want,
but if you're not gonna help,

300
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,079
I need you out of the way.

301
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,092
<i>Mom?</i>

302
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,646
<i>Mommy?</i>

303
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,948
<i>Meredith.</i>

304
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,245
You grew up.

305
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,302
I did.

306
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,755
It's a shame.

307
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,458
It's awful being a grown-up.

308
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,847
But the carousel
never stops turning.

309
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,730
You can't get off.

310
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,572
You page me? What do you got?

311
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,254
Yeah.

312
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:03,523
Do you remember the day you
met my mom at the carousel?

313
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,227
What? That's what you...

314
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:07,628
I remember this day.

315
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:11,382
I was on the carousel at
the park and you came,

316
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,797
and then you were arguing
and she said something to you.

317
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,021
Do you remember what she said?

318
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,208
Meredith, that was
a long time ago.

319
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,562
I don't remember.

320
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,165
Is that all you wanted?

321
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,702
Yeah, I just thought...

322
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,088
Forget it.

323
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,276
I was thinking
about what you said,

324
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,349
and it might be better for them,

325
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,385
Thatcher and Adele, ultimately.

326
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,797
Of course it would.

327
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,033
Let them find people
who will make them happy.

328
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,217
I never wanted to...

329
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,598
I never wanted to cheat.

330
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,368
I never imagined
myself a cheater.

331
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,614
You have the power
to change that, Richard.

332
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,471
It's in your hands.

333
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,641
I've been ready to
do this for a long time.

334
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,760
The question is, are you?

335
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,183
The wife gave consent.

336
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,530
That's lucky. I've been in
his chest for a while now.

337
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,794
That was a bold bet.

338
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,066
Wait. Is that an aneurysm sac?

339
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,590
Did you just fix that?

340
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,019
Yeah, but now I'm gonna
use it to bring blood back

341
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,676
to the spinal cord.

342
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,244
Wait. I'm lost.

343
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,807
Yeah. I was, too, for a while.

344
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,376
He is paralyzed
because his aorta

345
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,910
isn't sending
blood to his spine.

346
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,962
So I replaced the aorta
with a Dacron graft,

347
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:40,237
and now I'm rebuilding the
aneurysm into a second aorta

348
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,807
that will just send blood to the
spine, kind of like a side road.

349
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,604
Is that... You can do that?

350
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,305
Not many could, but she is.

351
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,141
I can see why you
want to keep her around.

352
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,600
Well, yeah, and... Never mind.

353
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:53,845
And it'll work?

354
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,919
God knows.

355
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,888
It's a last-ditch effort.

356
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,723
Take me with you when you go.

357
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,826
Suction. And get
another 6-0 Prolene ready.

358
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,646
Don't just stand
there, Wilson. Scrub in.

359
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,518
Okay, the tumor has taken
over the abdominal cavity.

360
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,365
It's pushed the viscera
over to one side.

361
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,657
Let's debulk as much of
this mass as we can, en bloc,

362
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,659
and when we get
closer to the organs,

363
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,744
we can resect it piece by piece.

364
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,829
Fine.

365
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,232
What?

366
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,333
Edwards told me.

367
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,569
You guys were
unanimous for Bailey.

368
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:29,953
Who told you that?

369
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,833
Dr. Bailey. Why
would she do that?

370
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,007
I kind of had her back.

371
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,386
And you should have had mine.

372
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,838
You listened to my speech.
You said it was good.

373
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,473
It was good. Then
what the hell, then?

374
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,375
Bailey's was better.
Oh, that's great.

375
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,866
Alex, you would make
a fine board member,

376
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,635
but Bailey will make
an exceptional one.

377
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,637
Is that what you want me to do?

378
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,873
Vote for you to be
good, to be fine?

379
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,642
You want my pity
vote? I wouldn't.

380
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,486
Have you lightened sedation?

381
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,754
Okay. He is coming around.

382
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,289
Want to do the honors?

383
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,710
Roy. Roy, are you with us?

384
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,975
Roy, you're okay.
The surgery is all done.

385
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,566
I just need you to
wiggle your toes for me.

386
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,035
Can you do that?

387
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,051
Roy, wiggle your toes, okay?

388
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,192
Roy, wiggle your toes.

389
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,209
Unbelievable.

390
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,713
All right, get him sedated
and get him up to recovery.

391
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:37,821
And good work,
everybody. Thank you, all.

392
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,469
She keeps saying talk to my
wife. Do you know what she means?

393
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,592
I might.

394
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,693
Well?

395
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,396
But I'm not talking
about anything

396
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,966
I might have learned
in AA about someone.

397
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,969
Because I made a pledge there.

398
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,790
But someone else might
know what I can't talk about.

399
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,099
Is Pierce in AA?

400
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,292
No. No!

401
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,544
So you should
definitely talk to her.

402
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,790
She'll just say talk to my wife.

403
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,454
Then you should
talk to your wife.

404
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,064
Edwards, you ready? Uh-huh.

405
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,499
It's invading everything.

406
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,173
I'm literally peeling
it off the spleen.

407
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:15,543
And 7.8 pounds. Wow.

408
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,822
7.8 pounds of lousy parenting.

409
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,575
But she does have a Dutch braid.

410
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,843
It's like a French one
but only harder to do.

411
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,912
I used to do it for my sister
when my mom was strung out.

412
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,580
It took me an hour,
and it still fell apart.

413
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,471
Only a saint or her mother

414
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,624
would take the time to
do something like this.

415
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,127
You need an extra set of hands?

416
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,947
No, we're good. Thanks. Metz?

417
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,177
She takes the time to
do her daughter's hair.

418
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,329
How the hell does she let
her develop an 8-pound tumor?

419
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,070
You and I know something
about crazy mothers.

420
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,423
Be careful. It's impinging
on the left hepatic vein.

421
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,602
I see it.

422
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,560
Damn it.

423
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,929
Where are you?
Where are you? Got it!

424
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,431
She's bleeding
out from her liver.

425
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,699
I'm packing, but
I can't control it.

426
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,017
More laps. Hang
another unit of blood?

427
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,135
Right away.

428
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,619
Edwards, more suction.

429
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,322
<i>I said clamp, now!</i>

430
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,889
- Another.
- Another.

431
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,125
One bullet went
through the right

432
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,676
lower quadrant and
perfed the colon.

433
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,661
A penetrating injury to the
liver here. I need more laps!

434
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,863
She's crashing. We got
to stop this bleed. Suction.

435
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,953
Come on. Come on!

436
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,433
Bokhee, 4-0 silk for ligation.

437
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,100
It's not working.
We're gonna lose her.

438
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,840
What about a balloon tamponade?

439
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,081
What? A balloon tamponade.

440
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,984
That could control a
penetrating liver injury. It should.

441
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,497
Yes. Get me a Foley catheter.

442
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,066
You might need more...
More than one. I know.

443
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,173
Foley, now. Let's go.

444
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,055
You think that'll
hold the bleed?

445
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,573
It's the best chance we've got.

446
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,030
Bokhee, clamp.

447
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,942
Inflating the balloon.

448
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:09,757
I'll be damned.
Nice work, Dr. Grey.

449
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:11,509
BP's climbing.

450
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,349
That's amazing. How the
hell did you think of that?

451
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,627
I don't know.

452
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,422
You okay?

453
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,391
She's fine. You
saved her. She's fine.

454
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,992
Yeah, I'm okay.

455
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,413
There's never
gonna be a good time.

456
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,717
We just have to do it
quickly, rip off the bandage.

457
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,610
I'll tell Adele. Tonight.

458
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,864
I'll tell Thatcher.

459
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,579
My heart's racing.
We're really gonna...

460
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:55,981
Dr. Grey?

461
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,005
Excuse me. Dr. Grey? One minute!

462
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,391
Yes, Chief?

463
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,520
Sorry, Dr. Grey.

464
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:04,044
I just received a very
interesting phone call.

465
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:06,847
Your lap method, the
one you just published.

466
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,315
The Grey Method.

467
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:10,434
The Grey Method, yes.

468
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,731
It's just been placed on
the short list of nominations

469
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:15,556
for the Harper Avery award.

470
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,809
Are you... It is?
Are you kidding?

471
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,130
No surgical resident has
ever made that list before.

472
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,718
I only hope we can convince
you to stay in Seattle.

473
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,363
Well, that's very... No, I know.

474
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,604
You'll have your
veritable pick after this.

475
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,041
Very well done, Grey.

476
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,594
Oh, the board would
like to see you to...

477
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:37,928
Of course.

478
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,923
Meredith. Derek, not now.

479
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,409
Five minutes. Just five minutes.

480
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,289
Derek, I swear to God,
I can't do this right now.

481
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,447
I am sorry about the thing
I said about your mother.

482
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,244
Why? You meant it. It was
in the heat of the moment.

483
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,012
You know, you wanted to
hurt me, and you did that,

484
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,115
so at least have the
guts to stand by it.

485
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,254
Will you just hear me out?

486
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,433
You could do worse
than compare me

487
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,923
to a brilliant surgeon,

488
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,171
but you meant it in the sense
that I am cold and ambitious

489
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,329
and selfish, a horrible
wife and mother. I got that.

490
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,965
I love how you just switch it
around so you can make it fit.

491
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,913
You think I sound like
my mother? You do.

492
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:21,705
And now I get to live under the
weight of your disappointment, too?

493
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,435
Because of
something you gave up.

494
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:25,025
If you recall, I
gave it up for you.

495
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,578
Oh, you gave it up for
me, but I don't want it.

496
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,397
Go. You should get
on the next flight out.

497
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:33,768
Call the President and
get the job back. Just go.

498
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:25,886
Blood. It's just blood.

499
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,926
Meredith, don't be
afraid. Don't be afraid.

500
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,451
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

501
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,224
My mother tried to kill herself.

502
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:47,117
You're a very resourceful
little girl. You know that?

503
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,906
You might have saved
your mother's life.

504
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,981
Someone from Child Protective
Services come here yet?

505
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,404
He's right there.

506
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,441
You're still here.

507
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,444
Yes. I was just worried
about the little girl.

508
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,763
Is she okay?
She's gonna be fine.

509
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,165
Thank God.

510
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,700
Child Protective Services
is here for her so...

511
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,988
Is that a Dutch braid?

512
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,048
When did she get sick, your
daughter? When did this start?

513
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,910
I just want to
see her. Please...

514
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,650
No, you can't see her.

515
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:37,996
But you can come talk to Child
Protective Services with me.

516
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,540
No, I want to make
sure she's okay.

517
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:41,032
And they are going
to call the police.

518
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,505
No. No, you can't do that.

519
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,609
You don't understand. We
have no papers, undocumented.

520
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,445
That's no excuse
to abandon your kid.

521
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,813
They will take her from me.

522
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,093
I've seen it to people I know.

523
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,560
They go to sleep
in the surgical room,

524
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,429
they wake up on a plane
or in a different country.

525
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,297
It's called medical
repatriation,

526
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,082
and it's not something
that we do here.

527
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:00,373
I was afraid to
even bring her here.

528
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,743
You think I didn't
want to help her?

529
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,477
What are my choices?

530
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,312
They do the surgery.

531
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,392
Then they send us back to
a country where we starve

532
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,585
or I will work as a
prostitute, or even worse,

533
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,055
they'll make her a prostitute,
and no one says anything about it.

534
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,092
That is one choice.

535
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,079
The other choice is
I ignore it and I pray

536
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,181
and I hope that she's okay

537
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,768
and I hope that whatever
my little girl has goes away.

538
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:32,455
And after a while, these
choices, they make you crazy.

539
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:37,044
And after a while, I say
to myself that she's fine.

540
00:26:37,113 --> 00:26:42,666
Then after a while, I don't see
the tumor when I look at her.

541
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,087
Because what is the alternative?

542
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,900
Yep? So, uh, you're leaving.

543
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,069
For sure?

544
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:04,448
You should talk to your wife.

545
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:09,309
Oh, no, that's not an
option. So, I'm asking you.

546
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,246
You know, it's not
really my place to say.

547
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:15,749
And, honestly,
I'm tired of saying it

548
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,268
'cause every time I
do, it just gets worse.

549
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,987
What? What gets worse?
What are you talking about?

550
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,775
She's my sister.

551
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,862
My parents, my birth parents,

552
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,885
are Ellis Grey and
Richard Webber.

553
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,933
Your wife's my sister. So
you should talk to your wife.

554
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,241
That's... So, Richard's
your father. Yes.

555
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,193
And Meredith is your sister.

556
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,095
Half-sister.

557
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,825
I thought she
would have told you.

558
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,381
Oh, no, no, we're not, um...

559
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,284
Meredith is
terrible with sisters,

560
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:51,884
just so you know, and I'm not.

561
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:54,313
I love sisters. I have a
bunch of them and, um...

562
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,309
I'm glad you told me.
It's nice to meet you.

563
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,846
It's nice to meet you.

564
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,131
Oh.

565
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,407
This is very strange.

566
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:15,342
Yeah, I got to go.

567
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:18,278
Okay, don't leave,
okay? Until we talk again.

568
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,831
Just don't leave.

569
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,525
Okay, what is the deal
with you and Pierce?

570
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:33,660
Bailey, please.

571
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,473
See, every time I bring
her name up to you,

572
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:37,409
you look like I just
stabbed you in the chest.

573
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,799
Now, I think she's
leaving because of you.

574
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,568
All right, you don't want
to tell me what happened,

575
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,672
you don't have to, but...

576
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,727
Did something happen?

577
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,169
She's my daughter,

578
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,588
mine and Ellis Grey's.

579
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,363
Oh, thank you, God.

580
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,064
What? No, no!

581
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,216
I thought you had
sex with that girl.

582
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,834
Bailey!

583
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,437
Wait. But that's
why she's leaving?

584
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,706
She doesn't want
anything to do with me.

585
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:23,710
Well, then, she doesn't
know you, or she would stay.

586
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:25,812
Now, you have to go talk to her.

587
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,280
I think I'm too late.

588
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,016
No such thing.

589
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,221
I wish I could go back.

590
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,708
I'd do everything
so differently.

591
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,978
We would've had a
wonderful life together, Ellis.

592
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,631
You think so? I do.

593
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,350
We would've done
our fellowship here,

594
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,739
and then you would've fought
me for Chief and probably won.

595
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:53,740
And I wouldn't have minded

596
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,170
because we'd have
the kids at home.

597
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,712
We have kids?

598
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,115
Meredith would've
needed a brother and sister.

599
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,870
Kids need family.

600
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,640
I would be fine, and we
could grow old together.

601
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,376
My life is so unfinished.

602
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,713
It's unfinished,
and I'm not finished.

603
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,233
No. No, Ellis.

604
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,170
Don't think that.

605
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,138
Just close your eyes

606
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,908
and think of the family,

607
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,495
of the house.

608
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,947
And you there every
night to come home to.

609
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,535
And me there.

610
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,762
I lied to you before

611
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,839
about what happened
that day at the carousel.

612
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,256
I remember what she said.

613
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,893
I remember what I said.

614
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,909
I remember everything.

615
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,790
It was a Thursday afternoon.

616
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,793
We had made a pact.

617
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:24,698
She would leave Thatcher,
and I would leave Adele.

618
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:28,935
Your mother had just received
her first Harper Avery nomination.

619
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,570
She was so excited.

620
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:36,710
And I was jealous.

621
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,778
Not like healthy competition.

622
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:43,116
A hateful, hopeless jealousy.

623
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:50,156
As if she was already too
far ahead to catch up to.

624
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:55,278
Her success illuminated
everything I hadn't yet accomplished.

625
00:31:55,346 --> 00:32:00,617
The night before, as I worked
up the nerve to tell Adele,

626
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,154
I thought of your mother.

627
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,471
I thought of what she could
do at such a young age.

628
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,902
I thought of what she would do.

629
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,200
And I thought,

630
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,854
"I will spend my
life feeling like this,

631
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,676
"my entire life."

632
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,948
So I ruined it.

633
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:38,983
You have a child.

634
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,052
Don't say that. I
won't listen. Richard.

635
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,542
I'm sorry. I can't.

636
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:44,522
No, please, please,
please, please!

637
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,846
Ellis, no. Richard.

638
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:48,909
Richard, you can't leave me.

639
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,367
Richard! Richard!

640
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,404
Richard!

641
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,121
Are you okay?

642
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,562
We have to go home.
We have to go home.

643
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,531
<i>We have to go home.</i>

644
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,934
And then she took me home.

645
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,603
Yes.

646
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,039
And then she attempted suicide.

647
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,963
We would have had
a whole other life.

648
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:43,353
Everything after
that was my fault.

649
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,525
I made the wrong choice
for the wrong reason.

650
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,555
And there's hardly a
day goes by that I don't...

651
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,139
I'm so sorry.

652
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,143
I bet you are.

653
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,193
<i>He's gone back to Adele.</i>

654
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,117
Yes. Of course he has.

655
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,321
Mom...

656
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,390
He's afraid.

657
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,992
Afraid to be happy.

658
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,161
And I'm all alone.

659
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,663
Now I have to raise
my daughter alone.

660
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,752
How am I expected to do that?

661
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:51,449
She's pretty skittish. Ana,
we need to talk to you.

662
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:54,123
No. No, you said
we will be all right.

663
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,237
It's okay. You're safe. Calm
down. You can't take her from me.

664
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,305
I'm going. I'm
go... Nadia is safe.

665
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,556
I spoke to CPS.

666
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,858
I told them the whole thing
was a huge misunderstanding

667
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,349
and that I made a mistake.

668
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,428
These people are
lawyers from the hospital,

669
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:06,597
and they are going to help you.

670
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,832
Ana, they're gonna work
with you, explain your rights,

671
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,039
help with the payment plan.

672
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,908
No one's gonna deny
Nadia medical treatment,

673
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,443
and no one's gonna
take her away,

674
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,055
but you have to bring her
here to me for her treatments.

675
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,246
Do you understand?

676
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,675
Okay, I'm going to
bring them in now.

677
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,889
Hi.

678
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,703
No, no, no, I
didn't vote for you.

679
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,505
Like a month ago, you were
all, "Tell me if you need help.

680
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,839
"I will help you."
So full of crap.

681
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,103
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

682
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,375
If you didn't want
to vote for me, fine.

683
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,065
But then why lie
to my face about it?

684
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,045
Because I didn't think that you'd
take the attending job if you knew.

685
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,682
Look, if you're trying to be a mentor
or whatever, right now you're sucking.

686
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:41,849
No, I'm not your mentor!

687
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,451
I mean, I am if
you need me to be,

688
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,052
but I need you to
not need me to be.

689
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,754
That's why I
didn't vote for you.

690
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,056
Listen, I spent the day
observing a fetal shunt placement,

691
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,859
trying to suck up to a woman
who I'm 100% positive hates me.

692
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,978
The only reason that I
could even try to do that

693
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:57,482
is because you handled that
little girl's case so beautifully.

694
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,868
I need to take a step
back from peds surgery

695
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,352
if I'm gonna make
this fellowship work.

696
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,856
And if I'm gonna keep my
marriage from falling apart.

697
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,274
And the only way that
I can even try to do that

698
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,968
is if you're here, doing
everything that I can't do.

699
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,864
I don't need you to be
my fellow anymore, Alex.

700
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,373
I need you to be me.

701
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,042
You're the only one
I can trust to do that.

702
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,113
I should be making
a lot more money.

703
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,016
A lot. A lot.

704
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,134
Uh, no, stop. Stop. We're not
fighting. The fighting is over.

705
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,490
I am calling a halt to it.

706
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,504
God, Derek, you
don't just get to do that,

707
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,495
decide when we're moving,
decide when a fight is over.

708
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,925
What if I'm not done fighting?

709
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,782
Oh, it's not over. I
can guarantee you that.

710
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,394
We'll probably fight
tomorrow and the next day,

711
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:45,696
and this is gonna
last for a while,

712
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,971
but right now we're
gonna have a truce.

713
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
A truce? Yes.

714
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,342
Why?

715
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,610
You have a sister.

716
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,216
You're losing her,
Meredith, and you shouldn't.

717
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,613
You have a sister and you
don't tell me? This can't happen.

718
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,488
When stuff like this comes
up, you have to let me know. I...

719
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:09,025
We put all our other
stuff aside, and it's like I...

720
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,394
I need to know that you're okay.

721
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,031
Are you? Are you okay?

722
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,244
<i>We have to go home.</i>

723
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,812
<i>Would you like to hold her?</i>

724
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,314
<i>No. Absolutely not. No.</i>

725
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,686
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

726
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,275
Richard and Ellis had a kid.

727
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,783
I remember moving to Boston.

728
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:38,071
I remember the two of us
basically hiding out in an apartment.

729
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,408
And I remember she cried a lot.

730
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,344
And I remember
her belly getting big.

731
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:49,215
And I knew I wasn't
supposed to make any noise.

732
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:53,953
And then her water
broke on the kitchen floor,

733
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,772
and that scared me
because it reminded me

734
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,143
of the blood in the kitchen
when she cut her wrists.

735
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,627
And I went to the hospital.

736
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,997
I was there. Both times.

737
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:08,785
And I heard a baby cry,
and I heard my mother cry.

738
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,621
And then we went home.

739
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,607
And her belly
wasn't big anymore.

740
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:18,427
And then we moved across town
to a house, a really nice house.

741
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,330
And then she started her
fellowship at Mass Gen,

742
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:25,551
and I just started first grade.

743
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,955
And then she was
just Dr. Ellis Grey,

744
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:30,435
and I was just a kid in school,

745
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,654
and everything
went back to normal.

746
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,238
I mean, I was five years old.

747
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:36,729
What was the alternative?

748
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,069
And I have a sister.

749
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,423
She's nice. Good doctor.

750
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,039
You remind me of my daughter.

751
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,382
Pierce.

752
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,521
Do you have a second?

753
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,951
Yeah. Listen...

754
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,803
You didn't ask for a sister,

755
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,971
and you probably don't need one.

756
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,424
Your parents send
you singing fish.

757
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:30,099
You're very accomplished for
your age, and you seem very happy.

758
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,246
So, you can go if you want.

759
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,604
I can understand
why you would want to.

760
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:38,193
But I would like to show you
something if you have a minute.

761
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:43,312
<i>They say we can
repress our memories.</i>

762
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,415
<i>I wonder if we're just
keeping them safe somewhere.</i>

763
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:52,688
She wrote in these
journals, obsessively.

764
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,525
Mostly surgical notes, ideas,

765
00:39:56,594 --> 00:40:00,746
but this one is from around
the time you were born.

766
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,854
"A surgery can fail for
any number of reasons,

767
00:40:07,923 --> 00:40:10,840
"whether from a
patient's morbidity

768
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,009
"or surgeon's ineptitude." Jeez.

769
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,744
They're not so warm.

770
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,197
She wasn't, either.

771
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:20,466
But there is more to her than...

772
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,122
I'm still finding out
things about her myself.

773
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,791
<i>Because no matter
how painful they are,</i>

774
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,844
<i>they are our most
valuable possessions.</i>

775
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:41,087
<i>Our lives are built on our
mistakes as much as our successes.</i>

776
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:42,784
She wrote mostly at night,

777
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:47,109
with a glass of wine, as you
can see by the ring stains and...

778
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:51,864
But I think here is
when she found out

779
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:55,268
she was pregnant
because the wine stains stop

780
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:58,271
and she starts writing
down everything she ate.

781
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,807
So... This was when she...

782
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,196
Realized she was
pregnant with you.

783
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,160
So she wanted you to be okay.

784
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,700
She wanted to be healthy.

785
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,704
She tried, at least.

786
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,810
<i>They made us who we are.</i>

787
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,886
<i>The first time I won
the Harper Avery,</i>

788
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,657
<i>I dedicated it to the men
who'd been so supportive.</i>

789
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,695
<i>No, I wish. Just kidding.</i>

790
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,997
<i>The first time I won
the Harper Avery,</i>

791
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,134
<i>I thought, "Screw
all those boys."</i>

792
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,904
<i>I stood there,
holding that trophy,</i>

793
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:53,176
<i>and I thought about
everything I'd sacrificed,</i>

794
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,178
<i>what I had overcome.</i>

795
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,982
<i>And I dedicated that award</i>

796
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,919
<i>to all the women surgeons
who would come after me.</i>

797
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,465
<i>Where were we?</i>
