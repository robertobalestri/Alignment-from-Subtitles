you can't leave me!</i>

180
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,737
<i>Richard, Richard!</i>

181
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,005
MEREDITH: <i>I was swimming...</i>

182
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,190
And I let go.

183
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,460
I stopped fighting.

184
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,114
ELLIS: Meredith, get up.

185
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,633
Zozo, honey, wake up.

186
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,622
ELLIS: Put these
on. (UNZIPS BAG)

187
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,073
Okay. You ready?

188
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,832
Where are we going?

189
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,036
Away, sweetie. We're going away.

190
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,229
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

191
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,425
It's just so strange that
she left with no warning.

192
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:18,793
She left a note.

193
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,129
Uh, "The kids and I are
safe"? Yeah, that's helpful.

194
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,943
ALEX: I called Yang again, but she
hasn't heard from Mer since the funeral.

195
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,501
Are you serious?
That was weeks ago.

196
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,603
Wha... Okay, I just
don't understand.

197
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,683
I don't understand. I do
not understand how you...

198
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,673
You want to go to
a meeting after this?

199
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:34,759
I'm good. Thanks.

200
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,227
Are you?

201
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,473
MIRANDA: "So long,
I'll see you later" or...

202
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,775
You're basically
living at the hospital.

203
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,409
MIRANDA: "trouble due
to the fact that I am all..."

204
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,544
I'm fine, Richard, really...

205
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,568
MIRANDA: "world right now."

206
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,098
I mean, she just dropped
everything. Her patients, her surgeries.

207
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,339
Look, maybe it's time
we hire a detective,

208
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,740
make sure she's really safe.

209
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,103
Yeah, I think we
should call the police.

210
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,193
CALLIE: Mmm-hmm.

211
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:54,102
RICHARD: Okay,
that's... That's enough.

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,581
Meredith Grey is not a missing
person. She... She left a note.

213
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,767
She's not jeopardizing her kids.

214
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,953
She's not an
irresponsible person.

215
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,055
If she's gone, she's gone

216
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,590
because she wants to be gone.

217
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,108
She's doing what
she knows how to do.

218
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:09,744
Same as her mother.

219
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,964
Ellis Grey left Seattle
and never looked back.

220
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,308
So, that's it? That...

221
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,753
We just let her go?

222
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,110

OWEN: And time isn't
the same over there.

227
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,272
Hours don't exist. There's
only minutes, seconds.

228
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,840
It's visceral and exciting.

229
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,308
But you're chief.

230
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,777
Well, not for the
next few months.

231
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,845
Webber is stepping
in as interim chief.

232
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,149
The work I'll get to
do is raw and urgent.

233
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,467
Kepner, you just feel
so useful and good

234
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,702
at the end of every day,

235
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,970
and after everything
that's happened here, I...

236
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,522
I'm ready.

237
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,552
I'm ready for this kind of
change. I just need to feel...

238
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,708
Useful.

239
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,061
And good.

240
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,495
Yeah.

241
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,712
I don't care how
sick the kids are.

242
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,369
I'm not doing this next year.

243
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,490
(LAUGHS)

244
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,742
Our patient has 60%
surface area burns.

245
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,012
She was pulled from a
house fire this morning.

246
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,191
Are you even listening?

247
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,292
JO: I'm... I'm sorry. I just...

248
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,393
You need to prepare yourself.

249
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,450
Burns like this are...

250
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,759
Difficult.

251
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,586
This will not be easy.

252
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,391
Hi, Anne.

253
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,779
Dr. Wilson and I are here to
start your first dressing changes.

254
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:56,150
(SIGHS) I'm so cold.
I can't stop shaking.

255
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,513
I mean, isn't
that weird, that...

256
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,970
That I got burned and I'm cold?

257
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,650
Well, your skin and your nerves

258
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,219
have experienced severe damage.

259
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,976
You are unable to retain heat

260
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,027
or feel surface pain.

261
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,897
Dr. Wilson, do you want
to walk Anne through

262
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,514
what we're gonna be doing today?

263
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,117
We'll debride the
burns layer by layer

264
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,936
until we expose healthy tissue

265
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,538
to help new skin grow.

266
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,140
JJ: And it hurts like hell,

267
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,709
so you might want to
grab onto something.

268
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,660
The bed rails work really well.

269
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,729
Who's that?

270
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,157
That... That's
your neighbor, JJ.

271
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,065
She was admitted
a couple weeks ago.

272
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,546
Hello, JJ. JJ: Oh, and
do yourself a favor,

273
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,003
grab something to bite down on.

274
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,550
That's not... Thank you, JJ.

275
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,673
Is she serious?

276
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,785
We've got you under sedation.

277
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,325
JJ: Barely works!

278
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,311
JACKSON: Really, JJ?

279
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,982
We are going to do this as
quickly as possible, okay, Anne?

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,517
Um, is my husband out there?

281
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,915
Oh, um, I don't see him,
but we can track him down.

282
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,216
S-should I... JACKSON:
Uh, sure, yeah.

283
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,108
Just... Just be quick,
okay? Ready to get started?

284
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,061
Okay. You ready?

285
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,441
(GASPS) JACKSON: Okay.

286
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,132
Ow. Ow!

287
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,879
Ow, that... That hurts! I know.

(SCREAMING)

290
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,888
JJ: Okay, you see, that's why

291
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,992
you want to get
something to bite down on!

292
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,077
(CRYING)

293
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,448
(CHUCKLES) I... I never... I
never said you were boring.

294
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,017
Don't deny it.

295
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,886
I got the whole story
out of a resident.

296
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,065
You thought I was boring.

297
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,334
That's why we never
had a second date.

298
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,892
(CLEARS THROAT) And, uh...

299
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,094
Which resident told you this?

300
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,729
(CHUCKLES)

301
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,142
I'm not gonna put my CI at risk.

302
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,482
Um...

303
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,702
That's a confidential
informant. It's cop talk.

304
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,115
I'd elaborate, but
you might think

305
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,638
it's a little too boring.

306
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,508
(CHUCKLES)

307
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,637
Relax, I'm just
messing with you.

308
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,361
(LAUGHS)

309
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,546
(GROANS)

310
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,233
Oh, okay, all
right. Take it easy.

311
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,630
That graft we used to close
your abdomen is breaking down,

312
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,298
and you're gonna need
another series of surgeries

313
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,955
just to complete the closure,

314
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,641
let alone to complete
your spinal fusion.

315
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,960
What about my leg?

316
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,007
I know it's in pretty rough
shape, but I'm gonna need it back

317
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,511
if I'm gonna go back to chasing
crooks and leaping over rooftops,

318
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,752
you know, all that
super-boring cop stuff.

319
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,588
(CHUCKLES) Come on.

320
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,041
Don't make it that
easy. Give a little back.

321
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,476
I can take it, you know?

322
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:22,313
Dan, I can't make you any
promises about your leg.

323
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,915
I'm gonna do
everything that I can,

324
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,833
but I am not confident
that we'll be able to save it.

325
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,603
There's a very, very
long road ahead.

326
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:30,989
Wow.

327
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,338
When you sling it back,
you don't mess around.

328
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,060
But silver lining,

329
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,706
this means you'll have that much

330
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,170
more time to fall
in love with me.

331
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,783
(LAUGHS)

332
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,234
Ow.

333
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,103
Your face... Priceless.

334
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,204
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

335
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,288
Yeah.

336
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,375
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

337
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:15,010
How is what you're doing any
different than Meredith Grey?

338
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,400
We've been over this.

339
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,869
Because my husband didn't die,

340
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,082
because I'm not running
away from anything,

341
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,967
because this is an
incredible opportunity for me

342
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:25,142
to learn surgical techniques
that I've never even dreamed of.

343
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,531
Jackson, it's only three months.

344
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,179
You could at least
pretend to be happy for me.

345
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,497
Why? I don't like it.

346
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,262
(SIGHS) I don't. It's dangerous.

347
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm not gonna be fighting!
I'm gonna be doing surgery.

348
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,971
I'm gonna be teaching, helping.

349
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,008
These are all things that
you do here every day.

350
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,760
It makes me excited.

351
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,497
Happy.

352
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,435
Please... I need this.

353
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,503

721 to Los Angeles...</i>

Well, I can't leave if we're like this.

357
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,582
Will you at least
kiss me goodbye?

358

360
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,090
I'm a surgeon.

361
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,010
Gonna ruin my day at the
lake, poking a hornet's nest.

362
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,240

363
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,714

poke the hornet's nest.

(CHUCKLES) You baby.

367
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,882
And you want to
be kept alive forever.

368
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,033
You can't deal with a
pair of sharp tweezers.

369
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:07,061
You want to be intubated,
catheterized, multiple IVs,

370
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,081
central lines in
the neck and groin,

371
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,984
and bed sores all because
you can't get it together,

372
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,586
let Jesus take the wheel.

373
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,817
What?

374
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,475
Look, look, if I am
lying in a hospital bed

375
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,577
in such bad shape that
it has reached that point

376
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:26,814
that some doctor is talking to
you about extraordinary measures,

377
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:28,582
I am not gonna let Jesus

378
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,195
take the wheel. Oh!

379
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:31,530
No, you know when Jesus
should've taken the wheel,

380
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:32,931
when he should've been flipping

381
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,232
his turn signals
a-and shifting gears?

382
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,768
When whatever bad
thing that happened

383
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,442
to make me suffer a traumatic
brain injury was happening,

384
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,628
but instead, Jesus was clearly
out joyriding with someone else

385
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,931
because there I
am gorked in a bed.

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,978
So, no, I'm not gonna
let Jesus take the wheel.

387
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,468
I'm not gonna let Jesus
anywhere near my damn car!

00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:49,870
I'm driving!

00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,406
No, science is driving.

390
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,944
I did not stab him in the
neck with these tweezers.

391
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,963
I want that noted.

392
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,033
Hey. Anything today?

393
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,001

to get off their asses

401

and hire a new
neurosurgeon already.

402
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,467
Don't make a scene.
It's not worth it.

403
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,767
I know.

404
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,114
DR. DREYFUSS: Well,
it's irresponsible, is what it is.

405
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,199
It's bad management.

406

You think that we need
to just get off our asses?

We should do you that solid

411
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,475
because the loss of
our colleague and friend

You think that we should
be sensitive to that?

414
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,770
How about you take a minute

415
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,723
to think about the person,
the talent, the life that we lost?

416
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,809
How about you think
before you start complaining

417
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,379
that Derek Shepherd's death
has been inconvenient for you?

Because I'm not having

428
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:18,159
He's probably gonna lose it

429
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,054
and Dan and I were hoping
he's a viable candidate

430
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,412
for a bionic prosthesis,

431
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,465
so if he's in chronic pain
or in a c-collar for too long

432
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,451

I realize this isn't the method my
dear, dead brother would have used.

His method would
actually be clunkier

00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,667
No, no, no, no, that's dessert!

703
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,091
I am sorry, but that
turkey is three hours away.

704
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,704
I didn't know it was
gonna take all day.

705
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,472
Didn't your mother ever
teach you how to roast a turk...

706
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,525
No, 'cause I never had a mother

707
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,830
and I didn't have
an oven in my car.

708

stuffed with is food poisoning.

You have plans for the holidays?

728
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,039
Um, yeah, my ex and I are
splitting Christmas with our daughter,

for an extended period of time,

740
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,385
that care can often feel
to the patient like, um...

741
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:41,437
(CLEARS THROAT) affection.

742
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,857

743
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:47,155
I meant as my doctor,

What if I met Idris Elba?

760
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,755
What?

761
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:36,342
Well, you're hooked
up to endless machines,

00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:40,746
having the time of your brain-dead
life with extraordinary measures,

763
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:44,483
and since you are
technically alive,

764
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,954
well, then I'm not
single, I am not a widow.

765
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:53,293
Years pass, and, uh... Okay,
I'm not the kind of woman who...

766
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:57,730
Okay, there are people who
think that sex isn't cheating,

767
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,009
there are people out there

768
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,579
who think that an
emotional affair isn't cheating.

769
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:04,699
Well, I'm not either kind
of person. It's all cheating.

Even though my
husband is an idiot

who thinks that he will have
that one-in-a-zillion chance...

No, look, there are

up after years of...

774
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,708
There are documented

775
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,110
who've seen the Loch
Ness monster, too.

776
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,174
So what?

777
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,769
I will be locked
up like some nun,

778
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,906
withering and wasting
away lonely and alone

779
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,559
all because you're mad at
Jesus, so I don't get to have Idris.

780
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,756
You're taking away
my Idris chance.

781
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,914
(LAUGHS) What? Idris Elba!

782
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:35,451
He could come to Seattle, witness
an accident, save a child's life,

783
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,332
carry that child in his
arms, bare-chested,

784
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,074
into my trauma
room. You don't know.

785
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,242
So, you're gonna
pull the plug on me

786
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:46,546
so you can have your
way with Idris Elba?

787
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,533
It's Idris Elba!

788
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,549
Oh, I ate too much
pizza. (CLEARS THROAT)

Second batch.

790
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:59,520
I always hated eggnog.
Why is yours so good?

791
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,876
Mine's mostly hooch.

792
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,646
It's basically a
bourbon milkshake.

793
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,414
Cheers to that.

794
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,061
Karev, that is definitely the
saddest tree I've ever seen.

795
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,251
ALEX: Tell Robbins.

796
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,236
No, it's better than no tree.

797
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:11,821
Alex was like, "Why bother?"

798
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,307
And I said, "You have to
have a tree at Christmas."

799
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:18,544
Otherwise, your soul is just
curdled and you've given up on joy,

800
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,312
so I got a tree.

801
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,050
I started decorating it, and then
some woman went into labor,

802
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,935
so I gave up.

803
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,237

"Mommy, maybe at
Christmas, we'll see Zola.

00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,242
"Shouldn't we
get her a present?"

808
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,316
And I don't... I don't
know what to say.

they're ever coming back.

Hmm. I know the feeling.

811
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,217

fundamentally change who he is

when what makes him feel good

good you make him feel.
