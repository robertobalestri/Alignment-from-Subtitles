1
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:07,958
Time stops
when you're in the O.R.

2
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:11,262
You step up to the table...

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,151
you evaluate the patient...

4
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:19,828
you pick up a scalpel...

5
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,546
Big brother.

6
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:28,234
And then you go into a bubble.

7
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:32,222
It's just you and your surgery,
and nothing else matters,

8
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:36,860
not time, not pain,
not exhaustion...

9
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,875
nothing.

10
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:50,402
Hey.

11
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,128
Just finished my corpectomy. Did I miss it?

12
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:53,334
No, you're good.

13
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:56,880
Wow.

14
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,882
- That was fast.
- What was fast?

15
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,852
I put out feelers
with a real-estate agent

16
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:02,619
about the house,

17
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,555
and looks like I got an offer.

18
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,823
You're selling the house?

19
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,757
No.

20
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,025
I-I don't know. Maybe.

21
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:11,228
Why do people constantly feel
the need to kill their arteries?

22
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:12,196
Are they here yet?

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,831
Oh, did I miss it?
Tell me I didn't miss it.

24
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,599
Nope. I almost forgot.

25
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,067
I can't wait to see
the beads of sweat

26
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:18,569
on their freaked-out
little faces.

27
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:19,603
Oh, man. Did I miss it?

28
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,604
- Nope.
- Nope.

29
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,840
I want to see someone crap...
actually crap.

30
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,575
Seen it, smelled it.
Not as fun as you'd think.

31
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,176
It's happening!

32
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,611
The baby chicks and ducks
are here!

33
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,694
It happens in real life, too.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,018
When something big happens,
something tragic,

35
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,187
you freeze.

36
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,923
You retreat
into your happy bubble...

37
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,759
- Derek.
- Derek.

38
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,527
- Right. Meredith.
- Meredith.

39
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,195
For what seems like a second...

40
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,865
Until you look up.

41
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:52,236
And suddenly you realize...

42
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:56,974
it's a whole new year.

43
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,209
Each of you today
comes here hopeful,

44
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,478
wanting in on the game.

45
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:03,714
a month ago, you were in med school,

46
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,882
being taught by doctors.

47
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,819
Today, you are the doctors.

48
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:12,055
The five years you spend here
as surgical residents

49
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,891
will be the best and worst
of your lives.

50
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,426
They will...

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,428
You have a question?

52
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:18,962
Yes. Why?

53
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:21,665
- Uh, you raised your hand.
- No, I'm sorry.

54
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,933
I mean why will these be

55
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,835
the best and worst years of our lives?

56
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,570
Uh, I-I was getting to that.

57
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,771
Sorry.

58
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,106
Um, where was I? Oh, right.

59
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,810
You will be pushed
to the breaking point.

60
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,611
Look around you.

61
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,780
Say hello to your competition.

62
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,249
Eight of you will switch
to an easier specialty.

63
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,452
Five of you will crack
under the pressure.

64
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:43,086
Two of you
will be asked to leave.

65
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,825
This is your starting line.

66
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,591
This is your arena.

67
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,626
How well you play...

68
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,362
that's up to you.

69
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,034
They look stupid.
They look like babies.

70
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,869
Were we ever that young?

71
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:01,438
- They're so... well rested.
- And stupid.

72
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,274
And eager, like puppies.

73
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,375
No, not like puppies.

74
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,610
- Chicks and ducks.
- Chicks and ducks.

75
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,779
When did we start calling them that?

76
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,713
You've been gone for a year.

77
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,038
Left to their own devices,
they would drown.

78
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,350
and take the patients down
with them.

79
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,886
God help us all.

80
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,537
They look good.

81
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,838
Pretty good.

82
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:35,739
Some of them.

83
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,876
I mean, for chicks and ducks.

84
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,844
I'll at least get
some good ones, right?

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,513
You'll make sure
I get some good ones?

86
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,381
Yeah. You're gonna hook me up.

87
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,317
Uh, listen up.

88
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,920
This is Dr. Edwards.

89
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,089
Some of you are lucky enough
to be under her supervision.

90
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,157
Listen closely
to everything she says.

91
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,259
Observe. Learn.

92
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:58,195
She has the power to mold you
into fine surgeons.

93
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,563
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

94
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,164
Oh, and congratulations, sir.

95
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,166
Dr. Webber's getting married
this afternoon.

96
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,067
- Hey!
- Hey!

97
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:05,068
Wow! That's...

98
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,236
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

99
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,070
Mazel tov, sir. Congratulations.

100
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:08,405
Hooray!

101
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,073
Thank... thank you.

102
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:13,010
Uh, now, um...
Who's got Dr. Edwards?

103
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:19,975
I did not hook you up.

104
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,287
All right. I have three rules.

105
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,023
One... listen to the nurses.
Respect the nurses.

106
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,791
Do whatever the nurses say.

107
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,893
You may think
you know more than the nurses.

108
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:30,794
You do not.

109
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,763
Two... your life
is now all about me...

110
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:33,630
Charge to 200.

111
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:34,965
Not about you
or your boyfriend...

112
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,133
Charged. Clear!

113
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,000
Your fight with your sister...

114
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,735
Or your nasty little rash
down there.

115
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,970
So, when we are focused on me,

116
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,238
we are learning to be
surgical gods.

117
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,807
When we are focused on you,
we're working at a gas station.

118
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,242
Three... no complaining.

119
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:47,844
You complain and you are out.
Got it?

120
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:51,415
You.

121
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,950
Rules. Repeat.

122
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:57,087
Listen to nurses, worship you,
complain and die.

123
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,022
Good. Let's go.

124
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:03,860
Hunt.

125
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,163
How much longer is Richard
gonna be interim chief?

126
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,965
Because I want to expand
my department,

127
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,967
and he has kind of a different
approach to the budget.

128
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,135
- So when are you coming back?
- Uh, I'm not.

129
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,971
The board's gonna appoint
a new chief.

130
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:14,972
We are? When?

131
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,607
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

132
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:20,077
Because... uh...
I've been chief long enough.

133
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,580
And... It's time
for something else.

134
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:27,150
Dr. Meadows. Dr. Meadows.

135
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,122
Jackson.

136
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:33,123
Jackson!

137
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:36,293
This is... uh...
you are just making a mess.

138
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:37,527
What are you doing?

139
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:39,162
Oh. Do you want some?

140
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:41,098
Sweetheart,
you don't have to be here.

141
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,065
Really, I'm fine.

142
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,001
I am supporting you.
I'm your maid of honor.

143
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:46,103
April said the job
of the maid of honor...

144
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,639
support the bride.
Keep her company.

145
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:49,938
So I'm supportin'.

146
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,287
I'm keeping you company.

147
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:54,669
You know, Meredith also said
that the maid of honor

148
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,114
drives the getaway car if you
want to make a run for it.

149
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,649
So, you know,
you want to make a run for it,

150
00:05:58,683 --> 00:05:59,716
I'm standing by.

151
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,681
Ready to go.
Just give me a holler.

152
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,887
Until then,
we're up on L.A. by 4.

153
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:06,768
I thought April would be
with you when you came over.

154
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,760
Is everything okay?

155
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,897
Yeah. Fine.

156
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,766
Mm. Well.

157
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,136
I know it's a challenge.

158
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,671
The woman that came back
from the combat zone

159
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:23,407
is not the same girl
that left here.

160
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,743
April has changed.

161
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:29,346
It would be understandable
if that created problems.

162
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:30,981
Jackson.

163
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,817
Is that Richard?

164
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,287
Tell me that he's here.
Tell me he's here, finally.

165
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,153
I told him not to go
to that hospital today.

166
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:39,001
We interrupt this program

167
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:39,957
- to bring you late-breaking news...
- It's not Richard.

168
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:41,191
from our studios
in downtown Seattle.

169
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,359
What's wrong?

170
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:43,861
These images are just coming in.

171
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:44,995
You know how many incoming?

172
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,563
No. We don't even know
what happened. But it is big.

173
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,130
I guess we're probably not making it
out of here in time for that wedding.

174
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,602
- You did a lobectomy on a dirt road?
- Well, we had to.

175
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:53,771
The nearest medical center
was 150 miles away.

176
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:56,001
- Hey, does anybody know what happened?
- Not a clue.

177
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:57,775
So, was it just a 24/7
adrenaline rush?

178
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,064
- What was a 24/7 adrenaline rush?
- The desert. No.

179
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:03,828
You get desensitized
pretty fast.

180
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,884
There's another group leaving in
two weeks if you're interested.

181
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,386
You're not living in a tent.

182
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,355
- I grew up in a car.
- That had doors.

183
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,222
We should both go.

184
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,691
I'm definitely not living
in a tent.

185
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,858
Okay. Here we go.

186
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,533
What have you got?

187
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,835
Mid-60s female
with crush injuries.

188
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,437
Massive blood loss at the scene.

189
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:29,093
We've done chest compressions
for 28 minutes.

190
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,148
49-year-old male.
Went into v-fib en route.

191
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:39,683
Shocked times three.

192
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,685
He had two rounds
of epi and vaso.

193
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,521
There are four more
ambulances behind us.

194
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,128
Every last one of them's
got nothing but D.O.A.s.

195
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,027
What's going on?

196
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,729
Why aren't the ambulances
unloading?

197
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,731
Because they aren't ambulances.
They're freakin' hearses.

198
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,549
All the patients are dead.

199
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,502
What the hell happened
out there?

200
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:07,044
S11E23
Time Stops

201
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,047
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

202
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,422
A tunnel on 99 collapsed
during rush hour.

203
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,137
The north entrance
completely caved in,

204
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,125
trapping nearly 20 vehicles
under the rubble.

205
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,593
Do we know how many victims?

206
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:24,096
They're trying to get people out
as fast as they can.

207
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,997
But for now, we're just waiting

208
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:27,366
for them to find
someone with a pulse.

209
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,636
How many dead?

210
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:30,427
13 fatalities so far.

211
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:31,670
God.

212
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:33,639
Coming through!
We got a live one!

213
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:34,706
Clear a path!

214
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,341
Scott Henry. 17 years old.

215
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,343
Penetrating trauma
to the abdomen.

216
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,645
He arrested as soon
as we took him off the rig.

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,813
Let's get him into trauma one,
and page Karev!

218
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,386
On it!

219
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,049
I know everyone wants to help,
but back up.

220
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:45,166
Give them room to work.

221
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:46,785
Dr. Karev to the E.R.

222
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,053
Dr. Karev to the E.R.

223
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,455
We got one alive.
There could be more.

224
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,057
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

225
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:54,659
There could be more.

226
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:56,127
There could be more.

227
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,962
There could be more.

228
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:02,167
Three rigs pulling in now
with more right behind them.

229
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,134
They don't know how many,

230
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,663
but they'll bring
as much as we can handle.

231
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:06,004
We've got live ones
coming in, people,

232
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,344
and we want them
to stay that way.

233
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,247
We need surgical trays
by each trauma bed,

234
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,643
and reserve "o" neg on standby!

235
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,778
There's always more.

236
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,081
Uh.

237
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:20,084
I-I know. Look, I am sorry.

238
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,687
I was on my way to the hotel,
but we crashed the O.R. floor.

239
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:23,521
It was too big just to...

240
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,523
I'm not here
to haul you out of here.

241
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:26,324
I'm here to help.

242
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,159
I'm looking
for a pair of scrubs.

243
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,094
This.

244
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,397
This is reason number 537

245
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,866
why you and I are made
for one another.

246
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,934
Mmm!

247
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:36,740
Mwah!

248
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,829
Surgery is sexy, honey.

249
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,231
- Mmm.
- It's hot.

250
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,599
Yes, it is.

251
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,901
And tonight,
on our wedding night...

252
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:43,820
Mm-hmm?

253
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,639
Dr. Webber,
I'm gonna show you just how hot

254
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,841
a morning surgery can make me.

255
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:50,642
Mm.

256
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,578
There are people dying.

257
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:56,581
You are so uptight
for a best man.

258
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,021
Now, don't worry.
You're not off the hook.

259
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:06,205
Good. I've never been
anybody's best man before.

260
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,461
You know they're appointing
a new chief soon.

261
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:11,094
I'm recommending you.

262
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:14,199
Unless you don't want it.

263
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,003
No, j... I've just heard you
say this once before.

264
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,585
About the board seat.

265
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,807
But then I find out
it'd been given to Alex Karev.

266
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,475
You're like the chief
who cried wolf.

267
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,779
Who's on the board now,
you or Karev?

268
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,614
Dr. Teller, extension 2219.

269
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,383
Dr. Teller, extension 2219.

270
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,184
Heel, ducklings! Heel!

271
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:35,287
34year-old pregnant female

272
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,489
with prolonged extrication
from a crushed vehicle.

273
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:38,490
Her name is Joan Paulson.

274
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:40,892
She's 40 weeks pregnant
and in active labor.

275
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:41,860
BP's 100 over 60.

276
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,862
She's been complaining
of severe neck pain

277
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:45,897
and an obvious fracture of her right arm.
And who are you?

278
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:46,865
I'm Andrew. Sorry.

279
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,733
I was on my way into work.
I saw the collapse.

280
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:49,734
I stopped to help.

281
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,570
We've got to go back!
We've got to go back!

282
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:52,804
Well, we've got it
from here, sir.

283
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm a doctor.
Actually a surgeon.

284
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:56,908
Her contractions
are five minutes apart.

285
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,845
- Her husband's still trapped in the car.
- Let's page O.B.!

286
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,381
You've got to get Keith out!

287
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,050
Please, you've got to go back
and get him out!

288
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,251
Hey, don't you worry,
okay, Joan?

289
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,319
Just need to focus on keeping

290
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,087
- you and your baby healthy.
- All right, thank you.

291
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,489
That was urban
search and rescue.

292
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:11,723
They have a victim
they can't extract.

293
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:12,891
They need us to send a team.

294
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,593
Who's on
the field rotation list?

295
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,862
Uh, we've got Pierce,
Shepherd, Kepner, and Grey.

296
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,578
No, Grey hasn't
been cleared yet, sir.

297
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:19,364
I'll sub in for Grey.

298
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:20,732
And leave everything
going on here?

299
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,100
It's a mass casualty.

300
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:23,201
Grey!

301
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,369
You need me?

302
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:26,071
We're sending a team on-site.

303
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:26,938
You've been cleared.
Go get ready.

304
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,874
She's still supposed to be
supervised.

305
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,609
She had a year off.

306
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:31,877
You can't give her
special treatment just 'cause

307
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:32,911
something bad's happened to her.

308
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,347
- You can't spoil her like that.
- The hell I can't.

309
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,622
Dr. Sanders, 1524.
Dr. Sanders, 1524.

310
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:44,689
Oh! Ow! Careful!

311
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,391
We're looking for our friend!
Are you a doctor?

312
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,559
One at a time.

313
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:48,693
His name's Scott. He's 17.

314
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:49,728
Uh, he was in the backseat

315
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,996
when this huge piece of cement
came down and...

316
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,565
he was really messed up. They
took him away in an ambulance.

317
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,600
We just got here.
We're not even from Seattle.

318
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,435
Okay.
Uh, where are your parents?

319
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,803
Back home. In Missoula.

320
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,038
They didn't come with us.

321
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,107
Our parents let us do stuff.
We don't get in much trouble.

322
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,309
- We're...
- Dorks.

323
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:06,379
We're supposed to be touring U.W.
Right now.

324
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:06,959
Wilson!

325
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:09,296
We could use some more hands
on our kid in trauma one.

326
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,750
- Is he talking about Scott?
- He's not gonna die, right?

327
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,114
Is that Scott?

328
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:18,590
V-fib.

329
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:21,993
Push an amp of epi.
Charge to 150. Paddles!

330
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:23,795
Wilson, get in
here and help bag! Clear!

331
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,772
- Fetal monitor is on. O.B. Is coming.
- And we should get ortho

332
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,006
to take a look
at her arm and her neck.

333
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,674
- On it!
- Right away! I will!

334
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,975
My baby. Is my baby okay?

335
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,344
Baby's looking just fine, Joan.
Heart rate's right on target.

336
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:41,313
Dr. Edwards, is it true

337
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:42,514
that the fetus
can be compromised

338
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:43,982
if the patient
is in the supine position?

339
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,584
The fetus is compromised?

340
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:46,952
Out. I'm sorry, did you mean...

341
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,687
Out!
This is not question time.

342
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,655
All of you,
just go to radiology.

343
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,157
Check on the reads.
I will call you if I need you.

344
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,092
- Where is radiolog...
- Scram!

345
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,761
The contractions
started this morning.

346
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,697
The doctor said
we could take our time,

347
00:12:58,731 --> 00:12:59,864
but I wanted to leave.

348
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,033
I made Keith
take the stupid tunnel!

349
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,494
He wanted to take the bridge,

350
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,869
but I said the tunnel
was faster.

351
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,438
I'm constantly telling him
what to do.

352
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,939
How long have you two
been married, Joan?

353
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:09,007
We're not married.

354
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,610
We met each other
nine months and three days ago.

355
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,645
I barely knew him.

356
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,181
It's crazy
what you find out about a person

357
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:18,323
when you get knocked up
on the first date.

358
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,518
We're gonna get married
next week.

359
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,854
Please tell me

360
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,823
we're getting married next week.

361
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,532
Get some water over here.

362
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,533
Over here!

363
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,403
And tape, bandages,
and a splint.

364
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:40,972
Will someone call my husband?

365
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,474
I need my husband!

366
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,842
Help me! Help me!

367
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:44,676
Okay, all right.
Calm down.

368
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,910
Please! Please!
Tell me your name.

369
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,746
He's 10 years old.

370
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,913
T-shirt and jeans.

371
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:49,848
- He was in the backseat?
- Yes.

372
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:51,716
Ma'am,
can you follow my finger?

373
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,884
His name is Tyler.

374
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,185
Stay with me, okay?

375
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,186
Help us.

376
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,658
You the surgeons
from Grey-Sloan?

377
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,892
We are. Where's the patient?

378
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,694
- This way.
- We're gonna help you.

379
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,362
What's his name?

380
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,263
Keith.

381
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:06,598
Gardner.

382
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,566
We got one. He's still alive.

383
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:11,870
My ear...
I can't hear anything!

384
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:13,038
Help!

385
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:17,342
Car's been crushed by debris.

386
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,576
We got his wife out, but...

387
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:20,078
- Oh, my God.
- He's in there?

388
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,047
- He's alive?
- Barely.

389
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,014
Back on the truck.

390
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,749
Ohh!

391
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:31,623
All right,
come on, you guys.

392
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,224
We're gonna get you out,
buddy. don't worry.

393
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,565
Hey, Keith.
My name is Meredith.

394
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,867
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

395
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,636
That'd be great.

396
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,205
How do we even start?

397
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,074
We just do.

398
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:01,252
The door's coming off!

399
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,898
I'm looking for my wife.

400
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:04,922
Please!

401
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,624
- There.
- She's good.

402
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,192
I need some more lap pads
in here.

403
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,694
You got it, doc.
Here you go.

404
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,696
Keith, can you follow my light
with your eyes?

405
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,197
My fiance, Joan,
she was with me.

406
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,031
Is she okay?

407
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,467
We saw her arrive
at the hospital.

408
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,301
She's alive.

409
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,737
Okay. Okay. Good.

410
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:21,472
She made it there. She's alive.

411
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,207
I need some packing!

412
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,742
Do you know
w-we're having a-a baby?

413
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,277
Keith, we're trying to listen
to your breathing.

414
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,112
Stop talking, please.

415
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:30,448
It's hard to hear
breath sounds out here,

416
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:31,482
but he could have
a collapsed lung.

417
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,818
How's his abdomen?

418
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,221
Lot of blood,
from what I can see.

419
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,889
Keith, I'm just gonna check
your torso, okay?

420
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,628
He's impaled in two places.

421
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,163
It's pretty bad, huh?

422
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,099
It's pretty bad.

423
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,451
But I've seen worse.

424
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,073
Okay.

425
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:57,441
Make sure
you got that crushed leg.

426
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,437
Call respiratory
for bed two,

427
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,013
and get a repeat crit
on bed eight.

428
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,378
- Thanks.
- Uh, Dr. Hunt.

429
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,117
- Yeah?
- Hi. Uh, I'm Andrew Deluca.

430
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,152
Oh, right. You came in
with the pregnant woman.

431
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,187
Yes. Uh, is there any paperwork
I should fill out or...?

432
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,222
You can do it later

433
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,823
if you're good to just jump in
and keep helping.

434
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,593
Of course. Sure.

435
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,361
- Oh, God, there's another one!
- Okay. Keep breathing. Nice and slow.

436
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:19,530
Edwards, nice job
reducing the wrist.

437
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,735
Uh, actually Dr. Deluca did
that in the field.

438
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,875
- Dr. who?
- Me. Hi. Dr. Deluca.

439
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,686
He was at the scene.
Paramedics ran out of splints,

440
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:28,172
- so that's actually my tie.
- Was your tie. Sorry.

441
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:30,107
Eh, it's not a problem.
It was my favorite one, though.

442
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:32,109
- Oh, God!
- All right. Three centimeters dilated.

443
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,011
Look, she has a fracture
at c5-6.

444
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:35,392
What's a c5-6?

445
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,480
Joan, you fractured

446
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:38,449
a bone in your neck,
but it is stable for now,

447
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,504
so we will fix it
after you deliver, okay?

448
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,543
Keep her in the collar
until her labs come back,

449
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:43,945
then we'll get her upstairs
so she can deliver,

450
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,285
- and repair the fracture.
- Got it.

451
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,563
Have them
page me when her contractions

452
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,524
- become more frequent, okay?
- All right.

453
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,194
Thank you so much for your help.

454
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,129
It was my pleasure.

455
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:54,899
He's losing blood faster
than we can put it in him.

456
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,319
We should get him upstairs.

457
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,802
We need to open his chest.
Glove me.

458
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:58,669
Crack his chest and then what?

459
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:00,204
That still might not
buy us enough time

460
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,036
to get to the O.R.
and fix his injuries.

461
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,905
Then we stop time.

462
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,477
- How?
- Put him on bypass, drain out all of

463
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,979
his blood and replace it with cold saline,
and then we operate.

464
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:09,780
Can you do that?

465
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:11,749
No, he can't.
That's way too risky.

466
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,484
We put him
in suspended animation,

467
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:14,585
cooling him from inside out...

468
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,920
his brain, his heart,
his organs.

469
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,755
- That buys us an hour or two.
- Hunt!

470
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,323
Ten blade.

471
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,200
Dr. Miguel... Dr. Miguel.

472
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,301
How's it going out there?

473
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:32,670
Um, they're coming in faster
than we can treat them.

474
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:33,671
Mm.

475
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:35,239
Um, listen, Catherine...

476
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,774
I-I-I hate to say this,

477
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,065
but, you know,
under the circumstances,

478
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:42,179
do you think
we should postpone the wedding?

479
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:43,214
I already did.

480
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:46,016
My assistant is notifying
our guests as we speak.

481
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,085
Oh. You're sure you don't mind?

482
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,795
Of course I mind.

483
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,048
But we both know
where we need to be.

484
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:55,827
Hey, uh, chief. Uh, we need you.

485
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:56,807
You can't just say

486
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,229
"suspended animation"
like it's a real thing.

487
00:17:58,263 --> 00:17:59,763
It's science fiction.

488
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:01,265
It's called emergency
preservation and resuscitation.

489
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,101
Trauma programs have been
discussing it for years.

490
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,903
It's a way to save patients
who can't make it to an O.R.

491
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,038
Yeah, a risky way,
an irresponsible way.

492
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,441
'Cause the safe option is to keep
transfusing him and race him upstairs.

493
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:11,295
How do you do it?

494
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,410
Well, we cannulate
the aorta, drain out his blood,

495
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:14,311
infuse cold saline,

496
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:16,080
then drop his core temp
to 50 degrees.

497
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:17,114
You put him in hibernation?

498
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,316
You replace his entire
blood volume with ice water.

499
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,118
You're gonna do what to him?

500
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,287
Get her out of here.
So you induce hypothermia.

501
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,922
Hold on. We're not gonna
consciously kill a kid over

502
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:27,252
something you discuss over beers with your
trauma buddies.

503
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,175
Kid's gonna die anyway.

504
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,628
At least this way we can try
to bring him back. I say do it.

505
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:31,896
No. It's way too experimental.

506
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,397
And we would need Pierce.
She's at the site.

507
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:34,431
This is not a cardio procedure.

508
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,300
It is if you can't get
his heart beating again!

509
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,578
What are you gonna do if you
can't get him back after bypass?

510
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:40,625
What then?

511
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,073
That's why we don't do things
like this on a whim.

512
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,676
- This is not a whim. This is a hail Mary.
- On a child?

513
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,745
The patient is a minor.
We don't have consent.

514
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:50,262
By the time you find
the parents, it'll be too late.

515
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,982
I agree with Jackson.

516
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:52,950
It's a no, hunt.

517
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:55,185
We're wasting time
having this conversation.

518
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:01,325
Okay. We only need
two physicians to give consent. Karev?

519
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,661
Really? That's how
you want to play this?

520
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,362
In.

521
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,730
Webber?

522
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:09,967
Chief?

523
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:12,436
Just do it.

524
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,203
I need a cannula!

525
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:18,342
Too many people have died today.

526
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,477
We're not adding this kid
to the list.

527
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,771
- How's his airway?
- His sats are okay.

528
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,674
There's definitely blood
in his chest on the left side.

529
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,984
- Meredith, can you get the packing in?
- I'm trying.

530
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,945
I can't really reach it
from this angle.

531
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,381
Uh, I need some more trauma pads

532
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,983
and cellulose polymer, please.

533
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,117
What's going on?

534
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,518
Whenever I press on the wound,

535
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,378
blood is flowing
out of his abdomen.

536
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:46,455
The metal is tamponading it,

537
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,190
but it's not going to last
very long.

538
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,958
And he needs surgery soon.

539
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:52,627
If he doesn't suffocate
on his blood first.

540
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,463
I got to get a chest tube
in here.

541
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,031
Do you have access?

542
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,466
No. Maybe.

543
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,800
We have to get him out of there.

544
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:00,369
What about from the other side
of the car?

545
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,237
I could be your other hand?

546
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,851
Yeah.

547
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,641
Do you really think
that you can get me out of here?

548
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:08,343
I have to.
You said it yourself...

549
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:10,645
you're having a baby.

550
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,381
Do you have kids?

551
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,548
I have three.

552
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,372
Wow, three.
One is freaking me out.

553
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:22,357
We did it backwards,
though, you know?

554
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,138
Y-you meet someone,
you, uh, fall in love,

555
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,829
get married, have a kid...

556
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:29,698
it gets bigger, right?

557
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:33,602
Joan and I, we... we did
this huge thing first.

558
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:38,760
"We're, uh, having a baby.
Nice to meet you."

559
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,610
We're still getting to know
each other,

560
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,245
learning
all these little things.

561
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,679
It's good stuff.

562
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:48,550
She, uh...
sleeps with her socks on.

563
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,219
We like... we like
watching tennis...

564
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,521
Get me a stethoscope.

565
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,022
But not playing.

566
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,357
She likes techno.

567
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,758
Would have been a deal-breaker,

568
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:59,694
but we got this big, huge
baby thing coming, so...

569
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,035
I really...

570
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,405
I-I really love
all her little things.

571
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,140
It's like I'm home.

572
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,042
She's like my home.

573
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:18,046
I should really tell her that.

574
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,506
Right?

575
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:25,387
Come on, guys!

576
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,227
I got it.

577
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,096
I should...

578
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,163
Hey!

579
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,631
- Slow down!
- I'm sorry.

580
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,317
What is in your mouth?

581
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:40,786
A brie tart.

582
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,138
With prosciutto.

583
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,906
Brie? Brie!

584
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:49,344
Um, there are patients here
that had chunks of cement

585
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:51,146
fall on them
during their morning commute.

586
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,239
But, please, have some brie.

587
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:56,751
While carrying lab samples.

588
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:57,786
That's nasty.

589
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,454
What's the matter with you?

590
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,191
Oh. Where'd you get this?

591
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,029
It looks wonderful.
What the...

592
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:09,664
Did you try this?

593
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:10,866
I'll try that.

594
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,434
No, yeah. It's vegetarian.

595
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:13,602
Oh, hey.

596
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,704
I heard Catherine Avery had
all the food from the wedding

597
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:18,273
sent here, you know, for the
staff, and I have two minutes.

598
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:19,986
How many sliders do you think I could
eat in two minutes?

599
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:20,823
Is that Pesto?

600
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,844
Do you think that Catherine's
gonna help pick the new chief?

601
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,279
I mean,
why wouldn't hunt just do it?

602
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,180
I don't, um...

603
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:27,682
God, it would save us
so much trouble.

604
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:29,651
The 12-page resumes
and the phone calls

605
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:31,119
and the polite vetting and...

606
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,854
Who would want to be chief?
Would you?

607
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,556
I...well, I had...

608
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,724
Are you asking?

609
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:37,659
Hunt should just do it, right?

610
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,095
Oh.

611
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:44,699
Those crab cakes
look really good.

612
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,868
But I don't want to make
a pig of myself.

613
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,371
Exactly what
I was thinking... exactly.

614
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:52,174
Well, yes.

615
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,443
Yes, I would like to be chief.

616
00:22:58,614 --> 00:22:59,814
I know.

617
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,016
Did you get ahold
of Scott's parents?

618
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,050
Not yet.

619
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,585
We left messages. We're trying.

620
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,387
I mean, they should know
that you're killing their son.

621
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,222
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah.

622
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,724
- We have some questions.
- From our research, we think this plan

623
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,493
is completely untried
and... and experimental.

624
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:13,028
- Your research?
- You're trying

625
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:15,830
suspended animation
through induced hypothermia.

626
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:18,500
- So you heard Dr. Hunt.
- It's basically science fiction.

627
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:19,768
It's still undergoing
clinical trials,

628
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:21,169
and there's
no documentation suggesting

629
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:22,571
that this will work on humans.

630
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,713
Whoa, whoa. Where did you
get this research?

631
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:35,051
Dr. Hunt, this procedure's
only been successful on pigs?

632
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,151
Wait, what?

633
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:37,752
It wasn't successful on humans?

634
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:39,020
It hasn't been tried on humans.

635
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,890
They've started trials, but
they have no outcomes. Not yet.

636
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,458
Core temp's down to 55.

637
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,860
- Where are you getting this?
- Those kids. His friends.

638
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:47,229
You said there were techniques
that were developed

639
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:48,597
and the studies were published.

640
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,632
The animal studies
have had incredibly success.

641
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,434
And the technique
has to start somewhere.

642
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:55,403
I can name 30 soldiers
this technique would have saved.

643
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:56,805
So you want to try it
on a high-school kid

644
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,473
without parental consent?

645
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:00,208
You better pray this works.

646
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,311
Even if we resuscitate him,
he could end up brain-dead.

647
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,680
His core temp's down to 53.

648
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:07,716
It doesn't matter now.

649
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,850
We're doing it. We've done it.

650
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:11,086
- So either get on board or get out.
- Karev is right.

651
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,088
Anybody who doesn't
want to be part of this

652
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,124
is welcome to leave.

653
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:17,559
I'll stay.

654
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,631
We're there.
Core temp's 50 degrees.

655
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:23,798
Okay. He's cold.

656
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,001
We have an hour,
90 minutes, tops.

657
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:26,668
We ready?

658
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,870
Start the clock. Scalpel.

659
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:40,749
I said no.

660
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:41,916
I know what you said.

661
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:43,752
If anything goes wrong
in that O.R.,

662
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,620
it jeopardizes
our entire surgical program.

663
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,755
It could be the boy's only hope.

664
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,424
I don't need you to defend
the technique to me, Richard.

665
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,992
I need you to follow orders.

666
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:51,960
Orders?

667
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:54,262
- I'm an owner in this hospital.
- I am, too.

668
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:56,364
But I'm also the chief.
It's my call.

669
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,099
You mean interim chief.

670
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:08,109
That boy had no chance.
We're giving him one.

671
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:10,111
I don't feel bad about that.

672
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:13,882
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another surgery.

673
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,056
We can't tell where
Keith ends and the door begins.

674
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,691
If we use the jaws of life
to get him out,

675
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,995
it'll rip him to shreds. He'll bleed to
death in seconds.

676
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:28,163
What about trying an ex-lap?
Then we can try to separate...

677
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,065
We're not sterile.
There's no blood bank.

678
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,200
- This is not a controlled environment.
- I know. I know. I know.

679
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:34,169
We could put a
balloon catheter into his aorta.

680
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:36,338
- It could buy us some time.
- If we were closer to the hospital,

681
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:37,906
I would
say maybe, but we're 25 minutes out.

682
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,040
- He'll never make it.
- Okay, what if...

683
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:41,376
he's a black tag, guys.

684
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,079
We can't do anything else for him.

685
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:53,021
Then I'm calling it.

686
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:56,091
We're gonna cut him out.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

687
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:01,096
- You should go.
- No, we can stay and help...

688
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,865
I'll stay. You go save people that
you can save.

689
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,665
I'll do what I can for him.

690
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,006
Okay, Keith.

691
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,609
We're gonna cut you
out of there now, all right?

692
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:16,511
Sure thing.

693
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,027
Uh, Joan, Dr. Edwards asked us to take you
to the O.R. now.

694
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,257
Okay?

695
00:26:34,277 --> 00:26:35,486
We can do that,

696
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,432
because we know
exactly where that is.

697
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:39,934
I knew our first day would be intense.

698
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,359
I figured we might get to watch
some stuff or start an I.V.,

699
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:45,540
but there was a mass casualty today.

700
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:46,574
I've never seen
so many mangled people,

701
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,276
so many dead people.

702
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,980
Doctors from this hospital just spent hours
in the field

703
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:53,281
trying to extract a guy.

704
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:55,157
Hours. That's gonna be us some day.

705
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,031
Did they get him out?
The guy?

706
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:59,053
Huh? Oh, no, I don't think so.

707
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:00,155
I heard he was too far gone.

708
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:01,756
Can't breathe.

709
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,324
So they just left him there?

710
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,326
Ah! Got it. I can't breathe.

711
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:06,995
I can't breathe. Let me out.

712
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,763
- What? O-okay. I-is it the collar?
- I need this off.

713
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,031
- I need to... I need to get out.
- Okay. I-I can loosen it.

714
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,066
- N-not much, but maybe... maybe a little.
- I need to get out.

715
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:13,835
- Should you do that? I-I don't...
- They left Keith.

716
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,403
They left Keith.
He's gone!

717
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:16,738
No, don't!

718
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:22,010
There's a shock through my body.
What's happening?

719
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:24,012
We need to stabilize her spine.

720
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:26,014
Um, help me reduce
her dislocation.

721
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,982
I'll hold her steady
and you attach the tongs.

722
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:29,584
- What, me?
- Yeah, I got her. Go.

723
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:30,752
If we hurry, maybe we can
save her from total paralysis.

724
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:32,130
But I-I can't.

725
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,071
I mean, I-I could try,
but I don't think it's the best idea.

726
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:36,788
- What do you mean? Just attach...
- I don't know how to do it.

727
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,627
Why? 'Cause I'm just an intern.

728
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,163
Okay? Today's my first day.
I was late.

729
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:43,676
I was on my way here. I saw
the tunnel collapse.

730
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,395
What?

731
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:45,667
Well, you...

732
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,502
What? What? You're an intern?

733
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:01,942
Maybe if we...

734
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:04,247
It wouldn't have worked.

735
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,714
Yeah. No.

736
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:09,550
He didn't have a chance.
It was the right call.

737
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,586
Huh.

738
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,523
What?

739
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:20,594
We're on the third floor.

740
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,897
- What'd I do?
- Wiggle your toes for me, Joan.

741
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:24,632
I can't.
I can't feel anything...

742
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,799
not even my contractions.

743
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,668
- What did you do?
- Am I paralyzed?

744
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:29,770
We're working very, very hard to prevent
that, but I need you to stay calm.

745
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,555
Can I do something?

746
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,287
You can go stand
over there with the interns, intern.

747
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,397
What the hell happened in here?

748
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,610
She dislocated
her fracture at c56. I'm decompressing.

749
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,707
Okay. Baby's got decels. All right.
I'm getting the first five-pound bag.

750
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,482
- How the hell did she dislocate?
- Uh, she was having trouble breathing.

751
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:42,950
I-I-I thought it was the collar.

752
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,130
Get out!

753
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,020
Okay. I need to get this baby
out of here.

754
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:48,022
- Let's get her up to the O.R.
- All of you out now.

755
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,615
So, if this works,
they're gonna do this in the army?

756
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:56,630
Absolutely.

757
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:57,531
We should go.

758
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:00,301
We should take a year,
do the program.

759
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,356
We'd spend our time doing
things like this all the time.

760
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,737
It would be amazing.

761
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:04,972
You're in the middle
of your residency.

762
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,508
Well, I'll take a research year.
We could have an adventure.

763
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:08,676
Not looking for an adventure.

764
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,843
Oh, crap.

765
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,346
- What is it?
- It's an infra-renal IVC injury. Damn it!

766
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,641
- How long's it gonna take to fix?
- I don't know, about 30 minutes?

767
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:16,093
We don't have that.

768
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,052
Okay, he can live without it.
Just ligate it.

769
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:19,320
- Got it.
- Oh, silk ties.

770
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:22,456
There was a mass casualty today.

771
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,486
They needed us
back here at the hospital.

772
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,074
I know, but maybe
there was still something

773
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:27,928
- that we could've...
- We did everything we can do.

774
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:29,330
Why are you second-guessing?

775
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:30,364
I'm just saying that maybe...

776
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,932
I was willing to try an ex-lap.

777
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,367
Oh, my God, would you shut up

778
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:35,369
about the stupid ex-lap?
That is not the point!

779
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:38,372
No. No, the point is that
maybe we should have stayed.

780
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,607
Maybe we didn't try everything

781
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:41,409
we possibly could have
to save him.

782
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:42,772
We were all there.

783
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:44,345
We all saw that car.

784
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:46,447
And there's a difference
between knowing

785
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,949
when you can
realistically save someone

786
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:50,251
and when it's time to walk away.

787
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:52,386
And when is that, Meredith?

788
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,754
When is that point?

789
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:56,057
When do you look
at a horrible, sad situation

790
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:58,292
and decide that you are ready
to turn your back on it?

791
00:29:58,327 --> 00:29:59,226
I'm curious.

792
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,429
I'm curious how you make
those decisions...

793
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:04,031
you specifically.

794
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,767
When are you okay
making the call

795
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:09,203
that someone
no longer has any chance?

796
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:11,706
How... how do you look around
and decide that?

797
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,874
When do you decide
that you should walk away?

798
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,343
Dr. Shepherd?

799
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:17,566
Dr. Edwards says she needs you in trauma
two right away.

800
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:18,943
I'm Dr. Shepherd.

801
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,481
Oh, sorry.

802
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:23,451
Dr. Edwards says
she needs you right away.

803
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:26,654
She wasn't... um... I...

804
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:29,710
They need you upstairs. Go.

805
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:34,462
Core temp's 98.6 degrees.

806
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,396
No pulse.

807
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,064
Heart should be
beating by now.

808
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,766
We're way over time.
The IVC repair...

809
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,900
He'll come back.

810
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:41,102
Come on, Scott.

811
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:43,304
If we lost him...

812
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,272
What the hell did you people do?

813
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:48,743
We put him in hibernation,
and we're bringing him back out.

814
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,444
Are we?

815
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:14,969
Okay. Let's get him off bypass.

816
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:22,710
We got a heartbeat.

817
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:24,145
The boy's reviving.

818
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,313
I'm thrilled to hear it.

819
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:27,348
I made the right call.

820
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:29,183
Talk to me when we see

821
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:31,018
what kind of brain function
he wakes up with.

822
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,454
Thinking like that would have
left that boy dead on the table.

823
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:35,556
I can assure you
that your successor

824
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,491
will be nowhere near
so cavalier.

825
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,059
I'll make certain of that
when I choose the next chief.

826
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:39,927
Oh, when you choose?

827
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:41,265
Well, it's not up to you,
Catherine.

828
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:43,297
It's a board decision.
We'll see about that.

829
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:45,166
You can't just come in here
and think you can...

830
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,168
I don't need you to tell me
how this hospital works.

831
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,536
I've seen plenty of that today.

832
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,349
Dr. Thompson to oncology.

833
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:04,351
Dr. Thompson to oncology.

834
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,357
I'm sorry about leaving
the patient there.

835
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:11,997
I didn't want to leave him
there, either.

836
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:14,764
And I am sorry for not talking
to you about the house.

837
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:16,530
You don't talk to me
about a lot of things.

838
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:18,499
And you're mad at me
for going away,

839
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,497
- and I am sorry about that.
- That's not...

840
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:23,637
I mean, I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't exist.

841
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,873
You know,
I looked around at that house,

842
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:28,876
and my kids, our kids...
I couldn't breathe.

843
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,344
You didn't call me.

844
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:32,546
I didn't call anyone.
I needed time.

845
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,289
I am a neurosurgeon.
I could have saved him.

846
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:37,510
- And you didn't call me.
- Amelia...

847
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,286
Who contacted you first?

848
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:43,506
The police? The paramedics?

849
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:46,293
How far away was the hospital?

850
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:47,928
How long were you sitting there

851
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:50,231
waiting for them
to declare him brain-dead?

852
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:55,102
How many hours later was it
before I was even informed?

853
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:58,572
How many chances did you have
when you could have called me?

854
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,307
Why didn't you call me?

855
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:03,224
There wasn't anything
you could've done.

856
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:04,778
He was too far gone.

857
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:07,214
- You don't know that. You don't know.
- Yes, I do.

858
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:09,483
What if I could've helped him?
What if I had a chance?

859
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,452
I pull off miracles
for a living.

860
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:14,223
I have proven that I can reverse
the impossible.

861
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,457
I should have been there.

862
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,926
If I had seen him
or treated him...

863
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,494
It was too late.

864
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:22,897
By the time they...

865
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,567
It was too late.

866
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:30,157
How could you do it?

867
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:34,975
How could you unplug him
without letting me know?

868
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,078
I didn't get to see him.

869
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:40,472
I didn't get to tell him
goodbye.

870
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:42,583
I thought you would've
at least given me

871
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:44,518
the courtesy and the respect

872
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,754
when my own brother was dying.

873
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:55,056
I didn't get to tell him
goodbye...

874
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,298
because of you.

875
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:19,687
Damn it!

876
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:10,901
Hey. Sorry about the wedding.

877
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:14,338
Oh, no.
It was the right idea to cancel.

878
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:18,209
Postpone you mean. Right?

879
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,407
The odds aren't in my favor,
Miranda.

880
00:35:20,427 --> 00:35:22,690
You know,
I've tried this before.

881
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,254
And failed.

882
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:25,883
Twice.

883
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,418
Well, it always comes

884
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:29,887
between choosing
between the woman and the work.

885
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:30,755
And when pressed, I...

886
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:32,223
You choose the work.

887
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,692
Yeah. You'd think I'd learn
at some point.

888
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:37,734
Sounds like you have.

889
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:39,935
You just need to be okay
with it.

890
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:43,200
But with Catherine and me,
it's already been a problem,

891
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:45,236
and it's still
gonna be a problem.

892
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,938
I'm not sure
I want to go down the road

893
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,902
if it's gonna go nowhere.

894
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,918
Carefully.

895
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,386
Carefully.

896
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,754
Okay. All right.
You're doing great, Joan.

897
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,989
Deep breaths.

898
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,026
What is it? Talk to us, Joan.

899
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:12,029
I feel something.

900
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,030
In my fingers.

901
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,330
- Okay.
- Good.

902
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,398
- That means the traction's working.
- And in my toes!

903
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:21,372
Oh, thank God. I can...
I can feel my legs again.

904
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,311
Oh, my... oh, my God!

905
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,245
Oh, my God.

906
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,947
I can feel everything.

907
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,615
Oh, my God!

908
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,783
She's having a contraction.

909
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,986
All right, Joan.
Joan I know it hurts,

910
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:37,655
but you have to keep still, okay?

911
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:39,990
We need to prevent your neck
from dislocating again.

912
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:48,481
You were right today.

913
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:50,516
I was taking a big risk.

914
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:53,452
You were lucky today.

915
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:54,505
Really lucky.

916
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,044
I understand.

917
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:58,576
Is Kepner back yet
from the tunnel?

918
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,089
I don't know.

919
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,005
I don't know much
about her lately.

920
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,452
She's... different

921
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,222
since she came back
from her training with you.

922
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:13,458
And I'm glad
that she found something

923
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:15,492
that makes her this happy,

924
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:17,495
I guess.

925
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:21,099
But it's weird.

926
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:25,236
We're just not
on the same page anymore.

927
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,572
Ever, it seems.

928
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:32,477
It happens...
more than you think.

929
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:36,481
You go away, you come back.
The world has shifted.

930
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:41,219
Things that made sense once
don't anymore.

931
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:46,079
You heard that I'm resigning
as chief?

932
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,397
Give her time.

933
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:54,132
That's all you can do.

934
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,070
That's the face
you're gonna make?

935
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,104
The kid's alive.

936
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,639
I don't want to have this fight.

937
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:03,241
- What fight?
- This fight.

938
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:04,642
This "I told you so" fight.

939
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,677
This thing where
this insane surgery works,

940
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:08,312
and then you get back
on this army thing,

941
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:10,481
and then I tell you you're not
going, and then you get pissed.

942
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:12,683
You're gonna tell me
what I can and can't do?

943
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:14,485
You do that,
I'm gonna be more than pissed.

944
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,320
You know what? Screw it.
You want to go, then go.

945
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,523
What's your problem?
It sounded interesting.

946
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:19,624
And for a minute, I thought

947
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:21,826
it could be something that
we'd do together... why not?

948
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,461
I have worked
really freaking hard

949
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:24,796
to get to where
I'm at right now.

950
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,264
I have finally found my place,

951
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:27,298
and it's at this hospital

952
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:28,633
doing this job
with these people.

953
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:29,700
Alex, I'm...

954
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:30,802
Last year was crap.

955
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:32,703
And now Mer is... i-i-is home,

956
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,539
and I finally feel like
things are back.

957
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:36,674
I don't need to go anywhere.
I don't want to.

958
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,376
I've put roots down here.

959
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,445
I've never put roots down
anywhere.

960
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,219
I'm not walking away,
not from this.

961
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,229
If you want to go, then go.
I can't stop you.

962
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,716
It's your life.
Do what you want.

963
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,381
Go join the freaking army.

964
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,043
You're almost there, Joan.
Almost there!

965
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:57,009
Uh, hey, guys...

966
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:01,866
Okay. She's crowning.

967
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,568
She was only six centimeters.

968
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,636
I need to... need to push
one more time.

969
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,672
This baby's coming now.
Edwards, hold her steady.

970
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:09,874
Occupied!

971
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:11,175
Occupied!

972
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:18,983
Dr. Guillaume.
Dr. Guillaume.

973
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:20,548
Hey.

974
00:39:21,787 --> 00:39:23,387
I needed to ask you something,

975
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:25,690
but I didn't want to

976
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:27,158
because I knew you'd say yes.

977
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,753
Then don't ask.

978
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,344
I went away.
I pressed pause on my life.

979
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,726
And I really needed that.

980
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:39,003
But since I've been back,
I just... I can't unpause.

981
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:42,540
I just can't get things
going again.

982
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:46,577
I go home every night
to my house and it's...

983
00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:49,846
It's not my house.
It was mine and Derek's house.

984
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,616
And now he's gone,

985
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,785
and it really just feels
like a house.

986
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,369
I came back, but I'm not home.

987
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:59,757
And I really want to be home.

988
00:40:01,886 --> 00:40:04,428
Can the kids and I come and stay
with you for a while?

989
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:06,807
Yeah. No big deal.

990
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,466
Well, you better check
with Wilson

991
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,767
because you know how she gets.

992
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:12,236
Trust me, I don't need
to check in with Wilson.

993
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:17,563
No.

994
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:21,145
No. Well, then,
explain it to me again.

995
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:27,486
Well, m...
uh, when did this happen?

996
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:30,221
Mom, how can you say that?

997
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,059
Okay.
You're doing great, Joan.

998
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,661
One more big push
and that should do it, okay?

999
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:37,762
I can't...

1000
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:39,630
I can't do this. I can't.

1001
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:42,333
He's supposed to be here
with me, with us, and he's gone!

1002
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,200
Joan, we know it hurts,

1003
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,802
but we need you
to keep going, okay?

1004
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:45,803
The head's out!

1005
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,609
How do you step back
into the world?

1006
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:53,411
This wasn't part of the plan.

1007
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:54,812
Joan, you did great.

1008
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:57,281
Keith was supposed to cut
the cord.

1009
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:01,018
He was supposed
to hear the first cry.

1010
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:02,486
Hold your baby.

1011
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,654
Everything is fine.

1012
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:05,756
Mom, say hello to your son.

1013
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,958
It's scary.

1014
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:10,186
This isn't how
it's supposed to be.

1015
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,692
It's not part of the plan.

1016
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:14,765
Keith should be here.

1017
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,033
Keith should be here.

1018
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,435
Keith should be here!

1019
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:20,438
Hi, baby. Time stood still...

1020
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:27,812
Mom, I have to go.
I have, um... uh...

1021
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,814
G-goodbye.

1022
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:34,685
And now it's speeding by.

1023
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,786
E.R.?

1024
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:36,988
Yep.

1025
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:40,458
I thought we'd seen
the last of it.

1026
00:41:40,492 --> 00:41:42,126
You are looking
for a lifeboat...

1027
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,727
You okay?

1028
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,292
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1029
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:46,697
Something to give you hope.

1030
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:48,699
But are you really ready

1031
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:51,135
to leave
your happy little bubble

1032
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:52,203
and step back out

1033
00:41:52,237 --> 00:41:55,873
into the big, blinding, bloody,
terrible world?

1034
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,575
I stopped them
from trying to extract him.

1035
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:58,909
I couldn't watch him bleed out.

1036
00:41:58,944 --> 00:41:59,877
You were right...

1037
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:01,579
you said if he were closer
to the hospital,

1038
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:02,580
he might have a chance.

1039
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:05,082
So let's give him a chance.

1040
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:10,921
Are you ready to achieve...

1041
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,224
The impossible?
