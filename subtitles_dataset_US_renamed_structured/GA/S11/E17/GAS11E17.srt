1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,772
<i>There's this thing I used to do
when I was a kid to my mom's VCR.</i>

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,244
<i>I'd take it apart
piece by piece,</i>

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,191
<i>then put it back together again.</i>

4
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,109
I left my phone at the lab.

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,666
By the time I
figured out I left it,

6
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,494
I was already at the
airport coming to you.

7
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:20,664
And she picked up
your phone, why?

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,220
I don't know.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,417
She probably thought it was
me. I called her from the airport,

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,541
and then she told
me she spoke to you.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,562
<i>But inevitably, there was
always a piece or two left over,</i>

12
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,831
<i>something I didn't quite
know what to do with.</i>

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,694
Is that it? Is that
everything you have to say?

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,101
That's all there is to say.

15
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,803
I've told you everything,
the whole story, all of it.

16
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,939
But if you want, I'll
go through it all again.

17
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,985
And she's your
research fellow. Yes.

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,277
Just your research fellow.

19
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,546
<i>So, what do you
do with that piece?</i>

20
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,147
Meredith.

21
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,576
I wish I could believe
you. You can. I'm here.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,601
I know how this works.

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,985
I was your resident once.

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,370
It seems like you came home

25
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:56,783
because you thought
you were in trouble.

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,172
<i>Do you try to fit it back in?</i>

27
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,608
I came home because
we're in trouble.

28
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,827
I came home to
work on this, on us.

29
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,880
I came home.

30
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,481
<i>Do you try to make it work?</i>

31
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,113
I have to get to the hospital.

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,474
Can't you get somebody to cover?

33
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,977
<i>Or do you decide you can
live without that missing piece?</i>

34
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,726
You should spend the day
with the kids. They'd love it.

35
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,990
They really miss you.

36
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,875
Who is next?

37
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:37,245
We're looking at neuropeptide
"Y" receptors in marmoset brains.

38
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,180
Great. That's... That's great.

39
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,377
Which one of you
is doing a thing

40
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,117
where you're
patch-clamping nerve cells?

41
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,918
Oh, that's me.

42
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,121
Which one of you is
"me"? What's your name?

43
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,874
Uh, Collier. Renee Collier.

44
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,810
Renee, how's it going?

45
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,612
Pretty good. How are you?

46
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,561
I mean with the research,
Renee. How's it going?

47
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:57,927
Oh... Uh, it's... It's
going pretty well.

48
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,896
A few bumps in the road,
but all things considered...

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,155
The synaptic timing discoveries
you made will help us here immensely.

50
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,657
I want to see what you're doing.

51
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,944
Oh. Sure.

52
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,092
I look forward to
working with you.

53
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,965
What do you got?

54
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,244
Seventeen-year-old with
history of biliary atresia.

55
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,201
Chronic liver rejection.

56
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,337
Uh... Waiting on donors,
but he keeps deteriorating.

57
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,639
I'm running out of ideas.

58
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,307
Let me take a look.

59
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,987
I didn't pull you out of Zola's
dance class or something, did I?

60
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,689
No, no. Derek's home, though.

61
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:44,490
Since when? Last night.

62
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,481
And this morning. And?

63
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,616
And what?

64
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,685
And do you know who
answered his phone?

65
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,665
His biliary outflow
is strictured.

66
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,339
I want to examine him myself
and get a new ultrasound.

67
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,211
Owen!

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,146
Uh... Chief.

69
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,759
Hey, Dr. Shepherd. You finished
your laminectomy in OR 2?

70
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,334
I did. Did you need...

71
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:10,839
Oh, I'm just trying to see if Bailey
can get in here for a bowel obstruction.

72
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,641
Right.

73
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,276
OR's all hers. Great.

74
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:18,863
I felt like last night's
business was left unfinished.

75
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,165
You felt that way, too?

76
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,416
Many agenda
items left unchecked.

77
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:24,752
Yeah, barely scratched
the surface, really.

78
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:26,282
I think we need a follow-up.

79
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,639
Agreed.

80
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,175
When we won't be interrupted.

81
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,446
Oh, my God.

82
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,916
Hey, how about... How about
tonight, if you're not on call?

83
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,785
I'm not.

84
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,535
Okay, then.

85
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,589
Okay.

86
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,431
Hey, Jo, I need your help.

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,679
No, I'm not letting you do
laundry at the house again.

88
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,314
Alex gets crabby when you leave
your soggy clothes in the washer.

89
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,650
Stop. I spent so much time with
Dr. Shepherd on that brain tumor

90
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,374
that I'm behind in, like,
every other specialty.

91
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,121
I just checked my
hours. I am so screwed.

92
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,379
Oh! Suddenly it's lonely
on the neuro throne.

93
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,676
Hey, Wilson, Edwards.

94
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,228
I've got a lacerated
spleen in 20 minutes,

95
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,451
and Hunt had a
personal matter come up.

96
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,631
I need someone downstairs.

97
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,815
Start with the
headache in bed three.

98
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,457
Wilson, it's yours.

99
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,091
What did I just say?

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,572
She said "headache." It's probably
neuro. I'm doing you a favor.

101
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,574
Fine. But if it's something
good, you better call me.

102
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,365
Fine.

103
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,077
I just got a page?

104
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,012
Oh, yeah. Now, I
don't want you to worry.

105
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,314
She's understandably
embarrassed,

106
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,650
so we went ahead and
put her in trauma one.

107
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,906
Richard, what are you...

108
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,185
Okay, now. She's
shaken up, okay?

109
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,709
She's got a big
bruise on her back,

110
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,745
and aside from a nasty head lac,

111
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,680
there's no evidence
of other injuries.

112
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,947
Shepherd's with her now.

113
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,261
Who are we talking about?

114
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,817
I thought they told you.

115
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,220
Mom! What happened?

116
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,117
For heaven's sake,
Owen, shut that curtain.

117
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,624
Everyone can see me.

118
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,475
Evelyn, try not to move, okay?

119
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,455
Already gave half the
neighborhood a free show

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,157
just by getting
in the ambulance.

121
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,592
She fell in the shower,
right through the glass door.

122
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:02,312
Did you slip? I told you, you
need a support bar in there.

123
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,869
Oh, those things are so ugly.

124
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,870
She said she got
dizzy. Dizziness, huh?

125
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,819
I'm not surprised with
a laceration like this.

126
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,874
You had quite a fall.

127
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,476
I think we should get a head CT.

128
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,145
She said she was dizzy before
the fall. All morning, actually.

129
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,647
Really?

130
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,310
We got this from here. Thank
you. You can step outside.

131
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,434
No, I want him to stay. John
was with me when it happened.

132
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,837
I know, Mom.

133
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,050
You've been great, thank
you. My mom's really grateful.

134
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,019
But he's done his
part now, Mom, so...

135
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,861
No, I don't mean since I fell.

136
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,581
He was with me when I fell.

137
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,864
I don't understand.

138
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,389
Well, I wasn't with
her in the shower.

139
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,242
I was... I was making us some
breakfast before I went to work.

140
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,966
Owen, I'm John.

141
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,971
As in... "John."

142
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,317
Yeah, I still don't understand.

143
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,992
Honey, John and I, we're...

144
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,326
I thought you told him.

145
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,798
Told me what?

146
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,711
Is somebody gonna tell
me what the hell is going on?

147
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,287
I think what they're
trying to say is John is...

148
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,256
your mother's boyfriend.

149
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,898
How long has this been going on?

150
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,132
She was dizzy when
she first got out of bed.

151
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,651
We thought she was
just hungry, so I...

152
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:32,740
That's not what I...

153
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,405
How long have you two been...

154
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,461
In a relationship?

155
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,880
Mom, please. Please
don't use that word.

156
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,366
Evelyn, any changes
in vision? No, dear.

157
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,712
We've been together
a little under a year.

158
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,647
A year? Dr. Webber,
what do you think?

159
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,838
More X-rays, maybe,
on her left wrist?

160
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,517
Uh... I didn't realize
she had hurt...

161
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,376
Just to be safe.

162
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,155
Sure, sure. That's a
fine idea, Shepherd.

163
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,896
Owen, John's very nice.

164
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,642
I think you two have
a lot in common.

165
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,694
She talks about you all
the time. She's so proud.

166
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,845
I'm thrilled that
we're finally meeting.

167
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:00,986
How old are you?

168
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,231
Don't be rude. Thirty-five.

169
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,833
He's young enough
to be my brother.

170
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,251
Does he have access to your
financial information, your pension fund?

171
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,275
Owen Hunt!

172
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,377
Okay, pupils are
equal and reactive.

173
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,445
This is a serious relationship.

174
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,826
But I'd still like to get that
head CT just to rule out a bleed.

175
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,261
"Serious." Sure, okay.

176
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,447
Seriously weird,
seriously misguided.

177
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,664
Not that we don't have our fun.

178
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,349
Hey, hey, hey, stay away
from her! You hear me?

179
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,622
Whoa, buddy, calm down.

180
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,442
I'm not your buddy, okay?

181
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,838
I'll be changing her passwords,
her locks, her phone number.

182
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,342
If you so much as attempt...
- Hunt!

183
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,715
Let's take a walk.

184
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,743
Let's take a walk.

185
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,102
Hey, Danny. Where's your sister?

186
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,271
Probably trying to find more
stupid stuff to cram in this room.

187
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,656
Dr. Grey, meet Danny,

188
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,603
Grey, Sloan's
resident hockey freak.

189
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,908
Nice to meet you,
Danny. Do you mind if I...

190
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:02,997
Hey, did you see
the game last night?

191
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,276
Yeah, you owe me 10 bucks.

192
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,000
Sharp had five shots on goal.

193
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,485
Yeah, and none went in.

194
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,370
Dr. Karev, any news?

195
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,574
Well, after today's scare, we
ran another set of blood tests.

196
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,588
We think he's developing
another infection.

197
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:18,157
Well, can we do the catheter
procedure again and drain the infection?

198
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,530
Well, we can try, but...

199
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,084
Actually, after looking at
Danny's scans and ultrasounds,

200
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,870
I think we could
go in surgically.

201
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,632
Could re-create the biliary tree

202
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,350
and prevent infection
from reoccurring.

203
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,708
Is that an option?

204
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,087
It's a risky one
in Danny's state.

205
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,045
I'd prefer to continue
with antibiotic therapy

206
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,664
and just keep monitoring him.

207
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:36,942
But the surgery could help Danny

208
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,278
while he's waiting
for a new liver

209
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,446
and possibly get him out
of the hospital for a while.

210
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,504
Well, I'm in. Living here sucks.

211
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,355
Well, let's not jump
into anything yet.

212
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,452
Dr. Grey and I will discuss it
before we seriously consider...

213
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,076
Well, why don't we
run some more tests,

214
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,428
and we'll let you know
what we think, okay?

215
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:56,017
So, you've had this headache
for a month with no relief?

216
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,152
Hmm, okay.

217
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,731
And where is the
headache located?

218
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,908
All over. It moves around.

219
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,925
Listen, I went to
China last month.

220
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:06,160
Is this the bird flu?

221
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,796
Or the... The... What...
What is it, the SARS?

222
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,065
It's one of those. I have
a headache all the time.

223
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,012
I get these nosebleeds.
Nosebleeds?

224
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,070
Yeah, the blood
starts to come out,

225
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,722
and then I go at it with a
tissue, and it just goes back up.

226
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,541
Huh.

227
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,875
Is that normal?

228
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,524
See, you're putting on a
mask. I've got the SARS.

229
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,147
No, this is just protocol.

230
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:31,019
Oh, hey, I see what
you're talking about.

231
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,170
Oh, God.

232
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,439
God, what?

233
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,324
That's not a nosebleed.

234
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,045
So, Dr. Avery attached the
transplanted tissue to the arm.

235
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,380
And, as described

236
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,343
in this morning's
presentation...

237
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,718
the fresh blood supply has
allowed the skin to regrow

238
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,887
without the need
for further grafts.

239
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,589
Dr. Warren?

240
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,807
Dr. Avery will perform

241
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:56,193
a primary microvascular
arterial repair first

242
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,907
and then follow with
a venous anastomosis.

243
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,892
All right, Matt. This
all looks very good.

244
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,627
We're gonna see
you in the OR. What?

245
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,012
I swear that never gets old.

246
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,653
Ah, if only that were true.

247
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,555
Okay, guys.

248
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,326
Excuse me. All right.

249
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,521
Hey.

250
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,016
Edwards. You need anything?

251
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,325
You are pretty.

252
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,885
I'm sorry?

253
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:24,322
Do you need anything?
Do you want anything?

254
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,191
Okay, that's...
That's flattering.

255
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,595
But, I have a beautiful
and very strong wife.

256
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,764
Ew, Warren. No,
I want your case.

257
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,267
Oh! No, not a chance.

258
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,719
I will give you $50.

259
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,939
No, I can't do it.

260
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,790
Come on, I need to
log more ENT hours.

261
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,259
And how is that my problem?

262
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,749
Look at this. Danny's
in full-blown cholangitis.

263
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,435
What was that with Danny?

264
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,881
Why would you
bring up that surgery

265
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,282
without talking
about it with me first?

266
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,217
You brought me on as
a consult for my opinion.

267
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,435
I was giving you my opinion.

268
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,903
He's barely able to
keep his blood clotting.

269
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,238
You really think he's gonna
survive a surgery that big?

270
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,706
I thought that's why
you brought me on,

271
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,057
because you wanted
some new ideas.

272
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,542
Have you even done
this procedure before?

273
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,526
You came to me. You
brought this case to me.

274
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,685
For your help. So
then listen to me.

275
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,421
What's going on here, Mer?

276
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,625
Nothing's going on.

277
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,605
Would you rather him sit
around and wait for a liver and die

278
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,523
or let me try a surgery
I know I can handle?

279
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,531
What's the deal here?
Is this about your streak?

280
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,399
Are you kidding me? Then what?

281
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:28,036
What's going on here?
What's your deal today?

282
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,256
Nothing. No deal.
I have no deal.

283
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,766
What in the world led you
to develop this technique?

284
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,413
It was for a little
side hobby of mine.

285
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,635
Which is?

286
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,104
I want to cure autism.

287
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,035
That's ambitious for a fellow.

288
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,827
What made you
decide to tackle autism?

289
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,962
One in 68 kids isn't enough?

290
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,631
Usually it comes
down to just one.

291
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,718
My little sister.

292
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,353
Ah.

293
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,456
I just always wondered
what she was thinking.

294
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,796
I hope you find that out.

295
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,048
Hey, why didn't
you answer my text?

296
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,072
'Cause I was working.

297
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,290
So?

298
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,408
So what?

299
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,687
How is Meredith?

300
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,611
What do you know?

301
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,614
I know she's being an ass,
pushing a risky surgery on my patient.

302
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,877
She's on a streak. Go for it.

303
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,245
Who was the woman
on Derek's phone?

304
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,579
I don't know. She said nothing?

305
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,930
Yesterday, she couldn't
stop talking about it.

306
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,599
All I know is Derek
came home last night.

307
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,573
No.

308
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,791
Crap.

309
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,626
Crap? Why crap?

310
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,795
A woman answers his phone,
he immediately gets on a plane

311
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,564
and shows up in the
middle of the night.

312
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,062
He's here to apologize.

313
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,403
Because he has
something to apologize for.

314
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,540
Crap.

315
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,761
I don't like this.

316
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,497
<i>Mrs. Hunt, I know this is hard,
but I need you to not move.</i>

317
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,734
I think I might be
done. Am I done?

318
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,903
<i>Not quite yet. Try
focusing on your breathing.</i>

319
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,943
I'm not usually like this.

320
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,211
I was in the military.
I served in Vietnam.

321
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,632
I don't panic. I
think I'm just upset.

322
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
<i>Well, you did have quite a fall.</i>

323
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,370
Not about the fall. About Owen.

324
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:45,206
I didn't mean for him
to find out like this.

325
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,809
He has a right to
be a little surprised.

326
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,711
Shocked.

327
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,013
But how does he think I feel?

328
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,449
A guy like John chasing
after a fossil like me.

329
00:13:57,353 --> 00:14:00,687
It was weeks before I even
realized he was dating me.

330
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,190
And then, one night
he kissed me, and...

331
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,727
I'm not stupid.

332
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,263
I know how we
must look together.

333
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,415
I know what people
must think of us.

334
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:15,202
"He's conning her.
She's buying him.

335
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,172
"It's a joke."

336
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
It's what I'd think.

337
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,143
But then he kissed me.

338
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,047
And when he kissed me

339
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,685
we were exactly the same age.

340
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,507
All those years
between us disappeared.

341
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,543
John always says,

342
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,413
"Ev, there's no difference
between us except a bunch of years.

343
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,917
"And, frankly, they're years
I wish I'd spent with you."

344
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,904
Owen's always
worried that I'm lonely.

345
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:54,042
His dad died 32 years
ago, so he worries.

346
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,276
But I'm not lonely.

347
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,312
I'm having the time of my life.

348
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,068
Am I done?

349
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,970
In order for me to
get a clean CT scan,

350
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,956
I need for you to be
perfectly still, which means...

351
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,124
No talking.

352
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,226
No talking.

353
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,161
John sounds amazing.

354
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,629
Doesn't he?

355
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:18,065
It would be so much
easier if he were my age.

356
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,402
But I got to tell you, it's
so much nicer that he isn't.

357
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,176
Oh, God.

358
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,795
I know. It's a little
uncomfortable,

359
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,564
but we can just get a good
look at what's going on inside.

360
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,183
Please don't find a tumor.

361
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:37,218
No, looks good.

362
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,820
Your tissues look healthy.

363
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:45,859
What's going on?

364
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,594
Nothing!

365
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,391
I told you to page me if
you had something cool.

366
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,816
Oh, it's not. Sorry.
No, it's just a...

367
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,378
It's just another neurotic lady

368
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,302
who thought her headache
was a brain tumor.

369
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,640
So lots of ibuprofen
and hand-holding in here.

370
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,226
You should go. Find
something worth your hours.

371
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,484
What was that? What was that?

372
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,522
It's some kind of critter.

373
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,735
What do you mean, "critter"?

374
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,469
It's alive? Something's
living in my face?

375
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,160
It's using your sinus
cavities to move around.

376
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,379
Oh, my God! I don't
care! Just get it out!

377
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,820
Hang on, all right? Hang on.

378
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,129
Let me put this mask on you.

379
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:33,653
Start him on an albumin drip.

380
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,890
I want the surgery.

381
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,780
Danny, we went over this. No.

382
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,200
I want the surgery!

383
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,397
Dr. Karev is gonna drain the
fluid, and you're gonna feel better.

384
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,271
No! I won't!

385
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,140
I can't keep doing
this. I want the surgery.

386
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,909
It's really risky. Your
body's very weak.

387
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,105
You don't know
what you're saying.

388
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,161
Yes, I do!

389
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,598
I can't go out like this,

390
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,816
sitting in some
hospital bed, waiting,

391
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,319
propped up with
my special pillows,

392
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,406
staring at crap that
doesn't mean anything.

393
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:08,542
Some hockey puck you
got signed for me out of pity,

394
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,196
pictures of our dead parents
who would have known better

395
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,882
than to just let
me sit here and rot.

396
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,978
All right, hey,
Danny. It's fine.

397
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,536
No, it's not.

398
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,105
It's my life. It's my choice.

399
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,776
Dr. Grey, I want the
surgery, and I want it today.

400
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,786
Kathy, he's hurting right now,
all right? Once he feels better...

401
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,304
Will he feel better?

402
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,674
I mean, he's
right. It is his life.

403
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,804
He has so little control
over anything else,

404
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,312
but he's almost 18.

405
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,542
He should get a say in
what he does in his life, right?

406
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,867
That's what he wants.

407
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,520
I mean, he just wants to go to
games and hang out with girls

408
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:57,441
and junk out on popcorn
with his friends at the movies.

409
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,994
He's miserable and terrified.

410
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:02,295
And I don't blame him.

411
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,749
Just... I'll give consent.
Just do the surgery.

412
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,350
Absolutely.

413
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,264
You're still his guardian.
You don't have to do this.

414
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,532
Just tell me that
it's going to work.

415
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,691
I've spent my entire adult
life taking care of him.

416
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,428
Now he wants a
life, but he's my life.

417
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,198
I don't know what I
would do without him.

418
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,268
Renee? Oh...

419
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,320
Oh, God.

420
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,555
You okay?

421
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,457
Yeah, I'm just...

422
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,626
I'm sorry. I broke
a cup. I'll replace it.

423
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,289
I'm not worried about the cup.

424
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,529
I'm fine. I'm sorry.
Have a good night.

425
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,838
Do you want to talk about it?

426
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,122
I've been measuring
levels of activity

427
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,258
and inhibitory cells
in VPA rat brains.

428
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,029
For months, I've been
patching and patching,

429
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,798
for more than a year, actually.

430
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:14,718
I've been looking for
abnormalities, and nothing shows up.

431
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,787
Nothing.

432
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,972
I'm wasting my time.

433
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,361
Do you know why
you feel like that?

434
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,944
It's because you're close.

435
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,647
You're very close
to a breakthrough.

436
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,349
I've been there. It's tedious.

437
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,135
It takes patience
and concentration.

438
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,239
And you want it. You
want a breakthrough so bad

439
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,052
that you have to
break something.

440
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,292
I'll replace the cup. I'm...

441
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,194
Stop talking about the cup.

442
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,296
Keep going.

443
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,332
You're right at the line.

444
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,685
You're gonna cross it.

445
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,089
Don't stop.

446
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,973
You should get some sleep.

447
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,386
Yeah.

448
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:07,955
I'll try.

449
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,197
Hey, so, I spoke to Dr. Webber.
Your CT results came back.

450
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,999
You have a mild head contusion,

451
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,423
so they're gonna keep
an eye on it overnight.

452
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,360
I suppose you have questions.

453
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,639
No. Um...

454
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,008
I brought you some, pant...

455
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:37,918
Uh... Some ladies'
underthings and socks,

456
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,405
in case your, you
know... Your feet get cold.

457
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:46,260
Patients are always telling me that
their feet get cold, so I thought "socks."

458
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,662
I spent your whole childhood
telling you to be sure

459
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,209
you had clean socks
and underwear on

460
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,999
in case you were in an accident.

461
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:53,533
Here I am.

462
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:55,018
No socks, no underwear.

463
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,426
Owen, ask.

464
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,424
It's none of my
business. I don't need to...

465
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,598
We met in a writer's group.

466
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,999
I didn't know you wrote.

467
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,368
Just stories.

468
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,870
Little things about
my time in the service.

469
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,174
John liked them.

470
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,444
One night, we stayed late
talking about my stories,

471
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,079
and he shared some of his.

472
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,014
He did a stint in the Navy.

473
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,234
And after a while,

474
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,671
we realized we were
the only ones still around.

475
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,976
He asked if I wanted
to go for some coffee

476
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,678
and keep the conversation going.

477
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,396
I did.

478
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,668
That was six months ago.

479
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:48,639
And somehow we've never
run out of things to talk about.

480
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,424
So, that's it? Just
coffee and conversation?

481
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,781
Do you really want to hear
about your mother's sex life?

482
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,450
Okay. Uh...

483
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,754
Owen, does it matter that
he's not what you pictured?

484
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,019
Yes, it matters, 'cause
there's something wrong here.

485
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,944
He's half your age.
He's younger than I am.

486
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:15,082
Mom, I think he's using you.

487
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,451
For what? For sex?

488
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,736
Well, God bless him.

489
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,905
Stop it. That's
not what I meant.

490
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,373
For money. Your pension, maybe.

491
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,253
That's what these guys do.

492
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,788
They prey on older people...

493
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,796
What do you mean, "these
guys"? John's not "these guys."

494
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,566
There's no way a
man like that could...

495
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,087
Could love me?

496
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,694
Is that what you were gonna say?

497
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:47,598
There's no way a man
like that could love me.

498
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:49,633
Mom.

499
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,709
Just think about it.

500
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,425
For a moment, put your heart
aside and try to think about it.

501
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,691
You should have
told me right away.

502
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,360
I would never have let this
guy do this to you. It's not right.

503
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,917
It feels right.

504
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,722
I want you to go.

505
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,007
Mom.

506
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,977
I don't want to see anyone
make a fool out of you.

507
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,024
And I won't let
anybody hurt you.

508
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,264
Please.

509
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:37,498
I like your mom. She's funny and
smart. I mean, I'm not surprised.

510
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:38,686
Is there a point?

511
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:44,838
Owen, if it were my mom,
I would be thrown, too,

512
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:47,508
but from talking to her, it
seems like they're really in love.

513
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,154
You spent 15 minutes
listening to her,

514
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,489
and you have this
whole thing figured out.

515
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,391
I know nothing about this guy.

516
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:55,655
You don't know my mother, so
please just stay the hell out of it.

517
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,737
We went to this
beautiful lake...

518
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,060
Shh! Don't speak.

519
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,240
With these waterfalls.

520
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,197
You'll scare him away.

521
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:15,168
Everyone on my tour was jumping
off this big, high ledge into the lake.

522
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:18,505
I was so terrified to
do it, but it was like

523
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:21,491
the big, high point
of the trip for them.

524
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,221
I didn't want to be the
only one who didn't go.

525
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,964
I didn't want to miss
out on the high point.

526
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm so glad I jumped.
It was exhilarating.

527
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,619
Amazing. It changed me forever.

528
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:33,904
Please stop talking.

529
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,449
Do you think that's when
I got this thing in me?

530
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,998
Andrea, don't move.

531
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,484
Come to mama.

532
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
Oh, no! Stop, stop, stop!

533
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,816
It's grabbing. Just a
little more. Just a little...

534
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,368
Stop it!

535
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,792
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

536
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,329
Okay.

537
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,132
We're gonna take a little break.

538
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,334
Then we'll try again.

539
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,013
Mmm-mmm. I'm
not doing that again.

540
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,637
I'm not doing it.

541
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,152
<i>We'll need to be very careful
when connecting the graft</i>

542
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,593
<i>to the posterior
auricular artery.</i>

543
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,995
And...

544
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,430
There. Scissors, please.

545
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,332
Uh...

546
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,767
Hello, Dr. Bailey.

547
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,668
Bribery, Edwards?

548
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,149
You think bribery is an
appropriate standard of practice

549
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,950
in this hospital,
bribing for surgeries?

550
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,519
I don't know what
you're talking about.

551
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,755
You tried to bribe your way
onto that surgery down there.

552
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,111
Warren.

553
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,580
Sleeping with the enemy.

554
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,282
You demean yourself,
and you demean medicine.

555
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,917
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,513
And it doesn't matter,
anyway. It didn't work.

557
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:56,665
Fifty dollars?

558
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,652
Fifty dollars.

559
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:03,310
Do you know how much
a full ear replantation

560
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:04,806
would have gone for in my day?

561
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,246
A hundred, easy.

562
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,715
One-twenty, even, plus
two weeks of night call.

563
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,435
You add in inflation,

564
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,582
you should have
offered him $175, at least.

565
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,972
Fifty dollars.

566
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,644
We can't even go
to dinner for $50.

567
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,416
Gelfoam, please. I
need more retraction.

568
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,396
Any more, and we'll
need to extend the incision.

569
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,730
Well, then we'll
extend the incision.

570
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,821
I need better visualization
of the bile duct.

571
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:31,949
His hepatic veins are bleeding.

572
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:33,407
His liver's too scarred.

573
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,153
We need to stop, give
him extra clotting factors.

574
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,988
We can't stop. I told
you it was a bad idea.

575
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,090
His body can't take it.
He's already deteriorating.

576
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,875
Let's pack him and get out.

577
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,445
We can't close him now. He
will die. He'll be dead in a week.

578
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,030
How long has he been
on the transplant list?

579
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,587
Will he get a liver this week?

580
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,526
I could do a hepatico-j
to decompress the liver.

581
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:54,122
That's crazy. It'll never
work. It's a chance.

582
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,991
I didn't ask you for a chance.
I asked you for an opinion.

583
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,998
Which I gave you,
which I'm giving you now,

584
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,211
which you refuse to listen to.

585
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,512
You hijacked my
patient to perform

586
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,097
a procedure that could kill him.

587
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,615
If you don't like my surgical
plan, you are free to leave.

588
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,267
What the hell is wrong with you?

589
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,868
Damn it. He's
dropping his pressure.

590
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,971
I'm putting a shunt in
from the splenic to the IVC.

591
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,605
The anastomosis
is not gonna hold.

592
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,162
It's the only way. Right angle.

593
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,394
Hello?

594
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:27,662
What are you doing right now?

595
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:29,929
I was...

596
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,948
<i>It's 1:00 a.m.</i>

597
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,333
How soon can you be at the lab?

598
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,805
I couldn't stop thinking
about your research.

599
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:40,552
You've been thinking
about my research?

600
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,859
Come here. Come on.
Let me show you. Look.

601
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,565
Oh, my God.

602
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,816
Yeah, I know. I told you.

603
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:51,785
It's all about the
excitatory pathways.

604
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,304
Here, look.

605
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,306
See?

606
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,375
Yeah.

607
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,347
Your blood pressure's
dropped since the last check.

608
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,814
You feeling okay?

609
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,950
I feel like I'm being
made too much fuss over

610
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,802
'cause my son's the boss.

611
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,323
Okay, so, the cat's fed,

612
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,069
um, I got the recycling
down to the curb.

613
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,638
I brought you some
clothes and stuff.

614
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,039
I couldn't find your journal,

615
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,474
so I just picked you up a
fresh one down in the gift shop.

616
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,099
You didn't have to do all that.

617
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,868
Hey.

618
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,299
Hey, are you... Are you okay?

619
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:28,563
Is she okay?

620
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,374
I'm fine.

621
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,677
You're very, very sweet.

622
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,632
But I don't think...

623
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,370
We shouldn't be doing this.

624
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,838
Not anymore.

625
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,640
What?

626
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,841
You don't need this, John.

627
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,462
A frail, old woman
who falls in the shower.

628
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:54,281
Stop it. Is this... Is
this because Owen...

629
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,617
He's my son.

630
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,253
And he's been to hell and back.

631
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,655
And he does everything for me.

632
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,069
And if he feels that it isn't...

633
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,333
Hey, hey, Evelyn.

634
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:09,313
Do you believe that?

635
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,248
Oh!

636
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,397
We need help in here!

637
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,153
Okay, her abdomen's rigid.

638
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,882
Evelyn. RICHARD:
Step outside, all right?

639
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,440
Blood pressure's dropping
drastically. She's going into shock.

640
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,589
Page Pierce, and get
Owen Hunt. Mmm-hmm.

641
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,222
I'm right here.

642
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,453
Shunt is in.

643
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,733
Bleeding seems under control.

644
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:36,751
You seem surprised.
I'm glad it worked.

645
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,519
You've questioned
every move I've made.

646
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,844
You, of all people? I
need you to believe in me.

647
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,557
ALEX: Crap, there's...

648
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,159
I see it. The
anastomosis is leaking.

649
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,423
Come on, Danny.

650
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,188
What happened?

651
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,834
Ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm.

652
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,336
The dizziness, the
bruising on her back,

653
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,104
they must have been
caused by a sentinel bleed.

654
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,655
What the hell, Richard?
How'd you not see this?

655
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,808
Hey, all of her injuries
were consistent with her fall.

656
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,209
None of us would have
thought to look any further.

657
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,473
I know you're worried,
but we have her.

658
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,118
Hey.

659
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,820
I need you to tell
me why you're here.

660
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,017
I'm gonna go. She told me to go.

661
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,761
Good. Go. I will.

662
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,211
But not until I
know she's all right.

663
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,991
I know she doesn't
want me, and that's fine.

664
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:37,183
But I can't just walk away
not knowing how she is.

665
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,533
I can't just walk away from...

666
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,925
I know she doesn't
want me, but I want her.

667
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:48,394
I have to know that she's
out there in the world okay.

668
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:49,704
I can't go not knowing.

669
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,410
She'll never even
know I was here.

670
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,312
You don't have to
say anything to her.

671
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,576
I'll go the moment that I know.

672
00:30:57,673 --> 00:31:03,677
But until then, I am
sitting here in this chair,

673
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:06,106
until I know that
Evelyn is all right.

674
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,423
Hey. He's okay, right? The
surgery worked? Can I see him?

675
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,628
Dr. Grey?

676
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,700
Kathy, um... I'm...

677
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,536
I'm so sorry.

678
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,839
I'm so sorry for your loss.

679
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,641
No!

680
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,099
Tell me that's not... Yes.

681
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,036
The VPA cells are connecting

682
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,824
almost twice the
rate of normal cells.

683
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,874
This is amazing!

684
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,843
You're amazing!
I could kiss you.

685
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,181
I mean, I won't.
Obviously I won't. Sorry.

686
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,150
But all the wrong
turns and brick walls,

687
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,853
and finding the
answer is such a high.

688
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,170
It's getting late.

689
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,306
Um...

690
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,236
I should go.

691
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,275
Do you have to?

692
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,821
Meredith!

693
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:04,840
Mer, stop!

694
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,179
He should have
lived. He couldn't.

695
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,727
You saw how messed
up his liver was.

696
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,811
I should have saved him.
I could have saved him.

697
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:14,395
If you weren't bringing me down

698
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,731
with your doubting and
second-guessing and distracting me.

699
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,316
Mer. He should have lived.

700
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,141
He should have lived!
He should have lived.

701
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,308
What?

702
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:25,277
Stop. Get off! Stop it!

703
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:26,696
Come on. No.

704
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,076
I'm mad at you. No, you're not.

705
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,350
I am. No, you're mad at Derek.

706
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:31,985
You want to take
it out on me, go on.

707
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,603
You want to yell
and hit and scream

708
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,192
'cause things are
hard at home, okay.

709
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:38,007
You want to be a mess, be a
mess. I don't care. I can take it.

710
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,177
But in that OR, you are
not a mess in that OR.

711
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,762
You tried. We both did.

712
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,475
You didn't do this. You
didn't kill that kid, okay?

713
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,781
So keep it together.

714
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,335
We were able to
repair her aneurysm.

715
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,031
So she's gonna be
okay? Yeah, that's good.

716
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:10,790
She should recovery nicely.
That was one lucky fall.

717
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,459
If her aneurysm had
ruptured outside of the hospital,

718
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,694
she wouldn't have made it.

719
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:15,762
All right.

720
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,830
Thank you.

721
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,068
Thanks. Mmm.

722
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,124
Uh...

723
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,025
Tell your mom I said goodbye.

724
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,094
Oh...

725
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,875
I ordered this book that she's
been searching for forever.

726
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,317
It was out of print. I
found it. I had it shipped.

727
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,625
It arrived yesterday.

728
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,648
It's in this little
brown package

729
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,783
on the table near the blue sofa.

730
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,502
Will you make sure she gets it?

731
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:45,625
Yeah.

732
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:46,894
Thanks.

733
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,129
John, wait.

734
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,536
I told you to go.

735
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:04,210
Yeah, well, Owen suggested
that you might be full of crap.

736
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,912
Hmm. I asked
him to stick around.

737
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:07,730
We've been talking.

738
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,120
Oh, God. I wish you didn't
have to see me like this.

739
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:15,788
I look so...

740
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,993
You look beautiful.

741
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,083
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

742
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,985
Okay, just relax, Andrea.

743
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:36,320
Dr. Wilson said I could have a
look at your little buddy there?

744
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,527
No.

745
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,812
Okay, I feel for you. I do.

746
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,957
But you got to let
us yank him out.

747
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,459
Wilson! ANDREA: But it hurts.

748
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:43,032
I think he has teeth.

749
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,718
I know you're scared.

750
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,487
He is, too. He doesn't
want to come out.

751
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:52,708
He has found the
perfect, safe home.

752
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:57,263
The tissues in your sinuses
are warm and damp and cozy.

753
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:01,834
But they're also tasty,
and he's gonna get hungry,

754
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:03,681
and then he's gonna
start chomping away.

755
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,239
And the more he
chomps through them,

756
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,085
the closer he's gonna
get to your brain.

757
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,160
And your brain...
Oh, your brain.

758
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,080
That'll be like
Christmas dinner.

759
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,110
He's here. He's right
here. Get him out.

760
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,411
Okay, okay, Andrea. This
is what I want you to do.

761
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,515
I want you to take
a great big sniff.

762
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,554
What? Sniff in? No way.

763
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:23,639
He'll end up somewhere
behind my eyeball.

764
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,492
No, he won't. Your
sinuses will contract.

765
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,260
It'll help. I promise.
Ready? Sniff.

766
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,705
There you are,
you little bugger.

767
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:39,922
Oh, my God.

768
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,402
Oh, my God. It's so gross.

769
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,437
And he was in my
face. What is it?

770
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,245
Oh, it's a leech.
Poor little guy.

771
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:48,013
Do you want to keep him?

772
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,148
If you don't, I will.

773
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:01,394
What? What is that?

774
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:05,448
I pulled it out
of a lady's nose.

775
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:09,169
This little sucker had me
working on one single case all day.

776
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:10,771
All day?

777
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,889
All day.

778
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,642
So you just logged six, seven
uninterrupted hours of trauma

779
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,178
without even trying,

780
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:20,124
all because of a stupid leech
up someone's stupid nose?

781
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,348
I think I'm gonna
name him Herbie.

782
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,537
I'm gonna put Herbie up
your nose while you sleep.

783
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,513
Amelia. I am so...

784
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:38,748
Sorry?

785
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,068
For being such a jackass?

786
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:45,622
And for how I spoke
to you. I was out of line.

787
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:47,823
You think?

788
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,909
I am sorry.

789
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:52,878
Good.

790
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,432
Don't go. Not like this.

791
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:01,754
It just took me by surprise.

792
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,626
I'm not always
good with surprises.

793
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,929
Me either.

794
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,946
Maybe we should get over that.

795
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,130
<i>When we go without certain
things for long enough,</i>

796
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,507
<i>it's easy to forget</i>

797
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,743
<i>just how much we need them.</i>

798
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,383
<i>We forget what we had once.</i>

799
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,505
<i>We forget what it's
like to live with a thing</i>

800
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:41,194
<i>not that we need,
but that we want.</i>

801
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:43,929
The kids?

802
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,165
Just put them to bed.

803
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,553
Derek?

804
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,087
Wait. Just...

805
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,132
Derek? Just wait.

806
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:15,134
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

807
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,396
Tell me that this
is all in my head,

808
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,332
that there isn't
something between us.

809
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,483
I know it's there.

810
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,334
I love my wife.

811
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,421
I'm married.

812
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,007
I don't want anything other
than what I have with her.

813
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,360
I have to go.

814
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,570
Right now I have to go.

815
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:47,076
<i>That's why it's so important
for us to remind ourselves,</i>

816
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,596
<i>for us to remember.</i>

817
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,333
I am calling Post-it.

818
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:55,735
Zola and Bailey

819
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:59,038
and tumors on the walls
and ferry boat scrub caps.

820
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,077
I thought D.C. was everything.

821
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:07,046
And I was wrong.

822
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,884
You...

823
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:15,621
You.

824
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,007
You're everything.

825
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,944
I love you,

826
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,647
and I'm not gonna
stop loving you.

827
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,315
Meredith, I can't
live without you.

828
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,485
I don't want to
live without you.

829
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,190
And I'm gonna do everything
in my power to prove it.

830
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,971
I can live without you.

831
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,852
But I don't want to.

832
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:02,669
I don't ever want to.

833
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,097
<i>Just because we can
live without something,</i>

834
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,123
<i>it doesn't mean we have to.</i>
