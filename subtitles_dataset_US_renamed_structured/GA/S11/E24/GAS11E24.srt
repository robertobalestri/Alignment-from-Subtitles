1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,639
<i>Time stops when
you're in the OR.</i>

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>You step up to the table,</i>

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,014
<i>you evaluate the patient,</i>

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,785
<i>you pick up a scalpel...</i>

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,721
He's too big for that.

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,761
<i>And then you go into a bubble.</i>

7
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>It's just you and your surgery,
and nothing else matters,</i>

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,134
<i>not time, not pain,
not exhaustion.</i>

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>Nothing.</i>

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,616
Hey, just finished
my corpectomy.

11
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,063
Did I miss it? No, you're good.

12
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,189
Wow.

13
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,202
That was fast. What was fast?

14
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,078
I put out feelers with a
real-estate agent about the house,

15
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,691
and looks like I got an offer.

16
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,832
You're selling the house? No.

17
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,851
I don't know. Maybe.

18
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,430
Why do people constantly feel
the need to kill their arteries?

19
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:14,100
Are they here yet? Oh, did I
miss it? Tell me I didn't miss it.

20
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:15,952
Nope. I almost forgot.

21
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,705
I can't wait to see the beads of
sweat on their freaked-out little faces.

22
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,746
Oh, man. Did I
miss it? Nope. Nope.

23
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,926
I want to see someone
crap, actually crap.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,516
Seen it, smelled it. Not
as fun as you'd think.

25
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,764
It's happening! The baby
chicks and ducks are here!

26
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,422
<i>It happens in real life, too.</i>

27
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:35,227
<i>When something big
happens, something tragic,</i>

28
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,362
<i>you freeze.</i>

29
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,398
<i>You retreat into
your happy bubble...</i>

30
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,079
Derek. MEREDITH: Derek.

31
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,663
Right. Meredith. Meredith.

32
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,047
<i>For what seems like a second</i>

33
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,090
<i>until you look up.</i>

34
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,060
<i>And suddenly you realize</i>

35
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,399
<i>it's a whole new year.</i>

36
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:02,121
Each of you today comes here
hopeful, wanting in on the game.

37
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,240
A month ago, you were in med
school, being taught by doctors.

38
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,945
Today, you are the doctors.

39
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,197
The five years you spend
here as surgical residents

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,483
will be the best and worst
of your lives. They will...

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,719
You have a question?

42
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,121
Yes. Why?

43
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,222
Uh, you raised your hand.

44
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,843
No, I'm sorry. I mean, why will these
be the best and worst years of our lives?

45
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,779
Uh, I was getting
to that. Sorry.

46
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,280
Um, where was I? Oh, right.

47
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,845
You will be pushed
to the breaking point.

48
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,652
Look around you.

49
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,788
Say hello to your competition.

50
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,385
<i>Eight of you will switch
to an easier specialty.</i>

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,529
<i>Five of you will crack
under the pressure.</i>

52
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,538
<i>Two of you will
be asked to leave.</i>

53
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,163
<i>This is your starting line.</i>

54
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,266
<i>This is your arena.</i>

55
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,651
<i>How well you play,</i>

56
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,454
that's up to you.

57
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,982
They look stupid.

58
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,253
They look like babies.

59
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,860
Were we ever that young?

60
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,714
They're so well
rested. And stupid.

61
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,484
And eager, like puppies.
No, not like puppies.

62
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,046
Chicks and ducks.
Chicks and ducks.

63
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,764
When did we start
calling them that?

64
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,948
You've been gone for a year.

65
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,989
Left to their own
devices, they would drown.

66
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,436
And take the patients
down with them.

67
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,776
God help us all.

68
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:35,363
They look good. Pretty good.

69
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:39,017
Some of them. I mean,
for chicks and ducks.

70
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,386
I'll at least get some
good ones, right?

71
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:45,991
You'll make sure I get some good
ones? Yeah. You're gonna hook me up.

72
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,861
Uh, listen up. This
is Dr. Edwards.

73
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,042
Some of you are lucky enough
to be under her supervision.

74
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,516
Listen closely to everything
she says. Observe. Learn.

75
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,252
She has the power to
mold you into fine surgeons.

76
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,155
Thank you, Dr. Webber.
Oh, and congratulations, sir.

77
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,242
Dr. Webber's getting
married this afternoon.

78
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,230
Wow.

79
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,640
Mazel tov, sir. Congratulations.

80
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,281
Hooray! Thank you.

81
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,818
Now, um, who's got Dr. Edwards?

82
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,640
I did not hook you up.

83
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,278
All right. I have three rules.

84
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,247
One, listen to the nurses.
Respect the nurses.

85
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,699
Do whatever the nurses say.

86
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,735
You may think you know
more than the nurses.

87
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,253
You do not.

88
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,821
Two, your life is now all about me.
- Charge to 200.

89
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:36,258
Not about you or your boyfriend...
- Charged.

90
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:37,403
Your fight with
your sister or your

91
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:39,060
nasty little rash down there.

92
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,458
So, when we are focused on me,
we are learning to be surgical gods.

93
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,760
When we are focused on you,
we're working at a gas station.

94
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,250
Three, no complaining.

95
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,752
You complain and
you are out. Got it?

96
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,224
You. Rules. Repeat.

97
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,545
Listen to nurses, worship
you, complain and die.

98
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:58,813
Good. Let's go.

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,982
Hunt. How much longer is
Richard gonna be interim chief?

100
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,834
Because I want to
expand my department,

101
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,019
and he has kind of a different
approach to the budget.

102
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,138
So, when are you
coming back? Uh, I'm not.

103
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,873
The board's gonna
appoint a new chief.

104
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,963
We are? When?

105
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,098
Why? Yeah, why?

106
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,851
Because I've been
chief long enough.

107
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,455
And it's time for
something else.

108
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,342
<i>Dr. Meadows. Dr. Meadows.</i>

109
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,298
Jackson. Jackson!

110
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,568
This is... You are
just making a mess.

111
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:37,847
What are you doing?

112
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,570
Oh. Do you want some?

113
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,985
Sweetheart, you don't have
to be here. Really, I'm fine.

114
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,853
I am supporting you.
I'm your maid of honor.

115
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,594
April said the job
of the maid of honor,

116
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:48,541
support the bride,
keep her company.

117
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,582
So, I'm supportin'. I'm
keeping you company.

118
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,952
You know, Meredith also
said that the maid of honor

119
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,000
drives the getaway car if
you want to make a run for it.

120
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,619
So, you know, you want to
make a run for it, I'm standing by.

121
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,809
Ready to go. Just
give me a holler.

122
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,145
Until then, we're
up on LA by four.

123
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,711
I thought April would be
with you when you came over.

124
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,051
Is everything okay?

125
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,862
Yeah. Fine. Mmm.

126
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:15,824
Well.

127
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,361
I know it's a challenge.

128
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,324
The woman that came
back from the combat zone

129
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,931
is not the same
girl that left here.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,850
April has changed.

131
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,153
It would be understandable
if that created problems.

132
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,239
Jackson.

133
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,538
Is that Richard? Tell
me that he's here.

134
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,673
Tell me he's here, finally. I
told him not to go to that hospital.

135
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,742
<i>We interrupt this program...</i>

136
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,632
It's not Richard.

137
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,861
<i>To bring you late-breaking
news from our studios</i>

138
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:42,834
<i>in downtown Seattle.</i>
What's wrong?

139
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,214
<i>These images are just coming in.</i>

140
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,415
You know how many incoming? No.

141
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,684
We don't even know what
happened. But it is big.

142
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,419
I guess we're probably not making
it outta here in time for that wedding.

143
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,021
You did a lobectomy on a
dirt road? Well, we had to.

144
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,106
The nearest medical
center was 150 miles away.

145
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,908
Does anybody know what happened?
- Not a clue.

146
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,949
So, was it just a
24/7 adrenaline rush?

147
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,695
What was a 24/7 adrenaline rush?

148
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,286
The desert. No.

149
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,038
You get desensitized
pretty fast.

150
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,775
There's another group leaving
in two weeks if you're interested.

151
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,572
You're not living in a tent.

152
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,762
I grew up in a car.
That had doors.

153
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,009
We should both go. I'm
definitely not living in a tent.

154
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,283
Okay. Here we go.

155
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,104
What have we got? Mid-60s
female with crush injuries.

156
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,739
Massive blood loss at the scene.

157
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:30,043
We've done chest
compressions for 28 minutes.

158
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,367
A 49-year-old male.
Went into V-fib en route.

159
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,740
Shocked times three.

160
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,787
He had two rounds
of epi and vaso.

161
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,674
There are four more
ambulances behind us.

162
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,058
Every last one of them's
got nothing but DOAs.

163
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,831
What's going on? Why aren't
the ambulances unloading?

164
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,033
Because they aren't ambulances.
They're freakin' hearses.

165
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,807
All the patients are dead.

166
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,236
What the hell
happened out there?

167
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,762
A tunnel on 99 collapsed
during rush hour.

168
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,509
The north entrance
completely caved in,

169
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,511
trapping nearly 20
vehicles under the rubble.

170
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,050
Do we know how many victims?

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,465
They're trying to get people
out as fast as they can.

172
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:28,701
But for now, we're just waiting for
them to find someone with a pulse.

173
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,424
How many dead?

174
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,094
Thirteen fatalities so far. God.

175
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,220
Coming through!

176
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,697
We got a live one! Clear a path!

177
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,650
Scott Henry, 17 years old.
Penetrating trauma to the abdomen.

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,230
He arrested as soon as
we took him off the rig.

179
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,281
Let's get him into trauma one,

180
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,938
and page Karev! WOMAN: On it!

181
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,302
I know everyone wants to help,
but back up, give them room to work.

182
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,222
<i>Dr. Karev to the ER.
Dr. Karev to the ER.</i>

183
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:52,280
We got one alive.
There could be more.

184
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,699
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

185
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,068
There could be more.
There could be more.

186
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,719
There could be more.

187
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,024
Three rigs pulling in now
with more right behind them.

188
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,236
They don't know how
many, but they'll bring

189
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,960
as much as we can handle.

190
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,206
We've got live ones
coming in, people,

191
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,641
and we want them
to stay that way.

192
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,342
We need surgical trays
by each trauma bed,

193
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,933
and reserve O-neg on standby!

194
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,568
There's always more.

195
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,156
Uh...

196
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,992
I Know. Look, I am sorry.

197
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,962
I was on my way to the hotel,
but we crashed the OR floor.

198
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,341
It was too big just to... I'm
not here to haul you out of here.

199
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,816
I'm here to help. I'm
looking for a pair of scrubs.

200
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,221
This. This is reason number 537

201
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,673
why you and I are
made for one another.

202
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:42,330
Surgery is sexy,
honey. It's hot. Yes, it is.

203
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,727
And tonight, on our
wedding night... Mmm-hmm?

204
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:49,086
Dr. Webber, I'm gonna
show you just how hot

205
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,984
a morning surgery
can make me. Mmm.

206
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,692
There are people dying.

207
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,121
You are so uptight
for a best man.

208
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,346
Now, don't worry.
You're not off the hook.

209
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,071
Good. I've never been
anybody's best man before.

210
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,009
You know they're
appointing a new chief soon.

211
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,317
I'm recommending you.

212
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:15,446
Unless you don't want it.

213
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:19,283
No, I've just heard you
say this once before.

214
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,869
About the board seat.

215
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,120
But then I find out it'd
been given to Alex Karev.

216
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,700
You're like the
chief who cried wolf.

217
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,876
Who's on the board
now, you or Karev?

218
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,656
<i>Dr. Teller, extension 2219.</i>

219
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,580
<i>Dr. Teller, extension 2219.</i>

220
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,966
Heel, ducklings! Heel!

221
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,545
A 34-year-old pregnant female

222
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,670
with prolonged extrication
from a crushed vehicle.

223
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,187
Her name is Joan Paulson.

224
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,034
She's 40 weeks pregnant
and in active labor.

225
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,341
BP's 100 over 60.

226
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,221
She's been complaining
of severe neck pain

227
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,456
and an obvious
fracture of her right arm.

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,896
And who are you?
I'm Andrew. Sorry.

229
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:51,361
I was on my way into work. I
saw the collapse. I stopped to help.

230
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,861
We've got to go back!
We've got to go back!

231
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,165
We've got it from here, sir.
I'm a doctor. Actually a surgeon.

232
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,567
Her contractions are
five minutes apart.

233
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,802
Her husband's still
trapped in the car.

234
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,975
Let's page OB!

235
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,557
You've got to get Keith out!

236
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,292
Please, you've got to
go back and get him out!

237
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,460
Hey, don't you
worry, okay, Joan?

238
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:08,860
We just need to focus on keeping

239
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,329
- you and your baby healthy.
- All right, thank you.

240
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,464
That was Urban Search & Rescue.

241
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:12,664
They have a victim
they can't extract.

242
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,467
They need us to send a team.

243
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,734
Who's on the
field rotation list?

244
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,159
We've got Pierce,
Shepherd, Kepner, and Grey.

245
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:19,605
No, Grey hasn't
been cleared yet, sir.

246
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,112
I'll sub in for Grey.

247
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,501
And leave everything going
on here? It's a mass casualty.

248
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,033
Grey! You need me?

249
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,437
We're sending a team on-site.
You've been cleared. Go get ready.

250
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,751
She's still supposed to be
supervised. She had a year off.

251
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,152
You can't give her
special treatment

252
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,370
just 'cause something
bad's happened to her.

253
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,674
You can't spoil her
like that. The hell I can't.

254
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,936
<i>Dr. Sanders, 1524.
Dr. Sanders, 1524.</i>

255
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,271
Ow! Careful!

256
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,567
We're looking for our
friend! Are you a doctor?

257
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,706
One at a time.

258
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,819
His name's Scott. He's 17.

259
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,053
Uh, he was in the backseat

260
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,055
when this huge piece of
cement came down and...

261
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,257
He was really messed up. They
took him away in an ambulance.

262
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,109
We just got here. We're
not even from Seattle.

263
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,649
Okay. Uh, where
are your parents?

264
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,168
Back home. In Missoula.

265
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,819
They didn't come with us.

266
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,149
Our parents let us do stuff.
We don't get in much trouble.

267
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,718
We're... Dorks.

268
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,719
We're supposed to be
touring UW right now.

269
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,711
Wilson. We could use some more
hands on our kid in trauma one.

270
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,925
Is he talking about Scott?
He's not gonna die, right?

271
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:17,751
Is that Scott?

272
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,038
V-fib. ALEX: Push an amp of epi.

273
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,173
Charge to 150. Paddles!

274
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,120
Wilson, get in here and help bag!
- Clear!

275
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,785
Fetal monitor is
on. OB is coming.

276
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,432
And, we should get Ortho take
a look at her arm and her neck.

277
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,451
On it! Right away! My
baby. Is my baby okay?

278
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,502
Baby's looking just fine, Joan.
Heart rate's right on target.

279
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,389
Dr. Edwards, is it true that
the fetus can be compromised

280
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,007
if the patient is in
the supine position?

281
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,614
The fetus is compromised?

282
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,960
Out. I'm sorry, did you mean...

283
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,946
Out! This is not question time.

284
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,748
All of you just go to Radiology.

285
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,332
Check on the reads. I
will call you if I need you.

286
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,256
Where is Radiology... Scram!

287
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,237
The contractions
started this morning.

288
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,901
The doctor said we could take
our time, but I wanted to leave.

289
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,947
I made Keith take
that stupid tunnel!

290
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,117
He wanted to take the bridge,
but I said the tunnel was faster.

291
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,546
I'm constantly
telling him what to do.

292
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,098
How long have you
two been married, Joan?

293
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,755
We're not married.

294
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,424
We met each other nine
months and three days ago.

295
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,609
I barely knew him.

296
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:17,261
It's crazy what you
find out about a person

297
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,664
when you get knocked
up on the first date.

298
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,499
We're gonna get
married next week.

299
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,969
Please tell me we're
getting married next week.

300
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,529
Get some water over here.

301
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,731
Over here!

302
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,683
Tape, bandages, and a splint.

303
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,938
Will someone call my
husband? I need my husband!

304
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,784
- Help me! Help me!
- Okay, all right. Calm down.

305
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,153
- Please! Please!
- Tell me your name.

306
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:49,843
He's 10 years old.
T-shirt and jeans.

307
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,490
He was in the backseat? - Yes.

308
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:52,741
Ma'am, can you follow my finger?

309
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,859
His name is Tyler.

310
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,266
Stay with me, okay?

311
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,500
Help us.

312
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:00,600
You're the surgeons
from Grey Sloan?

313
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,018
We are. Where's the patient?

314
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,762
This way. MAN 7:
We're gonna help you.

315
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,910
What's his name?

316
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,528
Keith Gardner.

317
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,398
We got one. He's still alive.

318
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,416
My ear! I can't hear anything!

319
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:14,068
Help!

320
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,723
Car's been crushed by debris.
We got his wife out, but...

321
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, my God. He's in there?

322
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,876
He's alive? Barely.

323
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,479
Back on the truck.

324
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,670
All right, come on, you guys.

325
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,459
We're gonna get you
out, buddy. Don't worry.

326
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,091
Hey, Keith. My name is Meredith.

327
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,310
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

328
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,583
That'd be great.

329
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,377
How do we even start?

330
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,945
We just do.

331
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,233
The door's coming off!

332
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,771
I'm looking for my wife.

333
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,517
There. MAN 3: She's good.

334
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,957
I need some more
lap pads in here.

335
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,503
You got it, Doc. Here you go.

336
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,605
Keith, can you follow
my light with your eyes?

337
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,259
My fiancee, Joan, she
was with me. Is she okay?

338
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,283
We saw her arrive at
the hospital. She's alive.

339
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:23,404
Okay. Okay. Good. She
made it there. She's alive.

340
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:25,172
I need some packing!

341
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,652
Do you know we're having a baby?

342
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,086
Keith, we're trying to
listen to your breathing.

343
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,510
Stop talking, please.

344
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,308
It's hard to hear
breath sounds out here,

345
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,692
but he could have
a collapsed lung.

346
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,683
How's his abdomen?

347
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,079
Lot of blood, from
what I can see.

348
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,021
Keith, I'm just gonna
check your torso, okay?

349
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,544
He's impaled in two places.

350
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,062
It's pretty bad, huh?

351
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,097
It's pretty bad.

352
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,999
But I've seen worse.

353
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,824
Okay. Make sure you
got that crushed leg.

354
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,778
Call Respiratory for bed two,
and get a repeat crit on bed eight.

355
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,058
Thanks. ANDREW: Uh, Dr. Hunt?

356
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,416
Yeah? Hi. I'm Andrew DeLuca.

357
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,062
Oh, right. You came in
with the pregnant woman.

358
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,164
Yes. Is there any
paperwork I should fill out or...

359
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,667
You can do it later if you're good
to just jump in and keep helping.

360
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,740
Of course. Sure.

361
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,322
Oh, God, there's another one!
Okay. Keep breathing. Nice and slow.

362
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,412
Edwards, nice job
reducing the wrist.

363
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,592
Actually, Dr. DeLuca
did that in the field.

364
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,394
Doctor who? Me. Hi. Dr. DeLuca.

365
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,500
He was at the scene.

366
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,663
Paramedics ran out of splints,

367
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,814
so that's actually my tie.

368
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,254
Was your tie. Sorry.

369
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,884
It's not a problem. It was
my favorite one, though.

370
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,886
Oh, God! All right, 3
centimeters dilated.

371
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,904
I think she has a
fracture at C5-6.

372
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,161
What's a C5-6?

373
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,279
Joan, you fractured
a bone in your neck,

374
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:42,027
but it is stable for now, so we
will fix it after you deliver, okay?

375
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,301
Keep her in the collar
until her labs come back,

376
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,781
then we'll get her
upstairs so she can deliver,

377
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,065
- and repair the fracture.
- Got it.

378
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,300
Have them page me
when her contractions

379
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,135
become more frequent, okay?
- All right.

380
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,843
Thank you so much for
your help. It was my pleasure.

381
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,875
He's losing blood faster
than we can put it in him.

382
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,282
We should get him upstairs.

383
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,662
We need to open
his chest. Glove me.

384
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,518
Crack his chest and then what?

385
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,250
That still might not buy us enough
time to get to the OR and fix his injuries.

386
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,223
Then we stop time. How?

387
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,337
Put him on bypass,
drain out all of his blood,

388
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,722
and replace it with cold
saline, and then we operate.

389
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,530
Can you do that? No, he
can't. That's way too risky.

390
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,399
We put him in suspended
animation, cooling him from inside out,

391
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,048
his brain, his heart, his organs.
That buys us an hour or two.

392
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,752
Hunt! Ten blade.

393
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,382
<i>Dr. Miguel...</i>

394
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,051
How's it going out there?

395
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,421
Um, they're coming in
faster than we can treat them.

396
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,584
Um, listen, Catherine,
I hate to say this,

397
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,192
but, you know, under
the circumstances,

398
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,844
do you think we should
postpone the wedding?

399
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,162
I already did.

400
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,781
My assistant is notifying
our guests as we speak.

401
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,016
Oh.

402
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,735
You're sure you don't
mind? Of course I mind.

403
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,520
But we both know
where we need to be.

404
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,742
Hey, uh, Chief. We need you.

405
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,271
You can't just say
"suspended animation"

406
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,295
like it's a real thing.
It's science fiction.

407
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,442
It's called emergency
preservation and resuscitation.

408
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,778
Trauma programs have
been discussing it for years.

409
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:07,629
It's a way to save patients
who can't make it to an OR.

410
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,687
Yeah, a risky way,
an irresponsible way.

411
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,899
'Cause the safe option is to

412
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,268
keep transfusing him
and race him upstairs.

413
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,303
How do you do it?
We cannulate the aorta,

414
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,371
drain out his blood,
infuse cold saline,

415
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,075
then drop his core temp to 50
degrees. You put him in hibernation?

416
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,959
You replace his entire
blood volume with ice water.

417
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,950
You're gonna do what to him?

418
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,947
Get her out of here. So,
you induce hypothermia.

419
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,832
Hold on. We're not
gonna consciously kill a kid

420
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,001
over something you discuss over
beers with your trauma buddies.

421
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,370
Kid's gonna die anyway. At least
this way we can try to bring him back.

422
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,622
I say do it. No. It's
way too experimental.

423
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,207
And we would need
Pierce. She's at the site.

424
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,442
This is not a cardio procedure.

425
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,160
It is if you can't get
his heart beating again!

426
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,345
What are you gonna do if you
can't get him back after bypass?

427
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,403
What then?

428
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,705
That's why we don't do
things like this on a whim.

429
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,470
This is not a whim. This
is a Hail Mary. On a child?

430
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,487
The patient is a minor.
We don't have consent.

431
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,946
By the time you find the
parents, it'll be too late.

432
00:18:52,015 --> 00:18:54,648
I agree with Jackson.
It's a no, Hunt.

433
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,784
We're wasting time
having this conversation.

434
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:03,119
Okay. We only need two
physicians to give consent. Karev?

435
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,509
Really?

436
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,217
That's how you
wanna play this? In.

437
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,361
Webber?

438
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,623
Chief?

439
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,201
Just do it.

440
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,510
I need a cannula!

441
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,919
Too many people have died today.

442
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:22,224
We're not adding
this kid to the list.

443
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,196
How's his airway?
His sats are okay.

444
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:35,151
There's definitely blood
in his chest on the left side.

445
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,485
Meredith, can you
get the packing in?

446
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,824
I'm trying.

447
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,588
I can't really reach
it from this angle.

448
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:43,330
Uh, I need some more trauma
pads and cellulose polymer, please.

449
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,049
What's going on?

450
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,851
Whenever I press on the wound,
blood is flowing out of his abdomen.

451
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,600
The metal is tamponading it,
but it's not going to last very long.

452
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,239
And he needs surgery soon.

453
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,437
If he doesn't suffocate
on his blood first.

454
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,389
I got to get a
chest tube in here.

455
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,453
Do you have access?

456
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,775
No. Maybe.

457
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,226
We have to get him out of there.

458
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,711
What about from the
other side of the car?

459
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,268
I could be your other hand.

460
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,837
Yeah.

461
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,900
Do you really think that
you can get me out of here?

462
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:10,991
I have to. You said it yourself.

463
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,693
You're having a baby.

464
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,845
Do you have kids?

465
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,146
I have three.

466
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,617
Wow, three. One
is freaking me out.

467
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,655
We did it backwards,
though, you know?

468
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,791
You meet someone,
you, uh, fall in love,

469
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,211
get married, have a kid.

470
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,112
It gets bigger, right?

471
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:36,951
Joan and I, we did
this huge thing first.

472
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,321
"We're, uh, having a
baby. Nice to meet you."

473
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,869
We're still getting
to know each other,

474
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,621
learning all
these little things.

475
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,911
It's good stuff.

476
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,882
She, uh, sleeps
with her socks on.

477
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,829
We like... We like watching
tennis... Get me a stethoscope.

478
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,370
But not playing.

479
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,155
She likes techno.

480
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,635
Would have been a deal-breaker,

481
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,925
but we got this big, huge
baby thing coming, so...

482
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:12,118
I really... I really love
all her little things.

483
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,923
It's like I'm home.
She's like my home.

484
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,010
I should really tell her that.

485
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,581
Right?

486
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,752
Come on, guys!

487
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,474
I got it.

488
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,445
I should... Hey!

489
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,258
Slow down! I'm sorry.

490
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:40,347
What is in your mouth?

491
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
A brie tart.

492
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,481
With prosciutto.

493
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,505
Brie? Brie!

494
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,608
Um, there are patients here
that had chunks of cement

495
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,510
fall on them during
their morning commute.

496
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,429
But, please, have some brie.

497
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,299
While carrying lab samples.

498
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,635
That's nasty. What's
the matter with you?

499
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,489
Oh. Where'd you get this?

500
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,194
It looks wonderful. What the...

501
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,191
Did you try this? I'll try that.

502
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,082
No, yeah. It's vegetarian.

503
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,885
Oh, hey, I heard Catherine Avery
had all the food from the wedding

504
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:20,465
sent here, you know, for the
staff, and I have two minutes.

505
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,017
How many sliders you think
I could eat in two minutes?

506
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,974
Is that pesto?

507
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,187
Do you think that Catherine's
gonna help pick the new chief?

508
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,788
I mean, why wouldn't
Hunt just do it?

509
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,245
I don't...

510
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,858
God, it would save
us so much trouble.

511
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,926
The 12-page resumes
and the phone calls

512
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,378
and the polite vetting and...

513
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:35,197
Who would want to
be chief? Would you?

514
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,055
I... Well, I had...
Are you asking?

515
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,243
Hunt should just do it, right?

516
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,327
Oh.

517
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,904
Those crab cakes
look really good.

518
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,211
But I don't want to
make a pig of myself.

519
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,568
Exactly what I was
thinking. Exactly.

520
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,404
Well, yes.

521
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,141
Yes, I would like to be chief.

522
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,276
Did you get ahold of
Scott's parents? Not yet.

523
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,728
We left messages. We're trying.

524
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,563
I mean, they should know
that you're killing their son.

525
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,414
I'm sorry, what? GIRL: Yeah.

526
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,515
We have some questions.

527
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,783
From our research,
we think this plan

528
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,618
is completely untried
and experimental.

529
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,609
Your research?

530
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:17,906
You're trying suspended animation
through induced hypothermia.

531
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,262
So, you heard Dr. Hunt.

532
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,625
It's basically science fiction.

533
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,010
It's still undergoing
clinical trials,

534
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,379
and there's no
documentation suggesting

535
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,113
that this will work on humans.

536
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,177
Whoa, whoa! Where
did you get this research?

537
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,531
Dr. Hunt, this procedure's
only been successful on pigs?

538
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,716
Wait, what?

539
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,911
It wasn't successful on humans?

540
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:41,546
It hasn't been tried on humans.

541
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,949
They've started trials, but
they have no outcomes. Not yet.

542
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,617
Core temp's down to 55.

543
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,761
Where are you getting this?

544
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,020
Those kids. His friends.

545
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,438
You said there were
techniques that were developed

546
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,939
and the studies were published.

547
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,974
The animal studies have
had incredible success.

548
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,132
And the technique
has to start somewhere.

549
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,534
I can name 30 soldiers this
technique would have saved.

550
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,914
So, you want to try it
on a high-school kid

551
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,604
without parental consent?

552
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,622
You better pray this works.

553
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,943
Even if we resuscitate him,
he could end up brain-dead.

554
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,562
His core temp's down to 53.

555
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,081
It doesn't matter now.
We're doing it. We've done it.

556
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,262
So, either get on board
or get out. Karev is right.

557
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,606
Anybody who doesn't
want to be part of this

558
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,238
is welcome to leave.

559
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,623
I'll stay.

560
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,661
We're there. Core
temp's 50 degrees.

561
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,280
Okay. He's cold.

562
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:29,260
We have an hour, 90
minutes tops. We ready?

563
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:30,918
Start the clock. Scalpel.

564
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,126
I said no. I know what you said.

565
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,749
If anything goes
wrong in that OR,

566
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,634
it jeopardizes our
entire surgical program.

567
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,080
It could be the boy's only hope.

568
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,671
I don't need you to defend
the technique to me, Richard.

569
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,023
I need you to follow orders.

570
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,541
Orders?

571
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,404
I'm an owner in this
hospital. I am, too.

572
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,389
But I'm also the
chief. It's my call.

573
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,247
You mean interim chief.

574
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,157
That boy had no chance.
We're giving him one.

575
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:12,860
I don't feel bad about that.

576
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,162
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another surgery.

577
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,448
We can't tell where Keith
ends and the door begins.

578
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,400
If we use the Jaws
of Life to get him out,

579
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,602
it'll rip him to shreds. He'll
bleed to death in seconds.

580
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,210
What about trying an ex-lap?
Then we can try to separate...

581
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,856
We're not sterile.
There's no blood bank.

582
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,124
This is not a
controlled environment.

583
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,559
I know. I know. I know.

584
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,227
We could put a balloon
catheter into his aorta.

585
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,296
It could buy us some time.

586
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,630
If we were closer
to the hospital,

587
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,965
I would say maybe,
but we're 25 minutes out.

588
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,183
He'll never make
it. Okay, what if...

589
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,606
He's a black tag, guys.

590
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,915
We can't do
anything else for him.

591
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,969
Then I'm calling it.

592
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,455
We're gonna cut him
out. Maybe we'll get lucky.

593
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,021
You should go.
No, we can stay...

594
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,845
I'll stay. You go save
people that you can save.

595
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,314
I'll do what I can for him.

596
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,972
Okay, Keith.

597
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,885
We're gonna cut you
out of there now, all right?

598
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,108
Sure thing.

599
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:36,460
Uh, Joan, Dr. Edwards asked us
to take you to the OR now. Okay?

600
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,546
And we can do that, because
we know exactly where that is.

601
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,442
I knew our first day
would be intense.

602
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,785
I figured we might get to
watch some stuff or start an IV,

603
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:47,487
but there was a
mass casualty today.

604
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,484
I've never seen so
many mangled people,

605
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,748
so many dead people.

606
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,009
Doctors from this hospital

607
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,411
just spent hours in the
field trying to extract a guy.

608
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,281
Hours. That's gonna
be us some day.

609
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,883
Did they get him out? The guy?

610
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,463
Huh? Oh, no, I don't think
so. I heard he was too far gone.

611
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,300
Can't breathe. So,
they just left him there?

612
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,301
Got it. I can't breathe.

613
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,992
I can't breathe.
Let me out. What?

614
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,639
Okay. Is it the
collar? I need this off.

615
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,140
I need to get out.
Okay. I can loosen it.

616
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,858
Not much, but maybe
a little. I need to get out.

617
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,710
- Should you do that?
- They left Keith.

618
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,329
They left Keith. He's gone!

619
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:18,647
No, don't!

620
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:24,735
There's a shock through
my body. What's happening?

621
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,337
We need to stabilize her spine.

622
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,973
Um, help me reduce
her dislocation.

623
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:30,007
I'll hold her steady and
you attach the tongs.

624
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,493
What, me? Yeah, I got her. Go.

625
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,428
If we hurry, maybe we can
save her from total paralysis.

626
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,951
But I can't.

627
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,765
I mean, I could try, but I
don't think it's the best idea.

628
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,768
What do you mean? Just
attach... I don't know how to do it.

629
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,752
Why? 'Cause I'm just an intern.

630
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,611
Okay? Today's my
first day. I was late.

631
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,624
I was on my way here. I
saw the tunnel collapse.

632
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:49,450
What? You're an intern?

633
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,731
Maybe if we...

634
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,166
It wouldn't have worked.

635
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,136
Yeah. No.

636
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,055
He didn't have a chance.
It was the right call.

637
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,892
Huh.

638
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:17,811
What?

639
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,295
What'd I do?

640
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,069
Wiggle your toes for me, Joan.

641
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,283
I can't. I can't feel anything,
not even my contractions.

642
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,185
- What did you do?
- Am I paralyzed?

643
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,619
We're working very,
very hard to prevent that,

644
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,404
but I need you to stay
calm. Can I do something?

645
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,406
You can go stand over
there with the interns, intern.

646
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,724
What the hell happened in here?

647
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,909
She dislocated her fracture
at C5-6. I'm decompressing.

648
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,312
Okay. Baby's got decels.

649
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:41,746
I'm getting the
first 5-pound bag.

650
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,069
How the hell did she dislocate?

651
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,399
She was having
trouble breathing.

652
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,205
I thought it was the collar.

653
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,340
Get out!

654
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,053
Okay. I need to get
this baby out of here.

655
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,157
Let's get her up to the
OR. All of you out now.

656
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:58,496
So, if this works, they're
gonna do this in the army?

657
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,670
Absolutely. We should go.

658
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,600
We should take a
year, do the program.

659
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:05,136
We'd spend our time doing
things like this all the time.

660
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,476
It would be amazing.

661
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,806
You're in the middle
of your residency.

662
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,774
I'll take a research year.
We could have an adventure.

663
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,809
I'm not looking
for an adventure.

664
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,211
Oh, crap. OWEN: What is it?

665
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:14,646
It's an infrarenal
IVC injury. Damn it!

666
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,897
How long's it gonna take to fix?

667
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,201
I don't know. About 30 minutes?

668
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,505
We don't have that.

669
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:20,390
Okay, he can live
without it. Just ligate it.

670
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,607
Got it. O silk ties.

671
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,961
There was a mass casualty today.

672
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,942
They needed us back
here at the hospital.

673
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,765
I know, but maybe
there was still something

674
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,579
that we could've... We
did everything we could do.

675
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:31,835
Why are you second-guessing?

676
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,115
I'm just saying that maybe...

677
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,638
I was willing to try an ex-lap.

678
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,885
Oh, my God, would you shut
up about the stupid ex-lap?

679
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,320
That is not the point! - No.

680
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:41,512
No, the point is that maybe
we should have stayed.

681
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,226
Maybe we didn't try everything
we possibly could have to save him.

682
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,033
We were all there.
We all saw that car.

683
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:49,435
And there's a difference
between knowing

684
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,538
when you can
realistically save someone

685
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,018
and when it's time to walk away.

686
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,642
And when is that, Meredith?

687
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,392
When is that point?

688
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,762
When do you look at
a horrible, sad situation

689
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:02,298
and decide that you are ready to
turn your back on it? I'm curious.

690
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,979
I'm curious how you
make those decisions,

691
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,602
you specifically.

692
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,706
When are you
okay making the call

693
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,741
that someone no
longer has any chance?

694
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,344
How do you look
around and decide that?

695
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,263
When do you decide that
you should walk away?

696
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:20,010
Dr. Shepherd? Dr. Edwards says
she needs you in trauma two right away.

697
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:21,068
I'm Dr. Shepherd.

698
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,670
Oh, sorry.

699
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,922
Dr. Edwards says she
needs you right away.

700
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,309
She wasn't...

701
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:32,228
They need you upstairs. Go.

702
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,435
Core temp's 98.6 degrees.
- No pulse.

703
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,681
Heart should be beating by now.

704
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,604
We're way over
time. The IVC repair...

705
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,701
- He'll come back.
- Come on, Scott.

706
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,843
If we lost him...

707
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,456
What the hell did you people do?

708
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,364
We put him in hibernation,
and we're bringing him back out.

709
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,249
Are we?

710
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,524
Okay. Let's get him off bypass.

711
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,514
We got a heartbeat.

712
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,816
The boy's reviving.

713
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,285
I'm thrilled to hear it.

714
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,553
I made the right call.

715
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,088
Talk to me when we see

716
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,185
what kind of brain
function he wakes up with.

717
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,937
Thinking like that would have
left that boy dead on the table.

718
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,944
I can assure you
that your successor

719
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:39,930
will be nowhere
near so cavalier.

720
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,926
I'll make certain of that
when I choose the next chief.

721
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,079
Oh, when you choose? Well,
it's not up to you, Catherine.

722
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,947
It's a board decision.
We'll see about that.

723
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,715
You can't just come in
here and think you can...

724
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,718
I don't need you to tell
me how this hospital works.

725
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,574
I've seen plenty of that today.

726
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,516
<i>Dr. Thompson to Oncology.</i>

727
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,773
<i>Dr. Thompson to Oncology.</i>

728
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:12,745
I'm sorry about leaving
the patient there.

729
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,815
I didn't want to leave
him there, either.

730
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:17,450
And I am sorry for not
talking to you about the house.

731
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,697
You don't talk to me
about a lot of things.

732
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,098
And you're mad at
me for going away,

733
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:23,389
and I am sorry about
that. That's not...

734
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,442
I mean, I couldn't
breathe. I couldn't exist.

735
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,661
You know, I looked
around at that house,

736
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,880
and my kids, our kids.

737
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,794
I couldn't breathe.
You didn't call me.

738
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,917
I didn't call anyone.
I needed time.

739
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:38,104
I am a neurosurgeon. I
could have saved him.

740
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,217
And you didn't call me.

741
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:40,241
Amelia...

742
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:42,325
Who contacted you first?

743
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,561
The police? The paramedics?

744
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,777
How far away was the hospital?

745
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,879
How long were you sitting there

746
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,697
waiting for them to
declare him brain-dead?

747
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:57,824
How many hours later was it
before I was even informed?

748
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,372
How many chances did you have
when you could have called me?

749
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,429
Why didn't you call me?

750
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,866
There wasn't anything
you could've done.

751
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,517
He was too far gone.

752
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,630
You don't know that.
You don't know. Yes, I do.

753
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,022
What if I could've helped
him? What if I had a chance?

754
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,835
I pull off miracles
for a living.

755
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,871
I have proven that I can
reverse the impossible.

756
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,262
I should have been there.

757
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,816
If I had seen him or
treated him... It was too late.

758
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,285
By the time they...

759
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,655
It was too late.

760
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,695
How could you do it?

761
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:37,013
How could you unplug
him without letting me know?

762
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,749
I didn't get to see him.

763
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,870
I didn't get to
tell him goodbye.

764
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,885
I thought you would've at least
given me the courtesy and the respect

765
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:49,225
when my own brother was dying.

766
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,087
I didn't get to
tell him goodbye.

767
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,703
Because of you.

768
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,025
Damn it!

769
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,543
Hey. Sorry about the wedding.

770
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,463
Oh, no. It was the
right idea to cancel.

771
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,499
Postpone you mean. Right?

772
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,719
The odds aren't in
my favor, Miranda.

773
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,554
You know, I've
tried this before.

774
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,857
And failed.

775
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:28,926
Twice.

776
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,560
Well, it always comes

777
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,929
between choosing between
the woman and the work.

778
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,197
And when pressed, I...

779
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,426
You choose the work.

780
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,784
Yeah. You'd think I'd
learn at some point.

781
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,254
Sounds like you have.

782
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,334
You just need
to be okay with it.

783
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,693
But with Catherine and me,
it's already been a problem,

784
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:49,479
and it's still gonna
be a problem.

785
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,649
I'm not sure I want to go down
the road if it's gonna go nowhere.

786
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,445
Carefully. Carefully.

787
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,008
Okay. All right. You're
doing great, Joan.

788
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,164
Deep breaths.

789
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,109
What is it? Talk to us, Joan.

790
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,605
I feel something. In my fingers.

791
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,801
Okay. Good.

792
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,359
That means the
traction's working.

793
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,994
And in my toes!

794
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:24,447
Oh, thank God. I can
feel my legs again.

795
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,117
Oh, my God!

796
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,922
Oh, my God. I
can feel everything.

797
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,490
Oh, my God!

798
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,975
She's having a contraction.

799
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,928
All right, Joan.

800
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,364
Joan, I know it hurts, but
you have to keep still, okay?

801
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,633
We need to prevent your
neck from dislocating again.

802
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,074
You were right today.

803
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,160
I was taking a big risk.

804
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:58,247
You were lucky
today. Really lucky.

805
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,082
I understand.

806
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,684
Is Kepner back
yet from the tunnel?

807
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,253
I don't know.

808
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,703
I don't know much
about her lately.

809
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:11,660
She's different

810
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,548
since she came back
from her training with you.

811
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:18,696
And I'm glad that she found
something that makes her this happy,

812
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,836
I guess.

813
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,874
But it's weird.

814
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,777
We're just not on the
same page anymore.

815
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,547
Ever, it seems.

816
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:36,002
It happens. More than you think.

817
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:40,006
You go away, you come
back. The world has shifted.

818
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,627
Things that made sense
once don't anymore.

819
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:49,215
You heard that I'm
resigning as chief?

820
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,104
Give her time.

821
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,373
That's all you can do.

822
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,446
That's the face you're
gonna make? The kid's alive.

823
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,926
I don't want to have this fight.

824
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,594
What fight? This fight.

825
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,067
This "I told you so" fight.

826
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,481
This thing where this
insane surgery works,

827
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,516
and then you get
back on this army thing,

828
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,834
and then I tell you you're not
going, and then you get pissed.

829
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,109
You're gonna tell me
what I can and can't do?

830
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,805
You do that, I'm gonna
be more than pissed.

831
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,674
You know what? Screw
it. You want to go, then go.

832
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,414
What's your problem?

833
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,360
It sounded interesting.
And for a minute, I thought

834
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,280
it could be something that
we'd do together. Why not?

835
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,814
I have worked
really freaking hard

836
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,549
to get to where
I'm at right now.

837
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,652
I have finally found my
place, and it's at this hospital

838
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,120
doing this job
with these people.

839
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,194
Alex, I'm... Last year was crap.

840
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:37,822
And now Mer is home, and I
finally feel like things are back.

841
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,961
I don't need to go
anywhere. I don't want to.

842
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,684
I've put roots down here.

843
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,992
I've never put roots
down anywhere.

844
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,700
I'm not walking
away, not from this.

845
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,804
If you want to go, then
go. I can't stop you.

846
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,779
It's your life. Do what you
want. Go join the freaking army.

847
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,149
You're almost there,
Joan. Almost there!

848
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,019
Uh, hey, guys.

849
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:04,940
Okay. She's crowning.

850
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,225
She was only 6 centimeters.

851
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,795
I need to... I need to
push one more time.

852
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,896
This baby's coming now.
Edwards, hold her steady.

853
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,550
Occupied! Occupied!

854
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,726
<i>Dr. Guillaume. Dr. Guillaume.</i>

855
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,294
Hey.

856
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,475
I needed to ask you
something, but I didn't want to

857
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,494
because I knew you'd say yes.

858
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:31,583
Then don't ask.

859
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,822
I went away. I pressed
pause on my life.

860
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,408
And I really needed that.

861
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,561
But since I've been back,
I just... I can't unpause.

862
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,990
I just can't get
things going again.

863
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:50,069
I go home every night
to my house and it's...

864
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,756
It's not my house. It was
mine and Derek's house.

865
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:57,594
And now he's gone, and it
really just feels like a house.

866
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,930
I came back, but I'm not home.

867
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,116
And I really want to be home.

868
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,981
Can the kids and I come
and stay with you for a while?

869
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,339
Yeah. No big deal.

870
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,471
Well, you better check with Wilson
because you know how she gets.

871
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,644
Trust me, I don't need
to check in with Wilson.

872
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,684
No.

873
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,453
No. Well, then
explain it to me again.

874
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,226
When did this happen?

875
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,696
Mom, how can you say that?

876
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:38,479
Okay. You're doing great, Joan.

877
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,114
One more big push and
that should do it, okay?

878
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:43,022
I can't... I can't
do this. I can't.

879
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,635
He's supposed to be here
with me, with us, and he's gone!

880
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,955
Joan, we know it hurts, but we
need you to keep going, okay?

881
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,262
The head's out!

882
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,768
<i>How do you step
back into the world?</i>

883
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,704
Joan, you did great.

884
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:01,657
Keith was supposed
to cut the cord.

885
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,293
He was supposed
to hear the first cry.

886
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,979
Hold your baby.
Everything is fine.

887
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,848
Mom, say hello to your son.

888
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,783
<i>It's scary.</i>

889
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,886
This isn't how it's
supposed to be.

890
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:16,422
It's not part of the plan.

891
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:17,874
Keith should be here.

892
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:21,660
Keith should be here.
Keith should be here!

893
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,770
Hi, baby. MEREDITH:
<i>Time stood still...</i>

894
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,452
Mom, I have to go. I have, um...

895
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,554
Uh...

896
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,922
Goodbye.

897
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,026
<i>And now it's speeding by.</i>

898
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,029
ER? Yep.

899
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,911
I thought we'd
seen the last of it.

900
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,495
<i>You are looking for a lifeboat.</i>

901
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,618
You okay?

902
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:47,927
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

903
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:50,523
<i>Something to give you hope.</i>

904
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,536
<i>But are you really ready</i>

905
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,628
<i>to leave your happy little
bubble and step back out</i>

906
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:59,481
<i>into the big, blinding,
bloody, terrible world?</i>

907
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,094
I stopped them from
trying to extract him.

908
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,064
I couldn't watch him
bleed out. You were right.

909
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,615
You said if he were
closer to the hospital,

910
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:06,305
he might have a chance.

911
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:09,124
So, let's give him a chance.

912
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:16,032
<i>Are you ready to
achieve the impossible?</i>
