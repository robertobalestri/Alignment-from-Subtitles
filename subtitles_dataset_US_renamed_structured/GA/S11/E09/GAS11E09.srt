1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,903
<i>When exposed to trauma,</i>

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,256
<i>the body deploys its
own defense system.</i>

3
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:08,485
Do you know why I resent you?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,642
I gave up everything for you.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,881
<i>From the first second the
brain receives the signal</i>

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,518
<i>that a catastrophe
has happened...</i>

7
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,345
You have a piece
of paper? For what?

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,685
We need to make vows.

9
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,521
I have Post-its.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,230
What do we want to
promise each other?

11
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,742
<i>The blood rushes to the
organs that need help the most.</i>

12
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,454
<i>Blood floods into the muscles,</i>

13
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,989
<i>the lungs, the heart, the brain.</i>

14
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,189
<i>The brain makes a decision
for the rest of the body.</i>

15
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,831
<i>Either face the
danger or run away.</i>

16
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,427
<i>It's a mechanism designed to
protect the body from harm...</i>

17
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,489
<i>from knowing that what has
happened might be irreparable.</i>

18
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,125
To love each other even
when we hate each other.

19
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,743
No running.

20
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:16,752
<i>We call it shock.</i>

21
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,825
<i>The person who cares for
your kids is an important choice.</i>

22
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,327
You want to make
sure it's the right fit.

23
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,217
So we'll sit and talk.

24
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,230
I'll find out about your
needs, you'll learn about me...

25
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,454
Right. Just, right now,
I'm a little pressed for time.

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,701
Oh, absolutely. You're busy.

27
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,101
That's why we're here to help.

28
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,226
Yeah, there's a trauma
coming in, and I...

29
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,373
Of course. Listen, I've worked
with doctors before, many times.

30
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,097
I know the drill.

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,727
How about if I wait in the
lobby until you have some time?

32
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,911
That's great. I'll
find you. Okay.

33
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,220
Who was that?

34
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,572
Uh, new nanny, hopefully.

35
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,490
You got a nanny?

36
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,292
I had to. Derek left.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,710
What?

38
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,206
We don't have
numbers yet... Meredith?

39
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,831
But be prepared for as
many as 20 casualties,

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,299
many of them kids.

41
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,834
What happened?

42
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,048
A woman drove off a bridge
with her two kids in the car.

43
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,722
Witnesses are saying that
the woman started speeding,

44
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,201
she rammed a bunch of vehicles,

45
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,493
and then took a sharp right
off the bridge into the water.

46
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,607
Police believe
this was intentional.

47
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,630
Oh, my God. With her kids?

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,318
Let's cooperate with the
police and do our jobs, okay?

49
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,047
God, is she one of
those crazy moms

50
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,716
who tries to drown her kids?

51
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,772
Oh.

52
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,541
Maybe she needed a nanny.

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,844
What kind of mother
does that to her own kids?

54
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,859
Why is it somehow worse when a
woman kills her kids? That's sexist.

55
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,117
Women are just as crappy
and homicidal as men.

56
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,786
Is there something
you want to tell me?

57
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,553
Or a grand jury?

58
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,267
Shut up. I'm just
making a point.

59
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,269
It's not like I'm
advocating killing your kids.

60
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,971
Oh, hi, Dr. Kepner.
You heard Dr. Hunt.

61
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,622
We've got at least
six criticals on the way.

62
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,166
Why are you both standing
here? You're right. I'm sorry.

63
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:54,860
I told Jackson about the baby.

64
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,418
Oh, God!

65
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,431
I was just standing here
shouting about killing kids.

66
00:03:58,455 --> 00:03:59,865
Why didn't you
tell me to shut up?

67
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,940
Does she know? Uh, I don't know.

68
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,343
No. Right? I
mean, if she knew...

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,547
If you found out that your
unborn baby had a fatal disease,

70
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,215
you wouldn't be at work, right?

71
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,650
No.

72
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,169
What do we got?

73
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:16,549
Ten-year-old female, Mia James.

74
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,685
GCS of 14 but was
unconscious at the scene.

75
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,852
Deep facial lac.

76
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,788
Little brother and mom
are right behind us.

77
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,856
Mia, I'm Dr. Hunt.
Can you hear me?

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,840
Where's my mom? Is she okay?

79
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,411
We'll find out as soon as
we can. Let's get her inside.

80
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,385
Parker James, age five.

81
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,198
Minor injuries include facial
lacerations, left-arm deformity.

82
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,617
Normal vitals.
Where's my sister?

83
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,858
She's right inside, Parker.
We've got you, okay?

84
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:39,961
We got a Brooke James,
submerged restrained driver,

85
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,292
unresponsive since
we arrived on the scene.

86
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,060
She is hypotensive, tachycardic.

87
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,096
Wait. Is this the driver? Yeah.

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,070
Let's move. Come on.

89
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,322
Police want to question her, but I
said there's no way in her condition.

90
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,158
Did they say what
happened? Did she go nuts?

91
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,459
She could have lost her
footing on the gas pedal.

92
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,817
We do not know.

93
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,485
We do know she's hypotensive,
had a low D-stick reading

94
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,387
and free fluid in the belly.

95
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:07,989
She's too unstable for a CT.

96
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,378
Let's get her up to the OR now.

97
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:14,362
Hunt. Driver's in bad
shape. We're taking her up.

98
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,797
I'm gonna alert the OR.

99
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:18,266
I'm looking for
my wife and kids.

100
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,613
Brooke James.
Kids are Mia and...

101
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,403
Parker, right?

102
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,968
They said some woman hit
their car and drove off the bridge?

103
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,892
Mr. James, your wife
is on her way to surgery.

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
Your kids are being treated.

105
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,162
Your wife was the driver.

106
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,931
She drove off the bridge.

107
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,683
What? No. That's crazy.

108
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,968
Sir...

109
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,481
No, she wouldn't
do that. That's crazy.

110
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,016
Mr. James, can you
come with us? Excuse me.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,151
She wouldn't do that.
Can you come with us?

112
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,601
Mr. James. Thank you, sir.

113
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,937
She'd never do that. It's
a lie! WOMAN: <i>Dr. Grey?</i>

114
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,655
I'm here. We're on our way up.

115
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,179
I'm gonna want more scans,

116
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,058
3-D renderings, so I can
get to know this tumor better.

117
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,449
I'm gonna need to draw up
measurements and trajectories.

118
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,263
When do I get to speak
to her previous doctors?

119
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,231
Um, as soon as I
talk to Dr. Herman.

120
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,088
Great. When are you doing that?

121
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,437
It's a big cliff. You
just got to leap.

122
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,894
I stole medical records.

123
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,874
I racked up about a
thousand HIPAA violations.

124
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,576
It's not a cliff. That's prison.

125
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,910
And I'm too pretty for prison.

126
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,335
Arizona, you are
saving her life.

127
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,238
I'm saving her life, but
you made it possible.

128
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,507
Once you tell her,
once she understands,

129
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,409
she will be okay with it.

130
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,910
She'll be happy.

131
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,679
Ultimately, she
will be thrilled.

132
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,948
You want me to tell her?

133
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,328
No. I have to do
it. I have to do it.

134
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,352
I just need to figure
out how and when.

135
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,120
How and when.

136
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,709
That's my tumor.

137
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:37,195
That's my tumor!

138
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,748
Where did you get it
and why do you have it?

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,873
You showed my tumor

140
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,052
to other doctors

141
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,196
without my consent?

142
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,878
I needed to understand...

143
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,490
You have no right.
You stole them.

144
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,764
I had to.

145
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,594
Do you know how many
laws you're breaking right now?

146
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,133
You weren't telling me anything!

147
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,669
I can remove the tumor.

148
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,281
I don't know who you've
been seeing for this.

149
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,671
I'm sure they're great.

150
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,418
I'm sure they are
the best in their field.

151
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:09,093
But I can only tell you
they lack imagination.

152
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,402
They lack scope.

153
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,748
Your tumor is smart.

154
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:15,600
It's brilliant.

155
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,069
But so am I. I can beat it.

156
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,904
I will beat it.

157
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,545
I have a surgery.

158
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,873
Chief, uh, just
wanted to let you know

159
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,520
that I don't think Kepner's
gonna make it in today.

160
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,726
We had some news...

161
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,955
April's here.

162
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,346
Wait. What?

163
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,692
Yeah. She's been
here all morning.

164
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,060
She's just on her
way up to surgery.

165
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,417
Everything okay?

166
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,353
Uh, yeah, yeah. Thank you.

167
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,588
You know what? No.

168
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,502
Actually, I need you to pull
her out of surgery right now.

169
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,822
Avery, I can't... No, look.
She shouldn't operate.

170
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,745
She shouldn't even
be at work today at all,

171
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,547
so she should definitely
not be operating.

172
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,216
I need you to trust
me when I say that.

173
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:06,845
Kelly, more lap pads?

174
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,114
I think I see the
source of the cut.

175
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,258
I got it.

176
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:13,018
Owen?

177
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,125
Grey. Kepner.

178
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,593
How we doing in here?

179
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,612
It's a mess, but we've
got it under control.

180
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,701
April, I'm tagging you out.

181
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,085
I'll take this one.

182
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,453
Why?

183
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,522
I'll just...

184
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,630
I'll take this one.

185
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,093
April.

186
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,162
I'm good. You can go.

187
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,831
It's okay. I'm tagging you out.

188
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,014
No.

189
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,385
Owen?

190
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,866
Listen, it's okay.
We've got this.

191
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,656
Go ahead and go.

192
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,901
Do we have a problem here?

193
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,005
No.

194
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,776
Yes. Yes, there is. Jackson.

195
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,982
Jackson's my
problem, right, Hunt?

196
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,797
He went to you,
and now you know,

197
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,482
and you've decided
what's best for me.

198
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,661
Jackson's downstairs,

199
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,885
and he's waiting for you.

200
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm working here.

201
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,256
April.

202
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,976
I am taking over for you.

203
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,089
Is this an order? Is
that what's happening?

204
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,647
Are you ordering
me out of my OR?

205
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,732
I'm asking you.

206
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,983
Then, my answer is no.

207
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,669
Then it is an order.

208
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,124
That is an order, Kepner.

209
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,359
Fine.

210
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,069
You're in so much trouble.

211
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,572
Shut up. You are.
You wanted to go out.

212
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:38,226
Got some bruises and
contusions, nothing surgical.

213
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,556
You guys had a
pretty rough ride, huh?

214
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,780
It was awesome.

215
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,608
That car slammed right into us.

216
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:45,983
And then they flew off
the bridge, into the water!

217
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,263
And then all the other cars

218
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,165
started slamming
into each other!

219
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,301
It was like <i>Grand Theft Auto!</i>

220
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,519
Son of a bitch. Dad's gonna
freak when he sees the car.

221
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:54,692
Language.

222
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,406
Where is your dad?
You can't tell my dad.

223
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,641
Yeah, 'cause he's gonna
ground you till you're dead.

224
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,115
Shut your mouth, assface!

225
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,615
You're an assface.

226
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,368
You want to be so cool,

227
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,704
but you're a crappy driver,
and your mustache is stupid.

228
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,023
Wait. You were driving?
How old are you?

229
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,092
Eighteen.

230
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Yeah, and I'm 25, assface.

231
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,543
Duodenal perf,
duct looks severed.

232
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,811
Head of the pancreas
is badly injured.

233
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:19,945
What do you think,
trauma Whipple?

234
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,769
Looks like it.

235
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,633
What happened
with you and Kepner?

236
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,823
Nothing.

237
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:25,935
It better have been something.

238
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,503
You kicked her
out of her own OR.

239
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,227
She shouldn't even be in an OR.

240
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,078
She's got personal stuff.

241
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,814
We all have personal stuff.
My husband left me. I'm here.

242
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,166
Wait. What?

243
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,531
I thought he would have
e-mailed you by now.

244
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,598
He went to D.C.

245
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:40,838
When did this happen?

246
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,040
Last night.

247
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,407
You want to throw me out?

248
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,654
Should I go get my nails done,

249
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,277
have a good cry?

250
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,457
Listen, Jackson didn't tell
me what it was, just that...

251
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,559
Oh, so her husband
tells you to do something,

252
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,562
and that's enough...
Okay, it's about their baby.

253
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,586
It's bad.

254
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:29,804
Good.

255
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:31,650
And then your mom
started driving faster.

256
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,058
Did she say anything?

257
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,109
She told us to shut up.

258
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,611
She said that?

259
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,862
She's never said that.

260
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,182
We weren't even making noise.

261
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,246
And then we started
to hit other cars,

262
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,403
and then we went into the water,

263
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,350
and then a fireman
pulled me out.

264
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,073
God.

265
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,421
You said "shut up"
was a bad word.

266
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,556
You said...

267
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,313
No, it's okay. You're okay.

268
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,117
It's true, Parker.
You're a lucky kid.

269
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,770
All you need is a little splint
on that wrist, but that's it.

270
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,823
Okay. Your daughter's
still just a little groggy.

271
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,903
Just need to stitch up
that laceration on her face.

272
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,638
- She's good to go.
- Yes. Of course.

273
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,374
Please, do whatever
you have to do.

274
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,714
Dr. Avery, a word?

275
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,832
Uh, excuse me.

276
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,384
One second. Uh-huh.

277
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,390
Hey. You all right?

278
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,087
I'll get somebody to cover
for me, and we can just go...

279
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,543
What is wrong with you?

280
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,656
Letting a cop interrogate
a five-year-old?

281
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,913
They needed to know...

282
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,632
Those kids were almost
killed by their mother.

283
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,112
They're terrified.

284
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,746
Okay. Slow down.
They're in shock.

285
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,449
Listen, listen, I think
you're in shock, actually.

286
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:38,150
They shouldn't even be down
here. Get them out of here.

287
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,069
Get them someplace
safe. Get them admitted.

288
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,542
Okay. Let's just go home.

289
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,794
Have you seen
those people in there?

290
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,195
What that woman did?

291
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,743
I know, and there are
plenty of people here

292
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,977
that can take
care of them, right?

293
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,084
You need to...

294
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,233
I... I need to be in an OR.

295
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,051
But you seem to be making all
sorts of decisions for me today.

296
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,173
I'm trying to help you.

297
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,642
Yeah, you're not helping.

298
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,455
You go to Owen, and
then two men decide

299
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,873
what they think is
best for the little lady,

300
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,841
like I'm some helpless idiot,

301
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,544
and then I suddenly find myself
standing outside of my OR?

302
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,601
That is not helping!

303
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,169
Why don't you tell
me what is, then?

304
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,870
Talk to me instead
of running away.

305
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,659
Tell me what you need. Tell me
what I can do. Tell me how you feel.

306
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,709
Tell me something, anything.
Say something. Talk to me.

307
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,706
I'm trying to help you.
That's all I'm trying to do here.

308
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,192
Okay, okay. You
want to help? Yes.

309
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,761
Just get that family into a room

310
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,025
and stitch up that girl's face.

311
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,759
Everything okay?

312
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,651
No.

313
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:20,208
Everything is not okay.

314
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,499
We need your parents' names.

315
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,002
They need to know that
you're here and you're safe.

316
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,669
Just cough it up.

317
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,606
You don't say a word.
You're a brick wall.

318
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,687
Dylan's CT shows
mesenteric stranding

319
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,438
and some thickening
of the bowel wall.

320
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,346
Could be just a
mesenteric injury,

321
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,208
but it also looks like
a bucket-handle injury.

322
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,794
I'll just go in and take a look
first with the laparoscope.

323
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,818
Uh-uh.

324
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,019
No. Come here.

325
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,358
No, we need to get in there,

326
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,170
open him up and
see what's happening.

327
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,661
Laparoscopic isn't the standard.

328
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,095
You could miss a bowel perf.

329
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,442
But I'm trying to save this kid

330
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,676
a massive scar
and a long recovery.

331
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,927
Yeah, but we shouldn't risk...

332
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,384
Why do you keep saying "we"?

333
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,293
You're not doing
it at all. He's a kid.

334
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,015
You don't tell me what
I'm doing and not...

335
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,189
You're a kid.

336
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,819
I'm an attending pediatric
surgeon, and he's a kid.

337
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,870
It's my call,

338
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,175
and I'm going in
laparoscopically.

339
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,646
Oh.

340
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,081
Is that how it's gonna be?

341
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,432
Yeah. It is.

342
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,645
And maybe while I do that,

343
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,879
you can get his
little rat brother

344
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:23,621
to roll over on his
parents. Okay?

345
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,208
Let's get him ready to roll.

346
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:29,517
You're a brick wall, Jack.

347
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,745
Brick it!

348
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,053
Okay, that should
prevent any tamponading.

349
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,025
One woman loses it, and look
at all the damage she can do.

350
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,672
There's a chest contusion with
intermittent arrhythmias in bed six.

351
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,697
Can you take a look at
that next? Mmm-hmm.

352
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,398
Boy or girl? What?

353
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,585
Oh, are you guys
not finding out?

354
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,786
I am such a control freak.

355
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,122
I don't think I could
handle not knowing.

356
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,292
I would want to have
a list of names in mind.

357
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,628
That would be the hardest
part, I think, choosing the name.

358
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:08,132
Bed six, consult. Now, please.

359
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,017
Okay.

360
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,836
Uh, I'm looking for Greg
James. Is he still down here?

361
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,405
I need to talk to you.

362
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,986
Okay. So, you talked to Jackson.

363
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,921
Are you okay? Can I do anything?

364
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,113
You saw something
on my ultrasound.

365
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,448
Yes.

366
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,451
Yes, you saw something,
and you didn't say anything.

367
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,319
I know. I...

368
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,088
I was right there in the room.

369
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,257
It was my baby,
and you said nothing.

370
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,692
Nothing.

371
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,738
I just wanted to be
sure before I told you.

372
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,058
Oh, but you had no problem
going and telling other people.

373
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,482
You had no problem
telling Jackson

374
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,219
before I even had a
chance to process. I'm sorry.

375
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,255
To have you, of all people,
knowing before I did.

376
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:52,893
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,478
Yeah, you should be.

378
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,485
Mr. James is upstairs.
His kids were admitted.

379
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,176
Hello. This is OR one.

380
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,456
Did he tell Amelia? Did
he pass off his cases?

381
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,682
I'm sure he did. Derek
wouldn't just leave his patients.

382
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,450
Pickups.

383
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,619
Or his wife or his kids.

384
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,855
It's just hard to believe.

385
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,005
He did.

386
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,909
And what do you need?
Someone to blame?

387
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,745
It's my fault. I did
it. I told him to go.

388
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,963
Stapler.

389
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,877
Dr. Grey, her tox screen's back.

390
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,568
Any drugs or alcohol?
Antipsychotics? Antidepressants?

391
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,687
All negative. Damn it!

392
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,833
What are you after?

393
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,674
An explanation. Something.

394
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,382
Someone puts her
whole family in danger,

395
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,577
you want to find out
there was a good reason.

396
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,282
You want to believe she
didn't have any choice.

397
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,632
Have you talked to Cristina?

398
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,986
I presume you guys talk
all the time, especially now.

399
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,510
Yeah, we usually get on the
phone Friday nights for me,

400
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,429
Saturday mornings for
her, pour drinks, settle in.

401
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,899
So, today's Friday. You
gonna call her today?

402
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,103
Yeah, I've missed
the last couple.

403
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,689
Why?

404
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,803
Before she left, she said
something about Derek and I,

405
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,327
and she was right.

406
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,597
And I don't want
her to be right.

407
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,317
Hmm. Hmm.

408
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:27,838
Okay, so, no history
of diabetes in the family.

409
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,142
What about, uh, current
illnesses or mental illnesses?

410
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,188
Are you asking if
my wife's crazy?

411
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,212
No, we're trying to
see if there's something

412
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,613
that could have made her do...

413
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,449
To hurt my kids?
Nothing. She wouldn't.

414
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,755
I didn't think she would.

415
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,893
Brooke. I mean, she's, uh...

416
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,030
She's busy.

417
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,799
You know, she's
tired and stressed.

418
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,452
And she forgets things.

419
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,889
She's got a lot going on

420
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:07,061
with getting them from
school and violin and baseball.

421
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:11,372
And making sure they're happy.

422
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,400
And I...

423
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,836
I work too much.

424
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,338
I don't know.

425
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,106
I...

426
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,009
I don't know my wife.

427
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,182
I don't know anything anymore.

428
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,384
I left you alone
for a few minutes.

429
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,708
Am I gonna find my
wallet in your pocket?

430
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,554
I'm sorry that I went
behind your back.

431
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,811
You're understating it.

432
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,113
You betrayed me. I
thought I could trust you.

433
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,760
Shepherd is fully convinced that
she can do a complete resection.

434
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,886
She's convinced...
Shepherd is in a party of one.

435
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,071
If there's even the
slightest bit of hope,

436
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,617
don't you want to know that?

437
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,925
Robbins, can you
name the single worst,

438
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,828
most malignant symptom
of terminal cancer?

439
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,296
It's hope.

440
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,566
It's recurrent, and it
keeps creeping back in,

441
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,401
no matter how many
times it gets ripped apart.

442
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,121
Mayo gave me hope in a
phase three clinical trial. It failed.

443
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,376
NYU hoped that radiosurgery
would work. It didn't.

444
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,461
And Barrow had high, high hopes

445
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,181
for a potent combination
of chemo and ablation.

446
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,349
No go.

447
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,916
And every time the hope goes,

448
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,152
it takes chunks of you with it,

449
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,688
until you can only find comfort

450
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,791
in the one thing that you
know you can count on.

451
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,760
That this thing
is gonna kill you.

452
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,697
So you tell Shepherd to
keep her hope to herself.

453
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,566
Better yet, tell her
where to stick it.

454
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,560
Okay. Let's start
the anastomoses.

455
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:48,462
Yep. 4-0 Prolene.

456
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:50,108
Husband says there's
no history of diabetes.

457
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,493
Anything else? Uh, yeah.

458
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,262
She's been exhausted,
forgetful, stressed,

459
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,730
running around,
taking care of the kids,

460
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,031
I don't know. Maybe she snapped.

461
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,771
Running around
taking care of her kids

462
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,374
doesn't sound like a mom
who's about to kill herself,

463
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:01,709
in my experience.

464
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,388
Hmm. It doesn't make sense.

465
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,946
Her blood-sugar levels were
so low when she came in.

466
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,447
My mother always used to say,

467
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,800
"The pancreas is the
self-destruct button of the body."

468
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,081
And her pancreas
was really friable.

469
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,287
And her husband said
she's been forgetful.

470
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,875
I bet there's a tumor
on that pancreas.

471
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,576
Insulinoma.

472
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,089
That would explain her anxiety,

473
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,591
confusion, erratic behavior.

474
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,081
That would explain everything.

475
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,549
Yeah.

476
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,351
I need to call
your parents, Jack.

477
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,229
Look, you're scared.

478
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,830
You think you're in trouble now.

479
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,379
But believe me, the longer
you wait, the worse it'll be.

480
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,641
Your parents are
scared right now,

481
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,543
wondering where you are.

482
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:56,213
And they're getting more
and more scared by the minute.

483
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,150
When they finally see
you, they'll be so relieved.

484
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,021
But...

485
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,858
I mean, all that fear has
got to go somewhere.

486
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:14,415
All that fear will turn
into white-hot anger

487
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,935
that will banish you to a world
with no video games forever.

488
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,889
Trust me. I have
a little boy, too.

489
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,024
I'm a brick wall.

490
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,453
Give me your cell phone.

491
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,147
I'm seven.

492
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,866
Would you give your
seven-year-old a cell phone?

493
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,164
Look, I am trying to help you.

494
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,288
If you don't cooperate,

495
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,224
then I'll have to call
Child Protective Services.

496
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,493
Do you know what that means?

497
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:51,986
Hey, you want to
do this the hard way?

498
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,776
Then I will make that call.

499
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,259
You do what you've got to do.

500
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,249
I stole a car once,
when I was 12.

501
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,229
Didn't make it two blocks.

502
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,386
What stopped you?

503
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,753
A dumpster.

504
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,456
Mmm. First time I stole a
car, I sideswiped the mirror.

505
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,735
First time?

506
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,258
Second time, I ran out of gas.

507
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,327
Third, I got away with it.

508
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,790
Fourth... Fourth?

509
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,858
Flat tire.

510
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,827
Are you messing with me? No.

511
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:22,950
Was there a fifth?

512
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:24,484
Yeah. I lived in that one.

513
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,750
Damn it. JO: What just happened?

514
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,985
Mesentery's bleeding like
crazy. We got to open him up.

515
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,453
I thought that's what
we were trying to avoid.

516
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,938
We have no choice.
We got to get in there,

517
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,423
and we got to get in there now.

518
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,930
10 blade. 10 blade!

519
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,763
Are you almost done here?
I've got two tib-fib fractures

520
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,965
and an L45 compression
fracture in trauma four.

521
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,356
Okay. Hang on. All right,
I'm gonna count to three,

522
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,570
and then I'll do it, okay? Okay.

523
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,638
You ready? Yeah.

524
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,294
One, two...

525
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,565
Ah.

526
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,411
Always better when
you don't see it coming.

527
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,447
Go ahead and put a
shoulder sling on him, please.

528
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,631
All right, Kepner. What's next?

529
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,839
I already told you, if
you'd been listening.

530
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,375
What is going on? I'm fine.

531
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:13,078
No, you're not, and I know
because I'm the queen of taking

532
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,880
my personal crap
out on other people,

533
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:17,064
especially you,
and it looks like this.

534
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,667
What's going on? I
don't want to talk about it.

535
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,051
And I don't want
you snapping at me.

536
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,511
You can't have a
baby. Excuse me?

537
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,547
And it's what you want.

538
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:29,500
All you want is to have a
baby and love that baby

539
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,901
and nurture that baby
and raise that baby,

540
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,638
and this woman, this woman,

541
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:39,059
throws her perfectly
healthy kids off of a bridge.

542
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:41,261
Doesn't that just enrage you?

543
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,707
April... I'm saying

544
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,982
how are you not screaming
right now at what she's done?

545
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,418
To her kids? To
all of these people?

546
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,488
How is any of this fair?

547
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,200
April! April.

548
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,390
April.

549
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,209
Okay, now...

550
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:56,426
Patients are waiting.

551
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:02,833
Uh...

552
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,819
Will my daughter have a
scar for the rest of her life?

553
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,454
Oh.

554
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,699
I took my time.

555
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,408
Any scar, it would
be very minimal.

556
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,160
Ah.

557
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:16,113
Every time she looks in a
mirror, she'll remember this.

558
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,581
My kids,

559
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,352
they lost everything.

560
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,653
They have you.

561
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,299
I don't... I'm not
sure how good that is.

562
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,357
Look, I missed
this. You know, I...

563
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:32,930
Whatever was
happening with Brooke,

564
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,482
I just wasn't seeing it.

565
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,851
You know, you worry
about everything.

566
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,972
But I was not prepared for this.

567
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,643
Should I have seen it coming?

568
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:52,515
How could I have
prepared for this?

569
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,333
Why do we want to avoid
putting in another port?

570
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,558
Each incision increases the
chances of rupturing the membranes.

571
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,704
Exactly.

572
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,230
Hi. Robbins?

573
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,531
Um, sorry to interrupt.

574
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,333
I wanted to ask if I could
meet with you and talk.

575
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,769
You and me and April.

576
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,472
Her hands are a little
full right now, Doctor.

577
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,435
Of course. We're
almost done here.

578
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,110
Yeah, I meant after.
But soon, please.

579
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,344
I just, um...

580
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,617
I need to be prepared
for whatever it is.

581
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,351
We need to know
everything we can.

582
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,421
Just what it is, what we can do.

583
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,889
Everything.

584
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,197
I'll come find you.

585
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,492
All right.

586
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:41,849
My friends, the baby with
osteogenesis imperfecta.

587
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,230
Hmm. I see. You're
clear on what to tell them?

588
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,854
Yeah, I know.

589
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:49,406
Just remember what
I said about hope.

590
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,955
Don't make it any harder
for them than it already is.

591
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,993
Can you take this,
please? Robbins.

592
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,783
I am done here.

593
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,068
Robbins!

594
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:06,385
They examined every slice?

595
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:07,486
I stood in path
and watched them.

596
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,575
Have them do it again.

597
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:10,944
I did. There's no
evidence of insulinoma.

598
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,980
Get me the ultrasound.
The tumor is in here.

599
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,516
It doesn't have to be.

600
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,362
The husband says she
was stressed and overtaxed.

601
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,681
Sounds like she was headed
for a nervous breakdown.

602
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,972
It sounds like she's
a mother, Owen.

603
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,540
Where is that ultrasound?

604
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,354
I'm just saying people have
breakdowns for all kinds of...

605
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,944
Owen. Shut up.

606
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,970
You're not gonna find anything.

607
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,257
I'm not?

608
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,410
Give me your hand.

609
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,718
What's that, right there?

610
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:54,220
It's tiny. Feels like
the head of a pin.

611
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,307
Right. But it's there.
I knew it was there.

612
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,943
Excellent work, Dr. Grey.

613
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,928
Edwards. Scrub in.

614
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:04,698
Okay.

615
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,333
Whew! OWEN: Hmm.

616
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,428
Give me your phone.

617
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,763
I don't have a phone.

618
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,364
Give me your phone!

619
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,994
It's not mine. It's Dylan's.

620
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:24,801
This is not a game, Jack.

621
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,354
Your brother is very badly hurt.

622
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,607
He is lying open on
an operating table,

623
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,410
with two doctors working
very hard to save his life!

624
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:37,530
There are no restart
buttons. There's no replays.

625
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,149
This is not a game.

626
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,219
When it's over,
it's over. It's real.

627
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,555
Now, he needs his parents!

628
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,923
So what are you gonna do?

629
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,294
It's all my fault.

630
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,158
I wanted to go to
the ice-cream shop,

631
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:55,463
and I asked him
to drive me there.

632
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:59,219
I want to go home.
I want my mom.

633
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,531
She should wake up soon.

634
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,698
A tumor?

635
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,168
Benign, but it secretes insulin,

636
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,903
which causes major
fluctuations in glucose levels.

637
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,304
And that was...

638
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,235
The exhaustion, the
confusion, the forgetfulness,

639
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,711
the accident, it was the
tumor. And it's gone now.

640
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,221
I'm sorry. I should
have never thought it.

641
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,907
Not for one second.

642
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,375
I should have never thought
that you would hurt them.

643
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,094
I'm sorry.

644
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,031
It's only 4:00 a.m. there.

645
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,316
I told Cristina to go, too.

646
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,253
It was the only thing to do.

647
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,157
She had to go.

648
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,642
If she'd stayed, it
would have been worse.

649
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,710
I know that now.

650
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:03,099
Tell her "hello" for me.

651
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,791
Robbins, you don't
ever walk out of an OR

652
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,154
in the middle of
a procedure, ever.

653
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,190
You have a shot!
You have a chance!

654
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,492
And it may be small and it
may be risky, but it's a chance.

655
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,727
A chance that my friends
would give anything to have,

656
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,032
and you're ignoring
it, you're wasting it.

657
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,585
Dr. Grey?

658
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:22,812
I'm still here.

659
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,682
Lynn, the nanny?

660
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,451
Oh, Lynn!

661
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,586
I'm sorry. You're still here?

662
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,170
I am.

663
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,174
It's fine.

664
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:37,377
Uh, now, tell me what
it is you're needing.

665
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,212
Uh, I, um...

666
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,549
I need help with
the kids, obviously.

667
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:43,950
More specifically?

668
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,321
Uh, I need support.

669
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,857
My life and my work
is very unpredictable.

670
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:53,246
And I need someone
who understands that

671
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:55,946
and who can be
there when I can't

672
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,448
and who understands
that if I can't be there,

673
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:02,752
it's because I must
be where I am.

674
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,066
And I need someone
who believes in that

675
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,856
and who supports that.

676
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,414
I need a person

677
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,351
who is in it with me.

678
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,188
And who believes in that.

679
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,602
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

680
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,805
I know I seem like I'm crazy.

681
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,330
And I'm really not.

682
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,100
But I've just had this day.

683
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,303
No, no, no.

684
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,273
It's okay.

685
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,755
Let's talk.

686
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,914
See this here? This
linear hypointensity?

687
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,183
It is a CSF plane.

688
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,130
That's what can give
me a clean dissection.

689
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,754
If I leave behind one
billionth of a malignancy,

690
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,323
the tumor will be back,

691
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,503
so I am going to have to
use every tool in the box,

692
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,544
CUSA, lasers, fluorescein,
radioactive seeds.

693
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,114
I will not stop until I have
completely decimated

694
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:22,422
each and every last cell.

695
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:26,636
Chief? What do you think?

696
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,774
It is complex, and it is risky.

697
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,526
I see three scenarios here.

698
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,529
One, Shepherd operates
and I die on the table.

699
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:39,265
Two, Shepherd operates

700
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,129
and resects
something she shouldn't

701
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,753
and I wake up gorked.

702
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,655
And three, least likely of all,

703
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,892
Shepherd operates,
removes all of the tumor,

704
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,729
and I wake up alive,
deficit-free. Am I right?

705
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,983
Yes. But as I...

706
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:59,469
How far does the
tumor need to reach

707
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,455
before it becomes impossible
to resect in its entirety?

708
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,826
Nicole, we need to do this now.

709
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,545
How far?

710
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,877
Once it goes through
the optic apparatus

711
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:14,995
and breaches the hypothalamus,

712
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,364
there's no way.
I won't touch it.

713
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,373
If you clot or
bleed, it's too risky.

714
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,127
Great. Then, we wait.

715
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,373
And when the tumor starts
threatening the optic nerve

716
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,733
and heading to the
hypothalamus, you can operate.

717
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,601
That is a dangerous plan.

718
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,104
It's a stupid plan.
This is the plan.

719
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,373
You get at my tumor,
you get at my knowledge,

720
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,509
I get at my life.

721
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,544
Everyone's happy.

722
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,641
When did the parents get here?

723
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,108
A few minutes ago.

724
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,588
I'm waiting to see
if they hug that kid

725
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,846
or slap him.

726
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,781
You're a really good mom.

727
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,783
What makes you say that?

728
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,886
You've been riding me all day,
making sure I don't screw up.

729
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:09,455
Crap, you've been
doing it for years.

730
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:13,209
It sucks, it's
annoying, but it's nice.

731
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,281
Tuck stole a candy bar
a couple of weeks ago.

732
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,000
I only found out
about it last night.

733
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:23,870
I got so mad. I yelled at him.

734
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,401
Turns out, Ben already
made him go back to the store

735
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,865
and pay for the damn thing.
I didn't even know about it.

736
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,315
I'm so busy at work, I
haven't been there to...

737
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,748
How do I watch out for my
own kid if I'm not even there?

738
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,071
How do I do that?

739
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,875
I stole a bunch of stuff.

740
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,426
I turned out okay.

741
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,834
Take her up to the ICU and
check her coags every hour.

742
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,269
Yes, Doctor.

743
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:57,770
Who's next?

744
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,039
That's it.

745
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,824
Take a look at the board, babe.

746
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,395
Everyone's been either
admitted or discharged.

747
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,931
No, there were at
least 25 patients here.

748
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,551
And you treated every one.

749
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,819
It's damn good you
were down here.

750
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,058
Listen, um,

751
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:25,532
you and I have a real
chance here, you know?

752
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,501
We're able to see
this thing coming.

753
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,370
Then we are gonna
find out exactly what it is

754
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,506
and prepare ourselves.

755
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,352
I already talked to Arizona.
She's gonna sit down with us.

756
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,437
We're gonna get some answers.

757
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,678
I already have answers.

758
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:41,614
Jackson, I spent all
night looking it up.

759
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,649
I pulled case study
after case study.

760
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,930
Yeah, I did the same thing,
but those are other cases.

761
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,932
There are four types of
osteogenesis imperfecta,

762
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,890
ranging from a manageable
disability to completely fatal.

763
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,526
Types II and III
are the most severe.

764
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:54,772
I'm talking about our baby.

765
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,878
So am I.

766
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,698
I studied my ultrasounds.

767
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,134
Best case,

768
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,470
our kid gets
surgery after surgery.

769
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:08,641
Worst case, our kid lives
only minutes after birth.

770
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,593
Mmm-hmm.

771
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:15,215
I don't... I don't need answers.

772
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:20,953
What I needed today
was just to do something,

773
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,839
to treat things I could treat,

774
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,508
to help people I could help.

775
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,398
At the very least, undo
some of the damage

776
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,847
this lunatic woman
did to her kids

777
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,314
and all of these people here.

778
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,233
She had a tumor.

779
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,621
It turns out she
had an insulinoma.

780
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,453
Causes cognitive deficits.

781
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,762
Hunt told me all about it.

782
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:42,058
Look, she was not
trying to hurt anyone.

783
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:46,596
She had no control.

784
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,260
Why?

785
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,798
Why would that happen?

786
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,135
Why would God give her kids,
give her a family, and let that...

787
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:12,238
Why would God let that happen?

788
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,607
I don't understand it!

789
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:17,794
You can do everything
right, and it doesn't even...

790
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,465
Why?

791
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,960
I don't know.

792
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,490
I don't know.

793
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:35,010
I... I just...

794
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,591
I don't want you to hold me
'cause if you hold me, I'll start to cry,

795
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,649
and I don't want
to start crying.

796
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,853
'Cause if I start crying,
I will not be able to stop.

797
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,739
I will never be able to stop.

798
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,065
Okay.

799
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,076
Okay.

800
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,645
Okay.

801
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,390
Whatever you need,

802
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,236
I'm here.

803
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:06,358
Did I tell you that it's a boy?

804
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,963
We're having a boy.

805
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,168
<i>When shock wears off,</i>

806
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,874
<i>when the body can accept
that a trauma has happened,</i>

807
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,681
<i>when it can let
down its defenses...</i>

808
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,322
Are you there?

809
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,623
Uh, no. I'm about to, um...

810
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,827
Meredith?

811
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:43,747
I don't want to fight anymore.

812
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,716
I don't, either.

813
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,384
<i>And I don't want you gone.</i>

814
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,720
I know that I told
you to go, but...

815
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,524
I mean, this isn't us.

816
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,659
This isn't how we end, is it?

817
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,547
I don't want it to. I'm trying.

818
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,198
I'm trying, too.

819
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,702
Listen, my flight's
been delayed all day.

820
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,605
I'm still at the airport.
I can come home.

821
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,471
<i>It's a scary moment.</i>

822
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,193
Do I come home?

823
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:17,897
What do we want to
promise each other?

824
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:21,500
That you'll love me,
even when you hate me.

825
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,339
To love each other even
when we hate each other.

826
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:27,518
<i>It's vulnerable.</i>

827
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,525
No. No, go.

828
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,427
Meredith.

829
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,262
<i>You know, in a good way. Go.</i>

830
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,948
And do what you have to do.

831
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,016
We can do this. People do this.

832
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:40,570
No running, ever.

833
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,272
Nobody walks out, no
matter what happens.

834
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:45,174
People do, yes. <i>Okay.</i>

835
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,393
So, go and do
what you have to do.

836
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:49,245
And we will figure this out.

837
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,063
We can do this.

838
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,483
We can do this.

839
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,234
Okay.

840
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:56,369
<i>Okay.</i>

841
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,639
Call me when you land.

842
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,140
<i>And, Derek?</i>

843
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,575
Yes?

844
00:41:02,644 --> 00:41:04,544
<i>I'm going to miss you.</i>

845
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:07,547
This can work.

846
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:08,881
We will make this work.

847
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,566
We will.

848
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,451
Are you still there?

849
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,552
Meredith?

850
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,502
Meredith? Meredith,
I'm losing you.

851
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:19,759
Derek?

852
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:33,389
This is forever.

853
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:39,311
Sign.

854
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,025
Now what?

855
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,860
Now I kiss the bride.

856
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,209
<i>The shock response
had protected us,</i>

857
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,215
<i>and it just might have saved us.</i>
