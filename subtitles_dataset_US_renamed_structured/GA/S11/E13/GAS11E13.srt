1
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,307
<i>I don't like questions
without any answers,</i>

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,792
<i>like, "Where do we
go when we die?"</i>

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,062
<i>I mean, I know what happens
physiologically speaking,</i>

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,131
<i>but beyond that,
what really happens?</i>

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>Anything?</i>

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,998
<i>That's what you start asking
yourself when you live on a clock.</i>

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,955
<i>All these questions
without any answers,</i>

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,859
<i>they'll drive you nuts.</i>

9
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:30,729
<i>That's why I like what I do,
fixing babies, birthing babies.</i>

10
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,982
<i>No ambiguity there, no
questions, just answers,</i>

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,217
<i>clear, precise, obvious answers.</i>

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,154
<i>And life, beautiful new life.</i>

13
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,388
<i>Hope for the future.</i>

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,023
<i>God, I miss that.</i>

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,493
Morning!

16
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,613
Robbins, are you
ever not chirpy?

17
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,791
Does that ever happen?

18
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,799
Are you ever not snarky?

19
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,234
Also, you snore.

20
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,402
I can't crash here again
tonight without earplugs.

21
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,172
Okay, so, we have seven cases
today. The first one is in two hours.

22
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,009
Also, it's Friday, so that's
MRI day. You know the drill.

23
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,680
47 minutes of my very
limited life-span wasted.

24
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:06,614
Come on, come on.

25
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:07,760
God! I'm coming.

26
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:08,845
Stop chirping.

27
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,118
Stop snarking.

28
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,231
<i>After this, we've got
the diaphragmatic hernia.</i>

29
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,300
<i>Baby's 27 weeks. We'll do a
tracheal balloon occlusion...</i>

30
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,357
Hey.

31
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,809
Figured you could use this...

32
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,355
<i>Which should, if we're
lucky, ensure the blood...</i>

33
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,212
before the big lecture.

34
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,721
Um, thanks. Thank you.

35
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,496
<i>They already scheduled
a follow-up procedure</i>

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,353
<i>on the baby, as well.</i>

37
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,856
You're cultivating quite
a bit of buzz, you know?

38
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,374
Really?

39
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:35,443
I heard from two hospitals
wanting us to record your talk.

40
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,976
<i>But we won't be too
close to the due date.</i>

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,778
And if... I have a lot
on my plate right now,

42
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,869
just with Herman and her tumor.

43
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,421
Her surgery.

44
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,324
I really need to focus...

45
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,510
On the tumor.

46
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,257
Don't need any
distractions, and you're...

47
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,214
Very hard to ignore.

48
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,732
Hey, I... It was just coffee.

49
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,596
No, I... I so
appreciate the coffee.

50
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,104
I was just getting some
coffee for myself, and...

51
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:05,006
It's good coffee.
It's great coffee.

52
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,343
I can just get my own if you...

53
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,579
I mean, you can get
your own so easily.

54
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,492
I don't want to get
my own coffee. I...

55
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:15,717
I mean, I do. I can. I will.

56
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:18,905
I can get my own coffee
all day long. I just...

57
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:20,905
Owen.

58
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,534
Thank you for
bringing me the coffee.

59
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,512
I really like it.

60
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,514
You're welcome.

61
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,333
<i>So, how's my head?</i>

62
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:34,819
The tumor seems stable.

63
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,633
I was worried about
the inferomedial margin,

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,723
but the good news is,
there's no sign of growth.

65
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,025
It hasn't invaded
the optic nerve yet.

66
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,438
Well, how long till it does?

67
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,782
I need a number, Shepherd.
I have things to plan.

68
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,265
About six weeks,
maybe eight if you

69
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,646
go in for the localized radiation
treatments I've prescribed for you.

70
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,203
I'd like for those
to start today.

71
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,383
No, no, no, no. I
tried that. Hated it.

72
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,539
Doctor's orders.

73
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,157
It is our best chance to shrink

74
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,821
the part of the tumor
on your optic chiasm.

75
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,371
Crap. MIRANDA: Glenda Castillo!

76
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,608
We're headed to surgery,
Dr. Bailey. No time to talk.

77
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,809
But you haven't
given me an answer.

78
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,343
Actually, I have. It was no.

79
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,712
But you haven't given
me the right answer.

80
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:06,813
You could at
least meet with her.

81
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,347
I've seen the case, okay?

82
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:11,234
I'm sorry, but I'm working
on a very limited time frame

83
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,337
with a very specific list of
surgeries to teach Robbins,

84
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,972
and Glenda Castillo
isn't one of them.

85
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,496
Okay, well, as a personal
favor to me, just me...

86
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,577
I have no time to
make it personal.

87
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,016
It's a no. I'm sorry.

88
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:23,713
I'll get you some
names, good people.

89
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,270
She can see one of them.

90
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,406
Um, sorry.

91
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,125
Three down, all these to go.

92
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,005
We've got four months'
worth of surgeries up here.

93
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,873
I mean, how are we gonna
get four months of surgeries

94
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,996
done in eight weeks?

95
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,976
We just do, I suppose.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,645
You'll do the next
one yourself. I'll watch.

97
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,901
What?

98
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,048
No. No, thank you. I appreciate
the vote of confidence,

99
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,583
but I'm not even actually
sure that I know how...

100
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,518
I need to see what
you've learned,

101
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,387
what you can and
can't do on your own

102
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,257
while I'm still around to
fix it when you screw up.

103
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,814
Gee, thanks.

104
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,076
It's not a vote of
confidence. It's a necessity.

105
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,095
Training wheels
are off, Robbins.

106
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,362
Time is up. What's next?

107
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,436
Your radiation treatment.

108
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,636
Ugh.

109
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,283
Radiation hasn't worked yet.

110
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,619
I don't see why it's suddenly
supposed to start working.

111
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:20,737
Radiation is bull...

112
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,544
Shepherd says
that it's necessary.

113
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,113
She's the doctor here.

114
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,838
"Life will out."

115
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,118
The origins and lessons of life

116
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,287
and evolution are
long and complex,

117
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,730
but what they basically
boil down to is, life will out.

118
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:47,118
Life will always find a
way to continue. Always.

119
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,988
Life... Will... Out.

120
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,427
This is a massive
grade IV astrocytoma.

121
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,540
I want you to take a look at it.

122
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,498
Really look.

123
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,283
Look at its size.

124
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,918
Look at the way it
invades healthy tissue.

125
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,087
Look at its vasculature.

126
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,908
It is blood and
tissue and flesh.

127
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,806
It's growing,

128
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,598
adapting to its environment,
struggling to survive, to stay alive.

129
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,101
It is alive.

130
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,131
We don't like to
think of it that way,

131
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,022
but it's nested in the
womb of a human brain,

132
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,243
feeding on its host,
growing and fighting for life,

133
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:29,405
almost like a fetus.

134
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,146
No, scratch that.

135
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:34,177
Let's just for science and
giggles say exactly like a fetus.

136
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,380
Because like a healthy
fetus, it is thriving.

137
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,533
You know, there are even some
types of tumors that grow teeth,

138
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,301
hair,

139
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,725
a stray eye.

140
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,873
Have I repulsed you?

141
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,074
It's gross, right?

142
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,215
Yeah.

143
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,846
I mean, that is a problem.

144
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,421
Nobody wants something
that nasty in their head.

145
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,425
I'd like you for one
moment to consider the idea

146
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,195
that, to the tumor,
we are the problem,

147
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,432
we are the invader.
We are the danger.

148
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,769
To the tumor, we are the cancer.

149
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,637
And the tumor?

150
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,207
Well, the tumor sees itself as
a sweet, cute, fat-cheeked baby

151
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,355
just trying to make
its way into the world,

152
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,112
and we want to
stop it, destroy it,

153
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,701
tear it from its happy
little home like barbarians.

154
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,834
To the tumor,

155
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,788
we are the soulless,
murderous monsters.

156
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,207
Why do I do this?

157
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:36,278
Why do I call it "baby"
and talk about killing it?

158
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,763
<i>Because this kind of
tumor deserves respect.</i>

159
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,634
<i>It deserves a little humanity.</i>

160
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,769
Charming, isn't it?

161
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,072
They put clouds on the
ceiling to distract you.

162
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:50,025
Least they could do is put
something interesting up there,

163
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,226
like porn.

164
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,013
It's not just a tumor.

165
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,699
It's ingenuity.

166
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,152
It's strength.

167
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,586
It's adaptability.

168
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,705
It's poetry.

169
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,374
It's one of God's masterpieces.

170
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,943
It is alive.

171
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,537
You okay?

172
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,949
Sure.

173
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,214
<i>And like any living thing,
it wants to stay alive.</i>

174
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:37,839
<i>Like any living thing, it is
going to fight like hell to survive.</i>

175
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:41,254
And when I saw open that skull
and come face-to-face with it,

176
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,422
with that tumor,
with that living thing,

177
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,686
it will be almost
impossible to remove...

178
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,886
Well, I'll see you after.

179
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,781
<i>Because it would rather</i>

180
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,532
<i>destroy the brain that holds it</i>

181
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,090
<i>than go gently
into that good night.</i>

182
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,893
<i>It is alive.</i>

183
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,698
And what's it all come down to?

184
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,115
Life...

185
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,884
<i>Will...</i>

186
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,319
<i>Out.</i>

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,422
<i>So, our fat-cheeked-baby tumor</i>

188
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,202
<i>that's nestled in that brain,</i>

189
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,737
<i>it's a creature of habit.</i>

190
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,479
<i>It has the same routine
day in and day out.</i>

191
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:55,116
<i>To grow, to spread
out, to take up space.</i>

192
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,551
<i>That's it.</i>

193
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,208
At this point, our baby tumor
is so enmeshed, so invasive,

194
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,676
it's touching virtually
every single brain structure.

195
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,690
It's pushed existing
tissue aside,

196
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:12,400
shoved brain matter out of
the way to find room for itself.

197
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,171
How do you remove it without
destroying the brain around it?

198
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,823
How do you kill the baby
without killing the mother?

199
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,779
I stare at these scans, and
the tumor stares back at me,

200
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:27,088
daring me to try to extract it.

201
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,534
I mean, this tumor
is bold and brazen.

202
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,815
This tumor thinks
it's in charge.

203
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,951
This tumor thinks
it owns the place.

204
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,920
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

205
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,221
You missed your radiation
session this morning.

206
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,155
I told you, I'm not
doing that anymore.

207
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,462
That is not your call.

208
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:44,215
My tumor, my head...
It absolutely is my call.

209
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,167
The tumor will be exponentially

210
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,085
easier to remove
after the radiation.

211
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,255
Nicole, please.

212
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,456
Go to radiation!

213
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,074
I will think about it.

214
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,676
Okay.

215
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:55,988
<i>The thing about
a tumor like this is,</i>

216
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,923
<i>you can't let it intimidate you.</i>

217
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,381
<i>The tumor isn't
smarter than you.</i>

218
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:03,250
<i>You just need a plan of attack.</i>

219
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,697
Here. Feel that?

220
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:05,998
You must be methodical.

221
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,066
You want to find a spot

222
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,300
with just the right
amount of give.

223
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,002
That's where you
want to cut. Scalpel.

224
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,060
Point of access is key.

225
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,806
- You're up, Robbins.
- I know.

226
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,307
I've never done
that part before.

227
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,949
So, um, you were
really serious about that?

228
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,395
It's time. Make the cut.

229
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,463
But I don't know...
I've never...

230
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,952
Make the cut.

231
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,913
<i>And then you start.</i>

232
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,485
That is the most daunting step,

233
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,034
pushing a blade into that
first squishy blob of flesh...

234
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,299
Because the first cut
is what sets the tone.

235
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:50,098
It determines every single
move from that point on.

236
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,669
So, you have to be careful.

237
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,054
You have to be sure.

238
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,390
Or you're in trouble.

239
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,773
It's like a...

240
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,797
Just look at them.

241
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,363
Who?

242
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,378
Arizona and Herman, they're
practically joined at the hip.

243
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,578
I'll take one of those, too.

244
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,946
Well, she is Herman's fellow.

245
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,648
Isn't she sort of supposed
to follow Herman around?

246
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,872
They're laughing all the time.

247
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,908
And Arizona seems so...

248
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,376
Happy, like really happy.

249
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,478
So?

250
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,374
You seem happy... Ish.

251
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,442
What do you even care?

252
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,466
I don't, obviously.

253
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:27,335
I'm just making conversation.

254
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,967
Don't you guys think it's weird
how they're always together?

255
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,257
They're not always together.

256
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,870
They do bunk up
together sometimes.

257
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,204
What? Alex.

258
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,672
Robbins has been
crashing with Herman.

259
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,579
She hasn't slept at
the house all week.

260
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,496
What? MEREDITH: Alex.

261
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,148
I don't mean like that.

262
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:40,848
They're not together
together, and you know that.

263
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,533
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,613
Arizona used to hate her.
Now they're having sleepovers?

265
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,749
Well, it's a good thing, right,
that they're getting along?

266
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,734
Herman's not exactly
the warmest person, so...

267
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:49,974
Yeah, whatever.

268
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,121
When you talk to Derek tonight,

269
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,288
would you ask him something
for me without saying it's for me?

270
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,512
I don't know that I...

271
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,614
Just ask him what he'd use

272
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,627
to avoid disrupting
the Gratiolet radiations

273
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,263
off the geniculate
body of the thalamus.

274
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,114
Why don't you ask
him that? No, no, no.

275
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,367
No, no. That's the point. You
ask him. I can't ask him for help.

276
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,735
I cannot listen to the
smugness in his voice.

277
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,209
You can hear it.

278
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,256
He has transcontinental
smugness. You know what?

279
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,375
Forget it. I'm fine.
I don't need him.

280
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,848
I don't need Derek. I
will figure it out myself.

281
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,650
When did this happen?

282
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,554
She found the perfect rebound
without having to actually find a rebound.

283
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,801
I mean, she just gets all
the good times and the fun,

284
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,394
none of the bad times or the
mess, no chance of getting hurt.

285
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:28,663
You don't even have
to wax. It's not fair!

286
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,394
Oh, my God. Am I seriously
wishing for a sexless relationship

287
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,731
where I don't have to groom
myself? Is that where I am now?

288
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,920
It sounds good to me.

289
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,229
Welcome to my life these days.

290
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,601
You two chicks need to get laid.

291
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,902
That also sounds good to me.

292
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,820
Not without the grooming.

293
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,578
It's in there. He can find it.

294
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,007
What, he can't do
a little work first?

295
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,111
I like her.

296
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,471
Eddie.

297
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,056
Excuse me?

298
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,542
Glenda Castillo, the patient you

299
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,970
and Herman turned
down last week,

300
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,860
her husband's name was Eddie.

301
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,313
I lost him six months ago

302
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,383
after he was injured
in a head-on collision.

303
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,184
My hands were inside of his body

304
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,903
when his heart stopped beating.

305
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,923
My hands held Glenda's when I
told her Eddie died on my watch.

306
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,359
Three weeks later, she
found out she was pregnant.

307
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,880
She's not insured, but she
remembered me and this hospital,

308
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:22,100
so, she came here to see if I
could give her some prenatal care,

309
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,868
and guess what we found out.

310
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,604
Her baby has a tumor,

311
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,408
a large, dangerous tumor

312
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,093
that's not just messing
with the baby's system,

313
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,896
it's messing with hers.

314
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:38,499
I couldn't save her husband's
life, but I can help save her baby.

315
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,501
I owe this woman that much.

316
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,821
Herman has to take
her on as a patient.

317
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,439
Just have her meet
Glenda, all right?

318
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,186
Then she'll... I can't, I can't!

319
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,288
I can't trick her into seeing a
patient she doesn't want to treat.

320
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,356
Who's in charge of her schedule?

321
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,113
Who tells her where
to go and when?

322
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:56,317
Who tells her what surgery or
post-op or anonymous consult

323
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,226
she should see next?

324
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,090
I'm concerned about
her blood pressure.

325
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,843
It's increased to 140
systolic in the past week,

326
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,612
and her swelling's gotten worse.

327
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,825
I used to have ankles.

328
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,165
Now I have balloons with toes.

329
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,881
So, your baby has a large
tumor in his lower back.

330
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,038
It's most likely benign,

331
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,507
but because of its size
and vascular nature,

332
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,927
it could cause an accumulation
of fluids in the baby.

333
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:26,080
But the tumor can
be removed, right?

334
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,211
Dr. Bailey says amazing
things about you,

335
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,435
that you're one of the best.

336
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,786
Bailey said that?

337
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,504
How flattering.

338
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,972
That was Glenda Castillo.

339
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,675
I told you no twice now.

340
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,511
And you, how am I
supposed to trust you at all

341
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,656
when you pull
something like that?

342
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,214
She didn't do anything

343
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,328
except try to get your help on
a patient who needs your help.

344
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,653
But if you heard her
story, if you knew she was...

345
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,521
Is that how Bailey
convinced you?

346
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,525
It's a tactic, Robbins, appealing
to your sad, bleeding heart.

347
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,810
Doesn't work with me.

348
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,407
Well, then, let me
appeal to your ego.

349
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,925
You walk around
here telling anyone

350
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,427
who will listen
that you're the best.

351
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,534
Well, then, be the best.

352
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:07,755
You can save her baby's
life, so save that baby's life!

353
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,242
No.

354
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,277
What the hell? Robbins, drop it.

355
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,301
No, I get that I've seen
tumors like that before,

356
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,848
but this can't all be
about my education.

357
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,572
I mean, at some
point, I have to...

358
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,569
At some point, we have to
make decisions and stick to them.

359
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,771
I wish we had
time, but we don't.

360
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,076
We have very little control
over the time we have,

361
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,729
and we have a plan.

362
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,998
Can't we make an exception?

363
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,661
Can't we just, you know,
sort of adjust the plan?

364
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,630
You... Fine. You want to?

365
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,554
Adjust the plan.

366
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,372
What are you doing?

367
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,353
Take down one of these cards so
we have time to help Mrs. Castillo.

368
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,709
Which one?

369
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,059
How about Meghan Carlson,
congenital airway obstruction?

370
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,508
Her husband's in Iraq right now.

371
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,066
Or Julie Hall, vasa previa.

372
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,280
She went through two
years of fertility treatments.

373
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:55,402
So, pick one.

374
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,866
Decide which baby
doesn't get to live

375
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,940
so Glenda Castillo's does.

376
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,042
Go ahead.

377
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,393
Pick a card. You choose.

378
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,884
That's what I thought.

379
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,193
No.

380
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,278
No.

381
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:39,782
Get me out!

382
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,333
Get me out of here!

383
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,402
Get me out!

384
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,964
You have to. I don't.

385
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:46,565
The radiation treatments
are going to help.

386
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,133
They are gonna shrink
the borders of the tumor,

387
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:50,302
which will make
it easier to resect.

388
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:51,792
It's a minimal gain for you.

389
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,523
I will take what I can get. I
am trying to save your life!

390
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,114
You are making me
feel like I've already died.

391
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,932
I'm sick. I'm losing my hair.

392
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,335
I refuse to spend the
last few months of my life

393
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,703
feeling like a pile of crap.

394
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,788
No more.

395
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,323
That's final.

396
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:07,886
<i>Dr. Stanley, please report...</i>

397
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,577
I am going to give you
more than a few months.

398
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:13,347
I am going to save your life.

399
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,061
And I am about to get up
in front of a bunch of people

400
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,163
and tell them how
I plan on doing it.

401
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,055
It makes it really
hard for me to do that

402
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,558
or even care about doing that
when you don't seem to care at all!

403
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,944
Well, that's your problem.

404
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,301
Well, the word's spreading.

405
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,356
This was a good idea, Hunt, a
master class in neurosurgery.

406
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,591
This is gonna put Amelia
Shepherd on the map.

407
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,753
Unless it fails.

408
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,143
It won't.

409
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,813
If it does,

410
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,115
there's a lesson in that, too.

411
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,837
So, she just spitballs
this stuff with you?

412
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,774
It's just the two of you
hanging out, talking tumor?

413
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,019
Pretty much.

414
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,755
I want to talk tumor!

415
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,712
I want to talk tumor so bad.

416
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,316
Oh, my God. Look
at that thing. Yeah.

417
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:08,836
Previous attempts to treat
Dr. Herman's tumor with radiation

418
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,955
proved unsuccessful.

419
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,290
I had hoped

420
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,559
to use high radioactive
doses to reduce the margins,

421
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:20,414
but at this juncture, that
course seems to be unrealistic.

422
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,951
But that's not enough
to make me quit.

423
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,756
This tumor is fierce and
intimidating and aggressive,

424
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,141
but so am I.

425
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,942
Now, the trick to this is,

426
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:38,977
you can't touch the vessel
while you're lasering the mass,

427
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,046
not even a little
bit. If you do...

428
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,430
The field fills with blood,
obscuring the camera,

429
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,106
and visualization
is compromised.

430
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:48,342
First, I need to see
the tumor, all of it,

431
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,378
every margin, every
last ripple and ridge.

432
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:53,413
So, what do you do?

433
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,581
I have two choices,

434
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,561
open her up and stop
the bleeding if I can,

435
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,220
or deliver the baby
regardless of how early.

436
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,332
Very good.

437
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,723
So, I will employ
fluorescein dye

438
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,125
to delineate every
border of the tumor,

439
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:10,531
to help me anticipate every
possible problem before I get to it.

440
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,167
<i>I don't want to leave
anything up to chance.</i>

441
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,780
What happened?

442
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,114
The pressure's dropped.

443
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,550
She's in a lot of pain,
and she's cramping.

444
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,373
It hurts! It hurts, it hurts!

445
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,803
It's okay, Julie. We've
got you, we've got you.

446
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,193
She has a vasa previa.

447
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,672
She's scheduled for
an ablation tomorrow.

448
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,674
I've been trying to get
her pressure back up,

449
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,138
but there is no fetal heartbeat.

450
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,018
Damn it. Where's her husband?

451
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,816
Is that blood? I'm bleeding?

452
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,800
Gown me. Keep him out of here.

453
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,525
Robbins, you're gonna get this
baby out right here, right now.

454
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,793
Here?

455
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,406
We need a C-section
tray set up in here.

456
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,675
Call peds. Get
an incubator, stat.

457
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,360
Wait! What? I'm gonna
have the baby now?

458
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,595
Julie, I'm gonna give yo u
something to calm you down, okay?

459
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,546
I never had to do a crash
"C" on my own before, okay?

460
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,182
- I mean, not like this.
- You know what to do.

461
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,840
It's the same three basic steps,
just like any other C-section,

462
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,708
open the abdomen,
open the uterus, deliver.

463
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,943
Okay, I'm okay.

464
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,544
Pressure's steady at 100/60.

465
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,990
Okay, I can do this. Betadine.

466
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,030
Okay.

467
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:02,878
Robbins? I'll
do... I'll do this.

468
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,152
It's fine, Robbins. I'll do it.

469
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,478
Scalpel.

470
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,871
I'm so sorry.

471
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:15,129
We did everything we could do.

472
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,066
I'm so sorry.

473
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,351
Good job. Let's go.

474
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,569
Stop crying.

475
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,737
For the love of...

476
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,521
Stop crying! I'm...

477
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,728
Stop it now! Just...

478
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,492
Stop it right now.

479
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,983
There's no time for crying.

480
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,751
We have work to do.

481
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,392
What? How... How can you even...

482
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,222
'Cause that's the
way it goes, Robbins.

483
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,965
Call Bailey.

484
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,033
Tell her we're on.

485
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,137
<i>Now, arguably,</i>

486
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,183
the most important
part of the brain

487
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,367
is the part that makes us hope,

488
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,210
dream,

489
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,129
imagine.

490
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,065
One singular, almost
immeasurable part

491
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,152
is what makes you you

492
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,538
and me me,

493
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,974
and everyone, everyone.

494
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,443
It's technically
called the fornix,

495
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,913
but I call it the "dream box."

496
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,961
The question is

497
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,883
what happens when the
dream box is being invaded,

498
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,809
when a tumor is so
large, so demanding,

499
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,940
it's sucking the dream box dry?

500
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,849
It's taking over, it's stealing
away hopes and dreams.

501
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:21,455
Imagine, when that
tumor is removed, what...

502
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,041
What will actually be left?

503
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,595
Or, rather, who is left?

504
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:30,564
Anything?

505
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,267
Anyone?

506
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:36,981
I remember my
mom telling me once

507
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:39,134
that when we die,
we go to heaven.

508
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,958
I couldn't picture it.

509
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,206
All I could imagine was
what we see in cartoons,

510
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,797
little people in robes with
wings, sitting on clouds.

511
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,434
But nobody really knows
what's up there, do they?

512
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,553
When I was a kid, I used to
think that we were like dandelions,

513
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,490
like, the part that makes us us

514
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,960
would just blow away
and land and grow into...

515
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,290
I don't want to be buried, by
the way. Have me cremated.

516
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,763
Excuse me?

517
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,743
If I survive the surgery
but don't wake up,

518
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,568
give me five days, a week, tops,

519
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,065
then pull the plug. This is...

520
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,516
We don't need to
be talking about this.

521
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,285
If I do wake up but I'm
dependent on vents or tubes,

522
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,670
pull the plug then, too.

523
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,654
You know what? You're
not... You're not dying.

524
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,957
You're not gonna wake up gorked.

525
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,358
Shepherd knows what
she's doing. She does.

526
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,460
Okay. Sure.

527
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,524
She does! I heard you.

528
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,050
That bird is gonna poop on us.

529
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,352
What's next today?

530
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,775
Glenda Castillo.

531
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,788
I'm so glad you
brought me back in.

532
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,113
Have a look.

533
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:40,450
Well, the teratoma has grown.
It's showing early signs of hydrops.

534
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,786
Is everything okay?

535
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,649
Glenda, your
baby's retaining fluid,

536
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,684
which is starting
to affect his heart.

537
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,936
I'm recommending we
do the surgery tonight.

538
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,561
Tonight? No,
that's way too soon.

539
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,841
The tumor is creating
pressure on your placenta.

540
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,714
It's not only
endangering the baby,

541
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,600
but now it's
putting you at risk.

542
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,997
But my baby wouldn't
survive, would he,

543
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,033
if you suddenly had to deliver?

544
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:03,084
'Cause I'm only 24 weeks along,

545
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,953
and I know that it would help
him if he had time to grow, right?

546
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,655
If I could just hold on
for a few more weeks...

547
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,090
It's not what's best for you.

548
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,480
I don't care about me.

549
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,415
Glenda, if Dr. Herman
thinks that...

550
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,235
No, my husband is dead.

551
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,803
But this baby that
is inside of me,

552
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,306
this baby of ours, I
cannot risk his life.

553
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,358
I won't.

554
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,539
So, if there is a choice between
helping me or helping my baby,

555
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,113
I choose my baby.

556
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,945
What does she think
we're trying to do here?

557
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,980
I am not negotiating
with a patient.

558
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,666
I am the doctor. I'm
gonna tell her when we're...

559
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,891
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,371
Robbins, what the hell?
What's funny about this?

561
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,628
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just... It's just...

562
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,365
It's funny listening to you
get so bent out of shape

563
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,844
when this is the
exact same thing that

564
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:47,212
you've been doing
to Amelia Shepherd

565
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,002
ever since she
offered to save her life.

566
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,823
I mean, she has. Exactly. "We'll
do the surgery when I'm ready."

567
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,875
And it's so frustrating. It's
torture, and it drives us crazy.

568
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,761
So, it's just fun to
watch it happen to you.

569
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,979
It's like divine justice.

570
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,548
Pretend that I'm not
here. Keep going.

571
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,772
I will give Ms. Castillo an extra
week, but I want her admitted.

572
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,020
And if she so much as hiccups
funny, I'm taking her to surgery.

573
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,110
Understood.

574
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,663
Hey, thank you
for taking her case.

575
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,598
Oh, shut up.

576
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,192
I can't...

577
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,496
Holy...

578
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:40,887
How do I access that area of
the brain when it's so hidden?

579
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,207
And once I access that area,

580
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,726
even with the perfect
tools, the perfect approach,

581
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,697
how do I keep
from screwing it up?

582
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,647
If there's edema,
it's post-fixed.

583
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,615
It's too narrow, too
close to the fornix.

584
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,684
If I hit the hypothalamus,
game over.

585
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,909
Not gonna work, not
gonna work, not gonna work.

586
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,929
Come on!

587
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,208
Do you want some food?

588
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,131
Have I figured this out yet?

589
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,216
No.

590
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:10,667
Then I don't want any food.

591
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,126
This has never been done before.

592
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,861
All these steps

593
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,916
in this order on this kind of
tumor, has never been done.

594
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,146
Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

595
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,671
Who do I even think I am?
Who am I to even try this?

596
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,640
Okay, a bad thing.

597
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,347
Have you called your brother?

598
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,129
What did I say about my brother?

599
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:46,019
I know. You don't need him.

600
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:49,056
I was just thinking you could,

601
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:51,191
just to have someone to
bounce these ideas off of

602
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,895
who understands this kind
of thing the way that you do,

603
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,163
a peer.

604
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,732
He might have a suggestion.

605
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,917
I do not need my brother!

606
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,488
I am not stuck! I am
thinking! I am figuring it out!

607
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,957
I am right on the
edge of figuring it out,

608
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,226
of making the
breakthrough of a lifetime!

609
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,461
I am this close!

610
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,596
My genius is flying
around this room right now,

611
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,498
trying to find a clear
path to land on me,

612
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,435
but I can't clear the runway for
landing because I can't find any quiet

613
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,605
because some idiot
resident keeps talking to me!

614
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:30,196
I shouldn't have said
that. I didn't mean it.

615
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,799
I'm tired, and
I'm frustrated. I...

616
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,670
I am so sorry. I just...

617
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,858
This tumor is making me crazy.

618
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,993
Edwards.

619
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,273
As bad as you want
to get that tumor,

620
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:48,715
that's as bad as I want to
watch you get that tumor.

621
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:52,919
You're tired and frustrated
and terrified, but guess what.

622
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,348
I don't give a damn. You're
supposed to be my mentor.

623
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,675
You are my mentor.

624
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:03,847
I believe in you, I look
up to you, I want to be you.

625
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:08,452
That's an enormous responsibility,
so don't call me names.

626
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,256
And stop pouting because
you don't understand what to do.

627
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:17,627
Be worthy of being believed
in, of being looked up to.

628
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,440
Or if you can't
actually be worthy,

629
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,142
if I am actually
wasting my time,

630
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,079
if there is nothing about
you that is special or wise,

631
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:28,238
for God's sake, at least have the
decency to pretend that there is.

632
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,369
Get it together, Dr. Shepherd.

633
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,534
Get it together, Dr. Shepherd.

634
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,442
Okay, bye.

635
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:24,812
Bye.

636
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,616
Hey. Um, how are you?

637
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,850
Uh, good.

638
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,647
How's Dr. Herman? Is she
good? Is everything good?

639
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,582
Yeah, I mean, she's killing me
with back-to-back surgeries but...

640
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,784
Yeah, and Amelia's
plan? You good with that?

641
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,852
Callie, what are you...

642
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:38,920
What?

643
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,955
I'm not... I'm just
checking in, okay?

644
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,848
I'm just seeing how
you are and how...

645
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:45,917
Callie?

646
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,751
Well, it just seems

647
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,297
like you and Dr. Herman are
getting along really, really well,

648
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,798
and you used to complain
that she was killing you,

649
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,150
but now you're happy
that she's killing you,

650
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,118
and it seems like you
really, really like her.

651
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:55,436
I do. Actually, I do.

652
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,671
She's great. I mean,
she's amazing.

653
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:57,935
And she's sick.

654
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,212
So, I worry.

655
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,497
Amelia's got it covered.

656
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,748
She's gonna be fine.

657
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,994
I worry about you.

658
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,751
I know I shouldn't.

659
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,482
I know it's none of my
business, but old habits.

660
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,205
Well, that's, um...

661
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,574
Thanks.

662
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:15,473
- I got to go.
- Okay, okay.

663
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:16,541
That's tall.

664
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,214
Yeah. Really big.

665
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,738
Just so you know, the
auditorium is packed.

666
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,718
The fire marshal actually made
me move a bunch of people

667
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,709
out to an overflow room.

668
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,679
Amelia.

669
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,748
Just give me a minute.

670
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:35,949
Amelia.

671
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,267
Hang on.

672
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,105
You can talk to me.

673
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,624
You're wound pretty tight.

674
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,477
I just want you to
know you can talk to me.

675
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,024
My whole career, I have
been the other Dr. Shepherd.

676
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,871
He's the real one.
I'm the other one.

677
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,742
Right now, this plan
of mine is theoretical.

678
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,546
It's just talk.

679
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,894
But at some point, I am going
to slice into Dr. Herman's brain,

680
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:14,587
and I have this sick feeling
that when I face that tumor,

681
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,327
I will discover that I am not
just the other Dr. Shepherd.

682
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,965
I'm the wrong Dr. Shepherd.

683
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,258
Hey.

684
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,126
911? What's going on?

685
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,010
Look, I know you've been having
me take the lead so I can learn,

686
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,112
but you need to handle this
case. Why would I do that?

687
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,547
Because it's emergent, and I've
never tried cutting umbilical bands.

688
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,383
First time for
everything. Well...

689
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,319
Listen to me, okay? I'm not
ready to take this over yet.

690
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,559
Doesn't matter.

691
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,711
Stop! Stop!

692
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,013
You... You're not hearing me.

693
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,715
It does matter. I'm not ready.

694
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,717
And you think I am?

695
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,131
You think this is easy for me?

696
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,971
You think I'm ready?

697
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,708
I was fine. I got
fine with dying.

698
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,194
And then you infected
me with your stupid...

699
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,776
With Shepherd and her
plan and your stupid hope.

700
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,212
And now it's harder than ever

701
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,703
to hand all this over.

702
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,539
I don't want to.

703
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,008
I'm scared to.

704
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,912
And I'm scared to let go of
it, and it's all your fault, so...

705
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,461
I think the very least
you could do is deserve it.

706
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,386
Take over, do well,
make me not regret it.

707
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,695
Can you do that?

708
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,307
Please?

709
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,911
<i>This is the part where things
get a little fast and furious.</i>

710
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,715
<i>It is arguably the
most dangerous,</i>

711
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,668
<i>most precarious
portion of the operation.</i>

712
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,588
<i>It also needs to
happen the fastest.</i>

713
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:58,608
Every step, every
move before this

714
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,622
has laid the groundwork
for this very moment,

715
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,746
the moment where I
place the radioactive seeds.

716
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,615
<i>It requires precision...</i>

717
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,029
I just need to slip these
shears under the band.

718
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,269
<i>And accuracy and speed,</i>

719
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,806
things that do not
go together well.

720
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:14,552
I can't get the last band.

721
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,187
This grip's not flexible enough.

722
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,411
Can you coax it through?

723
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,675
It's not... No. It won't give.

724
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,644
You have to cut
that last band. I know.

725
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,067
Have you tried a
smaller scissor?

726
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,418
It's not the problem.

727
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,521
Imagine picking
up little grains of salt

728
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:30,991
while wearing oven mitts.

729
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:34,578
That is what I'm doing
inside somebody's brain.

730
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,413
<i>Hand me a glove.</i>

731
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,209
What? Somebody hand
me a glove. Scissors.

732
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,983
There's this thing that
we used to do in peds.

733
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,080
I think it'll work.

734
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,664
I just need a more
flexible opening,

735
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,166
and I can make
it out of a glove.

736
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,830
That's not in my notes, Robbins.

737
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,904
- Are you serious?
- It's gonna work.

738
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,090
But once I do it,

739
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,492
once I place the final seed,

740
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,262
well...

741
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:12,665
It's smooth sailing.

742
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:14,267
Ha! Did you see that?

743
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:17,053
It worked! It absolutely worked!

744
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:23,236
'Night, 'night, tumor baby.

745
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,062
It has been lovely,

746
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,982
but we are done.

747
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,828
I'd like to open things
up to a few questions.

748
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,413
Yes.

749
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,781
Are you nervous?

750
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,836
I'd be crazy not to be.

751
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:53,039
Yes, of course I'm nervous,
but I'm also very excited.

752
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,275
This is history.

753
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,543
This surgery will be history.

754
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,220
How could I not be
excited about that?

755
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,185
Excellent, excellent.

756
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:06,694
You should be very
proud of yourself.

757
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:10,924
Close up now.

758
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:14,093
Where are you going?

759
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:17,229
What you're describing
is seven different surgeries

760
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,749
all using the hardest
techniques you've ever tried.

761
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:23,720
How long do you anticipate
the entire surgery actually taking?

762
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,054
18 hours.

763
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,657
Give or take some hours.

764
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,593
Follow-up question.

765
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,280
Do you need a second
resident on the case?

766
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,915
Not unless Edwards is
planning to bail on me.

767
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,679
You planning to bail, Edwards?

768
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:39,101
No, ma'am.

769
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,511
Yes, in the back.

770
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,612
Will you have help?

771
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,115
Um, sorry?

772
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,516
Well, I'm just...

773
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,847
Well, are you gonna be doing
this whole surgery yourself,

774
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:58,154
or is Derek,
Dr. Shepherd coming?

775
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,256
I'm... I'm just...
I'm just asking.

776
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,508
I mean, given everything,
is it a good idea?

777
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,877
Should you be
doing this yourself?

778
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:09,015
Well, I am, so...

779
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,210
Next question.

780
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,597
I need you to scan me.

781
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:28,868
Something's happening.
I'm experiencing symptoms.

782
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,156
Fuzziness around the
edges, a little like blinders,

783
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,658
and it's dark...

784
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,394
Darker than it
should be, I think.

785
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,132
Okay.

786
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,802
Let's go.

787
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,317
Bailey? Where's Dr. Herman?

788
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,424
She stepped out.
What do you need?

789
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,877
Uh, it's Glenda Castillo.

790
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,963
Hey, I need Herman right now.

791
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:32,727
Glenda Castillo's
baby is in distress,

792
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,161
and Glenda is
severely hypertensive,

793
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,063
showing signs of heart failure.

794
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,689
We need to operate on her
immediately, so if you could finish up...

795
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,340
What are you doing?

796
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,969
Why are you standing
there? I... Arizona.

797
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:48,913
Oh, God.

798
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:51,434
It's time.

799
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,436
Now?

800
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,043
I'm gonna go...

801
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,462
Get an OR ready.

802
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,630
Okay.

803
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,799
Okay.

804
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,286
You ready for this?

805
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:14,307
Mmm-hmm.

806
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,126
Amelia.

807
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,613
I'll get an OR prepped.

808
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,783
You'll inform the patient?

809
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,059
Oh, Robbins.

810
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:34,471
Surgery's all finished?

811
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,594
Yeah.

812
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,267
I see.

813
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,602
Shepherd's prepping the OR?

814
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,722
Yes.

815
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,090
If I had to guess,

816
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,076
I'd say the tumor's
invaded the optic chiasm.

817
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,615
My chariot awaits.

818
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,820
A little privacy, guys?

819
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,276
Did you need me for
something, a patient?

820
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,477
Yeah.

821
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,057
Glenda Castillo's
baby has hydrops.

822
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,241
Mom is mirroring, and
she's going into CHF.

823
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:13,841
Wow.

824
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,831
Looks like a big
day for both of us.

825
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,155
What you need to do first

826
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,108
is try to embolize the
vessels fetoscopically.

827
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,372
Make sure her blood
pressure is stabilized.

828
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,829
She has you.

829
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,063
Amelia has you.

830
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,400
This is the point where
you trust her, okay?

831
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,413
Don't go in without
checking Glenda's

832
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,349
platelet counts
and crossmatching.

833
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,173
This is the point where
you trust her, okay?

834
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,744
All set.

835
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,489
Don't let Glenda's
platelet count drop below...

836
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,696
100. I know.

837
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:45,682
Will you tie me? Yeah.

838
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,258
Let's do this.

839
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,171
<i>I never placed much value in
wondering about an afterlife.</i>

840
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,891
<i>My concern was always this
life, what would I do with it?</i>

841
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,477
<i>How would I make my mark?</i>

842
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,291
Be sure, be fast. You don't
have half the time you imagine.

843
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,543
Try to ablate all the vessels,
but don't wait too long.

844
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,395
Don't be afraid
to make that call.

845
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,097
If she's awake, she'll
tell you for the 15th time

846
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,798
to save her child's
life before hers.

847
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,383
Listen to her, let
her say her piece,

848
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,035
then you do what
needs to be done.

849
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,370
I don't think... I don't know...
I don't know if I can do this.

850
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,688
I can't. I can't
do this. You can.

851
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,472
Nicole. You will.

852
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,450
Let's get you inside now, okay?

853
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:12,919
<i>I wanted to break new ground.</i>

854
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,408
<i>I wanted to leave a legacy.</i>

855
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,678
<i>I wanted my life, my
brain, my existence...</i>

856
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,450
<i>To mean something.</i>

857
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,735
Hey, hey, hey, you're
gonna be fine, okay?

858
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,993
Amelia's got this.
You've got this.

859
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,896
<i>The thing I never really
thought about, though,</i>

860
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>the thing I never really wrapped
my brain around until now was...</i>

861
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,172
Wait, Robbins.

862
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,424
No. Don't you dare.

863
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,376
Don't you dare say it, Nicole.

864
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,373
<i>In order to do that, in
order to be remembered,</i>

865
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,931
<i>in order to leave something
significant behind...</i>

866
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,517
Time to go.

867
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,735
<i>You have to leave.</i>
