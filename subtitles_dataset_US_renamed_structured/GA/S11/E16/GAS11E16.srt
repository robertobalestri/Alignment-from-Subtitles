1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:06,972
<i>We teach residents,</i>

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:10,742
<i>"When you hear hoof-beats,
think horses, not zebras."</i>

3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,689
Wait, I know this is
Derek Shepherd's phone.

4
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,062
Who is this?

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,165
<i>It means that the most
obvious answer is usually right.</i>

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,634
<i>It keeps doctors from
heading down the wrong path.</i>

7
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:24,072
<i>It helps us stick to the
truth. It helps us save lives.</i>

8
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:26,057
<i>It's part of what makes
me a good surgeon.</i>

9
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:28,510
<i>When I hear hoof-beats...</i>

10
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:29,578
<i>Horses.</i>

11
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:31,179
Who is this?

12
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,148
<i>I always think horses.</i>

13
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,633
Hello?

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,670
<i>Even when I shouldn't.</i>

15
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:40,689
Hey.

16
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:41,835
Do you have a minute? Hey.

17
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:42,859
Yeah.

18
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,093
I was just coming to see you.

19
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,539
How's your first full day going?

20
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,230
Exhilarating.

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,976
Hunt just saved this little
girl's mother over the phone.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,568
It was nuts. It is
so good to be back.

23
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,370
Come here. All right.

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,725
Mmm. That good, huh?

25
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,993
Yeah, that good.

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,139
You sure you don't
want to take this home?

27
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,041
I mean, there's
people right outside.

28
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,543
So what? I don't
care. Who cares?

29
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,966
Okay.

30
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,501
Are you sure?

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,136
Do I seem unsure?

32
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,321
These are the moves
of a sure person.

33
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,823
What more do you need?

34
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,752
Mmm. I just want to
make sure that you're...

35
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,327
What?

36
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,715
Just, you know, you
haven't wanted to since...

37
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,149
Wow. Way to kill the mood.

38
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,283
No, April.

39
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,602
Come on. I didn't mean...

40
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,411
Pager. No!

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,964
I know. Hey.

42
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,274
I'm sorry. Later.

43
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,159
We will continue this later.

44
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,778
We better.

45
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,514
<i>Hi. You've reached Dr. Shepherd.</i>

46
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,839
<i>Please leave a message,
and I will return your call.</i>

47
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,197
Um, you really didn't
have to walk me in. I can...

48
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,065
I'm just trying to
prolong our half-date.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,713
I'm so sorry, but when
I'm paged for trauma, I...

50
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,648
No, no, no, no, no, I
should have seen it coming.

51
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,355
Your profile did
say "crazy hours."

52
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:23,408
And you're off to go save a
life. What's hotter than that?

53
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:28,347
Well, I'm glad I got to
lay eyes on you in person.

54
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,849
Well, maybe we can
do it again sometime.

55
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,102
Absolutely. First
dates are overrated.

56
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,121
Maybe we should just
jump to the end of this one.

57
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,429
Oh, um...

58
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,931
I have to get to the pit.

59
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,566
Me too.

60
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,367
Great. Okay.

61
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,084
Ow.

62
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,493
I called Derek.

63
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,962
I'm laying here. I'm sleeping.

64
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,247
A woman answered his phone.

65
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,127
There are two
empty beds. Pick one.

66
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,852
One empty bed. I'm up here.
A woman answered his phone?

67
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,086
Whose phone?

68
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,288
Derek's phone.

69
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,868
What kind of woman?
Doesn't matter.

70
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,235
It matters. It matters.

71
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,443
She was perky, and she
sounded happy and tall,

72
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,078
with a lot of great hair.

73
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,375
Hold. You saw her?
How did you see her?

74
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,598
I didn't.

75
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,802
I heard her voice, her
perky, happy, tall voice.

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,914
I hate voices like that.

77
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,965
You can tell by the voice?

78
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,166
What did Derek say?

79
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,657
I didn't talk to him.

80
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,976
Now I keep going to voicemail.

81
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,380
My short, twisty, mad voice
keeps going to voicemail.

82
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,496
He's not cheating on me, right?

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,000
He's not cheating on you.
He's not cheating on you.

84
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,227
Trauma.

85
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,132
So...

86
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,633
Big trauma coming in, huh?

87
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,136
Yeah. Uh, car accident, I think.

88
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,705
Yeah, I heard there were
two victims, maybe more.

89
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,840
Yeah.

90
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,927
I like your, uh, dress.

91
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,795
Thanks.

92
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,441
I don't remember that one.

93
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,382
It's new.

94
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,502
What do we got?
30-year-old male.

95
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:51,239
He and his wife were hit by a
car that crashed into their house.

96
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:54,542
Abdominal contusions,
right-upper-leg deformity,

97
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,239
binder applied for unstable
pelvis. Grey's in there now.

98
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,231
Robbins, trauma one.
Torres, I need you in trauma...

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,616
Oh, you're changing clothes.

100
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,446
You know, we have
attendings' lounges for that.

101
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,671
Yeah. No time.
All right, let's go.

102
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,366
Hang on. I'm gonna
need a resident, too.

103
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,802
Edwards, you're with Torres.
Uh, Wilson, go with Robbins.

104
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,303
Yeah! No, that's not fair!

105
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,772
Oh, I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear that.

106
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:15,564
Sorry, but Dr. Torres' patient
is also Dr. Grey's patient.

107
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,965
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,099
Dr. Grey?

109
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,968
Dr. Grey has not lost
a patient in weeks.

110
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,788
Yeah. She's on a streak.

111
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,306
Now!

112
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,942
Should be excited
to be working with me.

113
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,141
Paramedics couldn't get a line.

114
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,915
He's hypotensive
and needs fluids asap.

115
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,812
We should start a central line.

116
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,381
Is this the husband? Tom
Vinson. His wife is next door.

117
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,725
His BP is dropping.
Let's order some o-neg.

118
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,486
Edwards, help
me with this binder.

119
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,488
Oh, I thought I was on
Dr. Grey's service, so...

120
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,090
If we don't assess this pelvic
fracture, he could bleed out and die.

121
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,280
End streak.

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,177
Now, if he dies from
the pelvic fracture,

123
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,346
isn't it technically
on you, not Dr. Grey?

124
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,753
Edwards, zip it.

125
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,089
He's in v-fib. Starting CPR.

126
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,224
Grab the paddles. Charge to 200.

127
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,811
Charged. Clear.

128
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,598
Where's my patient?

129
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,827
Crap.

130
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,350
Find her, now!

131
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,972
The band was practicing, Mom.
We never would have heard the car.

132
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,591
What, I leave for 10 minutes,

133
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,905
and we suddenly let patients
roam the halls unattended?

134
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,962
Ma'am, you cannot
be walking around here.

135
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,359
Do you know who your doctor is?

136
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,943
Excuse me, you
can't get out of bed.

137
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,701
You're not listening, Mom. A
car smashed into our house.

138
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,947
Do you know where my husband is?

139
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,104
Hi, Blair. I'm Dr. Robbins.

140
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:30,316
We need to check
you and your baby out,

141
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,918
and this is not the
right place to do it.

142
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,686
One sec. Mom, I just told you
a car smashed into our house,

143
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,337
and that is what you
are worried about?

144
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,180
The music is fine
for the baby, Mom.

145
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,876
Ugh!

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,745
My husband is in
a punk-rock band,

147
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,168
and my mother
doesn't approve, still.

148
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,237
It's been eight years.

149
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,956
Is he okay?

150
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,075
He's back.

151
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,211
His BP is not fluid-responsive.

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,441
He's most likely bleeding
inside. I need that ultra...

153
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,566
Okay. Oh, God, it hurts!

154
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:01,669
Tom, listen. We got you, okay?

155
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,187
Let's push 50 of fentanyl.

156
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,968
Tom, we have you. It's okay.

157
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,569
Oh, God, where's
Blair? She's pregnant.

158
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,221
We know. She's in
the hospital, Tom.

159
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,196
Is she hurt? Is our baby okay? I
need to see her. Let me see her.

160
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,597
Tom, you are seriously injured.

161
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,360
You need to settle down
and let us do our job.

162
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,929
Blair!

163
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,797
His pressure's dropping
again. Let's hang another unit.

164
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,649
We need to take him
straight up. We ready?

165
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,272
Yep. Let's go!

166
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,486
All right, we need to assess
her injuries and monitor the baby.

167
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,188
I want a fetal
monitor on her ASAP.

168
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,511
Okay. Will do.

169
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,746
Hang on. Hey, stop.
That's my husband.

170
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,216
Hey.

171
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,601
You okay?

172
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,682
Blair, baby, I can't see
you. I can't turn my head.

173
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,882
That's okay. It's okay.

174
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,723
I'm right here, Tommy.

175
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,110
Are you okay?

176
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,162
You know me. I'm... I'm tough.

177
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,426
How's the baby?

178
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,117
Great.

179
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:53,454
He's, um, doing
backflips right now.

180
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:54,856
I think he hears your voice.

181
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,126
I'm not feeling so great.

182
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,187
I love you.

183
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,421
I love you, too.

184
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,190
I can't move this damn thing.

185
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,824
65-year-old male
complaining of chest pains.

186
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,176
Let me go. Let me
go! This the driver?

187
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,134
Vehicle's totaled,
amazing he even survived.

188
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,987
Get me out of this thing! I
just want to buy some shoes!

189
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,600
Is he drunk? Seems to be.

190
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,902
They said he came to disoriented,
too combative for an exam.

191
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,726
You don't understand. No!

192
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,429
We need to question him, and
we'll want your tox-screen results.

193
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,376
Okay, let us assess
and treat him first.

194
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,694
If he has anything in his
system, we'll let you know.

195
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,235
Thanks, Officer.

196
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,403
Who are you? Give
me my car keys.

197
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:43,472
Sir, just calm down.

198
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,106
Just find my damn keys!

199
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,352
Sir, we need to examine
you. You've got to be still.

200
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,072
Oh, God, do you
ever shut up for a sec...

201
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,840
Abdominal tenderness,
feels like multiple fractures.

202
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,492
There could be some internal
bleeding. Would you back off?

203
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,843
Sir, I need to
listen to your heart.

204
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,387
And I said get the
hell away from me!

205
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,689
Now will you give me some
service, for God's sake?

206
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,289
Dr. Pierce? Maggie!

207
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,551
Let go. Let me go!

208
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,086
Maggie. Can you hear me? Maggie?

209
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,104
Dr. Pierce!

210
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,918
Is someone gonna help me or not?

211
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,426
I want four-point restraints
on him at all times!

212
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,378
Let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

213
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,208
You want to act like an
animal, we'll treat you like one.

214
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,766
You touch one of my doctors
again, you'll deal with me.

215
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,201
Take it easy. Nice and slow.

216
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,785
I'm fine. I'm fine.

217
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,304
Stop. Stop. Stop!

218
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,084
Any pain? Any dizziness?

219
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,108
Pierce, are you okay?

220
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,503
I'm fine. MARTIN: Stop.

221
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,104
You're not fine till
I say you're fine.

222
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,529
Get yourself a CT. Make
sure it's nothing serious.

223
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,682
I'm gonna page Shepherd
to take a look at you.

224
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,401
I can't move in this!

225
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,870
Martin? Martin, I'm here.

226
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,955
I'm his wife.

227
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,290
Sally?

228
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,726
I just want some shoes.

229
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,034
Ma'am, has he been drinking?

230
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,612
Drinking? No.

231
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,366
My husband has Alzheimer's.

232
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,504
He has no idea what he's done.

233
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,374
All I needed was
to take a shower.

234
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,672
I left Martin with the football
game on, he likes football.

235
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,762
But the keys.

236
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:18,216
I always hide the keys.
I must have forgotten.

237
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,369
He would never,
ever hurt a soul.

238
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,083
I'm so sorry he hit
those people with the car.

239
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:26,941
Your husband has
multiple rib fractures,

240
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,710
and there's evidence that
there's blood in his belly.

241
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,863
He's gonna need
exploratory surgery

242
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,171
to see how extensive
the damage is.

243
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,268
Okay. Okay. Um, thank you.

244
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,288
Mrs. Davis, we need to
ask you some questions.

245
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,094
Okay, Grey, you and I will

246
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,463
take care of the pelvic packing.

247
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,587
Torres, reduce
the femur fracture.

248
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,099
Mmm-hmm. Any word on the driver?

249
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,373
Alzheimer's. He thinks
he's in a shoe store.

250
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,091
Oh.

251
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,381
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

252
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,650
It's nothing. It's fine.

253
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,071
Did Derek call?

254
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,522
Nope.

255
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,425
He will.

256
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:18,510
We'll see.

257
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,818
It's okay.

258
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,501
You got scanned?
Everything checked out okay?

259
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,637
Absolutely. Okay.

260
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:30,825
Let's go scrub.

261
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,474
Okay.

262
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,466
Damn it, these pelvic
veins are shattered.

263
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,712
More lap pads. See that, Grey?

264
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,472
I see it. I got it.
Clamp. 3-0 silk.

265
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,602
You know what? I didn't
even kiss her. She kissed me.

266
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,544
So, why am I compelled
to apologize to Arizona?

267
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,596
Suction, Edwards.
More. Lap pads.

268
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,116
I mean, I didn't do
anything wrong. Did I?

269
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,980
More lap pads. Pack it in there.

270
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,183
And why did she have
to make it so weird?

271
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,118
And what is my
responsibility here?

272
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,970
I mean, time has passed.

273
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,661
I can date. She can date.

274
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,010
I want her to date. We
can see other people.

275
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,576
Arizona was seeing other people

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,960
while the two of you
were still married.

277
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,505
Sorry. I just meant I think
you can do whatever you want.

278
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,907
God knows she did.

279
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,541
Mmm.

280
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,183
The look on his wife's
face, she felt responsible.

281
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,829
She should feel responsible.

282
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,570
I can't believe that woman.
It's like criminal negligence.

283
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,352
It's like going to the movies
and leaving your infant at home.

284
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,787
If an infant could start a car
and mow down innocent people.

285
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,473
Did you want me to put a
figure-of-eight stitch in here?

286
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,099
I mean, I'm not insensitive.
I mean, I get that it's hard.

287
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,295
But, you know, if you can't
be a responsible caregiver,

288
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,203
then find someone who can.

289
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,291
Do you need some
water, Dr. Warren?

290
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:02,179
I think Dr. Warren's trying
to subtly tell you to shut up.

291
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,567
I lost my wife to Alzheimer's.

292
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,806
Richard, I'm so
sorry. I had no idea.

293
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,208
No, it's okay.

294
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,195
You had no way of
knowing about her or...

295
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,132
What?

296
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,039
It's nothing. I just... I
wouldn't wish it on anyone.

297
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,910
There's some clear
fluid oozing from the tear.

298
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,913
Uh, give me a 5cc
syringe to sample it.

299
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,548
It's not a big
deal. It's just a cut.

300
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,050
It's a very deep cut.

301
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,002
Any dizziness or blurred vision?

302
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,005
I keep telling
everyone I feel fine,

303
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:48,109
except for the fact that I'm
exhausted and ginormous.

304
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,577
You got anything
for swollen feet?

305
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,997
I'd still like to order a
head CT, just to be safe.

306
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,177
So, your husband's
in a punk-rock band?

307
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,483
Yeah. We met at a show.

308
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:56,984
I used to like punk rock once.

309
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,986
Okay.

310
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,938
What? I did.

311
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,885
I rocked the heavy eyeliner,
and I had some t-shirts.

312
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,274
Sure you did, Robbins.

313
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,743
Hey, uh, Shepherd, how's Pierce?

314
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,011
Her exam.

315
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,313
It's more of a
post-punk scene now.

316
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,917
Or proto-punk? I
don't remember the...

317
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,065
Blair? Blair! We've
got a seizure.

318
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,138
Wilson, grab her arms.

319
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,653
Blair. Dr. Bailey,
a little help.

320
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,490
Where do you want me?
Help us hold her steady.

321
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:27,098
Push 10 of lorazepam.
Pupil's blown on the right.

322
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,101
She was conscious and
talking just 10 seconds ago.

323
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,353
Walking and talking,
classic extradural hematoma.

324
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,155
How pregnant is she? 35 weeks.

325
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,756
She's 35 weeks pregnant.

326
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,262
She isn't responding.
Start her on phenobarbital.

327
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:45,291
She needs an airway. All
right, give me a 7-0 and a scope.

328
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,755
Well, it's swollen,
is the problem.

329
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,656
You likely won't
lose your tongue.

330
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,025
Lose my tongue?

331
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,671
Yeah, the bigger problem is,
why were you stupid enough

332
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,272
to stick it in there
in the first place?

333
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,209
'Cause now your tongue
is gonna continue to swell,

334
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,711
pulling the bottle
deeper into your mouth

335
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,100
and cutting off your airway.

336
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,702
And then you're gonna die.

337
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,304
Die?

338
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,251
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but
you kind of did this to yourself.

339
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,808
Dr. Kepner, can I
see you for a second?

340
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:11,925
Absolutely.

341
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,127
One sec.

342
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,669
All right, listen, I really
just think we need to...

343
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,435
What are you doing?

344
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,887
I thought you wised up.

345
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,906
No, we need to, we need to talk.

346
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,718
Your first day back has
already turned into your second,

347
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,275
and you're tearing
into patients,

348
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,972
I am topless. Why are
we talking about this?

349
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,463
April, what is the matter?

350
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,821
What's the matter is
that you keep holding me

351
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,090
like this delicate flower
that's gonna break

352
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,553
every time you look at me.

353
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,478
That is what is the matter.

354
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,115
I'm gonna go pull a bottle
out of this moron's mouth.

355
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,917
I will see you at home.

356
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:57,371
How we doing with that airway?

357
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,201
I can't get the tube in.
Her teeth are gritted.

358
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,603
How long has it been?
We're almost at four minutes.

359
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,154
Persistent decels.
The baby's in trouble.

360
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,705
The seizures are
frying her brain.

361
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,091
Arizona, we need
to put her under.

362
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,548
Okay, okay. Push 100 of
sux and 20 of etomidate.

363
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,342
Oh. She stopped.

364
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,659
Oh, thank God.

365
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,345
Starting compressions.

366
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,764
Paddles!

367
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,615
Push one of epi.

368
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,749
Come on, Blair.

369
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:28,135
Okay, let's charge
to 200. Everybody off.

370
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,404
Clear.

371
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,202
Still v-fib.

372
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,159
Again. Charge to 300.

373
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,261
Clear.

374
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,395
Arizona.

375
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,781
Push another epi, 360. Clear.

376
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,735
Charging again.

377
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:44,923
Arizona.

378
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,950
Call it.

379
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,938
Time of death, 23:16.

380
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,327
I don't... She was
just talking to us.

381
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,896
What happened that fast?

382
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,698
Massive intracranial bleed.

383
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,317
Can't come back from that.

384
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,836
Poor thing.

385
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,447
Major tranq. Jo, you
start bagging the patient.

386
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,838
Restarting CPR.

387
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,105
Wait, what?

388
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,957
Bag the patient.

389
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,892
Why? Shut up and do what I said.

390
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,245
She's dead. Why
are we doing CPR?

391
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,459
We have to keep
her blood circulating.

392
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,498
For what?

393
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,267
Look, the mom's dead,

394
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,036
but as long as you pump
that bag, her baby's still alive.

395
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,522
Oh. So...

396
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,984
It's time to deliver the baby.

397
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,128
Right here, right now?
Right here, right now.

398
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,546
Somebody page Karev 911.
Tell him get down here. Ten blade.

399
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,347
Wait! Betadine!

400
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,027
We forgot to put betadine on
her belly so that she's sterile.

401
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,184
Don't need it.

402
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,913
No, we do, because
it's... We don't need it!

403
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,648
She's dead, Jo. Mom's dead.

404
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,152
There's nothing left
to protect her from.

405
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,932
Thank you, Doctor.

406
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,740
How's the father?

407
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,288
Oh, if he makes it through the
night, he may have a chance.

408
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,980
Um...

409
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,367
Does Maggie know that
Ellis had Alzheimer's?

410
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,687
I don't know. We
never talked about it.

411
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,491
Don't you think one
of us should tell her?

412
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,243
I mean, she might want
to find out, in case she...

413
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:51,590
I didn't want to
know for a long time.

414
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:52,963
Well, what changed your mind?

415
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:57,050
I just realized not knowing
isn't going to change anything.

416
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,621
It made me feel like I
was in control, but I wasn't.

417
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,268
Whatever is gonna happen is
gonna happen, no matter what.

418
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,776
Dr. Webber, the
driver, Martin Davis...

419
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,156
You need to come. What is it?

420
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,445
I'm not sure.

421
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,586
Mrs. Davis.

422
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,895
What did you do?

423
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,556
He's back.

424
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,823
What do you mean?

425
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:24,545
He knows who I am,
who he is, where he is.

426
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,458
He's remembering
everything I'm telling him.

427
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,343
Martin, the poem, say it again.

428
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,018
Sally, hon, you got to
let me catch me up, here.

429
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,186
Fine.

430
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,589
"Oh, lift me from the grass

431
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:38,525
"I die, I faint, I fail

432
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,028
"Let thy love in kisses rain

433
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,265
"on my lips and eyelids pale"

434
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,447
He read it to me
when he proposed.

435
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:50,237
I haven't heard it in years.

436
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,967
Now, will someone please
tell me what's going on?

437
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,793
You cured him. You
brought him back to me.

438
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,697
Thank you.

439
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,085
What the hell did we do?

440
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,821
I have no idea.

441
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,474
Say it again.

442
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,261
"Oh, lift me from the grass

443
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,380
<i>"I die, I faint, I fail</i>

444
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,017
<i>"Let thy love in kisses rain</i>

445
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,921
<i>"on my lips and eyelids pale</i>

446
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,140
<i>"My cheek is cold
and white, alas..."</i>

447
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,727
Is your hand cramping? Yeah.

448
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,256
Mine too.

449
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,296
Somebody paged me?

450
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,333
<i>"My heart beats
loud and fast..."</i>

451
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,536
Oh, crap.

452
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:43,123
<i>"Oh, press it close
to thine again..."</i>

453
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,355
Are you ready? ARIZONA: Yeah.

454
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,479
<i>"Where it will break at last..."</i>

455
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,914
Okay. Here we go.

456
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,516
The minute the baby's
out, we can stop doing CPR.

457
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,037
He's out. He's out.

458
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,423
He's not crying. Arizona?

459
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,236
I know, not crying.
Karev, stand by.

460
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,500
Bailey, the cord.

461
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,369
Okay.

462
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,465
Okay.

463
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,090
Karev, how is he? Alex?

464
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,336
Do you need some
help over there?

465
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,659
Would everybody shut up?

466
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,446
Come on, little guy. Come on.

467
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,763
One minute APGAR is eight.

468
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,386
He's okay.

469
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,137
Good breath
sounds, heart's strong.

470
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,539
Strong lungs, too.

471
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,536
Wilson, you can go.

472
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,827
Nice save, Robbins.

473
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,869
Wait, wait, wait, go back.

474
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,510
So, I missed Lisa's
wedding and her divorce?

475
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,313
He was a bum,
just like you said.

476
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,182
Eh. This is weird.

477
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,285
It's like I stepped into a time
machine and went to the future.

478
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:21,299
And he's never had lucid days
in the past? It's pretty common.

479
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,056
Never, nothing like this.

480
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,910
Oh. Toby is in his
second year at Penn State.

481
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,846
Toby? Stupid Toby?

482
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,281
He pulled it together!

483
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,783
How about Heidi? How's Heidi?

484
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,170
Seventeen and going
strong. Heidi's our cat.

485
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:39,173
Five years. This is just...

486
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,277
This must have
been awful for you.

487
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,232
I missed you.

488
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,550
I missed you so much.

489
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,123
I'm pretty confident

490
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,643
Dr. Webber has not found
a cure for Alzheimer's.

491
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,995
I have a suspicion, but I
would like to get an MRI

492
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:04,097
and confirm before we
jump to any conclusions.

493
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,599
Okay.

494
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:08,435
Um, Sally told me that
I was in a car accident.

495
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,220
Was anyone else injured, or...

496
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,383
Actually, there was...

497
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:14,008
Well, I know you
have a lot of questions.

498
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:18,212
Let's talk after we
have all the answers.

499
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,699
Uh, right now, Dr. Shepherd
needs to get that MRI. Okay?

500
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,972
Hey. How's the baby doing?

501
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,186
I'd love to have some good
news before the dad wakes up.

502
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,694
Hi. How's he doing?

503
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,346
Vitals are stable.
He's hanging in there.

504
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,048
Good.

505
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,008
I heard about the mom. You okay?

506
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:51,078
Yeah. It was... It was bad.

507
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:52,579
I'm so sorry.

508
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,335
Callie, um, about earlier.

509
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,615
Yeah, that was...

510
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,640
How long has that
been going on, exactly?

511
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,525
It hasn't.

512
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:06,104
I mean, that was our first
date, and it got cut short,

513
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,805
so we didn't even
make it to dinner.

514
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,380
Yeah, no, so she just
skipped right to dessert.

515
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,035
You know what?
Let's not do this.

516
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,536
I'm sorry. You know what?

517
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,733
I probably shouldn't be
saying anything, but I... Ugh.

518
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,757
I feel like I have to.

519
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,292
You don't.

520
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,894
Arizona, I am seeing
people. I will kiss them.

521
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,206
I didn't plan on that happening,

522
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,508
and I certainly didn't
plan on you seeing that,

523
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,416
but I do not need to
feel bad or apologize.

524
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,717
No, Callie, I...

525
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,697
I'm moving on,
and you should, too,

526
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,921
and it's kind of not your business
who I see now, or kiss, okay?

527
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:42,496
You're right. Godspeed.
Go kiss everyone.

528
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:48,736
24-hour monitoring. He
needs Q1 neurochecks.

529
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,638
Use pressors to keep
his MAPs above 60.

530
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,952
If he's still stable, Torres can
go back into the pelvis tomorrow.

531
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:55,775
If?

532
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,204
There's no guarantee he'll
make it through the night.

533
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,670
So, just to, um, clarify,

534
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,623
is this Dr. Torres'
patient, officially,

535
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,076
or yours or Dr. Grey's?

536
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,693
Is this about her streak?

537
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,463
Dr. Grey has not lost a
patient since November.

538
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,582
We are all pulling for her...

539
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,383
Well, stop it. Dr. Grey.

540
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,014
If this guy dies, his
little boy has no parents.

541
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:24,983
And if he's lucky enough
to pull through this,

542
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,319
his life isn't gonna look
anything like it did before this.

543
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:31,679
Is that really something we
want to brag about or celebrate?

544
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,907
It has nothing to do with me.

545
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,691
How many since November?

546
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,891
Eighty-nine.

547
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,900
Grey, that has
something to do with you.

548
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,802
Don't kid yourself.

549
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,455
Right there.

550
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,291
The swollen
ventricles are the clue.

551
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,105
So he doesn't have Alzheimer's?

552
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,494
Nope.

553
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,596
It's called normal
pressure hydrocephalus,

554
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,098
or NPH.

555
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,934
Martin had a buildup
of cerebrospinal fluid,

556
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,703
and it placed intense pressure
on his brain, as you can see.

557
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:17,068
The accident caused a tear in
the sheath around the spinal cord,

558
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,254
which released some of this
fluid and reduced the pressure.

559
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,605
Isn't the fluid just
gonna build up again?

560
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,162
If we do nothing, yes,

561
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,508
he'll go back to the way he was,

562
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,882
probably in a matter of hours.

563
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,952
But we're not gonna do nothing.

564
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,033
The shunt is like
a little hose to keep

565
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,140
fluid from building
back up again.

566
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,192
Then I'll be okay?

567
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,923
We'll want to do some
checkups, but, yes.

568
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,042
You'll have your husband back.

569
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,348
It's a miracle.

570
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,628
Uh...

571
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,385
Dr. Webber, um,

572
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,616
the police are asking
if now is a good time.

573
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Police? Why? What happened?

574
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,230
Hey. Where have you been?

575
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,116
I don't know. I just...
I needed some air.

576
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,353
You okay?

577
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,473
He's only been alive for two
hours, and he's already lost his mom,

578
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,010
his dad barely survived surgery,

579
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,079
he doesn't even have a name.

580
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,546
I'm calling him Dan.

581
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,433
How are we supposed do this?

582
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,770
The dead mothers,
the motherless babies,

583
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,956
it's just too freaking hard
and sad and messed-up.

584
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,105
It sucks, but it's the job.

585
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,744
Really? Really?

586
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,817
Hey, let her go.

587
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,853
Come on, don't you
remember what it was like

588
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,421
to be a resident and have
all this death around you

589
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,907
be new, terrifying?

590
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,509
Why do you think they care so
much about this stupid streak?

591
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,578
Death is scary.

592
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:50,217
They just want to believe that there's
somebody out there who can defy it.

593
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,583
Hey.

594
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,735
Geez!

595
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:12,039
Why are you...
Lurking in the dark?

596
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,890
You're lurking.

597
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,742
I can't sleep.

598
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:20,146
I'm wiped.

599
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:23,500
If you're gonna keep lurking,
please don't stare at me while I sleep.

600
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,769
Did you know when
Arizona cheated on you,

601
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,270
before she told you?

602
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,538
What?

603
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,719
And with George,
did you know it?

604
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:31,903
Did you have a feeling?

605
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,130
Meredith, what happened?

606
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:49,943
I killed a mother,
a pregnant mother.

607
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:52,057
Her baby survived. He's healthy.

608
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,248
And the father is stable.

609
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:58,802
Martin, this wasn't your fault.

610
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,820
You weren't in your right mind.

611
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,322
The police know that.

612
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:06,143
Martin, we have a short
window here, and it's closing.

613
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,172
We need to get you up to surgery

614
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,534
if I'm gonna place
the shunt in time.

615
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,249
I don't...

616
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,403
I don't think I want it.

617
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,822
Mr. Davis, without
the shunt, you...

618
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,491
I'll forget all this. I know.

619
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:22,971
I'll forget that I'm a murderer.

620
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,394
No, Martin.

621
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,275
Martin, you... Think
about what you're saying.

622
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,419
I know you're upset, but
just take a moment, Martin.

623
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,733
I don't need a moment, Doc!

624
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,037
Marty, don't.
Please don't do this.

625
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,076
I can't lose you again.

626
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,677
Please.

627
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,279
Sally. Honey.

628
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,715
I don't remember the
last five years. I lost them.

629
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,720
I come back, I wake
up here, to this?

630
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,490
It's not my life.
It's not our life.

631
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,227
It'll never be our life again.

632
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,263
I can't live with this.

633
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,799
I can't.

634
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,784
You just let me go.
You put me in a home.

635
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:07,888
Don't look back. You let me rot.

636
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:10,758
You let me go.

637
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:21,485
It's not fair. Can't
she just override him?

638
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,953
Martin was very clear.
That's not what he wants.

639
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,266
Yeah, maybe she
can wait until the fluids

640
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,689
build up in his brain again,

641
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,119
and then she can just
make a choice for him.

642
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:33,080
It's his decision, Warren,
not his wife's, not ours.

643
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,899
He's our patient.

644
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,534
He's lucid.

645
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,221
And he's made his
wishes very clear.

646
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,490
Now, we may not agree with them,

647
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,692
but it's our job to honor them.

648
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,884
Hi.

649
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,585
I thought you went home.

650
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,253
No, I was waiting for you.

651
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,600
I can make it home on my
own. I've done it lots of times.

652
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,124
Stop it, please.

653
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,371
Well, stop treating me
like some fragile, little...

654
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,578
Why wouldn't you be fragile?

655
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,180
And why wouldn't
I worry about that?

656
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:09,215
It's been almost two months.

657
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,017
Every day, I wake
up and remember

658
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:15,688
and have to fight just
to pull my crap together.

659
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:20,627
So if it's that hard for me, I got
to figure it's way harder for you.

660
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,216
So you know what?
I will watch you.

661
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,425
I will worry about you. I'm
not gonna apologize for that.

662
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,161
It's kind of what
I'm here for. I just...

663
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,425
I just want to be myself again.

664
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:32,155
I just... I just want
to feel like me.

665
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,124
I know.

666
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,193
I was just saying, you
don't seem like you.

667
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,862
I am! I am! This is me!

668
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,051
Trying to give you space...

669
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:41,126
I don't need space!

670
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,661
I am telling you, I don't...

671
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:44,446
Of course I want to
have sex with my wife...

672
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,353
I am your wife!

673
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,587
I'm right here!

674
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,690
I am your wife.

675
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,464
He probably just lost his phone
and some random lady found it.

676
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,766
Stretch.

677
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,146
Or it was stolen, some
chick stole it and answered it.

678
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,087
Bitch.

679
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,122
How's the driver?

680
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:25,075
So sad.

681
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,420
He had Alzheimer's, but then
he didn't have Alzheimer's,

682
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,089
but then he didn't want
to have killed someone,

683
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,924
so now he's gonna go ahead
and keep the Alzheimer's

684
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,098
that isn't really Alzheimer's.

685
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:35,652
Did Webber talk to you?

686
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,721
About what?

687
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:38,755
Nothing.

688
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,158
Hey, maybe a kid stole it,
and his mom picked it up.

689
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,893
Stole what?

690
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,560
Derek's phone.

691
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,957
We're talking
Meredith off a ledge.

692
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,281
Mmm. I'm good at this.

693
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,716
What?

694
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:50,984
Options.

695
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,788
He was in surgery,
and a nurse picked it up.

696
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:57,657
They pick up our
phones all the time. Hmm.

697
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,727
He was in the lab, and a
research assistant picked it up.

698
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,707
He was in the bathroom,
and a janitor picked it up.

699
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,476
He was in an accident,
and a paramedic picked it up.

700
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,065
Whoa.

701
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:09,285
Hey, listen, it's not the
best option, but viable.

702
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,233
I'm just saying, don't go
looking for zebras here.

703
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,435
I think Derek is...

704
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,502
He's done this before.

705
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,742
What?

706
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,444
Moved to a new
city, got a new job,

707
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,963
ignored his wife's
calls, met a girl,

708
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,264
fell in love, started over.

709
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,253
Wait, what are you
talking about, "Met a girl"?

710
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:25,485
Me. He met me.

711
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,838
He left Addison when
the marriage got hard,

712
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:31,057
moved to Seattle,
met me in a bar.

713
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:33,943
What if he's doing
the same thing now?

714
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,346
Say something.

715
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,835
Look, I've watched you
two suck face for years.

716
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:44,270
You've disgusted me
for a long, long time.

717
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,922
He's into you.

718
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,391
And if a guy is still into you,

719
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,837
it still means he
wants to do you.

720
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,711
And if he still wants
to do you, you're solid.

721
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,057
I don't know you as well
as everyone else here,

722
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,065
but I really need to tell
you to stop talking now.

723
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,134
I didn't want to say
anything in the first place.

724
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,310
Mer, I lived down
the hall from you guys.

725
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,790
I've heard the sex noises.

726
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,641
I've seen the
drama and the tears.

727
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,978
And there is no
way that Derek's...

728
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,698
Look, you and Derek are
living proof that love exists,

729
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,302
that it works,
that there is hope.

730
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,170
You guys are a
freaking romance novel.

731
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,372
And I, for one, am
rooting for you two.

732
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,707
Team MerDer!

733
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,091
I'm not saying that.

734
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,658
Well, somewhere in Georgetown,

735
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:28,726
there's a woman, a very
tall, happy, perky woman

736
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,678
with a lot of great hair.

737
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,397
What if she met Derek in a
bar? What if he fell for her?

738
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,889
I'm pretty sure her friends
are rooting for her, too.

739
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:40,755
Listen, I'm not a
zebra in this scenario.

740
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,647
I wish I were, but I'm
not. I'm just a horse.

741
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,578
Streak is over.

742
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,683
He bradyed down to 20 and
went into third-degree block.

743
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,174
I gave him atropine.

744
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,487
And he's in fib. How long,
Edwards? Three minutes.

745
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,054
Starting compressions.
Grab the paddles.

746
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,161
Me?

747
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,612
Yes, Edwards, you.

748
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,930
Charge to 200.

749
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:06,686
Charged.

750
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:07,770
Clear.

751
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,178
We're losing him.

752
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,091
No, we're not. Charge to 270.

753
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,115
Charged.

754
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,416
Clear.

755
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,671
Oh, my God. We did it.

756
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:26,122
You did it.

757
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,375
Nice work, Edwards.

758
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,193
I thought...

759
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:31,339
The streak was over?

760
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,196
Well, no, I just...

761
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,415
Don't leave him. Check
him every 20 minutes.

762
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,694
Do serial crits.

763
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,446
Make sure there's no
blood in the wound vac.

764
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,630
Keep him alive.

765
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:49,754
Hmm.

766
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,481
Uh, one more thing...

767
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,670
Oh, come on. About Heather.

768
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,819
You found out her name?

769
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,799
What is wrong with you?

770
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,057
I know her name because
I used to go out with her.

771
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,442
Oh.

772
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,490
Well, I'm sorry, but that's
gonna happen sometimes,

773
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,642
and I can't be expected to...

774
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,798
Heather is Steak Knives.

775
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:09,977
What?

776
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,151
Steak Knives.

777
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,904
The Steak Knives?

778
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,439
Yes.

779
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,191
The one who wanted you
to get matching tattoos?

780
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,977
On our 4-week anniversary, yes.

781
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,823
And then when you
didn't want to, she...

782
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,583
Oh, my God.

783
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,230
She seemed so nice. I know.

784
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,032
You never would
have seen it coming.

785
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,200
And I didn't know if it
was my place to tell you.

786
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:35,358
But I wasn't jealous.
I was just worried.

787
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,993
Thank you.

788
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,139
Ugh.

789
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,363
Holy crap, thank you.

790
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,881
Sure.

791
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,595
Hey.

792
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,448
You ready?

793
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,851
Um, wait. I'll catch up.

794
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,021
Wilson.

795
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,041
Dr. Bailey, I am
so sorry for earlier.

796
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,254
It will never happen again.

797
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:11,789
I've pulled myself
together and...

798
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,830
Don't apologize for
caring about your patient.

799
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,682
A lot of doctors aren't
willing to go all-in.

800
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:19,035
It hurts too much.

801
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:22,739
But that's what's gonna make
you such an excellent doctor.

802
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,624
It is?

803
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:27,827
I have a Whipple in
the morning, Wilson.

804
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,345
Scrub in.

805
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,031
You ready?

806
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,416
Yeah.

807
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,252
You okay?

808
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,487
Um, it's a crappy day.

809
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,690
Well, the baby
lived. The dad lived.

810
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,576
We beat the universe
two-to-one. It's a good day.

811
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,507
Hi. Hey.

812
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,867
So, it's later now.

813
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,335
Yeah.

814
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,109
Mmm. Oh, for God's sake.
You've got to be kidding me.

815
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,798
Well...

816
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:39,867
Yeah.

817
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,301
Yeah.

818
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:51,077
"Oh, lift me from the grass

819
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:54,447
"I die, I faint, I fail

820
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:57,851
"Let thy love in
kisses rain on...

821
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:02,271
"On my..."

822
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,173
"On my lips..."

823
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,876
"On my lips..."

824
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,304
Yes. "And..."

825
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,414
"And eyelids pale"

826
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:26,826
This can't be easy for you.

827
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:28,881
No.

828
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,501
It's not.

829
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,810
I'm so sorry about your wife.

830
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,596
It wasn't just my wife.

831
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,067
Ellis had Alzheimer's.

832
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,387
It started early. It
ended her career.

833
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,440
It was devastating to Meredith.

834
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,543
And to me.

835
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,613
Oh, my God.

836
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,740
I thought you
would want to know.

837
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,910
Obviously, it means that
you're genetically inclined.

838
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,963
Oh, my God.

839
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,132
What?

840
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:22,201
I'm so sorry.

841
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,947
No, no, no. I didn't
mean for the news to...

842
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,004
No.

843
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:31,744
I never actually got that CT
earlier. I'm just a little dizzy.

844
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:35,498
I think I might
have a concussion.

845
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,635
Margaret Pierce, you lied to me?

846
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,020
I did. I'm sorry.

847
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:48,227
Richard, I had a full genetic
history done when I was 12.

848
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:51,597
A lot of adopted kids do.

849
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:55,263
I have a genetic
predisposition for Alzheimer's.

850
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,807
Why do you think I do a crossword
puzzle every five minutes?

851
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,942
So you... I have it,
yeah. I knew I had it.

852
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:05,411
I just never knew
where it came from.

853
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:08,759
I was dreading
having to say anything.

854
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,023
I was worried it came from you.

855
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,054
Oh, my God. I'm
so glad it doesn't.

856
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,310
<i>Things are not always
what they appear to be.</i>

857
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:24,781
<i>They're often an indicator
of something bigger going on,</i>

858
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,015
<i>deep underneath...</i>

859
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:33,505
<i>Symptoms, red
flags, warning signs,</i>

860
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,275
<i>things we should
pay attention to,</i>

861
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:38,205
<i>things we shouldn't
ever ignore...</i>

862
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,878
I took the first
flight. Left my keys.

863
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,447
Uh-huh.

864
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:02,185
<i>Things that are bad,</i>

865
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,370
<i>things that could
really hurt us...</i>

866
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,626
You called me, and a
woman answered my phone.

867
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,775
I called you, and a woman
answered your phone.

868
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,782
<i>Things that</i>

869
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:19,635
<i>it might just be
too late to fix.</i>
