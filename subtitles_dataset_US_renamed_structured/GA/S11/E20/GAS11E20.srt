1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,195
<i>A surgical residency is all
about training for the worst.</i>

2
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,297
<i>But as prepared as we might be,</i>

3
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,433
<i>we usually don't
see disaster coming.</i>

4
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,623
<i>We can try to envision
the worst-case scenario</i>

5
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,324
<i>to foresee catastrophe.</i>

6
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,527
Kepner, where is everyone?
Anyone in particular?

7
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,729
Well, page everyone
now. A plane went down.

8
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,238
A small one, but it crashed
right in the middle of the city.

9
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,711
I didn't hear
anything about that.

10
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,480
There it is.

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,786
Let's move, people!

12
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,825
Hey.

13
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,711
Hi.

14
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,747
<i>But when true disaster strikes,</i>

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,316
<i>it often comes out of nowhere.</i>

16
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:08,884
Amelia.

17
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:13,087
I just don't think this,
us, is a good idea.

18
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,140
Mixing work and play. Play?

19
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,545
Play? What am I now, some screw?

20
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,980
I didn't say that. This is more.

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,149
Amelia, you and I
both know this is more.

22
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,502
I don't have any more to give.

23
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,810
I'm not trying to hurt you.

24
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not hurt.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,587
I get it.

26
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,108
And

27
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,277
I'm done.

28
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,357
<i>And when the worst
really does happen...</i>

29
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,916
Owen. You don't want
real. You want the play.

30
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,996
You want the high. You want
the rush. And I'm not doing that.

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,904
I'm not interested,
so I'm done, Amelia.

32
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,907
I've had enough.

33
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:11,107
We need to set up
a central triage area.

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,748
Walking wounded can go to
the ambulatory care center.

35
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,835
<i>We find ourselves
completely blindsided.</i>

36
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,464
<i>Hi. You've reached Dr. Shepherd.</i>

37
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,989
<i>Please leave a message,
and I will return your call.</i>

38
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,420
Hey. So, I just got off the
phone with the White House,

39
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,988
and apparently you
missed your meeting.

40
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,389
I don't know what's going on,

41
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,246
but you probably owe them...

42
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,358
a phone call, I think.

43
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,559
Watch out! Coming through!

44
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,418
Hey! Slow down!
What's your problem?

45
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,620
Sorry. There was a plane crash.

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,543
This is gonna be so good.

47
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:44,608
We are probably looking at
piles of crush injuries, burns.

48
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,726
Compound fractures.
If we're lucky.

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,470
Move it or lose it, ladies!

50
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,986
Sir, I need you to be still.

51
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,643
Wilson, I need
a little help here.

52
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,900
Shut up! Shut up!

53
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,586
Derek!

54
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,922
Grey. Grey, we need a hand.

55
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,035
I flew a plane. I had
the controls in my hands.

56
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,976
I don't know how to fly a plane,
and I flew a freaking plane!

57
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,674
We were in a plane, and
it crashed. Plane crash.

58
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,981
All I could see
was freakin' sky.

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,078
Are you the pilot? No,
no, Sam. Sam's the pilot.

60
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,919
Where is he? Where is Sam?

61
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,372
I don't know! I
only have one shoe!

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,306
Oh, God, Sam.

63
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,992
Transfer her on my
count. One, two, three.

64
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,414
I'll need a trauma panel,
C-spine, chest, and pelvis.

65
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,899
Edwards, grab the ultrasound.

66
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,411
He had a heart
attack or something.

67
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,395
Something happened
to him, and I had to try.

68
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,098
I had to try to land the plane.

69
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,505
Visualize the paracolic gutter.

70
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,474
What's your name? Kate.

71
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,383
Okay, Kate? We're
gonna find your husband,

72
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,788
but first we're gonna
take care of you.

73
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,040
Make sure you check for
fluid in Morison's pouch.

74
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,241
He's not my husband.

75
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,643
It was a date. OWEN:
Smaller movements.

76
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,611
A first date from
that site where you...

77
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,814
Where you put down what
kind of date you want to go on.

78
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,899
And then you meet the
person, and then you go do it.

79
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,173
What about that?

80
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,458
Yeah. Yeah, I see it.

81
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,875
We're almost done here.

82
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:22,305
I've been on a
bunch of those dates,

83
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,696
and it's always bowling or
something that sounds fun,

84
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,264
but then turns out to be dumb.

85
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,549
This guy's like, "Let's
go up in my plane."

86
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,102
And I'm like, "Why not?"

87
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,336
Grey, over here.

88
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,938
And it was perfect.

89
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:37,375
He turned out to be nice and
funny, and we were up in the sky,

90
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,062
<i>and I've never
felt like that before.</i>

91
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,107
Not even with guys I've
been out with a bunch.

92
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:45,100
He's amazing. He's...

93
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,955
Is he gonna be okay? I just...
Like, I don't want to lose him.

94
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,557
I just found him.
I just found him.

95
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,242
Meredith. Get up!

96
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,227
Derek!

97
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,590
I heard your voice.

98
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:58,691
I thought I was dreaming.

99
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,749
Grey? Grey?

100
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,900
Where are we at?

101
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,881
She's got free
fluid in the belly.

102
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,650
We're gonna have to take her up
for a head CT and get her to the OR.

103
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,607
Page Shepherd. Sam,
he's not dead, right?

104
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:09,958
Where is Derek?

105
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:13,144
Please. Please. He can't die.

106
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,758
Have you seen Dr. Robbins?

107
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,098
No, I'm sorry.

108
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:19,901
Alex, where's Robbins?

109
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,965
I don't know. What do
you need, a consult?

110
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,521
I need Robbins.

111
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,455
There was a plane crash.

112
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,024
I know.

113
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,799
But we're okay.
'Cause it's not us.

114
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:53,685
It's not us, so
we're... We're okay.

115
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,303
We are okay.

116
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,506
We are... We are okay.

117
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,510
Did you see the guy out there?
His leg is severed beneath the knee.

118
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,745
Did you see him?

119
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:07,248
- I did. We're okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

120
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,409
The girl,

121
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,027
she can't find her boyfriend.

122
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,070
We're okay.

123
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,840
We're okay.

124
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:01,670
You're awake.

125
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,154
I am now.

126
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,541
Don't pretend staring at me
like that isn't creepy because it is.

127
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,993
Is it sexy creepy or just...

128
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,761
How long have you been
awake? It's still dark out.

129
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,164
A little while. Not too long.

130
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,532
Your snoring woke me up.

131
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,767
I don't snore anymore.

132
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,169
You know, in D.C.,

133
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,155
I could hear the metro
station from my apartment.

134
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,258
The trains would wake
me up every morning.

135
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,793
This is a much
better way to wake up.

136
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,180
Yeah?

137
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,934
Your snoring is like a
train. It's much cuter.

138
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:34,635
I don't snore.

139
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,271
Yes, you do. It's like music.

140
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,422
It's like a birdsong.

141
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,276
A loud, gargling bird.

142
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,130
On a train.

143
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:52,854
They just keep
coming. Is that the pilot?

144
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:55,890
Yeah, Sam Garrett, 36.
BP's 90 palp. Tachy at 120.

145
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,258
Probable abdominal injuries.

146
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:58,526
Then let's get him in.

147
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,849
Have you seen Meredith
or Arizona today?

148
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,918
Mmm-mmm. No. I
haven't. They okay?

149
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,520
There ought to be some rule

150
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,733
that people who have been in
a plane crash can't work on one.

151
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,101
That's not a bad idea.

152
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,992
We should, uh, you know, look
out for them today, you know?

153
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,961
Yes. Oh, uh...

154
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,763
No.

155
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,115
No. Uh, I can't.

156
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,486
I mean, I want to, but I can't
be that person for Arizona.

157
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:28,322
It's, uh, not my place,
you know. Not anymore.

158
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,791
Right. Yeah. Okay.

159
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,528
Yeah.

160
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,808
I need tocolytics for bed six.

161
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,410
One of the overflows
needs a fetal monitor,

162
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,044
and I need you to
call Labor and Delivery

163
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,980
and have them prep for a
C that's heading their way.

164
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,098
Right away. Oh, my...

165
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,199
Don't do that to people!

166
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,439
Sorry. You okay?

167
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,603
Are you kidding? Of
course I'm not okay.

168
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,092
Well, I figured. Look...

169
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,595
A plane crashes into a
whole prenatal yoga class?

170
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,425
I mean, what are the
odds of that? Wait. What?

171
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,760
We were just
doing triangle pose,

172
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,016
and there was this crash,

173
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,679
and a car came right
through the window.

174
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,935
It was terrifying.

175
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,138
Okay, um, moms one
and two are possible labors.

176
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,307
Mom three is hypertensive.

177
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,211
Mom four is possible
labor, or she's freaking out.

178
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,829
Why wouldn't she be?

179
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,793
And mom five is a small abruption
that might require a section.

180
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,066
I mean...

181
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,379
Yeah, you don't
really seem okay.

182
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,635
You need a hand?

183
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,648
No. I'm just in the weeds here.

184
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,406
Yeah, you need a hand.

185
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,776
Kate...

186
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,645
She was so good.
She was amazing.

187
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:24,941
Abdominal distension.

188
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,348
Diffuse tenderness.

189
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,332
He needs a scan
and a cardio consult.

190
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,568
A guy has a heart
attack, crashes his plane.

191
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,403
It's a miracle
he's still talking.

192
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,739
It wasn't me. It was
Kate. She was the miracle.

193
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,775
My chest... Like a
load of bricks on it.

194
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,260
I couldn't move.
She just took over.

195
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,963
I tried to talk her
through the landing,

196
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,615
but she was so
brave. She just did it.

197
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,150
Dr. Grey? Is this Sam?

198
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,619
This is Sam.

199
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,448
Kate won't stop talking
about him. How is he?

200
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,406
You've seen her? Is she okay?

201
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,603
We're taking very good
care of her. Don't you worry.

202
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,178
I'm gonna marry that girl.

203
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,124
Uh, I think the
feeling's mutual.

204
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:02,901
That sounds crazy, but I
will. I'm gonna marry her.

205
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,748
Oh, his pressure's bottomed out.

206
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,066
We need to get him upstairs now.

207
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,024
Hang another
unit on the infuser.

208
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,359
Tell me again.

209
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,544
He likes you.

210
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,480
One, two, three.

211
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,784
He gushed.

212
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,619
He said he was gonna marry you.

213
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,982
Oh, my God. STEPHANIE: I know.

214
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,972
He has these pretty
eyes where you can't tell

215
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,752
if they're green or
hazel or blue or what,

216
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,438
but against the
sky, they're blue.

217
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,213
And he was looking at me, and
he asked me if I was ready to fly.

218
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,166
And the next thing I
know, we were up in the air.

219
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,046
He said flying is his
favorite thing in the world,

220
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,554
and he's so excited,
and he was so good at it.

221
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,223
Like, this is what
he was born to do.

222
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,261
I fell. Right then.

223
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,163
I knew I was looking
at the love of my life.

224
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,831
And we were flying,

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,500
and the air was underneath us

226
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,769
and clouds all around us, and...

227
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,788
I mean, this doesn't
happen, right?

228
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,574
First dates like
this, guys like this?

229
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,093
Up until now, I
would have said no.

230
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,049
But then he started
grabbing his chest,

231
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:10,518
and then we were
falling out of the sky.

232
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,521
It's not fair.

233
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,409
It's not fair.

234
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,476
Hey. Heard you
two caught the pilot.

235
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,401
Yeah, we did.
Going in on him now.

236
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,558
You good? You okay?

237
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:39,614
I'm fine.

238
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,445
'Cause, you know,
there was a plane crash,

239
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,869
and I just thought maybe...

240
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,850
For about a year after the
crash, Arizona had nightmares,

241
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,235
and if I'd come home even
10 minutes late, she'd freak out,

242
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,594
so I just wanted to
see if you're doing okay.

243
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,966
Derek missed his
meeting in D.C.,

244
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,336
and I haven't heard from him.

245
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,232
That's not weird. Okay.

246
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,068
It's not like I should
have heard from him.

247
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,741
We don't call each other every
second. We're not those people.

248
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,528
I'm a surgeon. I'm busy.
He's in D.C. He's busy.

249
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,048
So it's fine that I
haven't heard from him.

250
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,184
It's not a thing.

251
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,250
It's the plane crash, Meredith.

252
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,101
The plane crash is
making you worry.

253
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,776
I know. I know.

254
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,566
You call me if she...

255
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,630
Just call me.

256
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,997
For a while, I would
FaceTime Cristina.

257
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,112
I would prop her up right
there where your head is now.

258
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,013
Half the time, she
was in surgery,

259
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,555
so I would just watch her
operate until I drifted off.

260
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,752
I brought the kids
in the bed for a while

261
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,821
so we could all sleep together.

262
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,125
I printed a tumor, and I
slept with that there for a bit.

263
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,185
It's just weird. I...

264
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,803
That pillow's been
empty for such a long time.

265
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,939
Not now. Not anymore.

266
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,676
I know.

267
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,756
I just wished you didn't
have to go back to D.C. at all.

268
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,791
I wish you could just
stay right here, right now.

269
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,783
It's my last trip, and
then I'm back for good.

270
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,852
I promise. I know.

271
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,123
I've missed you.

272
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:31,876
I missed us.

273
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,105
I have, too.

274
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,101
Okay, let's pack
all four quadrants.

275
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,936
Can you feel the mesentery?

276
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,992
Grey. Did you find
the mesentery?

277
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,911
Oh. I was just... Sorry.

278
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,646
Dr. Grey, do you
need to be replaced?

279
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,315
No. I'm fine.

280
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:58,219
No, you're not fine.
You're distracted.

281
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:02,223
You and Derek went down in a
plane. You drowned. He got shot.

282
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,308
You gave birth
in a power outage.

283
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,071
Is this supposed to
make me feel better?

284
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm just saying you have
every reason to be distracted,

285
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,699
every reason to
think the sky is falling.

286
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,118
Do you need to go? No!

287
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,987
Okay, well, how long can you go

288
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,957
without hearing from him
before you absolutely go crazy?

289
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,561
I don't know. 6:00, 6:30, maybe.

290
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,879
Okay, then, let's say 5:00.

291
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,049
At 5:00 p.m., if you haven't
heard from him, you can panic.

292
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,786
You can call the police,
call the paramedics.

293
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,939
You can freak out until
your little heart's content.

294
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,675
But not one minute
before and not in this OR.

295
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,744
Can you do that?

296
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,845
5:00 p.m.? 5:00 p.m.

297
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,282
Yes.

298
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,383
Okay.

299
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,457
So, it's kind of
an amazing story.

300
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,206
It was their first
date, and they both...

301
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,055
Chief, in or out, please?

302
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,080
I just need to know if Kate is good to
go to the OR for abdominal surgery.

303
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,694
I'm looking. Please look fast.

304
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:04,368
I'm on a timeframe here.
I will not hold you up.

305
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,448
Because this lady will bleed
out if I don't get her up there.

306
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,390
Yes, I am aware you are
impatient. I can't make it my problem.

307
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,126
Does the patient have
a brain bleed or not?

308
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,899
She looks clear. Edwards,
take her up to OR two.

309
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,607
Kind of amazing
about these two, isn't it?

310
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,071
They meet for all of 20
minutes and just fall in love.

311
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,741
I'm not someone who believes
in fate or anything like that,

312
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,005
but it kind of makes
you wonder, doesn't it?

313
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,769
Or maybe not. Maybe
they're both crazy.

314
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,766
But even then, that's what
my grandma used to say,

315
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,401
that that's what
love is all about,

316
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,542
that everyone is
crazy in their own way.

317
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,545
And the trick is finding someone

318
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,465
whose crazy
complements your own.

319
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,685
Edwards, let's just work
without all the talking.

320
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,543
Edwards, what?

321
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,807
Well, I have questions
about the procedure.

322
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,442
You're supposed to
allow me to ask questions,

323
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,527
and I'm supposed to
learn. I have a right to learn.

324
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,279
I'm not... Instead,
you're silencing me.

325
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,548
I've been silenced.
It's unprofessional.

326
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,499
Just because you're
having personal issues

327
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,352
with a co-worker,
with a neurosurgeon,

328
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,837
it's not fair that you
silence my voice.

329
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,094
Fine, fine! What
is your question?

330
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,602
Well, when you glare at me
like that, I can't remember it.

331
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,171
I actually felt it
before I saw it.

332
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,807
Even small planes have
that engine power, you know,

333
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,976
the kind that vibrates
inside your chest.

334
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,072
Did it seem like something was
wrong? As soon as I looked up,

335
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,024
I immediately knew the
descent was in trouble.

336
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,482
The drag, the thrust, the angle.

337
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,868
Practically scraped my
roof. I couldn't believe it.

338
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,671
Well, how close were you again?

339
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,157
I should, you know, probably
see how they're doing in the ER.

340
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,640
Uh, I thought Torres was
down here. I need a consult.

341
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,014
No, she's in OR six.

342
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,077
Hey, are you working
with Arizona today?

343
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,567
Is she doing okay?

344
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,497
Yeah, well, I mean, she
keeps yelling at me to do crap,

345
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,653
so I guess that's normal.

346
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,922
Anyone know how Mer's doing?

347
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,643
Uh, they, um, had a bad
experience on a plane a while back.

348
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,061
Oh...

349
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,380
Yeah, I get that. I hate flying.

350
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,633
My flight out here from
Boston was the worst.

351
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,086
There was some technical
problem with the plane,

352
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:22,990
and so they left us on
the tarmac for four hours.

353
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,554
And they wouldn't let anybody out
of their seats to use the bathroom.

354
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,912
They weren't serving
water, and it was so hot.

355
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,013
It smelled like boiled feet.

356
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,419
And then, after four hours,
they just canceled the flight.

357
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,320
I mean, they just kicked us off.

358
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,389
There was no
apology. There was no...

359
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:42,093
What? You tell her.

360
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,878
Oh, okay. Um...

361
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,198
Here we go.

362
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,549
Looking good here.
How are we doing there?

363
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,837
Looking good so far. Let's
unpack, check what we have.

364
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,084
Pressure's dropping.

365
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,476
That doesn't make any sense.

366
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,155
Uh... There's no
blood in the abdomen.

367
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,558
He's throwing PVCs, and
his pressure is still dropping.

368
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,560
He's going into cardiogenic
shock from the heart attack.

369
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,444
He might be having a repeat MI.

370
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,601
Get Pierce up here now.

371
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,745
Meredith's sister?

372
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,714
Yeah.

373
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,949
And that's how Arizona lost
her leg. I never wanted to ask.

374
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,618
Callie had to amputate.

375
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,456
She would have died if
the leg didn't come off.

376
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,808
It would have killed her.

377
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,744
Oh, my God.

378
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,547
Oh, my God.

379
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:42,671
Uh...

380
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,924
Cutting the
pericardium. Suction.

381
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,162
Here.

382
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,483
Okay, good. That did it.

383
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,633
Oh!

384
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,066
What are you doing?

385
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,818
Acute MI. Cardiac tamponade.

386
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:03,952
His ventricle ruptured.

387
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,036
You need to plug the hole.

388
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,179
I'm trying. I can't
find it. Suction.

389
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,858
Stick your hand in there.

390
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,349
There you are.

391
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,549
Gown me.

392
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,340
Don't move.

393
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,409
He's barely perfusing.

394
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,332
Are you compressing hard enough?

395
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,644
I know how to compress a heart.

396
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,818
Watch my finger.

397
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,080
Okay, Grey, you'd
do well to remember

398
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,648
who you talking to
before you get smacked.

399
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,768
I need a patch,
pledget, and 3-0 Prolene.

400
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,070
His tissue's pretty friable.
You sure a patch will hold?

401
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,212
It has to. In a perfect
world, I'd put him on bypass

402
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,180
and stop his heart completely,

403
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,027
give myself plenty
of time to make sure

404
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,761
that I am sewing
up healthy tissue.

405
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,302
No. No bypass.

406
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,914
Well, we have to
do a splenectomy

407
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,156
and a partial hepatectomy
in order to salvage the liver.

408
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,659
If we put him on bypass,
we'll have to heparinize him,

409
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,506
and he'll bleed out on the table.
- I know.

410
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,842
There's nothing I like more
than being painted into a corner.

411
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,084
That's the spirit. Let's
be optimistic, shall we?

412
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:06,620
Okay. Meredith, I'm gonna need
you to lift your finger on my count.

413
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,222
One, two, three.

414
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,110
Ugh.

415
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,575
We managed to fix
the intestinal tears

416
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,977
without having to
resect the bowel.

417
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,745
You're actually pretty lucky.

418
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,629
With the kind of sudden impact you
took, it could have been a lot worse.

419
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,437
Oh, yeah, and just so you
know, Sam is still in surgery,

420
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:25,839
but he is in excellent hands,

421
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,992
and we will let you know as
soon as we have more news.

422
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,762
Sam? Yeah, Sam, your date.

423
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,265
The pilot of the plane.

424
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,350
What plane?

425
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,772
Why do you keep
talking about a plane?

426
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,392
What happened to me?

427
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:49,129
Please, tell me what
happened to me.

428
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:52,265
Temporary memory loss is very
common in situations like this.

429
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,479
That's your assessment,
that this is all just temporary?

430
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,071
It's my opinion and my hope.

431
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,859
But I will do a repeat CT
and a neuro check every hour.

432
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,639
And you're sure you didn't
miss anything in the first CT?

433
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,297
I didn't miss anything
on the first CT

434
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,915
because there
wasn't anything to see,

435
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,450
but she could have had
a post-surgery stroke

436
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,119
or an evolving
intracerebral contusion.

437
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,588
So you're saying
this was my fault.

438
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,457
I'm saying this
is no one's fault.

439
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,144
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

440
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,292
Do the CT. Let me know
when you have the results.

441
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,178
Hey, mom four looks okay to me.

442
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,880
I think you can discharge
her when you're done here.

443
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:29,281
Thanks. Uh, who do we got?

444
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,805
Uh, mom one, possible
labor turned into definite labor.

445
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,269
Great. Need help? No.

446
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,742
Um, no, yeah. Check on mom two.

447
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,260
I just started
her on nifedipine.

448
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,929
Do what you got to do, but
you keep that baby in there.

449
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,609
What? Nothing.

450
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,818
Then go. Go. Go, go!

451
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,155
Okay, you may feel a little sting
here, but we are almost done, okay?

452
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,435
No, I could tell right
away there was a problem,

453
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,825
the pitch, the air speed.

454
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,605
And I'm wondering,
where does this pilot think

455
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,079
he's gonna land this
bird? But then it's too late.

456
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,993
The thing just roars
right over my head

457
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,011
and crashed in the
street right behind me.

458
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,485
Right behind you?

459
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,320
Hmm?

460
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,017
Behind? Yeah, well, a
little back, a little beyond.

461
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,287
I mean, of course, we're
moving in opposite directions.

462
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:10,127
Wow!

463
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,775
And then I'm racing to the ER
to prep it for the first casualties

464
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,079
and just thanking God I'm alive.

465
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,068
I mean, I knew that they
were stranded out there,

466
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,903
but what they went through?

467
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,172
They gave Dr. Sloan
a pericardiocentesis

468
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,474
with, like, a drinking straw.

469
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,109
They all almost died.

470
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,163
It was love at first sight.
It's real, and they had it.

471
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,065
Who? Oh...

472
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,011
Kate and Sam, the
plane-crash couple.

473
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:35,881
They had it, and now she
can't remember any of it or him

474
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,472
or any of their amazing,
unicorn-magical first date.

475
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,943
Did you know that it was Torres
who sawed off Arizona's leg?

476
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,345
That's what happened?

477
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,480
Yes, and it's so weird
because now we know them.

478
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,834
They're like real people, and
they were in a plane crash.

479
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,020
Oh, oh. And Alex used to
hook up with Grey's sister.

480
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,972
Pierce? She wasn't even here.

481
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,940
No, there was
another one, Lexie.

482
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,075
Was?

483
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,744
She died out there in the woods.

484
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,749
Oh, my God. What if Sam dies?

485
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,563
What if Kate never remembers?

486
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,704
What if Shepherd
made the wrong call

487
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,573
because she's so pissed at
Hunt, and Hunt's so pissed at her,

488
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,994
and he dies, and Kate
doesn't remember any of it?

489
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,725
Like, it never even happened?

490
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:23,250
Like, poof, gone, just
evaporated like it was nothing?

491
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,523
I can never look at any of
them the same again. Never.

492
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:33,327
Yeah, that woman is never gonna
find this kind of love again. Ever.

493
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,414
Hey, who is that?
Where'd you get that baby?

494
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,428
It came flying out of mom two.

495
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,812
I told you to keep that baby in.

496
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,113
I tried. She didn't
respond to the meds.

497
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,515
Little bugger
apparently wanted out.

498
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:44,688
How's his mom?

499
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,168
She's doing great.
Easy delivery.

500
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,169
All right, I'll check on her
after my section on mom five.

501
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,888
You need a hand
with that? No, I'm fine.

502
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,440
Well, I mean, it's not a
problem if you want an assist.

503
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,007
No, I got it. Well,
no, I mean...

504
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,381
No, Alex!

505
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,684
Just get that baby settled in
the NICU and this one, too.

506
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,184
Okay, last suture going in.

507
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,712
Okay. You can let go now.

508
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,769
Damn it! Damn
it. It's not holding.

509
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:17,482
So much for optimism and joy.

510
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:19,283
- What now?
- I don't know.

511
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,992
Maybe there's a way we can
put him on bypass after all.

512
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,445
Are you out of your mind?
No, but I am out of options.

513
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,974
Bypass isn't an
option. You know that.

514
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,447
Do you have a better idea?

515
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,994
Yeah, don't do something
that kills my patient.

516
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:32,069
Dr. Grey, this is our patient,
and you're having a bad day.

517
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,174
Pierce, you are a
very smart woman.

518
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:41,212
There has to be something that
we can do, apart from bypass,

519
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,158
that doesn't involve
sending this man home

520
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,793
with your hand in his chest.

521
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,729
So we are all going to
be quiet and let you think,

522
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,113
and you are going to
come up with something.

523
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,345
Cyanoacrylate.

524
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,031
Glue? You want to use
glue to put the patch in?

525
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,360
What makes you
think that's gonna hold

526
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:03,694
any better than
the stitches did?

527
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,878
Bailey's infectious optimism.

528
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:11,825
You heard the
woman. Cyanoacrylate.

529
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,593
We don't have any on hand.

530
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,296
Then go get some!

531
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,182
He's in fib.

532
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,479
What are you waiting for?

533
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:21,596
Go get that glue now!

534
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,780
Move! MEREDITH: Run!

535
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,107
- Charge to 25.
- Clear.

536
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,183
Again. Clear.

537
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,377
Come on, come on, come on.

538
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,779
Come on, come on, come on.

539
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,904
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, come on.

540
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,218
Oh, there he is.
We got him back.

541
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,720
He barely has a pressure.

542
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,237
Where the hell is that glue?

543
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,501
It's coming. Any minute now.

544
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,946
Any minute.

545
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,331
I have the glue!

546
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,483
Optimism for the win.

547
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,697
All right, nurse, I need
your finger back in here,

548
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,989
and I need another
patch. All right.

549
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,530
Let's try this again, shall we?

550
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,149
On my count. Hands
up and see if it holds.

551
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,853
One, two, three.

552
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,344
Pressure's

553
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,171
good.

554
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,242
Well, that was fun.

555
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,293
Okay, great. Now tell
me your name again.

556
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:42,449
Kate Shaw.

557
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,151
Good. Squeeze my finger.

558
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,300
What city are we in?
Seattle, Washington.

559
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,487
Very good, other hand.

560
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,134
Now, tell me who's the
current US President?

561
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:52,003
Unless it's changed in the last
hour, it is still Barack Obama.

562
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,611
Nice. Now, tell me about
when you got on the plane.

563
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm sorry. I still...
No! No. Sorry.

564
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:06,773
You have to, okay?
Remember. Sam. Remember?

565
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,403
You thought he was really cute.

566
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,126
I know, you keep saying that.

567
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,975
And you really liked him,
and he really, really liked you.

568
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,498
Why do you keep...

569
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,227
Because I think you're
meant to be together, okay?

570
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,163
I don't... If you're not,
then what's the point

571
00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:19,964
of a plane crashing and
bringing the two of you here?

572
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:21,908
It's just... Stop it!

573
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,625
I don't know,
okay? I don't know!

574
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,270
You keep telling
me all of these things

575
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,039
that I'm supposed to
know, and I don't know!

576
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,412
You're not helping!

577
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,548
- This isn't helping.
- Dr. Edwards!

578
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,287
Edwards!

579
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,989
What the hell were
you trying to do in there?

580
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,591
You do not push
a patient like that.

581
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,187
I just... I hoped
that I could...

582
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,040
What, that you could
badger her into remembering?

583
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,246
That is not how this works.

584
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,898
She was distressed
enough already,

585
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,566
and you are only
making it worse.

586
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,980
Dr. Shepherd, you can stop
yelling at my resident in the hallway.

587
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,081
Your resident?

588
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,521
Yes, yes, today
she's my resident.

589
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,267
Okay, I can yell at
any resident I want to,

590
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,586
especially if she has
been tormenting my patient.

591
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,821
It looks completely
unprofessional.

592
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,373
You really wanna
argue about this?

593
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:02,858
Listen... I do, actually,
because you have been

594
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,826
totally unreasonable
at every level.

595
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,333
And you are
completely out of line.

596
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,834
Listen! Okay?

597
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,957
This story? It's all about me.

598
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:12,984
When I tell it, it's about me.

599
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:16,543
It's not about you or you or the
fact that you two are messed up

600
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,823
'cause you can't figure
out how to date or hook up

601
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,242
or whatever it is that you're
doing that I just don't care about.

602
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,834
Me. I am the protagonist.
You don't interest me.

603
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:29,155
This story is about
love and I will find it,

604
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,337
that he is out there, and
that even if I crash a plane,

605
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,960
he is out there.

606
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,807
And it doesn't work
unless she remembers,

607
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,911
and you're ruining it for me.

608
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,332
I am the hero.

609
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,869
Kate is the patient
that I saved,

610
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:45,722
and you two, you
two are messing it up.

611
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:55,382
I'm gonna...

612
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:57,552
I should...

613
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,087
Hey. ARIZONA: Hey,
oh, please don't tell me

614
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,622
you've birthed another
one of my babies.

615
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,475
No, no. All the yoga
ladies are in repose.

616
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,709
Their word, not mine.

617
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:12,877
Oh, it's about time.

618
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,213
Is this the abruption?

619
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,914
Where do you want me? - Outside.

620
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,699
Oh, come on, let me
help. I don't need your help.

621
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,784
I need you to stop hovering.

622
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,169
I'm not hovering. Yes, you are.

623
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,105
You're hovering and
lurking and creeping.

624
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,256
Look, I'm just trying to help
you. No, Alex, you're not.

625
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,891
Meredith asked you
to watch out for me

626
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,593
because she thinks I'm coming
apart, but I am not coming apart.

627
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,612
But you hovering
doesn't make it any easier.

628
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,035
What would make it easier

629
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,938
is if you got out of my
OR and let me do my job!

630
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,201
I'll do a TEE on Sam later to
make sure that the repair holds.

631
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,291
Any word? No.

632
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,573
5:00.

633
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,109
What's at 5:00?

634
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:58,423
Derek missed his meeting
in D.C. this morning.

635
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,358
I called him, and
he didn't pick up,

636
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,782
and I haven't heard
from him all day.

637
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,601
5:00 is my deadline.

638
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,738
If there's no news, then I'm
gonna go home and freak out.

639
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,255
You're freaking out
now, though, aren't you?

640
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,695
Yeah.

641
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:16,274
Going over everything
you can think of.

642
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:18,176
You're going back to the
last conversation you had

643
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,111
and playing it over
and over in your head

644
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:22,285
from beginning to end, right?

645
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,122
Yeah.

646
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,309
Yeah. That's what
I would do, too.

647
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,796
You should go home, Mer.

648
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:44,324
Zola wants a car.
Did she tell you?

649
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:46,003
A car? Yeah.

650
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:48,139
I asked her, "I'm gonna bring
something back from D.C.

651
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:49,429
"What would you like?"

652
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:52,482
And she goes, "I
would like to have a car."

653
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,081
I thought we were at least
10 years away from that.

654
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,825
Oh, it's gonna be
here before you know it.

655
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:03,543
You know, remember ages ago,

656
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,312
you and I had a
really big fight?

657
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,982
And I told you, I said,

658
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,570
"You're like coming
up for fresh air."

659
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:17,223
Like I was drowning,
and you saved me.

660
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,444
I still feel that way

661
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:26,649
when I see you, what
we have, our family.

662
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,374
That's the feeling. It's you.

663
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,309
It's always been you.

664
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:47,420
And I want more.
Of this, of us, of...

665
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,190
I want to have more.

666
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,112
Let's have more.

667
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,765
I mean it.

668
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,116
You're crazy.

669
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,668
That's not a no.

670
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,920
Another baby? Sure.

671
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,521
Seriously?

672
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,090
I'm completely serious.

673
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,753
Like right now, you want to...

674
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:11,678
No, you are serious.

675
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,433
And now I see it,
like 20 yards out,

676
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,702
nothing but fear and
panic on the pilot's face.

677
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,416
You could see into the cockpit?

678
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,850
We locked eyes.

679
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,341
And then at the last second,

680
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,471
I dove into the passenger
seat. I could feel the plane.

681
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:29,129
Dr. Webber? Can I
grab you for a sec?

682
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,663
Um, excuse me.

683
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,388
So, I've heard you tell this
story six different ways today,

684
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,623
and each time, the plane
seems to be getting closer.

685
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,854
I'm pretty sure the next time
it'll end with, "And then I died."

686
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,389
I think you're
missing the point here.

687
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,779
I guarantee I am.

688
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:51,284
Maybe I didn't
exactly die back there,

689
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,498
but I sure as hell could have.

690
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:56,406
I did look up from my car today.

691
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,377
I did see a plane
coming toward me.

692
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:04,848
And for a split second, I
did find myself thinking,

693
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,734
"Maybe this is it. This
is where it all ends,

694
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:14,140
"on 37th street, between a
yarn shop and a falafel stand."

695
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:18,294
I know what a near-death
experience is, and this wasn't my first.

696
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:22,215
And it's true. Your life
flashes right before your eyes.

697
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:25,285
And this morning, mine did.

698
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:28,622
And suddenly, I
saw how much I had.

699
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,676
Catherine, this hospital,

700
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,238
all of the people I've affected,

701
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,543
all the people
who've affected me.

702
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,800
And let me tell you.

703
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:42,568
It scared the hell out of me.

704
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:46,940
Because the minute you
see all the things you have,

705
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:50,527
you see all the things
that you stand to lose.

706
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:56,215
Look, maybe I did
embellish the story some.

707
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,286
I mean, that's human
nature, I guess.

708
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:03,056
But right now, I'm taking
stock of what I have,

709
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:07,053
and I'm feeling pretty grateful.

710
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,399
Alex, hey. I'm sorry
that I snapped at you.

711
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,034
I know you were trying to
make me feel better, but...

712
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,840
I was making me feel better.

713
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,110
It's just I wanted you
to be okay, all right?

714
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,995
I'm sick of feeling bad.

715
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,697
Why? Why would you feel bad?

716
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:32,001
Do you know it was
me who cut off your leg?

717
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,371
Callie was stuck in surgery,

718
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,306
and your circulation
collapsed from sepsis,

719
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,675
and she decided
you had to lose it.

720
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,678
But I made the cut.
I'm the one who did it.

721
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,348
Just... I don't know if you knew
that or wanted to, but it's true.

722
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:52,221
Are you pissed? I mean,
you can be pissed. I get it.

723
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,307
Thanks.

724
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,509
For telling me.

725
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,095
You're sure it's okay
that we're up here?

726
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,187
Oh, yeah, totally sure, but
maybe keep your voice down.

727
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,399
People are sleeping. That's all.

728
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,543
Okay.

729
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,743
All right. Here we are.

730
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,646
This is him?

731
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,864
This is Sam.

732
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,203
You don't recognize him at all?

733
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,347
I...

734
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:32,946
I don't know.

735
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,297
Dr. Edwards.

736
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,411
You know what? Take your
time. I'm gonna be right back.

737
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,439
You are just trying to
get fired, aren't you?

738
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:44,691
Dr. Shepherd, I'm sorry.

739
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,293
I told you to take it easy.
This is not taking it easy.

740
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:49,139
She just had surgery. She
should not be out of bed.

741
00:35:49,163 --> 00:35:51,091
I know. I thought that if
she saw... No, I disagree.

742
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,844
These are not the actions
of someone who thinks.

743
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:55,702
- This is someone...
- Oh, my God!

744
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:59,472
I'm sorry. I know I'm
supposed to keep it down, but...

745
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,278
We had sandwiches.

746
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,947
Wait... You did?

747
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,218
We did. He made them.

748
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,282
I don't like to eat on dates.

749
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,975
I never have an
appetite. I'm too nervous.

750
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,494
But he made them,
and so I took one,

751
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:24,998
and I ate it because I
wasn't nervous at all.

752
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,299
Not with him.

753
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,623
We had sandwiches
on his plane on our date,

754
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,809
on our first date.

755
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:41,130
This is Sam, right? And I'm
actually remembering this?

756
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,335
This isn't... I'm not just
remembering what you told me?

757
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:48,021
No, the sandwich
story is news to us.

758
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:55,978
I want to see his eyes.

759
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,516
You said they were
beautiful. I don't remember.

760
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:03,052
I wish he'd open them.

761
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:05,371
He will.

762
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,796
So, am I still fired?

763
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,966
Not today. Not for this.

764
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,269
But who knows what
you'll pull tomorrow.

765
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,006
Why didn't you tell me? Hmm?

766
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,645
About Alex and my leg.

767
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,894
Freaking Karev.

768
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,612
Don't be mad at
him. He's an idiot.

769
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:38,004
I was trying to protect him,
but why did he have to...

770
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:40,991
All this time, you let
me hold it against you.

771
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,125
Why?

772
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,680
I made the call.

773
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,199
I mean, no matter what,

774
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,180
it was still me making
the call to take your leg,

775
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,155
and I knew that you
were going to hate me.

776
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,021
I didn't want you
to hate Alex, too.

777
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,245
I wanted you to have somebody.

778
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,700
Thank you.

779
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,673
Chief!

780
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:18,077
Tell Kepner I'll be down soon
to help triage the stragglers.

781
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,713
I thought you'd like to know
Kate's memory is coming back.

782
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:23,827
It's still incomplete, but
I'm expecting a full recovery.

783
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,551
Thank you. I'm glad to hear it.

784
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:28,988
You say I'm playing games?

785
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,618
I am here, ready to talk,

786
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,303
but you are pissed at me,
so I'm getting punished.

787
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:34,121
I'm not punishing anyone,
and I'm not doing this.

788
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,561
I want to.

789
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,899
I want to do this because
this is unfair! This is...

790
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:41,234
Amelia, back off.

791
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,147
You wanted professional.
I'm giving you professional.

792
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:45,304
No, you're not. You
are hardly being civil.

793
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:48,658
I am sorry if I hurt your
feelings. I am, but...

794
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,538
This is not about you!
Everything isn't about you!

795
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,173
Then what is it? There
was a plane crash.

796
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,363
Yes, but... Not the one today.

797
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,563
I'm talking about the plane
that had Meredith and Derek

798
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:04,139
and Arizona and Mark
and Lexie and Cristina.

799
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,978
I put them on that plane.

800
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,498
I signed the requisition
for the airline.

801
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,234
I paid for it. I was in charge.

802
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,233
I don't care how long I've
been out of the service.

803
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,424
It was my watch, and
they were my men.

804
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,493
And...

805
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,464
I failed them.

806
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,932
It was my fault.

807
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,886
So, when something
like this happens today,

808
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,421
it brings it all back up.

809
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,561
There was a plane crash.

810
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,744
Owen.

811
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,446
And I won't survive
another plane crash, Amelia.

812
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:06,368
And that's all we are.

813
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,725
<i>Why do bad things
happen to good people?</i>

814
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:34,130
<i>We ask that question so
often, it's become a cliche.</i>

815
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,999
<i>But that's because bad things
do happen to good people.</i>

816
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,340
<i>Constantly.</i>

817
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:52,865
<i>You just have to hope
that when it's your turn,</i>

818
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:55,017
<i>you'll know what to do,</i>

819
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,456
<i>how to cope,</i>

820
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,910
<i>how to persevere.</i>

821
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,915
Help you with
something, Edwards?

822
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,318
No, sir.

823
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,519
What are you doing?

824
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:16,706
I am enjoying the view, sir.

825
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,912
Me, too, Edwards.

826
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,065
Me, too.

827
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,990
<i>But the truth is</i>

828
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,380
<i>you don't know how you'll
react to your worst-case scenario.</i>

829
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,373
<i>None of us do.</i>

830
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,383
<i>Not until it happens.</i>
