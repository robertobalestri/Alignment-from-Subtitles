1
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:22,223
<i>They say life doesn't
give you second chances.</i>

2
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:27,209
<i>But we do.</i>

3
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,914
<i>Surgeons do.</i>

4
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,483
Hey. ER? Yep.

5
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,318
Uh, so, sorry about last night.

6
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:37,881
Don't worry about
it. You're mad.

7
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,615
We just... We really
lost track of time...

8
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,985
I'm not. It's fine.
Forget it. Oh.

9
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,970
<i>You break a bone,
we put it back together.</i>

10
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:46,223
<i>You bleed, we make it
stop.</i> HERMAN: Well?

11
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,108
<i>You flatline, we
resuscitate you.</i>

12
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,275
What did you decide?

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,516
I didn't! I was up all
night. Mmm-hmm.

14
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,168
Then you had ample time.

15
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,198
You can't drop a bomb
like "I have a brain tumor"

16
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,440
and expect me to decide
anything. I need to know more.

17
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,854
You don't need to know anything
that you don't already know.

18
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,611
Okay, great. Why the pills?

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,380
I'm getting a migraine.
You're not helping.

20
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,082
This... This is what I mean.

21
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,795
Is it a migraine
or is it the tumor?

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,563
What kind of tumor is
it? What does it mean?

23
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,499
Are you gonna get
tremors during surgery?

24
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:14,935
You're talking me through a
procedure and you slur your speech?

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,091
I need to know more!

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,126
You don't get to.

27
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,407
Of course I'm not gonna do
anything to endanger my patients.

28
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,882
I am handling my
situation responsibly,

29
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:28,504
but it is my situation, and
you are not entitled to it.

30
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:31,689
You are entitled
to my knowledge,

31
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:37,062
to my years of discoveries
and mistakes and dead ends

32
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,615
and blood and
sweat and innovations

33
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,118
that you don't have to go
through. That's the deal.

34
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,122
The chance to take my work

35
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,824
into your future.

36
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:51,693
Just you.

37
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:59,083
So could you please
make up your mind?

38
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,354
<i>But as much as we give
people second chances,</i>

39
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,106
<i>surgeons don't usually get them.</i>

40
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,075
Surgeries are canceled.

41
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,478
Round on my service.
I have an appointment.

42
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,282
And don't ask what it is, 'cause,
of course, I'm not gonna tell you.

43
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,179
<i>Because the kind
of mistakes we make</i>

44
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,187
<i>are sometimes
impossible to recover from.</i>

45
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,174
What's wrong with you?

46
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,854
Uh... I was up all night.

47
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,895
Me too.

48
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:30,365
Ah, Sofia's been acting out, asking
questions about me and Arizona,

49
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,646
and I don't know what to
tell her or how to tell her,

50
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,790
so I'm just not sleeping. I'm
miserable. Why didn't you sleep?

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,522
Oh, you don't want to know.

52
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,108
What's going on?

53
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,877
Derek and I were up
having sex all night.

54
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,266
Yeah, I kind of didn't
want to hear that.

55
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,982
Sixty-nine-year-old male, jumped
two stories from a burning building.

56
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,508
Shocky, BP's 95 over
60 with a rate in the 120s.

57
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,727
GCS 14 in the field.

58
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,261
Hattie...

59
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,681
Why am I looking at two
patients on one gurney?

60
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,109
She's dead. OWEN: What?

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,345
Hattie... We
couldn't find a pulse.

62
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:09,454
And we tried to pull her off,
but the husband just held on.

63
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,123
He was agitated. He
wouldn't let her go.

64
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,104
So we had to stop 'cause we
were afraid we were gonna hurt him.

65
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,511
What've we got? Oh, wow.

66
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,946
Hattie...

67
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,543
Witnesses said he carried
his wife out the window

68
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,144
and jumped to escape the fire.

69
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,595
We think he was
trying to break her fall.

70
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,964
Let's get them into trauma one.

71
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:26,299
Amy, where do you need me?

72
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,634
You got the head
lac in bed 3, right?

73
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,901
Yeah, that's nothing.
I can jump in on this.

74
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,475
I don't need you.

75
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,910
Is that good management,

76
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,623
you leaving your star
player on the bench?

77
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,214
You won't be for long.

78
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,682
People are always hitting
their heads on something.

79
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,930
His skin is mottled
and cyanotic.

80
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,098
We have to get her off of him.

81
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,749
Sir, you have to let her go. No.

82
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,822
We have to move her

83
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,135
to help you. MALE
PATIENT: No, no.

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,479
Sir, what is your name? Norris.

85
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,706
Is she... MEREDITH: Norris...

86
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,158
You don't have to worry
about that right now, sir.

87
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:54,282
No, he does, actually.
Of course he does.

88
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,379
Norris, what is your wife's name?
- Is she...

89
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,202
Harriet.

90
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,337
Hattie.

91
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,308
Norris.

92
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,543
Norris, it's time to let
Hattie go. She's gone.

93
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,145
Gone? What do you mean gone?

94
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,097
Norris, she died.

95
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,582
No. No.

96
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,129
She's gone. I'm
sorry. Hattie, no...

97
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,164
You did everything
you could. No! No...

98
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,716
You helped her
through the hardest part.

99
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,775
You held her, you protected
her, and she died in your arms.

100
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,328
And I'm sure she couldn't
think of a better way to go.

101
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,191
She's no longer in any
pain, Norris, but you are,

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,265
and she wouldn't want you to be.

103
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,168
You have to let her go now
so we can help you, okay?

104
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,439
She's mine. I can't.

105
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,759
Norris. Norris, I'm so sorry.

106
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,460
It's time.

107
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,723
Okay.

108
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,040
On three.

109
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:57,245
One, two, three.

110
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,931
Let's go. Come on.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
I'll go pronounce. Hattie...

112
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,670
Hattie...

113
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,405
Honey... Honey...

114
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,318
Airway's intact, but
there's a little soot.

115
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,635
Hypotensive and a rigid abdomen.

116
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,571
Pupils are equal and
reactive bilaterally.

117
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:12,922
Right lower leg is
tense and swollen.

118
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,657
I'm gonna measure
compartment pressures.

119
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,225
Quiet. Breath sound
is decreased on the left.

120
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,544
Add right tib/fib
to the trauma films.

121
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,784
Quiet!

122
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,769
I got a pulse.

123
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,316
Barely palpable, but it's there.

124
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,724
Trauma two! Pierce,
Shepherd, you're with me.

125
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,893
She's alive?

126
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:30,545
She is.

127
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,397
You'll take care of her?

128
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,166
I will.

129
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,554
I'll take real good
care of her. I promise.

130
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,972
Where's Dr. Herman?

131
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,574
Did you call my mom?

132
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,187
You said to wait until there's
something to be worried about.

133
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,211
Well, now I'm worried.

134
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:48,480
Why isn't she moving?

135
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,493
Emily, Corey, I'm concerned

136
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,829
that the baby might be
bleeding into the tumor itself,

137
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,296
and it's causing
her to be anemic.

138
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,881
Oh, my God. Will
she be all right?

139
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,255
Where's Dr. Herman?

140
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:01,576
She had an, um, appointment
with another patient.

141
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,361
Well, she can do
something, right?

142
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,491
She said she'd do everything
to get the baby to term.

143
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,599
That was the whole point
of planning fetal surgery.

144
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,751
And that's still the point.

145
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,799
Dr. Herman will likely perform
an intrauterine transfusion.

146
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,417
I will apprise her,
and we'll come back

147
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,018
and talk to you about
how to move forward.

148
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,925
Sit tight, okay? Okay.

149
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,480
Where is Dr. Herman?

150
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,893
I have no idea, but
she better pick up,

151
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,198
because Emily Jensen's
baby's gonna die.

152
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,221
Good tube placement.

153
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,269
Yeah, the hemopneumothorax is
bigger. Edwards, prep for a chest tube.

154
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,338
Before you do that, Edwards,
can you check with CT again

155
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,573
and see when they can take us?

156
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,241
But she's bleeding
into her lung.

157
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,377
I know, but I felt a depressed
temporal bone fracture,

158
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,011
and she has spinal fluid
coming out of her ear.

159
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,651
I need a CT to confirm.

160
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,471
I'm on my way up to Radiology. Is
anyone free to update the family?

161
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,639
Mmm-hmm.

162
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,096
Sarah?

163
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,065
What are you doing here? Amelia.

164
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,733
You're a doctor?

165
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,886
I am, yeah.

166
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,355
My parents, they were in a fire.

167
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,991
Oh, God.

168
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,093
Okay. Um...

169
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,690
This is what we know so far.

170
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:14,482
Your father has some internal
injuries and a leg fracture.

171
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:18,636
Your mom has some bleeding
into her lung and a cranial fracture.

172
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,272
As her neurosurgeon, I'm gonna
need to do some surgery to...

173
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,058
Wait.

174
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,778
You want to do
surgery on my mom?

175
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,381
No. No. I'm sorry,
but no. No. I...

176
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,717
Excuse me. I need
a different doctor.

177
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,402
Sarah...

178
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,899
She cannot touch my
mother. It's not just...

179
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,718
I need a different
doctor right now.

180
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:39,818
Okay. Calm down. Let's just...

181
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,738
No! I want another doctor!

182
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,856
What's the problem here?

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,080
She cannot touch my
mother. She's a drug addict.

184
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,643
I can't have her
operate on my parents.

185
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,944
Hold it. Dr. Shepherd is our...

186
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,750
Is a junkie.

187
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,431
I met her in Narcotics
Anonymous. She's hooked on oxy.

188
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:56,690
She overdosed with her boyfriend and
woke up with him dead in bed with her.

189
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,159
I want another doctor.

190
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,427
Now!

191
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,006
Come with me. Just
come with me, please.

192
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,808
No! I'm... No, no!
This way, please.

193
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:03,943
You keep her away from them!
Hunt, don't worry. I've got this.

194
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,449
Keep her away from them!

195
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,959
Follow me, ma'am.
Calm down and follow me.

196
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,720
What was that?

197
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,744
You just took Amelia's surgery?

198
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,329
What was I supposed to do?

199
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,281
Take her side.

200
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,765
She was being attacked.

201
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,817
The woman had it
out for her, Meredith.

202
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,069
If anything goes wrong,

203
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,731
she'll go blaming her
because she was an addict.

204
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,139
You're gonna go talk to
Owen, right, and clear this up?

205
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,524
Yes, I will.

206
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,633
I paged you three times.

207
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,830
Yeah, keep your pants on. I'm
consulting on three babies here...

208
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,966
I have a mom whose fetus
is bleeding into her SCT.

209
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,317
She needs an
intrauterine transfusion.

210
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,992
It's inserting a 6-inch
needle into an umbilical vein

211
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,711
without rupturing membranes
or inducing bradycardia.

212
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,624
I've never done one,
and Herman's AWOL.

213
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,465
So, you deliver. You'll
take the baby out.

214
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:11,916
I'll repair the SCT myself.

215
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,767
Alex, the baby's 28 weeks.

216
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,199
The whole point in seeing Herman
was to try and get her to term.

217
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,984
Yeah, it'd be great if she were
here, but I know how to save this kid.

218
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:24,890
<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>

219
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,292
<i>of Dr. Nicole Herman.</i>

220
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,882
Herman, Robbins again.

221
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:30,385
The Jensen baby's anemic,
and the MCA flow is 70.

222
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,871
I will give you 30 minutes,
and if I don't hear from you,

223
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,341
I'm gonna do a C-section
and resect the SCT.

224
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,777
Okay. I'm gonna book an OR,

225
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,523
and can you be ready in
30 minutes if I need you?

226
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,679
Yeah.

227
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,068
That's good. Okay. Thank you.

228
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,535
She's losing it. Yes, she is.

229
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,872
Look, it's your first solo
surgery. It's a big deal.

230
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,152
If you're too nervous,

231
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,416
I am more than happy
to take it off your hands.

232
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:56,939
I'm not nervous.

233
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,508
Great. Then you'd
better not be pregnant.

234
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,465
Because if you let Karev
throw a baby in there,

235
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,733
I will never forgive you.

236
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,396
I'm not pregnant,
and I am not nervous.

237
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,614
I know how to fix a hernia.

238
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,738
Step one, medial dissection.

239
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,374
Step two, identify triangle
of doom, avoid the iliac vein.

240
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,283
Step three... Puke.

241
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,895
Bailey's gonna eat you alive.

242
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,675
No, she's not,
because I'm a badass.

243
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,819
Step three, lateral
dissection. Step four...

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,620
Identify triangle of pain.

245
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,732
See? Great.

246
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,234
I have got this procedure down,

247
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,126
and I am not afraid
of little bitty Dr. Bailey.

248
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,492
Think you could turn the
faucet on for me, Dr. Badass?

249
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,462
I'd do it myself,
only I'm so little bitty.

250
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,091
Shh. Here she comes.

251
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,438
That's really scary, the idea
of her operating on someone.

252
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,928
Did you know she was an addict?

253
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,321
It must be because
she's Shepherd's sister.

254
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,057
I need to talk to you.

255
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,396
She just said it in
front of everyone,

256
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,042
all this stuff that I said
at meetings about...

257
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,648
It's okay. Are you sober?

258
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,835
How is it okay?
Everyone is looking at me.

259
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,770
Are you sober?

260
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,173
Of course I am.

261
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:35,776
Did you disclose your
recovery when you were hired?

262
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,580
I didn't have to! Derek hired me.
He knew. I assumed people knew.

263
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,082
And you've done nothing wrong.

264
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,835
Okay? She did.

265
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,436
She violated your privacy.

266
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,773
And you are under no obligation
to tell anyone anything more,

267
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,526
unless you've done something to
compromise your ability to do your job,

268
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,445
and you haven't.

269
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,148
So you don't need to
say anything more about it.

270
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,315
Okay.

271
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,984
Those are your rights.

272
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,104
It's the past, and you
don't have to defend it.

273
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,475
I thought I got away from it.

274
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:08,784
Coming here, I thought...

275
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,946
I thought I had a chance to...

276
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,337
But you never get away from it.

277
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,406
No.

278
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,107
No, you don't.

279
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,763
What do I do now?

280
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,065
You just stay on track.

281
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:34,568
You look after
yourself, do your job.

282
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:38,005
And as soon as you can,
you need to get to a meeting.

283
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,139
Well?

284
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,538
Time's up. Let's
take the baby out.

285
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,812
You're making the right call.

286
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,948
Hey, it's Robbins, again.

287
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,737
So you've left me no choice, and
for all I know, you could be dead.

288
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,986
So I've made my
decision about you.

289
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,575
I am telling Chief Hunt as
soon as I get out of surgery.

290
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,712
Is that her? Yeah, that's her.

291
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,687
Dr. Shepherd. Um...

292
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,588
Could we go somewhere
private and talk?

293
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,604
I'm busy right now, actually.

294
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:33,478
This is important.

295
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,398
Listen.

296
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,252
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

297
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,023
To clear this up?

298
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,475
I don't.

299
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,595
I think you heard all the facts.

300
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,699
What I heard was a very
distraught woman shouting.

301
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,868
And I think there is
another side to this story.

302
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,139
A woman requested another doctor,
and I was removed from the case.

303
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,640
That is her right.
People have rights.

304
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,121
Listen, I am just trying
to have a conversation.

305
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,130
That is none of your business if
I'm doing my job. Am I doing my job?

306
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,983
Amelia, I am trying
to help you here.

307
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,301
I just...

308
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,498
I don't have to
discuss this with you.

309
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,312
And that's your answer?

310
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,200
That's my right.

311
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,139
Okay.

312
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,650
Let's clamp and cut.

313
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:49,470
And here she is.

314
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,506
I've got her.

315
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,602
All right, let's
exteriorize the uterus.

316
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,986
Starting an umbilical line.

317
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,304
How's she doing?

318
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,328
Let's pre-oxygenate
her before we intubate.

319
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,599
Can you handle this?

320
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,128
You just need to deliver the
placenta and then close the...

321
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,063
I've only done about
a million C-sections.

322
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,198
How you doing now? ALEX: Bad.

323
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:07,342
OR 7 is waiting for us.

324
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,752
Graham, I'm going with the baby,

325
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,977
so just come and find me
when you're done, all right?

326
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,313
All right, let's go!
We're on the move!

327
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,292
Damn it. This lobe is trashed.

328
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,033
We're gonna have
to do a lobectomy.

329
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:20,179
We really have to
take that much lung?

330
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:21,447
We'll try to save

331
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:22,831
as much as possible.

332
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,300
Wait. Where's the
bleed? Where's the bleed?

333
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,634
I can't find it.

334
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,936
Okay. DEREK:
Everything okay there?

335
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,086
All right. Here's what you do.

336
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,488
- Drop the suction.
- Yeah.

337
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,640
Now reach in there
and grab the hilum

338
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,974
and twist it off
like a garden hose.

339
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,982
Just slow the flow of
blood until I can find...

340
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:38,219
Ah! Yes. There we go.

341
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,938
Hattie...

342
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,208
That was really cool.

343
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,145
You may keep going,
Dr. Shepherd, but go easy.

344
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,947
Hattie here has a hot
date with her husband.

345
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,766
Okay. Gotcha.

346
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,285
Sinus flap coming off.

347
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,381
Yep, just like it's supposed to.

348
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:56,485
Good.

349
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,185
- Boy or a girl?
- What's that?

350
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,449
Your baby.

351
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,243
Oh, right. Yes. Um...

352
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:04,812
Actually we have
decided to be surprised.

353
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,730
That's a good call.

354
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,028
Ah, it's April's idea.
Actually, it's driving me crazy.

355
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,518
What would be the point

356
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,164
of knowing everything you
possibly could about your child

357
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,655
when it's so much fun to be
hopelessly unprepared, right?

358
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,525
Yeah, we found out
my son was a boy.

359
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:18,976
See?

360
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,189
Yeah, but I didn't know
he was gonna be delivered

361
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,391
by an intern in a
pitch-black room

362
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,916
in the middle of a superstorm,
but surprises happen.

363
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,886
That's a good story,
but I find no comfort in it.

364
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,716
Yeah, well, and this.

365
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,241
I've been on the
bench for weeks,

366
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,078
yet here I am, saving a woman's
life without even opening her skull.

367
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,015
Embrace surprises, Avery.

368
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,836
Lateral incision's done.
Going for medial now.

369
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,567
His spleen is shattered. Give
me the longest Kelly you have.

370
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,631
Here you go.

371
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,342
He was a human
trampoline for his wife.

372
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,661
Pretty amazing. Better
than burning to death.

373
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,906
I can't imagine.

374
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,548
I can imagine throwing
my wife out a window.

375
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,967
Ex-wife.

376
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:02,436
Everyone keeps saying
that things will get easier,

377
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:05,940
and I'm sure everyone can't
be wrong, but, man, I am...

378
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,392
I'm really ready
for the easier part.

379
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,861
I think Derek and I may
have hit the easier part.

380
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,996
Yeah. You mentioned.

381
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,510
I don't know. We keep
calling these time-outs,

382
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,610
you know? CALLIE: Mmm-hmm.

383
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,212
And then we're
so busy time-outing

384
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,048
that we forget we're even mad.
- Hmm.

385
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,850
I don't know. He seems
better, at home, at least.

386
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,442
I keep waiting for the other shoe to
drop, but maybe there is no other shoe.

387
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,311
There's a shoe.

388
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,114
You know what
your time-outs are?

389
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,749
Band-Aids.

390
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,529
They cover the mess, they
stop the bleeding for a little while,

391
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,433
but you're just ignoring
the damage, and then...

392
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,171
Good times.

393
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,360
Trust me. There's
gonna be another shoe.

394
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,394
Awfully quiet over there.

395
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,263
Just focused, Dr. Bailey.

396
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,015
Do you think you should be
updating me on your progress?

397
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,700
Yeah.

398
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,208
I, uh, just finished
the medial dissection

399
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,607
and identified the triangle of doom,
then lateral dissection, triangle of pain.

400
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,103
All that's left is the mesh.

401
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,056
Sounds like you have
everything under control.

402
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,974
Totally. Totally under control.

403
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,426
And you didn't
barf in your mask.

404
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,615
Bravo.

405
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,564
Okay, you have to
resect really carefully,

406
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,888
especially this premature.

407
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,667
Oh, no. There's another bleeder.

408
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,769
You're gonna have to
devascularize this whole thing.

409
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,409
Yep, yep. I got it.

410
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,678
This is nice. It's
like old times.

411
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,381
You haven't let me get
used to the new times.

412
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,233
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Maddox
has asked for you in OR 6.

413
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,952
Ugh. Graham. It's
a simple C-section.

414
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,318
I can take this if you got to go.
- He says it's urgent.

415
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,535
Put the blood

416
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,636
- in a rapid infuser!
- Graham?

417
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,110
The placenta was adhered,

418
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,406
and as I started to pull,
everything started bleeding!

419
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,707
How many units has
she gone through?

420
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,792
Uh, I don't know. - Graham!

421
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,456
Two, three! Eight.

422
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,213
I did what I was supposed
to! I pulled at the placenta!

423
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,437
Gown and glove me right
now! Damn it, Graham.

424
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,890
It looks like placenta percreta.

425
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,854
It's probably invading
deeper structures.

426
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,912
Can't you see that? Ugh!
Why didn't anybody stop him?

427
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,902
All right, listen, call Hunt or
any trauma surgeon that's on call.

428
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,815
- On it.
- Graham, move.

429
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,938
Move!

430
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,890
Your mother had
a spinal-fluid leak.

431
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,265
I was able to stop it
without opening up her skull.

432
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,300
She's still in surgery,

433
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,836
and we hope to repair the
damage to her right lung.

434
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,056
Your father has
some internal bleeding.

435
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,158
We'll know more soon.

436
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,444
Thank you both so much.

437
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,979
I didn't want to do that to her.

438
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,715
That other doctor.

439
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,084
I'm in recovery, too.

440
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,987
I broke an oath.

441
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,973
I wanted... I want to
be supportive, but...

442
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,276
But it's my mother.

443
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,714
We'll let you know when
we know more, okay?

444
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:47,801
Derek, what am
I looking at here?

445
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,348
What are you talking about? Amy?

446
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,949
What that lady said,
how much of it is true?

447
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:52,701
Is it all true? She's
a drug addict?

448
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,542
She killed her boyfriend?
She's my sister.

449
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,597
I'm asking because I need to know if
we want her out front as neuro chief.

450
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,466
I'm asking you if you think

451
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,803
she's the best person to
be heading the department.

452
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,177
Okay.

453
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,679
I get it. She's your sister.

454
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,147
Say no more.

455
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,866
Thanks.

456
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,799
Shh.

457
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,692
I'm here! Placenta percreta
invading the bowel and bladder, right?

458
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:34,716
I paged Hunt.

459
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:35,961
Where's Hunt? APRIL: He's busy.

460
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,295
Well, I didn't want
you to see this.

461
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,497
Oh, please. Where
do you need me?

462
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,715
Get in here and start clamping.

463
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,349
The ultrasound
didn't detect this?

464
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,517
No, even Herman didn't see it.

465
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,119
And pregnant women
have a higher blood volume,

466
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,403
distended vessels,
they bleed out faster...

467
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,205
Oh, can it, Graham.

468
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh, no. No, no, no.

469
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,497
What is it?

470
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,609
It extended to her kidney.

471
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,599
And the ureter... Lap pad!

472
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,596
Keep that blood coming! She's
losing a liter every two minutes!

473
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,398
Good lord. How do any
of us even have babies?

474
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,062
See, that's why I
didn't want you in here.

475
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,387
I see no other injuries.
The bowel is intact.

476
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,212
I think we can close.

477
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,325
How much longer do you guys have?
- What's up?

478
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,694
I've called for an
emergency board meeting.

479
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,935
Is this about Amelia? - It is.

480
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,287
Didn't Derek talk to you?

481
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,572
He did.

482
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,429
Owen. Owen!

483
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,663
Callie. Other shoe.

484
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:25,031
- We got this. Go.
- Close for me.

485
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,939
Shh.

486
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,873
Did Owen talk to you?

487
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,562
I didn't tell him anything.
I don't have any...

488
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,946
Did he talk to you
about your job?

489
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,439
He's saying he's
gonna take my job?

490
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,185
You'll talk to him,
right? I did. I did already.

491
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,649
I think I might have
given him the idea.

492
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,308
Oh, no. Derek,
no. I didn't mean to.

493
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:58,676
I'm sorry. I will fix it.

494
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,928
He wants to give you my
job, and you're gonna let him.

495
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,284
No, I'm not.

496
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,270
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!

497
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,255
Don't. You kept me here!

498
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,835
Don't. Amy, don't.
You asked me to come.

499
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,376
You asked me to stay,
when I was building a life...

500
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:13,030
A new life, a second
chance that I had given myself

501
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,859
just so that you could
feel better about leaving.

502
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,695
I was trying to help you, and
I was trying to help myself.

503
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,996
I was just try... And
you gave me this job,

504
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,981
and you have abused me
since the second I took it.

505
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,439
But that is not enough. You
need to destroy my entire...

506
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,486
How can you do
this to me? I will...

507
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,821
To me? I will fix it!

508
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,889
How can you do
this? I will talk to them!

509
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,681
I will talk to all of
them, and I will fix it.

510
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,399
You're my brother.

511
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,343
I'm looking for Derek
Shepherd. Have you seen him?

512
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,367
Uh, mmm-mmm.

513
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,568
Oh, there you are.

514
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,247
What is going on? What
is this meeting about?

515
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,882
There's not gonna be a
meeting. I'm gonna talk to Hunt.

516
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,317
He said he already
talked to you.

517
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,473
He did.

518
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,662
Well, did you set him
straight about Amelia?

519
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:00,794
I didn't.

520
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:02,562
What? Not right now, Mer.

521
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,966
I can't talk to you
about this. Not right now.

522
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:08,102
Derek, what did you say?

523
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,353
What did you do?

524
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,323
I just finished my first
solo TAPP surgery.

525
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,070
All right. Did you
throw up in your mask?

526
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,238
No. Why does everyone
keep asking me that? I nailed it.

527
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,407
Medial, lateral,
pain, mesh... Boom!

528
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,342
What about the triangle
of doom, the iliac vein?

529
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,244
What about it?
Well, you skipped it.

530
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,735
No, I didn't.

531
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,786
Jo, you didn't say it.

532
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:29,223
But I did it.

533
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,026
In there. I didn't skip
it in there. In there, I...

534
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,612
I did it, right?

535
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,921
Are you asking me?

536
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,062
Medium clip. - Got it.

537
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,464
3-0 silk. Hang another unit.

538
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,483
She's gone through 100
units of blood products.

539
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,585
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Karev
is asking to see you.

540
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:47,874
Oh, her baby.

541
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,655
Did he say what's wrong?
Just that he needed you.

542
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,028
Damn. Go.

543
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,808
No, I can't leave
this woman. I got her.

544
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,058
Make sure her baby's okay.

545
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,378
Oh! Sorry!

546
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,559
What happened?
Where's Dr. Karev?

547
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:10,108
What is it? What happened?

548
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:11,660
Oh, I finished. It went well.

549
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,944
You were all in a
twist about this kid,

550
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,879
so I thought you'd want
to update the dad with me.

551
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,370
Oh, God. Alex,
no, his wife is...

552
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,505
Is the baby okay?

553
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:21,842
Yes. Uh, the surgery went
well. Her vitals are good.

554
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,411
She'll likely need to stay
in the NICU for a while,

555
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,546
but she's looking good.

556
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:26,897
Has Emily seen her?

557
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,799
She's still in surgery.

558
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,395
Um, there were some
complications during her C-section.

559
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:31,930
Wait, she's still in surgery?

560
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:34,755
We're doing everything that
we can. I have to go back.

561
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,540
Everything you can?

562
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,848
How serious is this?

563
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:39,877
She lost a lot of blood.

564
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,712
Where's Dr. Herman?
Dr. Herman had a plan.

565
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,494
Now you've got my baby in critical
care, and my wife is bleeding to death!

566
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,162
I don't even know who you are.

567
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,285
I have to go back.

568
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,770
Where the hell is our doctor?

569
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,203
It was just a
misunderstanding with Owen.

570
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,945
He'll take care of
it. He said he would.

571
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:35,365
He did this, Meredith.
Why should I believe that?

572
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,466
Why do you believe it?

573
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,084
Because he's your brother.

574
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,120
That's why he can do it.

575
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:43,590
It's why he could steal my toys
and pull my hair and call me names.

576
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,993
It's because I'm family.

577
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:49,329
It's why he thinks he
can get away with this.

578
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,783
You don't get it.

579
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,368
No. I don't.

580
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,614
I was raised as an only child.

581
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,573
And I'm historically
lousy at being a sister.

582
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,910
You're here right now.

583
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,347
That's good enough.

584
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,501
You don't remember?

585
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,637
No, I... Of course I remember.

586
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,873
I just wanted to double-check
with you, to be safe.

587
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,843
My lateral dissection,
it looked good, right?

588
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,623
I don't think I went
anywhere near the iliac vein.

589
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,130
You don't think...

590
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,710
Wilson, either you hit the
woman's iliac vein or you didn't.

591
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:26,974
Which one is it?

592
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,054
I don't...

593
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,555
So, what do we do now?

594
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,641
We run a CT... No.

595
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,910
I run a CT. You?

596
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,623
You just stand here and pray

597
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:42,327
that your patient isn't
bleeding to death right now.

598
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:47,199
So Robbins is tied
up. Should we wait?

599
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:48,700
No, yeah, we should get started.

600
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:50,140
No, no, no.

601
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,569
Well, Derek, we just
need to figure out...

602
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,887
I know you're trying to
figure out what's going on.

603
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:57,914
I know you've heard
some stories about Amelia.

604
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,517
I let you believe something.
I let you believe that...

605
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:04,454
Shepherd, you were pretty
clear when we spoke, so...

606
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,790
She's in recovery.

607
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,258
She works really hard at it.

608
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,044
She's been successful
in recovery, and...

609
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,888
This hospital should
have protected her.

610
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:23,923
This woman should
have protected her. And...

611
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:35,034
More importantly, I
should have protected her.

612
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,459
I didn't.

613
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,284
And I didn't because
I wanted her job.

614
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:54,621
I wanted my old job back.

615
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,863
So now we're here.

616
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,089
My fault.

617
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,014
Derek, why did you even...

618
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,923
She should stay
where she is, Owen.

619
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:32,276
She can do the job.

620
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,144
She is doing the job.

621
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,349
I couldn't do it any better.

622
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,506
How's his baby? Is
there any change?

623
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,603
No. She's good. She's
stable. Let me do it.

624
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,855
No, I have to tell him.

625
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:54,881
How? How, Alex? How do I
tell him that his wife is dead?

626
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,661
Where the hell is Herman?
She should have been here.

627
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,296
That's not helping! I was here.

628
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,165
Emily was my
responsibility, and I lost her.

629
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:01,788
So let me do it.

630
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:12,149
Placenta percreta is
very difficult to diagnose,

631
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:15,418
and in cases as severe
as Emily's, it's usually

632
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,921
insurmountable.

633
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,642
If your baby had come to term,
it's likely Emily would have died.

634
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:23,994
No.

635
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,863
Corey, this is what
you have to understand.

636
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,634
If I'd done the surgery we'd
planned, it's likely that, down the line,

637
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,853
we would have lost
Emily and your daughter.

638
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:37,690
Dr. Robbins did everything
within her power for your wife.

639
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,655
But she saved your baby's life.

640
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,113
Your baby is alive
because of her.

641
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,454
I'm not sure what that was about,
but it doesn't change anything.

642
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,655
Okay? I can't
do it. I won't do it.

643
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,935
You abandoned me.

644
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,026
You left me no choice
but to take that baby.

645
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,015
You made me...

646
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,944
Are...

647
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,644
Go ahead. Finish your thing.

648
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,215
Well, I, um...

649
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,801
Oh, no, no. Go on. Get it out.

650
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:25,212
Thank you.

651
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,176
What?

652
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:32,779
What's happening?

653
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,925
Yesterday, my doctors decided

654
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:40,453
I need some aggressive
radiation therapy immediately,

655
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,562
so that's where I
was today. It just

656
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,793
hit me a little harder
than I expected.

657
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:51,464
Everything I said
to that man was true.

658
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,668
You saved a baby
that we would have lost.

659
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:55,780
I watched you.

660
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:57,582
I logged in to the
hospital interface.

661
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,323
I monitored your
progress all day.

662
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,328
You made the right call.
You made all the right calls.

663
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,913
That's not... If
you had been here,

664
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,115
you would've... Mmm-mmm.

665
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:13,336
No. The only thing I could've done
is perform an intrauterine transfusion,

666
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,491
try to keep the baby in a little
longer, get her closer to term.

667
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,830
And maybe we could have
detected the percreta earlier,

668
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:27,951
but it doesn't mean we could've
done anything for her that you didn't do.

669
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,521
I want to know how to do it,
the intrauterine transfusion.

670
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,902
'Cause if there's a chance
that I could've saved that mom,

671
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,992
then I need to know how.

672
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,061
For the next time.

673
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,447
I can show you tomorrow.

674
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,801
Unless you're planning to have
a conversation with Chief Hunt.

675
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,046
Okay.

676
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,381
I'll see you tomorrow.

677
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,682
Go home.

678
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,042
It's gonna be fine.

679
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,245
Hey, I'm gonna be
here with you, okay?

680
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,566
Edwards, out. Yes, ma'am.

681
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:22,189
How was the CT?

682
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:23,756
She never made it to CT.

683
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,294
Wait... This was
your surgery, Wilson.

684
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,480
I'm gonna need you
to talk to the family.

685
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,898
Oh, my God.

686
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,300
She's dead?

687
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,064
She's dead? Oh, my
God. I never said that.

688
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,866
I remember doing
everything correctly. Wilson.

689
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,130
I even...

690
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,540
She's fine!

691
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:42,092
What?

692
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,829
I didn't say she was dead. I
said she never made it to CT.

693
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,298
You're... You're
screwing with me.

694
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,834
I didn't take her to CT

695
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,905
because I saw you do
it in the OR, Dr. Badass.

696
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,673
Oh, my God.

697
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,593
Oh, my God! You have a problem!

698
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:03,647
No, you do. You
second-guess yourself.

699
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,249
This was the first in a
career full of surgeries

700
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,917
you will be doing alone.

701
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,821
Before too long, there won't be
anyone to catch you when you fall.

702
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,990
Your patients need to trust

703
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:17,727
that when you take them into
surgery, you know what you're doing.

704
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,629
Now, how can you
expect them to do that

705
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,098
if you don't even
trust yourself?

706
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,466
You are so mean.

707
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,002
I am, indeed.

708
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,821
Tell all your
little bitty friends.

709
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,429
Hey.

710
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:38,498
I heard about your
patient. You okay?

711
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,102
There was so much
blood, Jackson.

712
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,304
I mean, I know we
see it all the time, but...

713
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,718
Yeah. I just...

714
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,458
I didn't think it
was gonna stop.

715
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,027
And I know it can be scary.

716
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:54,931
But you and our
baby are just fine.

717
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,134
So do not worry, okay?

718
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,755
I'm not worried.

719
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,424
Are you worried?

720
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:06,793
All the time.

721
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,663
How can you not be?

722
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:14,967
You know how.

723
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:17,570
Right.

724
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,606
It's all in God's hands.

725
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:22,509
Yeah.

726
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:26,112
God, I don't know
how you can do that,

727
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,382
just write off all the
unanswered questions.

728
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:32,218
We don't get to
know the answers.

729
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,886
That's your answer.

730
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,623
I don't know why that
woman had to die tonight.

731
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:39,926
She exsanguinated. That's why.

732
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,228
Yeah, okay. But why?

733
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:45,799
Because all of it just...

734
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,335
All of it just happens.

735
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,206
You're really comfortable
with that answer?

736
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,508
Hmm?

737
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:56,676
Yeah.

738
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,048
See, I don't know
how you do that.

739
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:16,045
Is that you?

740
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,713
How's Hattie?

741
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,968
Thoracotomy. I had to resect
her entire right lower lobe.

742
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:25,038
Or she's gonna
need rib stabilization.

743
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:28,191
Norris, too. Ex-lap,
avulsed spleen.

744
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,961
Torres did a fasciotomy on his right
leg. I think it's gonna be okay, though.

745
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,764
We'll see if her lungs
don't shut down overnight.

746
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,399
We gave them the
best chance we could.

747
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,067
Yeah. We'll see.

748
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,871
We'll see.

749
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,406
Again, about last night...

750
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,155
Would you let it
go? I'm not mad.

751
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
Well, you sound like
someone who's mad.

752
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,829
Of course I'm mad.

753
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,193
You invited me to dinner, and
then you didn't come to the dinner,

754
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,000
at your own house!

755
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,109
I know. I told Derek it was a bad
idea. You didn't want to talk to Richard.

756
00:35:57,171 --> 00:36:00,940
I wanted to have dinner,
with people and conversation.

757
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,809
I don't know anyone here.

758
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:04,561
I have no friends.

759
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,196
I do nothing at night.

760
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,165
I go to the grocery store,

761
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,833
and I buy sad
single-serving packets of food

762
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,102
for sad people who eat alone.

763
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,372
I was really
excited for pot roast.

764
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,269
And people!

765
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,860
I changed my outfit four times.

766
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,496
And, no, I didn't want
to talk to Webber,

767
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:25,877
but that wasn't gonna
stop me from coming,

768
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:28,467
because I'm really sick
of talking back to my TV,

769
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:30,380
and I'm scared
I'm gonna get a cat.

770
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,190
And I was really excited

771
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,438
that someone had
invited me to dinner.

772
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,196
So, yeah, I'm pretty mad.

773
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,348
Hattie's awake.

774
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,938
What?

775
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,973
What happened?

776
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,443
Mom, there was a
fire in your apartment.

777
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,313
You've had surgery,
but you're doing well.

778
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,232
Your husband saved your life.

779
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,580
He picked you up and
jumped out a window with you.

780
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,354
Well, that was stupid.

781
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:13,329
Oh, Norris, you saved my life.

782
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,165
I nearly killed you.

783
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,936
But that doctor, she promised.

784
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:23,740
Where is she, that woman doctor?

785
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,442
Oh, Dr. Shepherd.

786
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:31,314
She promised they'd save
you, and she was right.

787
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,614
Are you busy tonight?

788
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,416
Oh, well, I was going to
catch up on some reading,

789
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,702
some medical journals, but...

790
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,773
Oh, actually, no.

791
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,676
No, I am, um, not busy. Why?

792
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,634
This was Ellis' house.

793
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,138
This is where you grew up.

794
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,567
It was nicer before
Alex trashed it.

795
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:17,209
Oh, shut up. It
smelled like books.

796
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,856
Well, it smelled a lot
better when I lived here.

797
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,325
Now it just smells like Karev.

798
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:22,393
Wait. You lived here, too?

799
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,450
Everybody lived here.

800
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,614
I practically lived here
with George, right?

801
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,558
George was my ex-husband.
He was in their resident class.

802
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:30,823
O'Malley.

803
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,158
O'Malley.

804
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,571
I'm sorry. Your husband?

805
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:36,012
Yeah, she does dudes, too.

806
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,542
True. I did him once.

807
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,315
True.

808
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:40,733
She did.

809
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:42,034
I didn't do him.

810
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,749
I did do George, though, once.

811
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,184
Yeah, yeah. Oh, God.

812
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:49,008
Yeah, yeah. We're
all related through sex.

813
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,694
We all have sexual
relations. That is horribly weird.

814
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:07,810
Hi.

815
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,195
<i>It's hard to give
second chances.</i>

816
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:14,446
I probably should've
called first, but...

817
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,686
Someone told me to go home,

818
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,515
and I wasn't really
sure where I should go.

819
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,859
See? Everyone lives here.

820
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,494
Beer's in the fridge.
Hard stuff's on the counter.

821
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,296
Thank you.

822
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,485
<i>It's even harder
to ask for them.</i>

823
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,757
<i>A chance to do it again,
knowing what you know now,</i>

824
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:42,529
<i>what you've learned,</i>

825
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:48,368
<i>a chance to do it
completely differently.</i>

826
00:39:58,697 --> 00:39:59,963
You okay?

827
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:03,801
I was at a meeting.

828
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,871
I'm moving out.

829
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,006
Tomorrow.

830
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,114
I'm sorry.

831
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,575
I'm just so sorry.

832
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,077
Don't, Derek. Don't even bother.

833
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,614
I didn't mean to hurt you.

834
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,182
I'm sure you didn't.

835
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,035
I'm sure you didn't
even think about me.

836
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,120
You saw an opening,
and you took it.

837
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:30,660
I have always wanted to
protect you ever since Dad died.

838
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,807
I didn't want to. I'm sure
you didn't want me to.

839
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,348
But I promised.

840
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,998
Shh.

841
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:49,222
Then you came up
here, and I realized

842
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,842
I didn't have to worry anymore.

843
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,586
You were okay. You were fine.
You were more than fine. You could

844
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:56,668
take care of yourself now,

845
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,497
and I didn't need to anymore.

846
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,894
I needed you today.

847
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:09,915
<i>A chance to right our wrongs,</i>

848
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,518
<i>to try and correct
our mistakes...</i>

849
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,969
I don't know who I am anymore.

850
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,175
Not anybody I ever thought

851
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,678
I'd be.

852
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:27,216
I try and make the right
choices for Meredith,

853
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,535
the kids, you.

854
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:31,720
And, um...

855
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,975
I'm angry all the time.

856
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:40,079
I'm miserable, and I don't
know what to do with it.

857
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:42,115
All I do is hurt people.

858
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:47,805
The last people I
want to hurt, and I just...

859
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,226
I just can't get control of it.

860
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,636
I don't know what to do anymore.

861
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,656
I know how you feel.

862
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,109
We call it rock bottom.

863
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,336
<i>A chance to try and start over</i>

864
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,771
<i>from scratch.</i>
