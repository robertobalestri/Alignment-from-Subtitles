1
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,203
<i>They found this guy in Maine</i>

2
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,727
<i>who had been living completely
alone in the woods for 30 years.</i>

3
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,165
<i>They called him
the last true hermit.</i>

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,074
<i>Thirty years without the
warmth of human touch,</i>

5
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,709
<i>without conversation.</i>

6
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,728
<i>The hermit felt more lonely
when he was out in the world...</i>

7
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:09,918
Alex! Alex!

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,420
<i>Than he ever felt in
the woods by himself.</i>

9
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:22,063
<i>Surrounded by people
but drowning in solitude.</i>

10
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,467
<i>That kind of loneliness</i>

11
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,460
<i>can swallow you whole.</i>

12
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,251
Hi. I texted you.

13
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,219
Yeah, I saw that. I was busy.

14
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,333
Well, Cristina would've
responded. That's not how it works.

15
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:47,868
Not if she was doing
what I was doing.

16
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,652
You pause. That's the rule.

17
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,354
What? If the text is urgent,

18
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,089
Cristina would say
to Owen, "Pause,"

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,391
and I would say
to Derek, "Pause,"

20
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:55,625
then we'd text each other back.

21
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,149
In the middle of sex?
If the text is urgent.

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,629
The fact you are
checking your text

23
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,063
while you're doing
it is already sad.

24
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,667
We have a special ringtone.
Hey, you want a special ringtone?

25
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,725
No. Wait, this pause thing...

26
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,172
Like, your legs are in the air
and you're screaming and...

27
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,464
Pause. No, I don't
pause. Jo doesn't pause.

28
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,700
She fast-forwards, she rewinds,

29
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,679
but she doesn't pause.
Okay, that's gross.

30
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,949
Do you wanna scrub
in on my IVC sarcoma?

31
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,383
Is it a kid? No.

32
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,407
Then no. Why?

33
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,291
Because I want some company.

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Get a resident.

35
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,406
I have a resident.
I want a grownup.

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,763
Bye.

37
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,242
Cristina would've scrubbed
in. You're no good at this...

38
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,482
Bailey!

39
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,645
You wanna scrub in
on my IVC sarcoma?

40
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,965
Well, you don't need me for
that. Don't you have a resident?

41
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,016
Residents are boring.
All they wanna do is learn.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,384
Come on. It's gonna be good.

43
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,003
It's all over the
liver, hepatic vein.

44
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,155
It's gonna be bloody and gross.

45
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,912
Does look like fun.

46
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,698
Page me when you're
ready. See you in the OR.

47
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,080
Adrian Nelson, 51.
Presents with abdominal pain.

48
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:54,005
Scans show a leiomyosarcoma
behind the liver, including the IVC.

49
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,591
What's the surgical plan?

50
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,742
Laparotomy to
isolate the vessel,

51
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,423
resect the tumor, and
then replace with a graft.

52
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,392
It's a pretty straightforward
procedure, Adrian.

53
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,010
I don't foresee any problems.

54
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,600
Could I ask you to...

55
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,936
It's silly. Never mind.

56
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,337
What is it?

57
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,174
She wants you to
swear on the book.

58
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,427
The <i>Odyssey.</i>

59
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,039
It's the first book I
ever sold to Adrian.

60
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,496
The day we met.

61
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,565
Michael's a rare book vendor.

62
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,412
Our hands touched
when I was ringing her up,

63
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,403
and it was such a high.

64
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,288
It was electric.

65
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,134
We were both too
shy to ask for a date.

66
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,952
So I wrote my
number on a bookmark.

67
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,910
I saw it as soon as I got
home, and then I called.

68
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,139
We've been together ever since.

69
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,868
This book, it's
our wedding ring.

70
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:43,137
Could you swear on the book,
Dr. Grey, that you'll do your best?

71
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,323
It would mean so much.

72
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,659
Dr. Wilson, too.

73
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,528
Sure. I swear.

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,680
So Dr. Wilson will prep
you, and I'll see you up there.

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,287
They're adorable.

76
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,406
They're weirdos.

77
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,369
Okay, you're gonna
feel a little bit of pressure.

78
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,326
And this will tell
us conclusively

79
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,124
if the osteogenesis
imperfecta is type II or III?

80
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,010
Yes. It's probably
type III though, right?

81
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:12,729
I mean, so far there's been
no indication of fetal distress.

82
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,919
We'll know soon enough.

83
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,001
It'll be okay. OI type
III, it's hard, sure.

84
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,471
I mean, there's surgeries and
challenges, but we're surgeons.

85
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,095
We can handle challenges, right?

86
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,642
Mmm-hmm. I mean, we'll...

87
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,401
We'll still be able to give our
baby a wonderful life. Right?

88
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,671
Many type III babies
live very, very happy lives.

89
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,806
Shouldn't Dr. Herman
be doing this?

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,530
It's a very routine procedure.

91
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,965
Dr. Herman is the big gun.

92
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,401
We only fire the big gun
when we need the big gun.

93
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,637
I'm the little gun. So
let the little gun work.

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,234
Thank you so much. I know
that took up a lot of your time.

95
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,114
I just wanna get
all of the views

96
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,171
with the thinnest
cross sections I can get.

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,341
And I find that adorable.

98
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,821
You really think you can
pull off your plan, huh?

99
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,178
I've got all your
past medical records.

100
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,714
Once I get a firm grasp

101
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,416
on the roads your other
surgeons took to get to "no,"

102
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,518
I can cut away a
clear path to "yes."

103
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,898
By the time I'm done with your
tumor, I'm gonna be able to tell you

104
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,506
what street this
bastard grew up on

105
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,674
and where it lost its virginity.

106
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,287
Hmm! Well, you
certainly are confident.

107
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,044
Thank you. Or delusional.

108
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,414
One of the two.

109
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,683
It's hard to tell.
They look so similar.

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,524
So I think we need to
talk about what we'll decide

111
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,971
if it turns out the
baby's type II.

112
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,861
I already told you, he won't be.

113
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,208
Yeah, I know that's what
you believe. So do I, obviously.

114
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:52,400
But if he is type II,
then it's so terrible...

115
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,903
I know. And fatal usually.

116
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,515
All right? And before
that, it's even worse.

117
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,507
I know all of this. I just... I
don't wanna talk about it.

118
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,520
But we should talk about
it. We need to talk about it.

119
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,729
Why? Why can't we
just wait until tomorrow?

120
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,743
Because we should have
a plan. What do you mean?

121
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,900
Okay, what do you wanna do?

122
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,469
That's what I'm saying.
I think we should decide.

123
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,088
No, no. I'm asking
what you want.

124
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,257
I want for us to figure
this out together.

125
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:17,758
I don't think that's true.

126
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,806
I think that you already know
what you would wanna do.

127
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,007
So... What?

128
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,464
Just... Yeah, just
say it out loud.

129
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,978
Don't... Right now.
What do you wanna do?

130
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,593
If our baby is type II, I...

131
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,497
I think we should terminate.

132
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,281
And I don't care whether
our baby is type II or type III.

133
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,417
Either way, I wanna keep him.

134
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,540
April!

135
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,968
I told you I didn't
wanna talk about this.

136
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,277
Look at all these adhesions.

137
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,245
Yeah, there's no way
to see 'em coming.

138
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,703
Sneaky little bastards
won't show up on the scan.

139
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:04,005
And there's more of
them posteriorly, too.

140
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,439
I need some more exposure.

141
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,070
You're thinking of
extending the incision?

142
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,327
I have to. I can't see
what's up in there.

143
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,781
This tumor just keeps coming.
And all the landmarks are obscured.

144
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,083
I'm lost in here. It's
like going in blind.

145
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,251
Hey! Would you bring
those scans closer, please?

146
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,653
Yes, Doctor.

147
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,907
See, the tumor should be
in the suprahepatic IVC only.

148
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,037
That can't be right.

149
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,838
It doesn't show any
further local invasion.

150
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,295
Show me the coronal view?

151
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,476
What's the tumor doing
all the way over there?

152
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,350
That's what I want to know.

153
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,380
- How old are these scans?
- They're only two weeks old.

154
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,915
And they're completely outdated.

155
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,939
I mean, this thing
is growing too fast.

156
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,451
Nothing is where
it's supposed to be.

157
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,893
Tumor has extended
to the IVC tributaries.

158
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,172
Yeah, these scans are useless.

159
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,124
I can't see what I'm doing.

160
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,393
Oh, God. It's also spreading
through the diaphragm. Suction.

161
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,894
I can't even see where...

162
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:50,184
Neither can I.

163
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,587
Don't touch that. It's tearing.

164
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,917
The tumor's extended all
the way up between the lungs.

165
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,487
Someone page cardio! It's all
the way up into the pericardium.

166
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,689
Get the suction out. Don't
touch it. Don't do anything.

167
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,040
Okay, page cardio, 911!

168
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,565
We gotta get out.
Everybody out. Hands off.

169
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,430
What are we doing?
What's going on?

170
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,580
Can someone say
something? What are we doing?

171
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,827
It's spread from her major
blood vessels to her liver,

172
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,180
diaphragm, pericardium,
and maybe even her heart.

173
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,420
How can one tumor
grow this big this fast?

174
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,387
It is everywhere.
It's a monster.

175
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,774
So what do we do?

176
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:34,562
I have no idea.

177
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,331
Michael, I'm afraid Adrian's
tumor has grown considerably

178
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,378
and it's now reaching
around her heart.

179
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,101
So Dr. Pierce is here.

180
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,919
Her heart?

181
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,267
It's entangled through
the vein that stretches up

182
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,923
from her liver to her heart.

183
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,510
And it's growing more
rapidly than anticipated.

184
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,740
So we need to take
her for more MRIs

185
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:11,416
so we can see how
extensive the tumor's growth is.

186
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,768
Now there's all of you.

187
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,954
Three doctors.

188
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,789
Three is a lot.

189
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:25,146
Look, Odysseus didn't
return to Ithaca all by himself.

190
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,383
He needed a lot of help,
right, from the Phaeacians?

191
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,385
Well, we're the Phaeacians.

192
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,221
You want all the
Phaeacians you can get.

193
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,623
We are going to
figure this tumor out.

194
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,511
Oh!

195
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,609
Mmm! So light. And
it's last year's model.

196
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,261
We're weeks away
from unveiling one

197
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,651
that will weigh 30% less.

198
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,619
Wow. Very impressive.

199
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,521
Your project is impressive.

200
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,636
Robotic limbs for
injured vets? Sexy as hell.

201
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,662
And we at CyberSystems are
dying to climb into bed with you.

202
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,447
Well, that's very flattering.

203
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,449
Good. I want it to be.

204
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,697
I'll leave you this folder so
you can go over the materials.

205
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,532
I'll be in Seattle another day,

206
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:09,790
so, please, call me
if you need anything.

207
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,460
Thank you. Thank
you for coming in.

208
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,047
So what do you think?

209
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,976
I think you should
definitely go for it. Really?

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,979
'Cause I was not that
impressed with these transducers.

211
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,320
What? No. No,
those things are crap.

212
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,971
I'm talking about her.

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,007
Her vibes? You
didn't feel her vibes?

214
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,394
Major vibage for Major Hunt.

215
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,939
You read that totally wrong.

216
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,363
Oh, please.

217
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,465
"Your project's sexy as hell.

218
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,668
"Ooh! Ooh, let's
climb into bed."

219
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,913
I was actually uncomfortable.

220
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,537
Stop it!

221
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,719
There you are.
Where have you been?

222
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,676
I was performing a
CVS on April Kepner.

223
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,789
We're just waiting for the
results. God, I hate waiting.

224
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,179
In peds, it's so much easier.

225
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,814
You know, the
parents are right there.

226
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,161
And you talk to them, and
then their kid is right there,

227
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,452
so they can hold them
close and hope for the best.

228
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,637
The cat's on the roof.

229
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,171
With this, there's
no kid to hold.

230
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,607
The problem
feels so theoretical.

231
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,220
You know, there's
no cat, there's no roof.

232
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,122
There's just two scared
parents feeling totally helpless.

233
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,474
And you've had
the results rushed?

234
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,397
Yeah. I should get
them in, like, 24 hours.

235
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,862
Then there's nothing more to
do about it today, which is good.

236
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,453
I have been working miracles.

237
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:16,557
I have found us the
most incredible surgeries,

238
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,891
all for the next few weeks.

239
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,595
Look, a TTTS in a 19-weeker,

240
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:23,681
a 21-week TRAP
sequence that needs an RFA,

241
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,945
a unilateral pulmonary agenesis.

242
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,713
And that is just the beginning.

243
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,103
The beginning of what?

244
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,471
Your crash course.

245
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,474
I have hunted down
the most screwed up,

246
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,993
medically compromised
fetuses that I could find,

247
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,157
and I'm bringing them
all here to this hospital

248
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,525
for you to learn and us to save.

249
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:43,251
And you'll get to
fix them all? We will.

250
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
Start reading.

251
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,263
You can thank me later.

252
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,976
And then, and this sounds
crazy, I know, so don't even...

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,202
I'll build in a distribution of a
radioactive seed during surgery,

254
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,238
keeping Dr. Herman's tumor
bed free of recurring cells.

255
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,751
I thought you were
gonna use a laser.

256
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,137
I am. I already did.
We're way past that.

257
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,961
Try and keep up.

258
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,057
I'm sorry, Shepherd, but
this is a great opportunity

259
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,609
for them to learn.
I know. It's fine.

260
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,311
The laser is for ablating
cells off the optic nerve.

261
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,913
It's a massive butterfly glioma.

262
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,436
Well, it's not just massive.

263
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,973
I mean, it's magnificent.

264
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,726
No, no, no. I mean that
won't a laser take months?

265
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:27,345
Again, before
that, I'll be using

266
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,175
the ultrasonic surgical aspirator
to mush and flush the cells,

267
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,560
then the sexy laser
and the... Yeah.

268
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,751
I'm sorry. I'm just lost.

269
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,064
You were just talking
about laser ablation.

270
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,599
So is that confined
to the optic chiasm

271
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,973
or will that extend...
Guys, step back.

272
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:42,877
Look at the whole big,
beautiful, shapely thing.

273
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:46,798
Every part of this tumor's
body will respond differently.

274
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,967
You will need a
multitude of approaches.

275
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,315
You will have to be gentle with
one part and rough with the other.

276
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,174
That is the only way
she will respond. Get it?

277
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,736
I don't see tumors
the way she does.

278
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,329
Didn't five surgeons say any
one of these approaches would

279
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:02,947
likely kill the patient?

280
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,982
Six.

281
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,113
But none of them tried it all at
the same time. It should work.

282
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,966
Maybe we should start over
again from the beginning.

283
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,924
Okay.

284
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,444
I will begin with a
bifrontal approach.

285
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,913
Is that the right
atrium? I can't tell.

286
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,032
Everything looks like mush.

287
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,779
Look at this angle right here.

288
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,280
Is that invading
the right atrium?

289
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,631
I think that's a
motion artifact.

290
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,483
Crap. MIRANDA:
Adrian's back in her room.

291
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,718
Stable for now.
How we doing here?

292
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,721
Has the Cyclops revealed
himself? The Cyclops?

293
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,490
Well, the patient's a
fan of The <i>Odyssey,</i>

294
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,359
so I'm calling the
tumor the Cyclops

295
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,176
'cause it's a big, ugly monster.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,113
And I feel like I'm working with
one eye because I can see it,

297
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,655
but I can't get a sense
of the whole thing.

298
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,556
Every view is incomplete.

299
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,021
Okay, what if we get a new
set of scans, with contrast,

300
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,890
this time with 3-D
reconstruction?

301
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,558
Well, the woman's
lying open in her bed.

302
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,276
We don't have time
for a lot of trial and error.

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
I just wanna
reach in and grab it.

304
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,838
Well, we could go in with
these, but, yeah, I can't see.

305
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,525
If I could just hold it in my
hand so that I could see it...

306
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,961
Holy crap. What?

307
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,269
She's having an idea.

308
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,447
I already had it last
year, and it's brilliant.

309
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,401
We are going to print
it. The whole tumor.

310
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,615
I tried it with the portal
veins, but it's not working.

311
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,868
But with this, we don't
need it to function.

312
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:22,227
She's got a functioning tumor.
We just need to be able to see it,

313
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,507
- so we know how to kill it.
- Know your enemy.

314
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,842
Is this gonna work? It'll work.

315
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,093
Oh, 2% left to upload.

316
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,983
This is how we beat this thing.

317
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,252
This is how we
get visualization.

318
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:35,189
We are going to have a
tangible, anatomically correct

319
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:39,761
3-D model of this exact tumor, and
correlate to the adjacent organs...

320
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,378
Done! Loaded!

321
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,578
In 10 hours.

322
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,917
The longest documented
surviving type II case that I could find

323
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,568
lived for all of 18 months.

324
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,554
In an ICU his entire life,

325
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,956
hooked up to feeding
tubes and a ventilator.

326
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,441
That's not a life.

327
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,987
That's not a life I
want for my son.

328
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,562
Neither do I. I...

329
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,130
Okay. So then how can you...

330
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,519
Because we don't
know what will happen.

331
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,951
We don't even know if he's
type II. Okay, but what if he is?

332
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,155
Any amount of time
that he survives,

333
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,739
any amount of
time that he lives...

334
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,509
Will be with us,
in our arms. Yes.

335
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,057
Knowing that he's
loved and wanted.

336
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:33,414
Baby, his bones can
break if you touch him.

337
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,516
His bones can break if
we're changing his diaper.

338
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,012
We're doctors. We can handle it.

339
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,731
If anyone can handle it, we can.

340
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,439
I'm not saying we can't handle
it. I'm asking if we should.

341
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,107
Yeah, we're doctors.

342
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,087
Maybe we are better equipped to
make an educated decision here.

343
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,957
And maybe we were
given this baby for a reason.

344
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,080
April.

345
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,232
You called your mom.

346
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,769
Yeah. People need
their mom in a crisis.

347
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,904
No, not everybody does.

348
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,940
I came as soon as I
got your call, sweetie.

349
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,593
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be okay.

350
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,911
I'm here.

351
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,332
Are you working today?

352
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,501
No. Then let's get out of here.

353
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,970
You could use a
change of scenery.

354
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,382
That's actually a
really good idea.

355
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,789
We should take the day,

356
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,157
go somewhere nice,
maybe drive to the ocean.

357
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,676
Let's go to church.

358
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,095
You'll find comfort there.

359
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,848
Yeah, go ahead.

360
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,517
Let's go pray.

361
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,786
She is doing fine.

362
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,498
Those chairs
will kill your back.

363
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,002
You should go home
and get some rest.

364
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,025
I can't.

365
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,461
I can't go home alone
when she's like this.

366
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,809
Thought I'd just stay and read.

367
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,834
Okay. That's fine.

368
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,401
But I can't read either.

369
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,089
Can't concentrate.

370
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,842
It's odd. I've never
had that problem.

371
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:12,813
I think it's because I
don't know where she is.

372
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,584
I always know where she is.

373
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,185
She's right here.

374
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,971
It's just as if she's asleep
in the bed next to you.

375
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,541
Not really.

376
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,927
Because she might not wake up.

377
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,997
I feel like...

378
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,985
Like she's sailed away and I
don't know if she's coming back.

379
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,786
That's the feeling, you know?

380
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,658
Michael, we are working
very hard to solve this.

381
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,259
I know.

382
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,795
I know. I just...

383
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,464
I just want her to come back.

384
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,001
I do, too.

385
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,273
This HLHS case seems impossible.

386
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,585
This mother's pregnant
for the third time,

387
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,025
and each baby was stillborn.

388
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,727
Well, this one will be, too.

389
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,796
22q11 deletion?

390
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:03,130
She should adopt.

391
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,966
Now this one, however...

392
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:10,704
Tracheal balloon occlusion
for CDH? Card that puppy.

393
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,852
How do you do this without... I
mean, these stories are awful.

394
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,559
They're patients, Robbins.

395
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,662
The more you find, the more
you learn, the more we save.

396
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:20,080
It's as simple as that.

397
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,666
Your work is making
these three categories,

398
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,336
possible, impossible, maybe.

399
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,972
Any other approach
is a waste of our time.

400
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,444
Ah!

401
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,848
Oh, wow.

402
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,052
Holy crap. It's fate!

403
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,072
Look! It's your sexy tech
rep! Your sexy tech rep!

404
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,174
She's not my sexy anything.

405
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,004
Not yet, but she could be.

406
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:53,330
I came out tonight with
you to unwind, not to...

407
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,866
And she's a tech rep.
That's a conflict of interest.

408
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,563
Not if we don't buy
her transducers. Mmm.

409
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,153
They're junk, anyway.

410
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,622
Come on! You gotta
get back in the saddle.

411
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,224
And she's got a nice saddle.

412
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:05,693
Oh, yeah.

413
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,361
What? Whoa, what are you doing?

414
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,916
Okay, so listen, I'm not
really great at this kind of thing,

415
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,685
so I'm just gonna blurt it out.

416
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,216
I think that you were interested in
more than just our program today.

417
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,523
Oh, you picked up on that?

418
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,441
I was right!

419
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,343
I knew it! Okay. So
this should be easy.

420
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,647
Owen is a little bit shy,
but he's a great guy.

421
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,200
And the feeling's mutual.

422
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,935
So...

423
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,005
So what do you say?

424
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,419
I would say that there's
something about him

425
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,560
that doesn't quite
feel like he's my type.

426
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,396
What? No! He's...

427
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:45,199
He's very attractive.
He's nice. He's funny.

428
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,545
People like funny, right? I mean,
come on. Give him a chance.

429
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,849
What about him isn't your type?

430
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,028
He has a penis.

431
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,657
Oh!

432
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,959
Oh...

433
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,145
Oh.

434
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,331
Wait. No. You were...

435
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,868
You were flirty. I was.

436
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,903
But not with him.

437
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,308
Oh.

438
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,542
Um...

439
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,777
Wow.

440
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:17,682
I am wildly saddened by my
intense lack of game right now.

441
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,994
I can't believe I
didn't see that coming.

442
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,329
There was a time
when I would've been all,

443
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,463
"That's right. I know it's me."

444
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,954
But right now, I'm just like...

445
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,106
Uh...

446
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,308
'Cause you looking
at me like that...

447
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,288
You are gorgeous, by the way.

448
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,908
Do people just tell you that all the
time? Because you are gorgeous.

449
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,564
No, I'm not.

450
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,667
Am I? No. Am I?

451
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,253
No. Wait. No, no. Wait, wait.

452
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,656
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

453
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,004
Not into women? No,
no, no. I am, totally.

454
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,694
Women. Men. People, really.
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just...

455
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,375
I'm just not really
shopping right now.

456
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,598
I'm divorced.

457
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:56,320
And it was recent
and painful and brutal.

458
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,755
Brutal, actually.

459
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:02,476
Well, if you wanna
forget for just a little while,

460
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:04,512
I fly out tomorrow.

461
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,220
Doesn't have to be
anything more than one night.

462
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,952
I would love...

463
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,866
I would love to love
that. I'm just not ready.

464
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,272
I'm so sorry.

465
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,846
Uh...

466
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,802
Hi, guys. Hi.

467
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,672
You're here late. Well,
we're on a timeline.

468
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:34,158
I was taking a look
at Dr. Wall's notes,

469
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,921
and I found some
contradictory information.

470
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:38,226
He was the second opinion?

471
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,563
Wall is where?

472
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,931
Case Western.

473
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,066
Uh, he was third.
He's radiation.

474
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,575
Right. Just getting
my dates straight.

475
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,555
What are all these?

476
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,306
Cases. Fetuses.

477
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,843
Each card represents a fetus that
I'm gonna teach Robbins how to fix.

478
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,964
That I estimate we can
get to in the time I have.

479
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,132
And those? These?

480
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,452
No. These are the
ones that I could save,

481
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,472
if I had time.

482
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,457
You should just think of
them as babies who will die

483
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,594
if it turns out that you're full of
crap and can't take out my tumor.

484
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,130
Oh.

485
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,916
No pressure. Oh, no. Pressure.

486
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,419
We're on a timeline here, right?

487
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,987
Try being me.

488
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,246
Okay.

489
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,009
<i>Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery.</i>

490
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,300
<i>Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery.</i>

491
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,826
Oh, good! You're home!

492
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,328
Just in time for dinner.

493
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,514
Smells good.

494
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,622
How was church?

495
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,100
The choir was there,

496
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,469
practicing for their
service tomorrow night.

497
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,822
Really beautiful.
We should all go to it.

498
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:59,610
I don't think we'll know what
we'll be up for tomorrow, Karen.

499
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,446
Because of the test results?

500
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,666
April told me about
the test, and I told her

501
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,552
there's really no point in
even getting those results.

502
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,605
Excuse me? God gives
what he wants to give.

503
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:14,308
No test is going to change that.

504
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:17,194
And April's already
so upset, so stressed.

505
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,829
It's not good for the baby.

506
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,433
Just focus on loving
that sweet little baby.

507
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,167
That's all that matters.

508
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,664
No, that's definitely
not all that matters.

509
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:29,522
I know, it's hard to
understand sometimes

510
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,291
how His plan will unfold.

511
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,438
Yeah, but I'm not worried
about His plan, am I?

512
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:34,845
I'm worried about our plan.

513
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,759
He never gives us
more than we can handle.

514
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,149
Getting the results,

515
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,878
being informed about
our baby's condition,

516
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,096
that's how we handle it.

517
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,820
I called our pastor at home.

518
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,089
April spoke to him at
length. He was very helpful.

519
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,556
April.

520
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,776
Me. Let me help you.

521
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,873
Whatever happens, we
will shoulder the burden

522
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,057
when it is placed upon us.

523
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,276
We will. You and I.
We'll shoulder the burden.

524
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,799
She's just trying to help.

525
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,318
Is she, though?
Really? Is she helping?

526
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,420
Don't snap at her.

527
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,916
Don't talk to her in
that tone. What tone?

528
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,669
I'm not talking using a
tone. I'm trying to understand.

529
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,504
You're trying to
talk my little girl

530
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,906
into doing something she
knows in her heart and soul

531
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,170
she does not want to do.

532
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:10,876
I'm not trying to talk
her into anything.

533
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,711
I'm supporting her in trying to
make the best choice possible

534
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:14,301
for our baby, for
her, for our family.

535
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,581
This is between April
and her God. Okay.

536
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:19,139
And if you think
she is going to agree

537
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,108
to abort her child... Our child!

538
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,754
You are... Get that
straight. It's our child.

539
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:25,211
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

540
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,631
None of this is helping!

541
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
You are not helping,
neither of you.

542
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,580
I am standing here,
listening to you tell me

543
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,247
that God only gives
me one choice,

544
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,684
and you telling me that I
should forgo God's choice.

545
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,958
And the truth is, I
don't know anything

546
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:43,380
expect that I am scared
and sad and I'm alone.

547
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,028
You're both just standing there,
yelling at each other and talking at me,

548
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:49,920
but I am alone,
and it is terrifying!

549
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,689
And the louder you get,
the more terrified I become,

550
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,076
so I just need you
both to just shut up!

551
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,830
Can you... Can you do that?

552
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:03,984
Can you please, can you
please both just shut up?

553
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,321
What are you guys
still doing here?

554
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,257
We're solving a
tumor by 3-D printing it.

555
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,658
Yeah.

556
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,238
What are you still doing here?

557
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,129
Also solving a tumor.

558
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,631
Maybe you should
3-D print your tumor.

559
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,616
Visibility is not my problem.

560
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,604
I can see my tumor in
all its problematic glory,

561
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,000
and it's giving me
the middle finger

562
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:44,257
in front of Richard Webber
and a bunch of residents.

563
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:45,959
Where are the kids?

564
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,012
Upstairs.

565
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,325
Daycare. Nightcare.
Whatever care.

566
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,916
It's open 24 hours.

567
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,552
You know that's only for
surgeons on call, right?

568
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,901
Bailey, don't judge
me. Derek lives in DC.

569
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,256
No, I'm saying if they ask you,

570
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,191
make up something
about being on call.

571
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,572
When I had my genome
lab, I was on call twice a week.

572
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,462
You all realize that
printing this thing

573
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,359
is gonna take, like,
five more hours?

574
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,643
Seven-ish. Seven
hours and 20 minutes.

575
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,417
Seven and a half.

576
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,538
I'm just saying you could go
home, sleep, and then come back.

577
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:18,608
Someone has to stay in
case the printer crashes.

578
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,237
Plus, I don't mind. I like the
sound. It's kinda soothing.

579
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,702
It feels weird to sleep alone.

580
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:31,572
I'm not used to it.
I don't know why.

581
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,921
He used to go away all the time,

582
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:36,877
but this time, he's...

583
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:40,013
He's gone, and I know he's gone.

584
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,516
And the bed feels lonely.

585
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,305
It's like I don't know
how to sleep alone.

586
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,607
You don't.

587
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:53,894
I mean, before three months
ago, any time I called your house

588
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,496
or came over or
Skyped or whatever,

589
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,082
Cristina was there.

590
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,928
There's no way you ever slept
alone. I mean, you had Derek.

591
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,496
And if you didn't have
Derek, you had Cristina.

592
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,403
I'm guessing if it
came down to it,

593
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,371
you were, like, the middle spoon

594
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,026
in the middle of a very
weird spooning situation.

595
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,598
I've never met a less alone
person than you used...

596
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,351
Used to be.

597
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,173
I have to learn to sleep alone.

598
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:28,228
Ben snores. And he
sometimes talks in his sleep.

599
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:29,546
And he's hot.

600
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,981
Like a furnace.

601
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,283
Like flames shootin' out of him.

602
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,934
He's lucky I love him.

603
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:38,989
And he's a resident
and hardly home at night.

604
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,340
Or he'd be dead.

605
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,461
I miss sleeping with
a man in my bed.

606
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,358
You know, facing
away from each other,

607
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:50,951
barely touching expect for just
the arm thrown over your waist.

608
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:57,490
When I'd wake up at
night, terrified of me,

609
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,944
I liked knowing he was there

610
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,546
and I wasn't by myself.

611
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:14,207
I cannot sleep with
someone lying next to me.

612
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,542
Literally cannot.

613
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:19,078
My one serious guy, Dean.

614
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,627
Dean just loved to
spoon and snuggle,

615
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,601
and I would just lie there,

616
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:27,337
staring up silently,

617
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,706
counting the seconds
until he would fall asleep

618
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,953
and I could sneak off
to sleep on the sofa.

619
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,238
And then I'd sneak back into bed

620
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:35,390
before he woke
up in the morning.

621
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,126
Yeah, people think that's a
cute story. It's not a cute story.

622
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,470
That sofa was hard as
a rock. I was exhausted.

623
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,948
Dean is a really sweet guy.

624
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,773
He's tall and kind.

625
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,175
Civil rights lawyer.

626
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,677
He's funny.

627
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,897
So when he proposed,

628
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,516
I explained to him
about the sleeping.

629
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,318
I said,

630
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:01,132
"Maybe you could sleep
in a room down the hall."

631
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,973
I wanted to sleep alone.

632
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,310
And what happened?

633
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,591
He is now married to someone
who loves to spoon and snuggle.

634
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,710
And I sleep like a
baby every night.

635
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,542
I might be too
good at being alone.

636
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,584
Maybe I could print a Derek.

637
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,655
Just for sleeping.

638
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,691
Hey, move your butts.

639
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,983
Hello again, Cyclops.

640
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,135
It is crazy cool amazing.

641
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:23,715
It could not be more amazing.

642
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,439
Okay, hit me. What's next?

643
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,940
I think we can
divide the diaphragm

644
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,344
to resect the pericardial
component of the tumor.

645
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,845
But carefully.

646
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,992
We'll need to dissect
two to three centimeters

647
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:38,334
proximal to the IVC
first to control flow.

648
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,869
Yep, and then we can clamp

649
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,317
and create the
veno-venous bypass flap.

650
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,403
You sure you don't
wanna do a sternotomy?

651
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,405
Now you have something to
say? Where were you yesterday?

652
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,407
You should've showed me
this. Karev, what's your point?

653
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,259
Well, I would do
McGinn's technique

654
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,378
to access the chest
with less invasiveness

655
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:56,169
to avoid diaphragmatic
hernia postradiation.

656
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,888
He's got a point.

657
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,206
Back to the beginning.

658
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,691
Okay, so feel this, right here.

659
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,364
Okay, that's what, like five
centimeters superior to the renal vein?

660
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,510
Okay, but stop.

661
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:28,835
Close your eyes
and just feel. Okay.

662
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:32,464
Because all we have to
go on is muscle memory.

663
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,526
It's two fingerbreadths

664
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,011
from the confluence
of the hepatic veins.

665
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:42,299
And then we anastomose
the bifurcated graft.

666
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,617
Bailey?

667
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,719
Write that up.

668
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,530
You're their board bitch.

669
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,311
You're jealous,
aren't you? No. A little.

670
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,335
Wilson! Oh, yeah. On it.

671
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:11,695
Okay, my finger is in
the foramen of Winslow.

672
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,029
Bailey, can you feel me?

673
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,291
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

674
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:17,234
I can feel the edge
of the lesser omentum.

675
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:21,871
I think that gives me enough
space to control the porta hepatis.

676
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,274
Yes. Yes. I can
palpate a good window.

677
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,759
Good. That works.

678
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,946
No. All right, what next?

679
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,232
There is no next. The
wound VAC has frank blood.

680
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,284
She's bleeding. We have
to get her up to the OR.

681
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,698
You need an extra set
of hands? Yes. Wilson's.

682
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,222
Take that white board. Bring it
up where everyone can see it.

683
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,986
We haven't even gotten to the
retroperitoneal dissection yet.

684
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,211
We will when we get up there.
We'll figure it out as we go.

685
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,415
You are coming with me.

686
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,848
I'm into the retrohepatic
area. More suction.

687
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,105
Okay, then you're
on to step two.

688
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,443
Step two, access
the pericardial IVC.

689
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,494
Bailey, a little
more retraction?

690
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,847
Okay, I'm at the pericardium.

691
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,727
It branches two centimeters

692
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,495
in either direction,
so you're close.

693
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,130
Damn it. Adhesions here, too.

694
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,798
There's too much blood. Suction!

695
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,766
I need to do a partial
resection of the liver,

696
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,469
but I just can't see to do it.

697
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,172
Same problem up here. Can I
get some more suction, please?

698
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,862
Should we control
the hepatic veins

699
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,825
and resect part of the liver?
- I'm trying.

700
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,182
I think that's the only way.

701
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,087
But without visibility, I might
hit a major vessel. Pierce?

702
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,573
I can't see the field.

703
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,881
Yeah, I can't see anything.

704
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,995
Crap. They're drowning.

705
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,707
I'm not sure the
model's gonna help them.

706
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,926
It's not telling them any
more than the scans did.

707
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,361
And they still can't
see enough to...

708
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,751
The model is how they'll see

709
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,019
without adhesions
and bleeding in the way.

710
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:46,406
How the pieces
relate to her anatomy.

711
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,940
It's the big picture.

712
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,543
Oh, my God.

713
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,478
I get it.

714
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,066
You're welcome.

715
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:05,959
How's it coming?

716
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,994
You know, by millimeters.

717
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,863
Your notebook-wielding
minions got bored

718
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:12,732
and ditched me
for another tumor.

719
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,601
I thought you might need this.

720
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:19,088
Are you keeping tabs on
me? Is that what's happening?

721
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,224
No. Why would you say that?

722
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,126
Because you might
be worried about me,

723
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,830
and that I have decided I can
do something that cannot be done

724
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,635
just so that I can prove that I am
okay and that I deserve to be here.

725
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,743
That I'm overreaching. Should
I be keeping tabs on you?

726
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,487
I mean, you saw the look on
those residents' faces yesterday.

727
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,444
They think that
I am certifiable.

728
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,779
And why shouldn't they?

729
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,748
Why should I think
that I can do this?

730
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,118
Why shouldn't I think that
I'm gonna kill this woman

731
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,398
and all those little babies with
her? You are not doing that. No.

732
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,857
Nobody thinks that this can
work. No one understands it.

733
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,494
You were talking way
over those residents' heads.

734
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,963
And you think so fast,
it made my eyes spin.

735
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,032
But you have a plan.

736
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,914
And just because you're the
only one that can see the endgame

737
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,621
doesn't mean that you're wrong.

738
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,790
It just means it's lonely.

739
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,760
And scary.

740
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:17,269
You'd be a fool if
you weren't scared.

741
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,420
I'm-a leave you be.

742
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,789
Oh, don't. Then I'll be
alone with this thing.

743
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,872
What you were
talking about yesterday,

744
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,997
the whole big, beautiful body?

745
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,186
I think I get it. I think.

746
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:40,387
So you do the fluoroscein
first. Tell me why.

747
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:42,955
So you can keep an
eye on the pituitary stalk

748
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:44,369
even though you're
nowhere near it.

749
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,225
Because?

750
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:50,847
Because you want to appreciate
the whole thing at once.

751
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,633
Right? Yes.

752
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,635
Thank you.

753
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,403
You can go now.

754
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,487
Oh, there. Got it.

755
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:08,559
Just ligated the hepatic
veins. What's next?

756
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,951
Okay, you just controlled the
lower end of the tumor, so...

757
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:15,071
That's as far as you
got. That's the last step.

758
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,725
Okay, so next we...

759
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:21,706
Dissect around the diaphragm.
Finish my dissection retroperitoneally.

760
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,680
Uh, that's two ways to go.

761
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,284
Her heart can't
handle all the clamping.

762
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,714
Whatever we do,
we have to do it now.

763
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,204
You mean cut blind?

764
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,558
No. Wait. Jo, bring
the Cyclops over here.

765
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,754
On it. MEREDITH:
Bring it over here,

766
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,778
hold it up, turn it slowly.

767
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,849
Okay, so we're gonna anastomose
the graft to the lower end.

768
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,136
And then I'll start from
the upper end, yeah.

769
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,655
Okay. Find me.

770
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,173
I am at the diaphragm.

771
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:53,626
6-Prolene and graft stat.

772
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:56,462
I'm on top of the
right hepatic vein.

773
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,665
This is where
we cut, right here.

774
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,750
That's my finger.

775
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,336
Oh. Okay. No, it's...

776
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:06,856
Got it. Here. It extends 10
centimeters off where the veins meet.

777
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,670
Right? This is it.
This is it, right here.

778
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,774
This is where
we cut, right here.

779
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:13,724
How much do you
trust that thing?

780
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:16,016
I'll let you know
in a second. Metz.

781
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,447
No excess bleeding.

782
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,994
Not any more than before.

783
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,762
Your dissection was flawless.

784
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,798
Then she's comin' out.

785
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:40,356
Okay, Cyclops, show
me that ugly face.

786
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:48,397
Ugh! So gross and
so freaking cool!

787
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,300
Oh! Got some bleeders!

788
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,402
Beautiful bleeders, right
where we can see them.

789
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,056
She was really pretty.

790
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,994
The woman.

791
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,329
At the bar.

792
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,432
With the nice transducers.

793
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,201
I'm not ready.

794
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,735
You gotta start sometime.

795
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,273
Owen, the last woman
that I kissed in that bar,

796
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,474
I ended up marrying.

797
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,243
Maybe just take the
next one home then.

798
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,590
Right? Shut up.

799
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,898
Hey, you're not ready either.

800
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,367
You know, I can't
even imagine it.

801
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,236
It's sex, sure.

802
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:46,665
You know, I've gone out and
had one-night stands before but...

803
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,936
I don't know. I can't...

804
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,879
Something real?

805
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,284
I pulled that icicle
out of her chest, Callie.

806
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:01,904
I bathed her when she
couldn't bathe herself.

807
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:05,040
I can't imagine belonging
to anyone like that again.

808
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,245
Have we used up all our happy?

809
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:14,801
You ever afraid of that,
that this is all there is now?

810
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,346
It's like I had a certain
amount of happy

811
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,514
that was supposed
to last my whole life,

812
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,038
and I've used it all up.

813
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:21,558
Do you think that's true?

814
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,894
God, I hope not. Hmm.

815
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,907
<i>The last true hermit was found</i>

816
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,299
<i>and dragged out of
hiding and into the world.</i>

817
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,569
<i>Most might find
his existence sad,</i>

818
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,465
<i>but the hermit knew
something we didn't.</i>

819
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,090
Mmm! Pause!

820
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:38,224
No!

821
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,895
Oh! Steph's rocking
neuro with girl Shepherd.

822
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,865
She got assigned
her crazy tumor! Yeah!

823
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,267
Who taught you "pause"?

824
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,547
Oh, um... Grey told me about
it when we were scrubbing out.

825
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,137
Great rule.

826
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,640
Now, unpause.

827
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,397
<i>He knew that when
it comes down to it,</i>

828
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,084
<i>even when you're with someone,</i>

829
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,723
<i>or in the noisy rush of people,</i>

830
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,064
<i>it's just you.</i>

831
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,072
<i>The one you can count on</i>

832
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,475
<i>and lean on</i>

833
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,745
<i>and depend on.</i>

834
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,681
<i>It has to be you.</i>

835
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,710
<i>Hi.</i> Hey.

836
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,635
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

837
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,736
No.

838
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,706
Just... What are you doing?

839
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:04,177
<i>Nothing. Nothing. You?</i>

840
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:06,796
I'm just lying in
bed with my tumor.

841
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,264
Aw...

842
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,661
<i>You brought it
home. Can I see it?</i>

843
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,785
Mmm-hmm.

844
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,865
<i>And once you figure that
out, that's when being alone...</i>

845
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,858
<i>Well, it's no 3-D husband,
but it's something.</i>

846
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,572
It'll do for now.

847
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,174
<i>Oh, my God. I have to...</i>

848
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:24,918
<i>becomes a choice.</i>

849
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,349
Um, it'll be a minute.

850
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,292
Okay.

851
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:55,328
What?

852
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:58,598
This is a big guns
conversation, isn't it?

853
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:04,086
Yes.

854
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,893
April, Jackson, we
have your test results.
